<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We have had, on a previous occasion, to make use of the ejaculation--How the
						Rump loves the boys in blue." There are some of these latter who still
						adhere to the fortunes of that party--men who have learned the "loyal"
						catechism by role, and with whom the words, "Copperhead," "traitor,"
						"rebel," &amp;c. pass for an answer to every argument, a response to
						every appeal. Parrot-like they repeat them over and over and then march to
						the polls and vote loyally and--blindly, for
						their bitterest foes. We have a few words to say to these men, to all
						soldiers, indeed, with white faces and white hearts--a trio of companions
						sketches them for their study--a little plain talk for them to listen to,
						and think over. </p>
					<p>The Rump, at Washington, voted those of you who had been in service of a
						certain time an extra bounty of $50 to $100 each.</p>
					<p>The same butt-end of New England Puritanism voted every negro soldier $300 extra bounty. </p>
					<p>The Praise-God Barebones Convention of fanatics and fools, designating itself
						a Federal Congress, also voted to each one of its members nearly $4,000
						extra pay.</p>
					<p>Well--a white soldier, who fought at Bull Run, and went with Grant, every
						step of his blood progress from the Wilderness to Richmond, leaving an arm
						at Petersburg, sacrificing health and physical constitution for love of
						country presents his papers, his vouchers to the proper official at
						Washington. Of course he receives his money!
						Congress has voted it--it is the generous
						acknowledgement of faithful service by a "loyal" legislative body loving the boys who "wore the blue!" </p>
					<p>The Paymaster General or whatever official attends to such matters, looks
						over the papers, peers in the man's face, sees blue eyes, a white skin, and
						fair hair, and says.</p>
					<p>"My good man, we can't do anything for you--the fact is Congress failed to
						appropriate the money necessary to meet the little claims of the soldiers
						but, of course, if you are a "loyal" man you won't mind that accident: won't be much disappointed!" </p>
					<p>"Well,--now--let me see! Come around in about two, three or five years, and
						we may have some money which can be used for you, white trash. The fact is,
						it takes so much money to pay the extra bounties
						of the colored troops--the extra pay and mileage of Congressmen, and the
						interest on Government bonds, that I do not see who we can get to your case,
						much short of that time!" </p>
					<p>D--n Congress! </p>
					<p>"Tut; tut, my man: you must not swear in a government office; be patient;
						wait awhile; you will get the money some time:
						good morning; go to work, and the little plum will drop after a while; let
						it ripen; wait my man; wait a little longer." </p>
					<p>As the soldier is turning away, up steps a fat, greasy, insolent negro, with
						a swagger and strut suited to his position in the reconstructed Union! He is a specimen "American citizen of
						African descent." He has huge heels which stand out from the remainder of
						his feet like the rudders of Mississippi rafts. His lips are huge masses of
						discolored meat. His eyes rolling orbs of whiteness. His teeth shown in
						continued mirth. The covering of his cranium, crispy wool. The aroma and
						fragrance proceeding from his carcass, is delightful to the nostrils of
						Thaddeus Stevens. He flings his paper on the desk before the paymaster; he
						squats himself in and easy chair; rams his hands into his pockets; chuckles,
						laughs, and finally says: </p>
					<p>"Well, boss, dares de papers, I speeks Ise titled to some bounties, and here
						I is? I'listed in Maryland in 1864, to go for a Massachusetts deacon's son
						who didn't want to go for a soger, cause carryin' a gun made him sick--ki!
						but it didn't make him sick to furnish such gunboats as dese (showing his
						shoes) to us coons! I guess not! Ki--gor--a--mighty, boss, I nebber got
						shot--when the battle was comin' on, gorra, how sick I used to get--de
						Cappen was a good Abolitioner, and he'd say--'Augustus, you may set down
						till you feel your courage comin' to you'--but, boss, I never could feel
						like fightin' while dem guns was bangin' away. I only staid in de war seven
						or eight months, de rest of the time I was doin' guard duty at Point
						Lookout, killin' de dam rebels that walked over de dead line! Ki, massa, dat
						was fun! And now I wants my extra bounty, and what good Mr. Sumner says we
						are so jussy titled to."</p>
					<p>Says the Paymaster General: "My good friend, Augutus Ceasar Johnson, here are
						$300--these are glorious times; this is an age of progress; political and
						social equality are just before you; your son may yet be President of the
						united States. You and those of your color will recieve the snug little sum
						of $20,000 in extra bounties--the white trash not a
						cent! The down trodden colored man receives a portion of his due, and
						the white trash, as I had occasion to remark a few moments ago, should be
						thankful and wait! But, Mr. Johnson, I perceive Hon. Mr. Snooks, of
						Massachusetts, coming. I must, therefore, wish you a very good morning, Mr.
						Johnson, brave defender of our country! </p>
					<p>Hon. Mr. Snooks, white livered, be-whipped, sanctimonious Apostle of the
						"Massachusetts school" advances.</p>
					<p>"Ah, Mr. Paymaster, these are sad days! The President, a traitor,
						Copperheadism defiant and aggressive, God' political elect sad at heart,
						while soldiers who have received all and more than they were entitled to,
						clamoring for bounties, chargin us with trickery and deception, it is hard,
						Mr. Paymaster, shocking, and the Lord only knows where it will all end! My
						claim, back and extra pay, and mileage, is just $3,846.32, hardly earned Mr.
						Paymaster, but republics are ungrateful, and we have many sacrifices to make
						who love our country! Thank you, yes it is quite a right!"</p>
					<p>Forget the script! </p>
					<p>So I did? Ah, there is a soldier who has lost an arm--give the thirty--two cents to him--we should not forget the white soldiers, although as my friend, General Geary,
						of Pennsylvania, says, there were so many of them "hospital sneaks" and
						"bummers!" Ah, Mr. Paymaster, if it had not been for the black soldiers we
						should never have crushed the infernal rebellion--never! NEVER! Good morning--good morning! </p>
					<p>How do you like it, white soldiers?</p>
					<p>A fancy sketch! </p>
					<p>Yes, but there is more truth than poetry about it. The incidents may not have
						happened just as we related them, but the facts show that not a single white
						soldier has or can receive a cent of the bounty voted him--that negro
						soldiers are now being paid--that Rump Congressmen, with a single honorable
						exception, have drawn from the Treasury every cent of the money they, by
						vote, flinched from the strong box of Uncle Samuel!</p>
					<p>You, white wearers of blue uniforms, are of no account now! The hosts of
						dauntless men who bravely and boldly faced you on so many battle fields, are
						all dispersed, peace reigns, it is no longer dangerous for the Rump to vapor
						and bluster in the Capitol--you are the sucked orange, whose pulp and juice
						are all exhausted, thrown carelessly by those who have strengthened and
						upheld into the nearest kennel or gutter!</p>
					<p>But Cuffy! Ah, the Rump programme includes negro suffrage--negroes, that end
						accomplished, will be props and support of Radical power. Can you not
						comprehend? That is why you do not get your paltry $50 or $100, and why the
						negro, whose term of service was shorter and less arduous, receives his
						$300!</p>
					<p>"Not one cent for white soldiers," is the maxim of the Rump--"$300 for each
						negro mercenary!"</p>
					<p>How do you like it, white faced wearers of the blue?--La
							Crosse Democrat. </p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Repository made a most malicious and wanton
						attack on Mr. Matthew P. Welsh, the newly appointed Post Master of this
						borough. The charges against Mr. Welsh are as false as the attack is
						malicious and mean. It says Mr. Welsh "proved to be the only Republican in
						Chambersburg who would join his political foes for a price." This is lie No. 1. In fact it is a double lie. First, the
						assertion that Mr. Welsh was the only Republican in Chambersburg who was
						willing to take the Post office is untrue, and
						second the charge that he surrendered his
						political convictions "for a price," is equally false. In regard to the first we can assure the Repository that the Post office did not go begging, as it would
						fain make its readers believe. A score of such Post offices could have been
						filled just as easily as one, by men who have heretofore been considered
						good, reliable and substantial Republicans. The Repository may not know this fact but we do. In regard to the second allegation we know whereof we speak
						when we say that the office was given to Mr. Welsh because of his known
						devotion to the restoration policy of President Johnson long before the Post
						office was at stake. He has always been conservative in his politics, and
						never approved of the course of the radical leaders, even during the
						progress of the war, though usually voting the Republican ticket. When the
						issue arose between the President and the radicals, entertaining the views
						he did, he as naturally took the side of the President as did an old-time
						constitutional Democrat. It was because of his well known honest of
						conviction on this issue that he received the appointment. </p>
					<p>The intimation that Mr. Welsh had recently applied
						for a position under the Republicans at Harrisburg is lie No. 2. It is true that more than a year ago Mr. Welsh
						applied for the position of messenger in the School Department, but that was
						long before any issue had arisen between the President and Congress. Why,
						the editor of the Repository himself was at that
						very time on the stump in this county eulogizing the President is policy and
						telling the people that the Republican party were the only true friends and
						supporters of the President. Mr. Welsh was then acting with the Republican
						party were the only true friends and supporters of the President. Mr. Welsh
						was then acting with the Republican party in good faith, supposing that Col.
						McClure and the leaders of the party generally were sincere when they put
						themselves forward as the special champions and defenders of the President.
						Mr. Welsh has applied for no position from the
						Republicans since their hostility to the
						President has been unveiled, and the attempt to create a false impression on
						the public mind by reference to this matter is contemptibly mean and beneath
						the dignity of respectable journalism. </p>
					<p>The character of Mr. Welsh needs no vindication at our hands--it will bear
						comparison with that of the editor of the Repository, or any other man in the community. There is a coolness
						in the editor of the Repository talking about
						"corruptionists" and men selling their votes "for a price" that amounts to
						audacity. There is an old adage that "those who live in glass houses should
						not throw stones," which the editor of the Repository would do well to remember before he again undertakes to
						charge corruption against his neighbors and villainously assail their
						private characters. Col. McClure talking about "the purity of the
						administration of the government!" Good heavens! This is a world of wonders.
						After this we may reasonably expect soon to hear of the devil reproving sin!

					<p>The Democratic and Conservative Citizens of Franklin County out in their
						might.</p>
					<p>THE LARGEST MEETING EVER HELD IN THE COUNTY.</p>
					<p>10,000 FREEMEN IN COUNCIL</p>
					<p>A Procession Five Miles Long.</p>
					<p>Wednesday, the 26th day of September 1866, will be a marked day in the
						history of Franklin county. The largest political party meeting ever
						assembled in the county was held on that day in the borough of Chambersburg.
						The demonstration was a magnificent success, exceeding the most sanguine
						expectations of its friends and striking terror to the hearts of its
						enemies.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, the Democracy and Conservative
						men of the county began pouring into town by hundreds and thousands at an
						early hour. The "star spangled banner" was floating to the breeze from all
						the principle points of the town, and the residence of many of our citizens,
						who sympathized with the good cause, were handsomely decorated with flags
						and wreaths of ever greens. A magnificent arch spanned south Main at the
						residence of Mr. George Ditmann, and our german citizens residing on Water
						street had their houses most magnificently and tastefully decorated, giving
						the most unmistakable evidence that the great heart of our noble and thrifty
						german population is true as steel to the Union and the Constitution of the
						land of their adoption. The Montgomery House, the Washington House and the
						"Union Restaurant" House were also handsomely decorated, as well as others
						which we have not the space to enumerate.</p>
					<p>The regular train from Hagerstown in the morning brought quite a large
						delegation from that place, and the Greencastle delegation arrived shortly
						afterwards in a special train provided for their especial accommodation
						consisting of ten cars packed full to overflowing. This delegation numbered
						over five hundred. The train from the east brought large delegations from
						Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle and other places along the rout. About ten
						o'clock the county delegations began to arrive in wagons and carriages. The
						first to arrive at the outskirts of town were the delegations from
						Mercersburg, Loudon and St. Thomas, in a body, under the leadership of the
						gallant Col. Frank Wingert. The appearance of Col. Wingert, who was an
						ardent Republican up to a recent period, at the head of these delegations
						was a severe blow to our republican friends. They hung their heads in grief,
						now doubt mentally asking themselves what was to happen to them. The
						Mercersburg, Loudon, St. Thomas and Hamilton delegations were met at the
						intersection of the Strasbourg road with the turnpike by the delegations
						from Letterkenny, Lurgan and the Valley. The combined delegations were then
						marched in procession into town, marching up Main street to the German
						Reformed church and then, crossing to Second, down Second until the head
						rested at the point at the eastern extremity of the borough, where it was
						halted to await the arrival of the delegations from the other parts of the
						county. This part of the procession alone was acknowledged by many to have
						been larger than the whole procession at the Republican Mass Meeting on the
						17th. The procession being now joined by immense delegations from
						Waynesboro', Quincy, Funkstown, Fayetteville, Greenvillage, Orrstown and
						Shippensburg, it took up its line of march from the Point up Main to Queen,
						down Queen to Water, up Water to the south end of town, then down to Main to
						Queen, up Queen to Second, and down Second to the Point, the place of
						beginning.--Chief Marshal, Col. McAllen, his first and second assistants,
						Col. Frank Wingert and Major J. S. Nimmon with their numerous aids did
						everything that lay in human energy and power to manage the immense
						procession with only partial success. It was an utter impossibility to
						handle a procession of such prodigious and unwieldy proportions. There was
						only one way to do it and that was to enlarge the town, and that the
						marshals hadn't the power to do. The procession was not a whit less than
						five miles [ITAL five miles] long on a straight line. To give a faint idea
						of its immense size we need only say that the head of the procession had
						made the entire circuit of the town as indicated above and returned to the
						point of starting before the rear was able to move at all.</p>
					<p>Our space will not permit us to refer to the numerous banners and
						transparencies in the procession with their pointed and significant
						inscriptions. One struck us as peculiarly pointed, carried by the "White
						Boys in Blue" of Chambersburg, to wit: "We can't go Fred. Douglass nor Fred.
						Stumbaugh." One of the banners of the Greenvillage delegation had these
						inscriptions; "Gen. John W. Geary, the hero of Snickersville" and "Col. F.
						S. Stumbaugh, the hero of Cockeysville." Perhaps the great feature of the
						procession was the wagon drawn by thirty horses from Guilford township under
						the management of our friend Jacob C. Snider. Each horse had a rider and the
						spectacle was truly a novelty and elicited much applause from spectators
						along the route. Green township also furnished a mammoth team, consisting of
						twenty horses. On the wagon they had erected a hickory tree with thirty-six
						streamers flying from its limbs, representing the thirty-six States, and a
						"dead duck" hanging by the neck in the top of the tree. This was emblematic
						of the fate of John. W. Geary on the 9th of October, and was hugely enjoyed
						by the crowds along the line of procession. But the most mirth provoking
						spectacle of all was the huge wooden cannon attached to the hind carriage of
						a wagon in Green township delegation labeled, "captured by Geary at Harper's
						Ferry." This was considered a capital hit on all sides.</p>
					<p>The speakers, consisting of Senator Doolittle, of Wisconsin, Judge Hepburn,
						of Carlisle, and Hamilton Airicks Esq., of Harrisburg, arrived in the 11
						o'clock train from the east, and were escorted in carriages to the residence
						of Hon. George W. Brewer, whose guests they were during their stay in town.</p>
					<p>There were about one thousand returned soldiers--"White Boys in Blue"--in the
						procession. These, after the procession had dispersed for dinner, were
						marched to the warehouse of Messrs. Wunderlich and Nead under the command of
						Col. Frank Wingert, and there partook of a magnificent free dinner which had
						been prepared for them by the citizens of Chambersburg. After they had been
						served--about one thousand in number--the outside crowd were invited in and
						fed as long as the bountiful supply of good things lasted. There were about
							twenty five hundred persons dined at the
						warehouse. This is the estimate of the ladies in attendance. There were
						three immense tables, running the entire length of the building. These
						accommodated about four hundred persons at a time, and by counting the
						number of times the tables were filled, the estimate was easy to be made,
						and made correctly. Add to those that ate in the warehouse the crowds that
						dined at the various hotels, and at private houses, and the reader can form
						some idea of the immense multitude of people which were assembled in town on
						that day. The number could not have been much less than ten thousand. It certainly outnumbered the Geary demonstration
						of the 17th as two to one. Candid Republicans admit this. </p>
					<p>Owing to the rain which came down in torrents in the afternoon, it was found
						impossible to go to the woods where stands had been erected for the
						occasion. But almost two o'clock a portion of the crowd repaired to the
						extensive car house in the rear of the Railroad depot, where the meeting was
						organized by the selection of the following named gentlemen as officers:</p>
					<p>President--Rev. Wesly Howe, of Green. </p>
					<p>Vice President--B. F. Nead, of Chambersburg, Gen.
						Ludwig, Albertus Miller, of Antrim, D. J. Skinner, of Dry Run, Samuel
						Breckenridge, of Fayetteville, John Snyder of Guilford, Wm. Bossert, of
						Hamilton, Jos. Gilmer, of Letterkenny, John Gilbert, of Lurgan, Jacob
						Snyder, of Loudon, Major John S. Nimmon, of Metal, Wm. Boyd of Montgomery,

						Johnston, of Concord and Daniel Stake, of Sulphur Spring. </p>
					<p>Secretaries--Capt C. R. Pialee, of Chambersburg,
						Col. B. F. Wingert, of Welsh Run, and Capt. T. B. French, of Waynesboro'. </p>
					<p>After the organization was effected the Hon James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin
						was introduced to the vast audience, and was greeted with loud and long
						continued cheering. After silence was secured the distinguished Senator
						proceeded to deliver one of the most eloquent, able and logical addresses we
						have ever had the pleasure of hearing.--For one hour and a half he held the
						immense multitude before him as it were spell bound, eager to catch the full
						meaning of every sentence that fill from the lips of the eloquent speaker.
						He stated his points so clearly and concisely that the most illiterate could
						comprehend them, and enforced them with a logical power and eloquence rarely
						equaled. His arguments were unanswerable, and we cannot help believing that
						they carried conviction to the minds of all honest Republicans who were
						present to hear. We may refer more at length to this able address in another
						column.</p>
					<p>Mr. Doolittle was followed by Mr. Alricks, of Harrisburg, who, in a stirring
						and spirited speech wound up the meeting in the afternoon. The meeting was
						continued in the evening in the Court House, and addressed by Judge Hepburn,
						of Carlisle followed by Mr. Brewer. The Judge is a fine speaker, and the
						able manner in which he discussed the issues of the day made a deep
						impression upon the audience. Mr. Brewer's speech was delivered in his
						happiest vein eliciting round upon round of applause from the delighted
						audiences.</p>
					<p>While the meeting in the Court House was going on the "White Boys in Blue"
						had a grand torch-light procession, marching through all our principal
						streets and making a most magnificent display.</p>
					<p>Thus ended the Proceedings of the day, every one feeling that a good day's
						work had been done in the cause of the country. Nothing occurred during the
						entire day to mar the pleasure of the occasion except the incessant rain,
						over which the managers of the meeting had no control. There was no rioting
						and little or no fighting that we heard of, and less drunkenness than might
						reasonably have been expected under the circumstances, the day being
						exceedingly wet and disagreeable. The country delegations generally left
						town before night set in, and about ten o'clock, those who remained, with
						our own citizens who had participated in the meeting, quietly dispersed to
						their homes and lodging places. There were no houses stoned or others
						riotous proceedings in imitation of the conduct of the radicals on the 17th.
						This shows the difference between the two parties. The one is order-loving
						and law-abiding--The other is lawless and revolutionary in all its
						instincts. This fact alone should have great weight with all good citizens,
						of whatever party when they go to cast their ballots on the 9th day of
						October.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>To the Republicans of Franklin County: </p>
					<p>How beautifully expressive of the American Union are the memorable words "I
						Pluribus Unum," engraved upon the Flag of our country overshadowing thirty
						six stars each star a state. Our Fathers in adopting that motto in
						connection with the stars and inscribing it upon the Banner of our country,
						Red White and Blue, arraigned in parallel stripes, [UNCLEAR fiannting?] it
						aloft to the world disclosed their invincible determination to maintain its
						unity by purity, virtue and blood, and threatened the infliction of those
						Stripes upon the Parricide that would erase one of those stars; and well did
						they keep their purpose during seven years of suffering and blood untill
						[UNCLEAR] acknowledged its Nationality.</p>
					<p>How much like the works of God. Look and behold your solar system. Her works
						are perfect. Her motion is harmony and maintains the law of Physical life.
						The coherent law that binds them one in gravitation. No Star can change
						position; no discordant motion, no independent action except in harmony with
						all. One star secedes she flies through trackless space causing "wreck of
						matter and crush of world."</p>
					<p>Our country is one center sun. Thirty six stars revolve around that sun. The
						Constitution is its binding force. Blot out one star destroy that force and
						you destroy the whole. Thus is our country consolidated, bound by written
						constitution to give it perpetuity, coherence and life.</p>
					<p>It is only necessary to refer to the constitution to ascertain the rights of
						the states. The instrument says "all powers not delegated by the states to
						the General Government are reserved to the states and it is my purpose to
						show that that the states in Rebellion, against the lawfull authority of the
						general government have not changed their status as states, and expose the
						tyrannical and revolutionary attitude of a congress of twenty six states
						seeking to change the organic law of our country, without the participation
						in congress of the Representatives of all the states.</p>
					<p>It is most evident our Fathers intended one perpetual Union with such powers
						delegated to the general Government as to established one Nationality for
						public welfare, suppress insurrection and Rebellion &amp;c and the
						President commander in chief of its military force, as such he has used the
						military power of the Government to put down rebellion in the Southern
						States against its lawful authority. Those states now having submitted and
						acknowledged the lawful authority of the government, and under obedience to
						their constitutional requirements are States in the Union as before the war,
						excepting such condition and loss as were imposed upon them during
						hostilities for the suppression of rebellion, by the commander-in-chief of
						our armies. After lawful authority was restored, President Johnson, as
						conservator of the public peace required those States to embody in their
						State Constitution the abolition of slavery forever, which they had lost by
						the emancipation proclamation as a necessary war measure, thus gaining their
						assent to it. And the Congress of the United States, in order to prevent the
						future revival of slavery, introduced an amendment to the Constitution of
						the United States, prohibiting slavery forever and submitted that amendment
						to those States for their ratification, thus recognizing them as lawful
						states in the Union. I shall submit a few reasons why they have not changed
						their status. 1st. Because secession is void, per se. They have no right to
						violate a contract declared to be perpetual. Neither have they the right of
						self-destruction, nor to destroy the peace, happiness and prosperity of the
						other States of the Union, and jeopardize the life of the nation itself.</p>
					<p>To illustrate, a man has no legal or moral right to commit suicide. Neither
						has he right to burn his property to endanger that of another, nor has he
						right to demolish a structure in which he has but one fourth interest, nor
						the right to repudiate a contract entered into by his predecessors.</p>
					<p>The theory of Thaddeus Stevens that they are conquered provinces subject to
						the will and legislation of the conquerors, are sophistry and deception,
						because they is not analogous to his illustration in his Bedford speech. The
						illustration he there used was Prussia and Austria. These are tow
						acknowledged independent sovereignties, in that case the defeated power is
						subject to the conditions of the conquerors. The Southern States are part of
						this union bound by an irrevocable and an indissoluble contract, and having
						tried rebellion and failed are as "Ante Bello." Nor will his theory apply
						because of belligerent rights accorded them by other governments, that fact
						only encouraged them in their rebellion for separation, only admitted their
						right of revolution and would mitigate their punishment if unsuccessful, but
						did not in any wise alter their relation to the parent government.</p>
					<p>Mr. Stevens' doctrine is a great heresy. He practically acknowledges that
						secession did affect a separation, and that belligerent rights begin
						acknowledged them by foreign powers made them public alien enemies, and
						therefore we can hold them as conquered provinces. Admit that doctrine and
						the American Union only exists by the will of foreign powers, and they may
						break up this government at any moment by admitting belligerents rights to
						any part or parts that ask it. Away with such doctrine.</p>
					<p>Whoever heard of belligerent rights accorded to a foreign independent
						sovereignty. Why they have the right in themselves. I imagine the fact of
						belligerent rights being accorded, presupposes those States part and parcel
						of the American Union until they achieve their separation and independence.
						The South has signally failed of separation and are as States in the Union,
						Ante Bello. I am particular in ascertaining the status of the States, for
						with it holds or falls Mr. Stevens whole theory of reconstruction,
						confiscation, &amp;c. If as I have shown the States to be in the Union.
						Then arraign Congress as usurping a power over them unwarranted by the
						Constitution and despotic and tyrannical in its acts and revolutionary in
						passing amendments to the Constitution affecting the rights of those States
						without their participation, and threatening to enforce it upon them unless
						they ratify it by their Legislatures, by the sword the torch and dispossess
						of their land and parcel it out to an emigrating army of radicals.</p>
					<p>Republicans, Conservative Democrats are you prepared for this? will you
						surrender the birth-right of American citizens--representation with taxation
						and the equal rights of the States, and impose an amendment whose provisions
						are odious and repugnant upon an unwilling people? Remember, do to others as
						you wish to be done by is a scripture injunction, and its warning is: take
						heed the measure you mete for it shall be measured to you again. In thus
						opposing the tyranny of Congress and defending the rights of the States and
						the Constitution we are only but asserting our own rights and defending
						ourselves. Who can tell that Congress now usurping legislative power, not
						warranted by the Constitution, centralizing power in itself, and striking
						down the rights of the States, and threatening the enforcement of its laws
						by fire, and blood and confiscation may not demand the same of Pennsylvania
						when it suits the caprice and political purpose of a party? Republicans,
						think you such a change in our republican democratic form of government can
						be made so abruptly without a tremendous shock. Well may Mr. Stevens tremble
						in his place while the coming artillery of an offended heaven--the artillery
						of his outraged country, and the bellowings of remorseless earth are begging
						to be heard in the distance. There are some that pant for war. Listen to the
						voice of New England that breathes fire and blood and smoke, she wants war,
						how contemptible to put chestnuts in the fire and get other people to pull
						them out.--Why she cannot live without the radicalism and agitation. Her
						history from the days of witchcraft and Blue Lights; from the days of the
						persecution of Roger Williams and penal laws against mothers kissing their
						infants on Sunday has been radicalism in politics as well as theology; out
						of the theatre of war and fattening by shoddy contracts and cotton
						speculations she urges her sister States on to the conflict while she
						remains at home, hires a few negroes to do her share of fighting and rolls
						up her eyes in holy horror at the carnage, but pockets the cash.
						Sanctimonious as the Pharisee they always see the mote in their brother's
						eye but cannot see the beam in their own eye. Republicans we have enough,
						endured enough, lost enough, let the angel of peace spread over the land
						blessings of a reconstructed Union and the cordiality of all the States,
						then shall we have peace, happiness, prosperity, wealth and strength at home
						and respect abroad. In our form of government we are responsible ourselves
						for the weal or woe of the States and shall receive the plaudits or
						execrations of mankind for the care we take of our liberty in a
						representative and democratic form of government. Under this form of
						government we have lived four score years. We have grown to manhood, we have
						increased to thirty millions of people with unexampled prosperity,
						intelligence, purity, power at home and respect abroad that has never been
						accorded to any nation.</p>
					<p>Republicans will you stop the career of your country's glory; shall your
						Constitution be torn to fragments. Shall a party of political agitators and
						tyrants settling like an incubus upon the heart of the nation bind you with
						cords of despotism while they cry equality, enfranchisement for the negro,
						whom they care nothing about and will certainly send the whole race to the
						grave or impel their vagrancy and vagabondism by their absurd policy got up
						for political purposes. The leaders of the Radical party seem to have lost
						natural affection for the human race for love of power and spoils; as "cruel
						as death, insatiable as the grave, like the horse leech that crieth for
						more."</p>
					<p>I implore my Republican brethren as they value civil and religious liberty,
						as they love their country and its institutions, as they revere their
						household gods and families, not to invite anarchy and civil war that will
						ridge the hills and valleys with the graves of our sons and brothers, and
						sweep over this whole land like a fiery comet, leaving in its rail the smoke
						of the burning embers of our dwellings, total destruction and horror that
						will set like the angel of death.</p>
					<p>Arouse then friends of liberty. The citadel of liberty is being invaded; the
						ruthless head of the Patricide is lifted to tear our glorious
						Constitution--the Palladium of our rights, to fragments. The fanatical
						leaders of Congress are preparing to place upon this people the collar of
						tyranny and the heel of the despot.</p>
					<p>Thou whose eye wept over the devoted city in beholding the impending calamity
						that befel it, guard well the star of American Liberty raised high in the
						political firmament to guide the homeless, impoverished, weary and oppressed
						of earth to this last asylum on earth for man. Like Thine own star that led
						the wise men of the east to Bethlehem to do Thee homage, so may this western
						star give light to guide the homeless wanderer of earth to this western
						shore--the land of the brave, the home of the free--sweet land of liberty.</p>
