<b>Impeachment of President Johnson and a New Civil War</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With tension between the President and Congress mounting, it appears likely
					that, should the Radicals carry the Congressional elections in the fall, an
					attempt will be made to impeach Johnson once they can agree upon the grounds for
					proceeding. The article predicts that such a development would surely lead to a
					resumption of armed strife.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York World</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The bitter violence with the Radicals all over the country are assailing
						President Johnson, as a "traitor," and classing him with Jefferson Davis, is
						intended to fire the popular heart, and prepare the way for a forcible
						ejection of the President from his office. If the Radicals carry the
						Congressional elections this fall, an impeachment will follow as soon as
						they can settle among themselves the grounds of proceeding. A New York
						delegate to the so-called Loyalists' Convention at Philadelphia, Mr. Thos.
						J. Sizer, of Buffalo, who shares the feelings and the secrets, but not the
						cunning, of his party, offered, on Tuesday, the following resolution:</p>
					<p>Resolved, That in view of the probable impeachment
						of a high officer of the United States government, it would be exceedingly
						improper, unconstitutional, and dangerous to have twenty members of the
						Senate designated, in effect, by the President of the United States. </p>
					<p>It is here declared that the Southern Senators must not be admitted, because
						their admission would obstruct the success of "the probable impeachment" of
						Mr. Honson. This resolution was not passed, only because the Republican
						leaders are too crafty to alarm the country by so forma an avowal of their
						intentions. But all their diatribes, and the whole spirit they manifest show
						that they are preparing for and expecting a new civil war. If they are
						beaten in the Congressional elections, their courage will be broken and they
						will not dare to proceed. to be sure, they would still have strength enough
						to impeach the President, as the present Congress does not go out until the
						4th of next March. But the impeachment by the House, and the trial by the
						Senate, would consume nearly the whole of the three months' session, and the
						sentence of deposition would hardly be declared before the body passing it
						would be defunct. The President would not submit. He would immediately call
						an extra session of the new Congress, which would treat the impeachment as
						null, and continue to recognize Mr. Johnson as President. An impeachment
						would, therefore be futile unless the Radicals elect the next Congress.</p>
					<p>One of the Radical schemes for getting rid of the President is to pass a law
						forbidding the participation of the South in federal elections, and depose
						the President of refusing to execute it. This scheme is disclosed by Mr.
						Tremaine, the President of the Republican State Convention, who said, in his
						speech at Syracuse on Wednesday:</p>
					<p>If the South reject the offers of the Union party, I assume that Congress of
						1868 will, like the Congress of 1864, pass a law declaring that the
						insurgent States shall not have their electoral votes, nor will such votes
						be counted, and in such case they will not be counted. I assume further that
						while this law remains in force it will be executed, and that, if the
						Southern States should attempt to voice in defiance of it, the President,
						who will be bound to execute the law, will arrest such an illegal and
						revolutionary proceeding. From the President's has to denounce the Louisiana
						Convention as an illegal assembly, although it was not held in violation of
						any law, I can not doubt that he will prevent any election or meeting of the
						Presidential electors which shall be prohibited by an act of Congress. If,
						contrary to my assumption, President Johnson shall refuse to perform this
						plain duty, I assume further that other constitutional means will be
						employed to execute the laws. Again I assume that any attempt by the South
						to trample such a law under foot would unite the North, and that the South,
						standing alone, would not obtain that majority which would be wanted as a
						pretext for taking possession of the government, and in either of these
						cases the scheme would fall; and as to a second rebellion, why, if these
						gentlemen are not satisfied with their experience in the first, let them try
						the second. Yes, let them try it. At the first tap of the drum, an army
						composed of veteran troops capable of overcoming all opposition, would come
						to the rescue, and, adopting the President's opinion, that traitors must be
						punished, soldiers would proceed to punish them. And I assume further that
						this time it would be effectually done--done without the intervention of
						President or Congress, court, jury or military commission. We tender these
						people the olive branch, but if they will not have it so, they can have the sword. </p>
					<p>True, here is no direct mention of impeaching the President; but as it cannot
						be supposed that he would allow the army to be used for such purposes as Mr.
						Tremaine describes, it is plain that the Radicals are planning to make his
						place vacant, and create a new Commander-in-Chief, before the expiration of
						his term.</p>
					<p>Senators Yates, of Illinois, in one of his speeches at Philadelphia, also
						made a threat of military violence:</p>
					<p>Governor Yates, commenced by declaring his amazement that the accidental
						successor of the great and good Lincoln should have
							turned traitor to the high principles on which he had been elected, and
							betrayed the loyal millions who had conferred upon him such a
						high and distinguished honor. He would apply to President Johnson the
						language of an amiable Illinois judge to a man who had been convicted before
						him of murder: "Mr. Smith, it is my duty to pronounce sentence upon you. It
						is a painful duty, but the law requires me fix some time when you shall be
						hanged. Now, Mr. Smith, I want to know when it will suit you to be hanged?"
						Illinois, he said, had raised two hundred and fifty thousand troops to
						battle in the cause of the country, and was now prepared to raise five
						hundred thousand more to finish the same good work. </p>
					<p>Governor Brownlow, in reply to the serenade given him in Philadelphia, on
						Friday night of last week, breathed out threatenings and slaughter in the
						following infuriated strains:</p>
					<p>But I say to you in all candor, and with the knowledge of what I am saying
						and the use that may be made of it, that if the wicked spirit of the South,
						the rebellions combined with the treachery and copperheadism of the North,
						shall bring upon this country another civil war, and force you gentlemen to
						leave your homes and families to invade the South and put down a second
						rebellion, I want to have something to say about the division of your forces
						the next time. I would divide your army into three grand divisions. Let the
						first go armed and equipped as the laws of the army require, and with small
						arms and artillery.--Let them be the largest division, and let them do the
						killing. Let the second division be armed with pine torches and spirits of
						turpentine, and le them do the burning. Let the third and last division be
						armed with surveyors' compasses and chains, and we will survey out the land
						and settle it.--We will first sell it out, to pay the expenses of the war
						with the proceeds, and then settle it with men who will honor this glorious
						banner (Great applause.) These are my sentiments.</p>
					<p>It would be easy to extend such quotations to almost any length, but our
						space allows us to add only the following from Forney's Philadelphia Press, of yesterday. He is speaking of President
						Johnson and thinks the Radicals are already rife for another civil war: </p>
					<p>And whatever he intends, a coup d' etat or a coup de grace, he will be accommodated to a fair
						trial, [UNCLEAR] of his experiment and himself. The
							American people were never in so rare a humor to deal with a new rebel
							or a new civil war. </p>
					<p>It is clear from these atrocious menaces that, under the reckless Radical
						incendiaries are sternly rebuked by the people, we are on the brink of
						another civil war, by which the country will be deluged with horrors such as
						it has never witnessed.--We implore all virtuous, peace-loving citiznes to
						consider the gravity of the existing situation.--New
							York World of the 7th inst. </p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial reproaches Col. McClure for his critique of an article that

					his stand on the question of voter eligibility.<br>(Names in announcement: Col.  McClure)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>COL. McCLURE has the effrontery now, or base partizan purposes to advise
						honest citizens to do what he believes, and has declared to be, illegal and
						unconstitutional.--He has sunk his manhood. He has given the lie to his
						profession and candor and honesty. He has condescended to practice deception
						upon the men of his party who look to him for honest counsel. It seems
						strange indeed that for the purpose of attaining political ends, men will
						sometimes "throw conscience to the dogs" and become as unscrupulous as the
						Devil himself.--Spirit</p>
					<p>The above is a specimen of the Spirit's legal
						argument in answer to our declaration that election officers cannot
						determine the constitutionality of a law. The chief editor of this paper has
						uniformly, in and out of the Legislature, demanded obedience to all laws
						until they are formally decided to be invalid by the proper tribunal. </p>
					<p>We have heretofore said that the act of the Legislature relating to the votes
						of deserters is dependent, judicially speaking, upon the act of Congress,
						but we have no right for that reason to assume to nullify it.</p>
					<p>The act of the Legislature has never been judicially questioned, and until it
						is so questioned, there is no election board or other body of men competent
						to set it aside. If one law can be set aside by an election board, any man
						can with equal propriety assume to disregard any law that does not please
						him.</p>
					<p>When the Spirit can show that we have ever been
						inconsistent, or ever advised anything else than obedience to all laws, it
						will use more reputable and logical arguments than the foregoing specimen of
							billingegate.--Repository </p>
					<p>The above is the Repository's reply to our
						article, two weeks ago, on the deserter question. We give it entire to show
						our readers what an artful dodger the chief editor of the Repository is.
						What do you think of it honest men of Franklin county? </p>
					<p>He says, "we have heretofore said that the act of the Legislature is dependant, judicially speaking, upon the act of
						Congress." Well now, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has decided,
						"judicially speaking," in the case of Huber vs Reilly, that the act of
						Congress "means that the forfeiture which it prescribes, like all other
						penalties for desertion, must be adjudged to the
							convicted person after a trial by court-martial and sentence
						approved. FOR THE CONVICTION AND SENTENCE OF SUCH A COURT THERE CAN
						BE NO SUBSTITUTE. </p>
					<p>Again the Court says: "The plaintiff not having been
							convicted of desertion and failure to return to the service, or
						fail to report to a Provost Marshal, and not having been sentenced for the
						penalties and forfeitures of the law, WAS ENTITLED TO VOTE." </p>
					<p>Now the act of the Legislature being "dependant" on the act of Congress, and
						the act of Congress being judicially interpreted as above, by the highest
						Court in the State, we ask the editor of the Repository in all seriousness,
						whether that decision is not now THE LAW? A plain
						yes or no will suffice. We pause for a reply. </p>

					<p>The trial of Josiah H. Brown, D. M. Betts and D. H. Yeager, Election Board of
						Snowshoe township, for illegally refusing the vote of John Dayton, at the
						October election in 1865, resulted in the conviction of Brown and Betts, and
						the acquittal of Yeager, the Court having instructed the jury that they
						could not convict the latter on the evidence.</p>
					<p>The facts of the case, as given in evidence on the trial, are about as
						follows: John Dayton, a man of foreign birth, presented himself at the
						window at the October election in 1865, offering his ballot in one hand and
						his naturalization paper and a receipt for taxes in the other. He was
						challenged by one of the board as a deserter, as he had been absent from the
						township during one of the drafts. They refused to allow him to vote until
						he would take an oath that he had not left the township to avoid the draft.
						Mr. Dayton refused to do this and his vote was rejected. Mr. Yeager
						protesting against the action of the Board and being overruled by his
						companions. Mr. Orvis assisted the District Attorney in the prosecution, and
						Mr. M'Allister conducted the defense. The jury were out but a short time,
						when they returned with a verdict of guilty as to Brown and Betts, and not
						guilty as to Yeager.</p>
					<p>The attention of the State officials at Harrisburg who are sending out lists
						of "alleged deserters" and instructing their political friends in the
						various election boards throughout the State not to permit these persons to
						vote, is called to this trial and conviction. It covers the whole ground and
						is sustained by the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of the State
						in a kindred case. Election officers have no right to sit in judgement upon
						deserters. If a man is challenged upon that ground, the challenging party
						must produce legal evidence that the person offering to vote has been tried
						and convicted of the offense before a proper tribunal. If such proof is not
						submitted and the vote is rejected, the officers are liable to arrest and
						punishment, as was the case with the parties in Centre Country. That is now
						settled as the law, and there should be no attempt to prevent legal voters
						from depositing their ballots.--If there is, those making it will suffer the
						consequences of their illegal and unlawful acts. The freemen of Pennsylvania
						have determined to vote at the coming election and they will be prepared to
						exercise that right at all hazards.</p>

					<p>The Southern "loyal" Negro Suffrage and Negro Equality Convention which had
						been advertised to meet in Philadelphia, assembled in that city on the 3d
						instant, in the National Hall. The whole number of delegates in attendance
						is reported at three hundred and nine-two. James Speed, late Att'y Gen. of
						the United States, of Kentucky, was chosen permanent Chairman, with a Vice
						President and Secretary from each of the Southern States. At the same time
						there met in Philadelphia, a number of delegates from all the Northern
						States, aiders and abettors of the negro worshippers from the South. They
						expected to be allowed to participate in the convention, but they were
						snubbed by being refused admittance.</p>
					<p>She session was terminated on Friday.--The proceedings were stormy and on
						more than one occasion the convention was on the point of breaking up in a
						row. Among the delegates in attendance from New York, was Fred Douglass, the
						negro, who was received and treated as an equal on all occasions. In the
						procession which went to the Hall of Independence, where the Southern
						delegates were formulary received, he walked with a white man, and he was
						cheered as he passed through the streets. The same night he was invited to
						visit the Union League, when he and Theodore Tilton of the Independent , walked up the steps and entered the
						building arm in arm. He was a distinguished guest at the League rooms during
						his stay in Philadelphia where he hob nobbed with Governor Curtin and lesser
						lights, and now and then enlightened them with a speech. After this, how can
						the radicals deny that they are not in favor of negro equality social and
						political. </p>
					<p>The great bone of contention in the Convention was the question of negro
						suffrage. The border-State men opposed it bitterly, saying that they had not
						come there to commit suicide; while the delegations from the
						non-reconstructed States advocated it strenuously. The Convention was
						largely in favor of it, but it was opposed on the ground that it would
						injure them at the polls this fall. The Telegraph
						of Thursday evening says on this subject: </p>
					<p>It was generally conceded, as we announced in our fifth edition yesterday,
						that the friends of unconditional suffrage would find themselves in the
						minority in the Convention. A large majority of the delegates were heartily
						in favor of the measure when they arrived in town. But since then the
						anti-suffrage men of the Northern and Border States had been so earnestly at
						work that they stood a good chance of carrying the day in the end. A
						majority of the Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri
						delegates are fully committed against placing the ballot in the hands of the
						negro at the present time, their only forcible argument begin that it would
						cause the defeat of the Anti-Administration party in the coming elections. A
						majority of the delegates from Alabama and Arkansas have also yielded to
						this election pressure, and with their accession to their forces it is
						almost certain the anti-suffrage men will triumph. The result would have
						been entirely different if Philadelphia had not been crowded during the
						sittings of the convention with politicians from every quarter of the North.</p>
					<p>On Wednesday evening, quite a serious difficulty took place at the League
						house where the delegates met. It almost ended in a melee, as pistols and
						knives were drawn and the intercession of friends only prevented them from
						being used. The session of Thursday was very stormy. A fierce debate sprung
						up on the adoption of the resolutions and address. The delegates from the
						non-reconstructed States insisting that they were not strong enough--that
						negro suffrage should be endorsed out and out, which the Border State men
						would not agree to. Policy dictated a compromise, even against the sense of
						the Convention, and the advocates of negro suffrage were to be permitted to
						report another address to embrace their favorite dogma. The men who were
						opposed to committing the Convention to this doctrine, were among the most
						outspoken in its favor.</p>
					<p>Senator Willey of West Virginia, said:</p>
					<p>"Negro suffrage is no bug bear to me. In my place in the Senate of the United
						States I [UNCLEAR] ground in favor of negro suffrage.--I am heart and hand
						in securing impartial suffrage in the Southern States."</p>
					<p>Parson Brownlow was still more outspoken in his sentiments. He said:</p>
					<p>"While I am satisfied with what has been done, I am the advocate of negro
						suffrage and of impartial suffrage (Great applause including "three cheers
						for Brownlow."] I would sooner be elected to any office under heaven by
						loyal negroes than by disloyal white men. [Applause.] I would sooner
						associate in private life with a loyal negro than a disloyal white man. I
						would sooner be buried in a negro graveyard than a rebel graveyard.
						[Applause.] If I have after death to go either to hell or to heaven, I shall
						prefer to go with loyal negroes to hell than with traitors to heaven."</p>
					<p>At the evening session there were only about sixty members present, less than
						a quorum, when the convention adjourned until the morrow.</p>
					<p>The address is one of the most bitter and ferocious documents we ever read.
						It is simply a bill of indictment against President Johnson, charging him
						with every conceivable crime, and there is scarcely a paragraph that is not
						devoted to his denunciation.--Neither God nor man will smile upon such a
						platform or the party that stands upon it.</p>
					<p>With the exception of those from the Border States the delegates represented
						nobody but themselves. The Convention had no significance whatever except to
						disgust the public with the display made of negro equality, social and
						political. We have a right to believe that the Almighty frowns upon their
						blasphemous proceedings, from the fact that He gave their chief place of
						meeting to the flames immediately upon the conclusion of their orgies. The
						speeches were of the most inflammable kind and appear to have been made with
						a view to prepare the public mind for the revolutionary course they have
						marked out.</p>
					<p>A noticeable feature in the proceedings was the many allusions to the
						impeachment of the President, which were always received with great
						applause. One member from New York offered a distinct resolution on the
						subject, which sets forth that inasmuch as the President is to be impeached,
						it is improper that twenty Senators shall be submitted from the South. These
						men mean to do this thing if they can carry the fall elections. Let them
						elect a majority in next Congress, and the President will be impeached and
						deposed just as soon as it can be done. This will lead to civil war.--We ask
						our radical fellow citizens to ponder well before they cast their votes for
						a party that will drench the country in a fraternal blood. After the polls
						are closed it will be too late to prevent it--now is the time to do
							it.--Doylestown Democrat. </p>

					<p>That the Radicals are looking forward to another civil war there is every
						reason to believe. The more indiscreet men among them give expression to
						this design. They are determined not to yield up the power they have so
						villainously abused without the most desperate struggle. Forney advocates
						arming the negroes of the South. In the Chronicle
						he says: </p>
					<p>"It cannot be expected that the State governments (South) will organize on
						any basis the loyal black militia. Congress must therefore take the matter
						in hand. The black militia can be organized into separate companies and regiments." </p>
					<p>This proposed arming of the negroes is part and parcel of a deep laid scheme
						to precipitate the country into into one another war which will be
						infinitely more terrible than that through which the country has passed. The
						only safety for this country is to be sought in the overthrow of the Radical
						fanatics who are thus endeavoring to precipitate a war of races. The arming
						of the negroes of the South would inevitably lead to a collision and to the
						enactment of scenes of horror from which every friend of humanity would turn
						away with loathing and terror. The people must exert their whole power in
						this coming election if they would save the country from renewed disaster.
						every radical elected to Congress will be fuel added to the fire of
						revolution now smoldering, and the election of General Geary would prove a
						national calamity which could not be repaired. We beseech all thoughtful men
						to pause on the brink of the precipice, and to lend their aid to save the
						nation from the peril which is impending. If the Radicals succeed in their
						designs they will give the negroes the right to vote, and will put arms in
						their hands to enable them to domineer over the white race. Are the people
						of Pennsylvania ready to aid in such a scheme? If they are, let them vote
						for Geary and for Radical candidates for Congress and the State
							Legislature.--Lancaster Intelligencer. </p>

					<p>To the Republicans of Franklin County: </p>
					<p>It is a sufficient apology to address you, however repugnant to me to appear
						in print that the distracted and fearful condition of our common country
						demands that her patriotic citizens should calmly and dispassionately reason
						together how to close the chasm that has been created by the tremendous and
						bloody civil war through which we have passed.</p>
					<p>It is now sixteen months since the war has closed and we find to-day the
						country more distracted, more sectional hate, more animosity, not only among
						the southern people but among the people at the north, than has been since
						the formation of the government. Why is this, while we are at peace with all
						the world that we cannot be at peace with ourselves? It should be the pride,
						as well as the duty of American citizens to promote the peace, wealth,
						prosperity and honor of our glorious country. God has chosen this country
						and government for his own purpose, to give homes, liberty and happiness to
						the oppressed and impoverished of all nations, and exalted her its
						Capernaum, should we by our dissentions and party strifes cast her from her
						lofty pinnacle, and dismember her into contemptible fragments and destroy
						the last hope of Democratic, Republican Liberty on earth.</p>
					<p>The questions that now divide and distract the country are few and vital--the
						status, [UNCLEAR] of the States lately in rebellion, and congressional
						representation. We know that secession is a heresy in the political body.
						That doctrine has been settled by the sword. We know the South formed a
						confederate government, and maintained it by force of arms, with valor,
						determination and pertinacity, thus causing the greatest contest in the
						history of the world, until their armies were subdued and themselves
						[UNCLEAR] in the dust by the force of the national government. We also know
						that they were accorded belligerent rights by foreign governments hostile in
						the peace, liberty and unity of the States. The fact of having belligerent
						rights accorded to them by foreign and no wise friendly governments did not
						make them alien public enemies, or dissever this Union no more than if they
						had warred themselves against us to divide or take part in our territory and
						failed to do it. Mr. Lincoln never acknowledged them as having belligerent
						rights nor as States out of the Union. We exchanged prisoners to be sure,
						but it was for the sake of humanity, to alleviate the sufferings of our
						prisoners in their hands.--The effort of the Southern States to dissolve
						their contract with their sister States without their consent did not
						relieve them of their obligations to the Federal Union and their inability
						to dissever that connection by force of arms and destroy the Constitution
						that was still binding on them as well as us, and the power of the federal
						government to prevent their going out and committing political suicide
						certainly does not change their status as States in the Union, no more than
						the prevention of a suicide destroys his contracts or his rights of
						property. Mr. Lincoln and both houses of Congress designated them as States
						in rebellion and by acts of Congress declared that the war was waged for the
						unity of the government and enforcement of its laws, and when that was
						accomplished the war ought to cease.</p>
					<p>The next question that presents itself is the rehabiliment of the States. The
						States upon the surrender of their armies and submission to the Constitution
						and laws surrendered their theory of secession, and were ready to resume
						their positions in the government. The President as commander-in-chief of
						the army, victor and conservator of the public peace required the
						abolishment of slavery (the ostensible cause of the war) in remodeling their
						State Constitutions now in accordance with a republican form of government.
						They have now resumed their positions as States in the Union and Congress so
						regarded them in submitting constitutional amendment to their respective
						Legislatures for ratification.</p>
					<p>Congress has no more to do with them but to judge the qualifications of its
						members, each house for itself. Why, if Thaddeus Stevens contends that they
						were alien, public enemies and the States out of the Union and are conquered
						provinces, why, I ask, does he desire to submit to their legislatures any
						amendment for their ratification? I would say he places himself in an
						unenviable position. First he acknowledges the Southern States as States in
						the Union, and then secession a success. That they are in the Union for
						ratification and out of the Union for tyrannical legislation. That secession
						annulled their contract with the federal government, did take them out of
						the Union, when all the world knows that we held them firmly in the Union by
						the folds of the great Anaconda. Such logic is a
						legal anomaly. I cannot understand Mr. Stevens' interpretation. I suppose
						because he is a great lawyer and I, a plain farmer. Mr. Stevens' doctrine is
						fatal heresy as here applied. If the secession of the States annulled their
						relationship with the federal government, then we have no right to complain,
						and that places Mr. Lincoln as one of the worst tyrants incarnate in waging
						such a stupendous war to controvert that doctrine. </p>
					<p>Now fellow Republicans, if secession is a heresy, if disunion has not been
						effected by force of arms, if the States in rebellion have returned to the
						federal government, and having acknowledged their allegiance to the
						Constitution, and remodeled their State Constitution in accordance thereto,
						what right in the name of common sense has Congress to refuse their
						admission to a participation in the government an equality with the other
						States in accordance with plain letter of the Constitution that guarantees
						the equality of the States? What right has Congress to hold the Southern
						States in abeyance until they ratify a constitutional amendment odious to
						their people? From whence to they get power to interfere in State matters?
						There is no provision in the Constitution providing such power. There are no
						precedents in the history of our country to warrant such usurpation. It is a
						departure from the theory of our government of States in unity. It is
						contrary to the plain letter of the Constitution that all powers not
						delegated to the government are reserved to the States. It is a departure
						from the teaching of the fathers of the Republic that the people should be
						jealous of their liberty and watch the disposition to centralization and
						despotism. Republicans, you must recollect that John W. Forney, the organ of
						the radicals foreshadowed this policy in the commencement of the war. He
						advocated a strong government, and said the American people would not again
						find themselves feeble and impotent as they did, that the Constitution must
						be changed to suit the times.</p>
					<p>We now see [UNCLEAR] a radicalization of the programme of the radicals in the
						animosity, malignity, and sectional hate engendered among the people to
						alienate, distract, divide and destroy, to further the schemes of their
						unholy lusts of spoils and of power.</p>
					<p>Me thinks I see the noble ship of state in the open sea, just emerging from
						the tempest of fire and hail--with her banner all shattered, bearing aloft
						the emblems of her country's glory and liberty--the glorious flag of red,
						white and blue, with thirty-six stars gleaming in the light of Heaven as the
						beacon light to tell us of her safety. As she approaches nearer in her
						majesty, throwing aside the angry billows that dash harmless against her
						iron clad sides, I see her decks yet streaming with the blood of heroic
						defenders. I see the Illustrious Admiral Farragut at the steerage, the brave
						Lieutenant General Grant at the helm and Andrew Johnson the captain of the
						ship, "God bless him," with the chart of our country in his right hand, and
						a figure beautiful in imagination--the Goddess of Liberty--at his left,
						coronetted with a golden crown, decked with thirty-six diamonds dazzling to
						the eye as the sun poured down its transparent light; a wreath of emerald
						beauty encircling her temple, and upon that was inscribed in letters of
						light, the UNION AND THE CONSTITUTION, ONE AND INSEPARABLE, NOW AND FOREVER.
						Her breast was covered with a brazen shield with the inscription writen
						thereon with a diamond pen, refulgent with a halo of glory such alone as God
						can give VIRTUE, LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE. I stood upon the shore, I saw her
						beauty, I admired her noble bearing--I gloried in her strength: I could hear
						the hilarity of her tars as she was drawing near her mooring. When lo! ah!
						what do I hear?--the Captain cries ahoy boys! ahoy the maelstrom! the
						maelstrom!! Quickly the steersman flew to the compass, the pilot to the
						helm, the tars to the rigging, the crew to their posts. Do I hear excited
						language of mutiny, or discordant counsels. No, No, but the air rings with
						shouts of her undaunted crews; the excited ear catches the accents as borne
						along the balmy current, survive or perish, sink or swim, we will never
						forsake thee.</p>
