<b>A Talk With The Ladies</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Written by a woman, the article implores members of the "fairer sex" to
                    help the nation during this time of crisis by "planting in the hearts of their
                    sons the true principles and virtues which will render them discerning patriots
                    at the polls, and moral upright citizens, at all times."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For many months I do not remember to have taken in my hands a paper which did
                        not contain one or more recitals of woe and degradation, revolting to all
                        that is good and pure in heart, or of crimes so horrid that the reading
                        about them would almost congeal the blood as it was flowing through the
                        veins. The question naturally arises, what can be the cause of all this
                        wickedness? Am I in any way responsible or accountable for it? Is there any
                        way in which I can mitigate the evil abroad in our land? An answer has come
                        to me repeatedly, saying, Yes, you and your whole sex are responsible as
                        those who carry an influence, not only through the circle of your
                        acquaintance, but far, far beyond.</p>
                    <p>That influence may be "but as a drop in the mighty ocean," or it may be as
                        the glorious luminary of day which lights the earth. According to that
                        influence you will be held (in some degree) accountable for its effects. It
                        has been said that "man ruled the world, but that woman ruled man."--Now, if
                        this, be true, and all women are willing to think so, how fearful is our
                        responsibility.</p>
                    <p>I do not ask for my sex a voice in the halls of state or a ballot at the
                        polls; but I do ask that many of the precious moments now multiplying
                        themselves into hours, which are spent perverting or destroying the
                        beautiful adornments which God has given us, should be spent by mothers
                        planting in the hearts of their sons the true principles and virtues which
                        will render then discerning patriots at the polls, and moral upright
                        citizens, at all times. Leave to the African the frizzled hair as their
                        Maker intended, and brush you own long silken tresses in the modest style
                        adorning the true woman; then discharge to the best of your ability, the
                        duty of training the immortal spirits entrusted to your care. Remember
                        Cornelia of old; was it because she was the leader of fashion that the
                        grateful Romans erected to her memory a monument more enviable than the
                        beautiful Helen ever achieved?--Ah! no, but because she had trained for them
                        two jewels who were ornaments to their country.</p>
                    <p>I call upon the ladies of our broad land to think of the great and useless
                        extravagance in which they indulge, and also to reflect upon the moral
                        effects of that extravagance. I do not now refer especially to the
                        exorbitant price paid for the fanciful arrangement of lace and flowers which
                        is placed upon the crown of the head, nor to the expensive silk which is
                        gracefully sweeping the streets; no, not to these alone do I refer, though
                        they are a few of the "littles" that go to form the ponderous whole which is
                        crushing the virtue and morality of our people.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps there is one out of every twenty of the elegantly dressed ladies on
                        our streets, who is peculiarly able thus to add to the coffers of our
                        merchants of every class; then there are eight-twentieths who, regardless of
                        the hard-earned wages of a father or a husband, are trying to imitate the
                        heiress of thousands; there may be four-twentieths who are thus wasting
                        their own honorably earned money, but what then are the base means to which
                        the other seven-twentieths of our sex resort, in order that they may equal,
                        if not excel, the heiress in richness of apparel and in indolence? It may be
                        that the lady of wealth who reads this will say, "It is not my fault if made
                        sad by their loved ones in allowing them to imitate me; it is their
                        weakness, not mine, neither is it my sin that many sell themselves, body and
                        soul, in order to excel me if possible." It is your fault; because you
                        delight in being the envied of hundreds, not for your love and charity to
                        suffering humanity, but for the gorgeousness of your habiliaments, and
                        because it was your hearty demeanor which has driven many a poor but
                        virtuous woman down to the depths of degradation: it is in part your sin,
                        and one for which you will have to answer.</p>
                    <p>Pause to think of this; ask yourself if it would have detracted any from your
                        position and importance as a lady to have spoken kindly to that poor orphan
                        sewing girl, or that tradesman's sensible daughter, who chanced to wear a
                        robe of coarser material than yours?</p>
                    <p>Perhaps some one will ask, is it not our duty to make ourselves (by
                        adornment) as pleasing as possible to those around us, especially our
                        husbands, or may be lovers? It is; but with all this lavish expenditure are
                        we any more pleasing than Rachel was, for whom Jacob served and waited seven
                        years, or Lucretia, to whom was awarded the honor of being the most noble
                        lady, while busy with her loom! Why many would consider themselves
                        discharged by a knowledge of its use! Let us adorn ourselves with that
                        modesty of bearing , gentleness of temper, and Christian forbearance, which
                        is more charming, as it speaks with love and kind reproof to an erring
                        sister or brother, than all the gems of Golconda; it is more lasting, for it
                        defies the touch of time, and will live in the influence we have exerted,
                        long after we are sleeping in our lowly beds of earth. The reform in the
                        extravagance of both sexes is important; it is necessary to our life as a
                        virtuous people, and it cannot efficiently begin with one alone, for she
                        would only be marked as odd and eccentric. It must be made by a number of
                        ladies of wealth and position, who can then give the noble reason which
                        actuates them, and by the silent workings of their power, in a few short
                        years they will achieve more than the eloquence of Clay or Webster ever
                        gained. Think then how rapidly homes could be made to rise for our maimed
                        defenders, our orphans and widows, schools for the ignorant, and hospitals
                        for the suffering.</p>
                    <p>This "amendment" will rapidly abolish the mercenary trade in matrimony,
                        because then there will be no necessity for the ladies and gentlemen each to
                        consult the assessor's list for the value of the one they love.</p>
                    <p>Divorcements will be unheard of, and elopements become unpopular. As
                        furtherance of our plan of reform and partial reward, we ask for the modest
                        girl who is neatly but simply attired, an equal share of the attention given
                        the flaunting heiress by the "lords of creation."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is worth the while, says the Journal of
                        Commerce, of every lover of American institutions to inquire whether
                        the progress of modern radicalism will lead us and where it will find its
                        end. The present dogma of the radical party is this, that the government can
                        be made stronger and better by making a new Constitution, and compelling a
                        minority of the State which do not submit to it. No choice is to be
                        permitted. The new style of law is to be made absolutely binding by force if
                        not by free-will acceptance. The theory of the right of secession, in the
                        shape in which the Southern States professed to stand on it, has been
                        thoroughly extinguished by the war, and is abandoned throughout the country.
                        It is proclaimed, and with undeniable truth, that if the war done anything
                        it has established the conclusion that no right exists in any one State, or
                        any number of States, to withdraw at will from the American Union. But how
                        does the new doctrine no put in practice by the radicals agree with this
                        conclusion? If one State has no right to secede, ten States have no right,
                        nor have twenty States a right to secede from the minority. Yet we are at
                        the present time urged to adopt a policy based on this very theory of the
                        right of a majority of the States to secede from a minority. For the whole
                        plan of the radicals for reconstruction depends on this claim. Keeping
                        States out of the Union temporarily is precisely the same thing as
                        secession. Observe the direction in which this leads. Let us imagine the
                        Union reconstructed on the radical plan. Political questions are then sure
                        to arise from time to time which will be of great importance. None is more
                        plainly visible in the future than the question of the representation of
                        States in Congress. This is a totally different question from that of the
                        representation of populations, which is now discussed. The Union was
                        constructed on the theory of representing States as States, and populations
                        also. The new reconstruction theory goes on the assumed right of a powerful
                        majority of the States to reform the whole system of State representation.
                        It makes no distinction. It refuses to admit either State or people to
                        representation except at the will and on the prescribed terms of the
                        majority. Adopting it will have established a precedent.--The old
                        foundations of the Union will be changed, undermined. The independence of
                        States entering the Union will no longer exist. The constitutional provision
                        that "no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of equal suffrage in
                        the Senate," implies a right to regulate that suffrage, and to disregard the
                        doctrine of equality of States. It is but a clause in the Constitution, and
                        the new theory is, that amendments of any sort may be made by a sufficient
                        majority of States. It is only an amendment, therefore, which is needed to
                        strike this clause out of the Constitution. Such an amendment would not be
                        any greater assumption of power by the majority than the present proposition
                        to exclude States entirely from the Senate unless they adopt certain
                        specified laws. The facilis decensus averut opens
                        before us--When the new political questions arise to agitate the minds of
                        men, when South and West grow strong and insist, as producing countries, on
                        the adoption of principles which are not liked by the East, as manufacturing
                        and consuming countries, then this new doctrine of secession will rise up to
                        curse us. "Why," they will argue, "why should we be blockaded in the Senate
                        by this absurd relic of old times, the equal representation of States? Why
                        should the vast populations of the Mississippi Valley and the Western plains
                        be governed by the votes of small and old States along the seaboard?" If
                        they be then told that the Union was formed on this theory, they will reply
                        that it was reformed on a totally different theory, and that they may
                        rightly prescribe terms of union to the smallest States, and turn them out,
                        if they do not accept them. But let no one imagine that "turning them out:
                        implies a division of the Union and a departure of any State from all
                        connection with the government.--The radical plan, not to be made a
                        precedent if adopted. is to say to States, "You may have representation on
                        our terms, if you wish it, but if you do not wish it, then you shall be
                        governed and taxed without any representation." The new doctrine of
                        secession has added to it the claim of a right to conquer and subject the
                        smaller and weaker States, and to make them territories. The old theory of
                        union will be forever destroyed; the new theory will take its place; and the
                        end will be the end of American liberty. All the safeguards of the
                        Constitution will vanish before this principle of amending whatever the
                        majority of the time dislike. The principle of a union of States with
                        certain reserved and inalienable rights as States being laid aside, New
                        England will be compelled to accept social and commercial law as the people
                        of the South and West may choose to prescribe it. States will in time
                        disappear, having no foundations to stand on, and no legal or equitable
                        protection against the will of people of other States. When annihilated by
                        the form of constitutional amendment, they will be unable to plead any
                        unchangeable rights reserved by the old terms of union in the old paper
                        called a Constitution.--These are no wild views. They are possibilities,
                        probabilities, certainties in our national future, unless we stay the
                        progress of radicalism and turn the tide into the old conservative
                    channels.</p>

                        arming of the militia of the Northern States, and forbidding the same action
                        in the South, the revolutionary proceedings of the Louisiana Convention, and
                        the utterances of the leaders of the "Torch-and-Turpentine" convocation, all
                        prove that war, anarchy, and confusion are the real purposes of the disunion
                        faction which is now sustaining Congress and opposing the restoration of the
                        States.</p>
                    <p>As one preparation for the civil war, the Radicals are organizing the negroes
                        and inciting them to insurrection by secret inflammatory appeals. In many of
                        the States secret organizations are kept up, which meet at stated periods,
                        and are drilled by competent officers. These meetings are held in our State,
                        and in some counties in connection with the Radical party, as well as their
                        revolutionary purposes, are no secret. In New York African "Loyal Leagues"
                        have been instituted, the negroes armed and put under military discipline.
                        Four regiments are thus prepared in order, as one of their officers
                        declared, to give the people of the North a taste of St. Domingo"! In
                        Indianapolis two companies of negroes have been armed with the cognizance of
                        the State authorities. Some two or three hundred negroes have had night
                        drills for several weeks. It was reported some moths ago that negroes were
                        organizing and drilling in Richmond, and this discovery created considerable
                        excitement in that city, and Gen. Terry issued an order which put a stop to
                        this movement. The arming of negroes also in Missouri and Louisina means
                        something which white men who have property to preserve, and wives and
                        children to protect, should be deeply concerned about.--The placing of
                        weapons in the hands of colored men in the South has been agitated in the
                        Loyal League, and a late number of the Washington Chronicle, edited and owned by Colonel Forney, a candidate for
                        United States Senator in Pennsylvania, thus speaks of that measure: "it
                        cannot be expected that the State governments (South) will organize on any
                        basis the loyal black militia. Congress must therefore take the matter in
                        hand. The black militia can be organized into separate
                            companies and regiments." This is the programme. The negroes are
                        to be secretly organized, armed, and prepared by the Radicals, and then
                        Congress is to let them loose upon the whites and to "give them a taste of
                        St. Domingo." </p>
                    <p>Do the white people understand the full meaning of that Radical threat, at
                        "taste of St. Domingo?" The following statement from a valued correspondent
                        gives a graphic picture of the negro insurrection in that island, to which
                        allusion is made by the Radical "Torch-and-Turpentine" conspirators in this
                        country:</p>
                    <p>I was not in the unfortunate Island of San Domingo when the first massacred
                        of the whites by the negroes took place, consequently I cannot describe the
                        scenes of the desolation of those dark days of horror with the various
                        tortures which the whites were made to suffer. But, I distinctly remember
                        having had in my possession a pamphlet with prints exhibiting those
                        tortures, two of which I never could forget.--On one was to be seen a white
                        man naked, stretched on the ground, surrounded by a number of infuriated
                        women in the act of putting him to death slowly by pricking him with pins.
                        The other represented a white man also naked, bound between two beards and
                        two negroes cutting him in two with a saw! All of this was under the rule of
                        Toussant L'Onventure.</p>
                    <p>In 1798, or thereabouts, the English made war with France, and landed on the
                        islands. They were received as friends. They made regular soldiers of the
                        negroes, disciplined them, built block houses for them, and then went their
                        way when they thought the negroes were able to resist attempts which the
                        French might make to retake possession of the country. So it was in 1802,
                        during a short peace between England and France. A French army, without
                        opposition, took possession of the principal cities and towns along the
                        coast; the blacks retired into the mountains of the interior, waiting
                        prudently, for the yellow fever to fight their battles, that dreadful
                        scourger sparing the natives but so fatal to new comers, had made its
                        appearance for the first time.</p>
                    <p>On the resumption of hostilities in 1808, between England and France, what
                        remained of the French army were compelled, for want of provisions, being
                        hemmed in on land by the negroes, and blockaded at sea by the English, to
                        evacuate the island. This took place at Port au Prine the capital of the
                        island, and a truce was agreed upon with the negroes. As soon as this
                        determination of the French army was made known to French residents, they at
                        once made preparations to follow the fleet with their valuables. As soon as
                        the negroes heard of this, seeing that they were going to lose a large
                        booty, they sent in a flag of truce with a proclamation promising full
                        protection to those who would remain. This induced a great many, perhaps
                        three-fourths, of the French residents to do so.</p>
                    <p>The French fleet left the harbor on the 28th day of October, 1865, steering
                        for the Island of Cuba. The negroes immediately entered the city. The very
                        next day they broke their pledge, and all the young men able to bear arms
                        were seized, under the plea of making soldiers of them, marched out of the
                        city, sent to parts unknown and cruelly butchered. From that day, October
                        29, 1803, to the 16th of March, 1804, every night the residences of the
                        whites, supposed to be wealthy, were broken open and pillaged. These were to
                        be the booty of the black officers, and the male inmates were carried out to
                        the sea, dispatched and thrown overboard. On the 16th of March a general
                        massacre of the remaining male whites took place, and their property was the
                        share allotted to the soldiers. Thus far the lives of the women and children
                        had been spared, but on the 5th of May, in the same year, they were all
                        pitilessly murdered; but before the women were assassinated what took place?
                        I know not. I leave my readers to surmise. They were in the hands of demons
                        in human shape! After that horrible day, no more victims remaining, the
                        black history of the island records no more massacres.</p>
                    <p>This is the "taste of St. Domingo" which the Radicals are inciting the
                        negroes to give the white men, women, and children, whenever their plot can
                        be made effective. The Loyal League are preparing the negroes for deeds of
                        blood, rapine, and lust, and Congress is to organizee them into companies,
                        furnish them with arms, and let them loose upon their victims. This is one
                        of the duties imposed upon the coming Congress, should the majority be in
                        the hands of the "Torch-and-Turpentine" faction. Butler, and Brownlow, and
                        Stevens, and Summer, and Wade, are fit men to counsel blood and urge on the
                        negroes of the United States to emulate their brethren of St. Domingo in
                        acts too horrible to bear a fitting name.--Age</p>
