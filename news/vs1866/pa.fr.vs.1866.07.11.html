<b>Disfranchisement of Deserters</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides a transcript of the opinion handed down in the Huber vs. Reilly
					case, which struck down the law barring deserters from voting.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The following opinions of the Supreme Court in the case of Huber vs. Reily,
						was read by Justice Strong:</p>
					<p>The act of Congress under which the defendant below justifies his refusal to
						receive the vote of the plaintiff is the one approved on the 3d day of
						March, 1865. The twenty-first section is the only one applicable to this
						case, and it is as follows: "And be it further enacted, that the addition to
						the other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion from the military or
						naval service, all persons who have deserted the military or naval service
						of the United States, who shall not return to said service, or report
						themselves to a Provost Marshal within sixty days after the proclamation
						hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily
						relinquished and forfeited their rights of citizenship, and their rights to
						become citizens; and such deserters shall be forever incapable of holding
						any office or trust or profit under the United States or of exercising any
						rights of citizens thereof; and all persons who shall hereafter desert the
						military or naval service and all persons who being duly enrolled, shall
						depart the jurisdiction of the district in which he is enrolled, or go
						beyond the limits of the United States, with intent to avoid any draft into
						the military or naval service, duly ordered shall be liable to the penalties
						of this section." This is followed by a clause authorizing and requiring the
						President to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of the
						section, and we know judicially that this was done on the 11th of March,
						1865.</p>
					<p>The act of Congress is highly penal. It imposes forfeiture of citizenship and
						deprivation of the rights of citizenship, as penalties for the commission of
						a crime. Its avowed purpose is to add to the penalties which the law had
						previously affixed to the offence of desertion from the military or naval
						service of the United States, and it denominates the additional sanctions
						provided as penalties. Such being its character, it is, under the well known
						rule of law, to receive a strict construction in favor of the citizen.</p>
					<p>The constitutionality of the act has been assailed on three grounds. The
						first of these is that it is an ex post facto
						law, imposing additional punishment for an offence committed before its
						passage, and altering the rules of evidence so as to require different and
						less proof of guilt than was required at the time of the perpetration of the
						crime. The second objection is, that the act is an attempt by Congress to
						regulate the right of suffrage in the States, or to impair it, and the third
						objection is that the act proposes to inflict pains and penalties upon
						offenders before and without a trial and conviction by due process of law,
						and that it is therefore prohibited by the bill of rights. </p>
					<p>In the view which we take of this case, and giving to the enactment the
						construction we think properly belongs to it, it is unnecessary to consider
						at length, either of these objections to its constitutionality. It may be
						insisted, with strong reason, that the penalty of forfeiture of citizenship
						imposed upon those who had deserted the military or naval service prior to
						the passage of the act is not a penalty, for the original desertion, but for
						persistence in the crime, for failure (in the language of the statue) to
						return to said service, or to report to a Provost Marshal within sixty days
						after the President's proclamation. If this is so, the act of Congress is in
						no sense ex post facto, and it is not for that
						reason in conflict with the constitution. Its operation is entirely
						prospective. If a drafted man owes service to the Federal government, every
						new refusal to render the service may be regarded as a violation of public
						duty, a public offence for which Congress may impose a penalty. And as it is
						the duty of every court to construe a statute, if possible, so "ut res magis releat, quam petreat," that
						construction of this act must be adopted which is in harmony with the
						acknowledged powers of Congress, and which applies the forfeiture of
						citizenship to the new offence described as failure to return to service, or
						to report to the Provost Marshal. </p>
					<p>The second objection also assumes more than can be conceded. It is not to be
						doubted that the right to regulate suffrage in a State, and to determine who
						shall, or who shall not be a voter belongs exclusively to the State itself.
						The constitution of the United States confers no authority upon Congress to
						prescribe the qualification of electors within the several States that
						compose the Federal Union. Congress is indeed empowered to make regulations
						for the time, place and manner of holding elections for Senators and
						representatives, or to alter those made by the legislature of a State,
						except those in relation to the places of choosing Senators, but here its
						power stops. The right of suffrage at a State election is a State right, a
						franchise conferable only by the State, which Congress can neither give nor
						take away. If, therefore, the act now under consideration is in truth an
						attempt to regulate the right of suffrage in the States, or to prescribe the
						conditions upon which that right may be exercised, it must be held
						unwarranted by the constitution. In the exercise of its admitted powers,
						Congress may doubtless deprive an individual of the opportunity to enjoy a
						right that belongs to him as a citizen of a state, even the right of
						suffrage. But this is a different thing from taking away or impairing the
						right itself. Under the laws of the Federal government, a voter may be sent
						abroad in the military service of the country, and thus deprived of the
						privilege of exercising his right, or a voter may be imprisoned for a crime
						against the United States, but it is a perversion of language to call this
						impairing his right of suffrage. Congress may provide laws for the
						naturalization of aliens, or it may refuse to provide such laws. Its action
						or non-action may thus determine whether individuals shall or shall not
						become citizens of the United States and I cannot doubt as a penalty for
						crime against the general government, Congress may impose upon the criminal
						forfeiture of his citizenship of the United States. Disfranchisement of a
						citizen as a punishment for crime, is no unusual punishment. Barker vs. the
						People, 20 Johns, 458. If by the organic law of a State, citizens of the
						United States only are allowed to vote, the action or non-action of Congress
						may thus indirectly affect the number of those entitled to the right of
						suffrage. Yet after all, the right is one which its possessor holds as a
						citizen of a State, secured to him by the State constitution alone. It is an
						integral part of the State government.</p>
					<p>But it is not a correct view of the act of Congress now before us to regard
						it as an attempt to override State constitutions or to prescribe the
						qualifications of voters. The act makes no change in the organic law of the
						State. It leaves that as before, to confer the right of suffrage as it
						pleases. The enactment operates upon an individual offender, punishes him
						for violation of the federal law, by deprivation of his citizenship of the
						United States, but it leaves each State to determine for itself whether such
						an individual may be a voter. It does no more than increase the penalties of
						the law upon the commission of crime. Each State defines for itself what
						shall be the consequences of the infliction of such penalties. And with us
						it is still our own constitution which restricts the right of suffrage, and
						confers it upon those only who are inhabitants of the State, and citizens of
						the United States.</p>
					<p>The third objection against the validity of the act of Congress would be a
						very grave one, if the act does in reality impose pains and penalties before
						and without a conviction by due process of law. The fifth article of the
						amendments to the constitution ordains "that no person shall be held to
						answer for a capital or other infamous crime, unless on a presentment, or
						indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval
						forces, or in the militia, when in actual service, in time of war or public
						danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence be twice put in
						jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to
						be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property
						without due process of law." The sixth article secures to the accused in all
						criminal prosecutions certain rights, among which are a speedy and public
						trial, by a jury of the vicinage, information of the nature and cause of the
						accusation, face to face presence with the witness against him, compulsory
						process for his own witnesses, and the assistance of counsel. The spirit of
						these constitutional provisions is briefly that no person can be made to
						suffer for a criminal offence unless the penalty be inflicted by due process
						of law.--What that is has been often defined, but never better than it was
						both historically and critically by Judge Curtis of the Supreme Court of the
						United States, in Den [UNCLEAR] vs. Murray et al, 18 Howard 272. It
						ordinarily implies and includes a complainant, defendant and a judge,
						regular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial according to some
						settled course of judicial proceeding. It must be admitted there are a few
						exceptional cases. Prominent among these are summary proceedings to recover
						debts due to the government, especially taxes and sums due by defaulting
						public officers. But I can call to mind no instance in which it has been
						held that the ascertainment of guilt of a public offence, and the imposition
						of legal penalties, can be in any other mode than by trial according to the
						law of the land or due process of law, and that is the law of the particular
						case, administered by a judicial tribunal authorized to adjudicate upon it.
						And I cannot persuade myself that a judge of elections or a board of
						election officers, constituted under State laws, is such a tribunal. I
						cannot think they have power to try criminal offenders still less to
						adjucate the guilt or innocence of an alleged violator of the laws of the
						United States. A trial before such officers is not due process for the
						punishment of offences, according to the meaning of that phrase in the
						constitution.--There are it is true many things which they may determine,
						such as the age and residence of a person offering to vote, whether he has
						paid taxes, and whether if born an alien he has a certificate of
						naturalization. These things pertain to the ascertainment of a political
						right. But whether he has been guilty of a criminal offence, and has as a
						consequence, forfeited his right, is an inquiry of a different character.
						Neither our constitution nor our law has conferred upon the judge of
						elections any such judicial functions. They are not sworn to try to issue in
						criminal cases.--They have no power to compel the attendance of witnesses,
						and their judgement if rendered would be binding upon no other tribunal.</p>
					<p>Even if they were to assume jurisdiction of the offence described in the act
						of Congress, and proceed to try whether the applicant for a vote had been
						duly enrolled and drafted, whether he had received notice of the draft
						whether he had deserted and failed to return to service or failed to report
						to a Provost Marshal, and whether he had justifying reasons for such
						failure, and if after such trial they were to decide that he had not
						forfeited his citizenship all this would not amount to an acquittal. It
						would not protect him against a subsequent similar accusation and trial. It
						would not protect him against trial and punishment by a court martial.
						Surely that is no trial by due process of law, the judgement in which is not
						final, decides nothing, but leaves the accused exposed to another trial in a
						different tribunal and to the imposition by that other tribunal of the full
						punishment prescribed by law.</p>
					<p>Moreover it is not in the power of Congress to confer upon such a tribunal,
						which is exclusively of State creation, jurisdiction to try offences against
						the United States. Notwithstanding the decision in Buckwalter vs. United
						States (11 S. &amp; R., 193) which was an action for penalties, declared
						to be recoverable as other debts, the doctrine seems a plain one, that
						Congress cannot in the courts of any other government or sovereignty. Martle
						vs. Hunter's leasee, 1 Wheaton, 304, 330 Eby vs. Peck, 7 Con., 242, and
						Scoville vs Canfield, 14 Johns, 338. And clearly if this is so Congress
						cannot make a board of State election officers competent to try whether a
						person has been guilty of an offence against the United States, and if they
						find him guilty to enforce a part of the prescribed penalty.</p>
					<p>If therefore the act of March 3, 1865, really contemplates the infliction of
						its prescribed penalty or any part of it without due process of law, or if
						it attempts to confer upon the election officers of a State the power to
						determine whether there has been a violation of the act incurring the
						penalty, and to enforce the penalty or any part of it, it may be doubted
						whether it is not transgressive of the authority vested in Congress by the
						constitution.</p>
					<p>But such is not the fair construction of the enactment. It is not to be
						presumed that Congress intended to transgress its powers and especially is
						this true when the act admits of another construction entirely consonant
						with all the provisions of the constitution.</p>
					<p>What then is its true meaning? As already observed, forfeiture of citizenship
						is prescribed as a penalty for desertion, an additional penalty, not for an
						offence committed before the passage of the act, but for continued desertion
						an failure to return or report. It is not a new consequence of a penalty,
						but it is an integral part of the thing itself. Nor is it the whole. It is
						added to what the law had previously enacted to be the penalty of desertion
						as imprisonment is sometimes added to punishment by fine.</p>
					<p>It must have been intended, therefore, that it should be incurred in the same
						way, and imposed by the same tribunal that was authorized to impose the
						other penalties for the offence. It would be very absurd to suppose that the
						two trials and two condemnations for one crime were intended, or that it was
						designed that a criminal might be sentenced in one court to undergo a part
						of the punishment denounced by the law, and be punished in another court by
						the imposition of the remainder. The law as it stood when the act of 1865
						was passed, had provided a tribunal in which alone the crime of desertion
						could be inflicted. The consequences of conviction may be noticed in other
						courts, but the tribunal appointed by the law for that purpose is the only
						one that can determine whether the crime has been committed, and adjudge the
						punishment.</p>
					<p>The act of March 3d, 1865, is not to be considered apart form the other
						legislation respecting the crime of desertion. It is one of a series of acts
						pertaining to the same subject matter. It must, therefore, be interpreted
						with them all in view. This is an admitted rule of statutory construction.
						So long as Rex vs. Soxdale, 1 Burrows, 147, Lord Mansfield said when
						speaking of acts of Parliament, "that all which relate to the same subjects,
						not withstanding some of them may be expired or not noticed, must be taken
						to be one system and construed consistently." So Chancellor Kent, in the
						first volume of his commentaries, 463-4, said "it is to be inferred that a
						code of statues relating to one subject was governed by one spirit and
						policy and was intended to be consistent and harmonious in the several parts
						and provisions."" In looking through the numerous acts of Congress relating
						to desertion from military or naval service it is plainly to be seen that
						they all contemplate a regular trial and conviction prior to the infliction
						of any penalty, and court martials are constituted and regulated for such
						trials. The twentieth article of war, enacted on the 10th of April, 1806,
						(Brightly's Dig., 75) is in these words: "all officers and soldiers who have
						received pay, or have been duly enlisted in the service of the United State,
						and shall be convicted of having deserted, the
						same shall suffer death or such other punishment as by sentence of court martial shall be inflicted." Other enactments
						have been made at different times respecting the punishments to be inflicted
						for the offence. The punishment of death in time of peace was abolished in
						1830. Corporeal punishment by stripes was abolished by the act of May 16,
						1812, and by the act of March 2d, 1833, that section of the repealing act
						was itself repealed, "so far as it applies to any enlisted soldier who shall be convicted by a general court martial of the
							crime of desertion." By the act of January 11, 1812, an
						additional penalty was prescribed for desertion, and it was declared that
						"such soldier shall and may be tried by a court martial and punished."
						Brightly's Dig., 89. The 13th section of the act of March 3d, 1863, which
						declared that any person failing to report after due service of notice that
						he had been drafted, shall be deemed a deserter, enacted that such a person
						"shall be arrested by the Provost Marshal and sent to the nearest military
						post for trial by Court Martial, unless upon
						proper showing that he is not liable to military duty, the board of
						enrollment shall receive him from the draft." All these acts of Congress
						manifestly contemplate trial for desertion by courts martial and the
						infliction of no punishment or forfeiture, except upon conviction and
						sentence in such courts. The act of 1806 provided for general court martial,
						and made minute and careful regulations for their organization, for the
						conduct of their proceedings, and for the approval or disapproval of their
						sentences. Subsequent acts made some changes, but they have not restrained
						the jurisdiction or diminished the powers of such courts. </p>
					<p>It is to such a code of laws, forming a system devised for the punishment of
						desertion, that the 21st section of the act of March 3d, 1865, was added. It
						refers plainly to pre-existing laws. It has the single object of increasing
						the penalties, but it does not undertake to change or dispense with the
						machinery provided for punishing the crime. The common rules of construction
						demand that it be read as if it had been incorporated into the former acts.
						And if it had been, if the act of 1806, and its supplements had prescribed
						that penalty for desertion or failure to report within a designated time
						after notice of draft (which the act of 1863 declares desertion) should be
						punished on conviction of the same with forfeiture of citizenship and death,
						or in lieu of the latter such other punishment as by the sentence of a
						court-martial may be inflicted, would any one contend that any portion of
						this punishment could be inflicted without conviction and sentence?
						Assuredly not. And if not, so must the act of 1865 be construed now. It
						means that the forfeiture which it prescribes, like all other penalties for
						desertion, must be adjudged to the convicted
						person after trial by a court-martial and sentence approved. For the
						conviction and sentence of such a court there can be no substitute. They
						alone can establish the guilt of the accused, and fasten upon him the legal
						consequences. Such we think is the true meaning of the act, a construction
						that cannot be denied to it without losing sight of all the previous
						legislation respecting the same subject matter, no part of which does this
						act profess to alter. </p>
					<p>It may be added that this construction is not only required by the
						universally admitted rules of statuatory interpretation, but it is in
						harmony with the personal rights secured by the constitution and which
						Congress must be presumed to have kept in view. It gives to the accused a
						trial before sworn Judges, a right challenge, an opportunity of defence, the
						privilege of hearing the witnesses against him, and of calling witnesses in
						his behalf. It preserves to him the common law presumption of innocence,
						until he has been adjudged guilty according to the forms of law.</p>
					<p>It gives finality to a single trial. If tried by a court-martial and
						acquitted, his innocence can never again be called in question, and he can
						be made to suffer no part of the penalties prescribed for guilt. On the
						other hand, if a record of conviction by a lawful court be not a
						prerequisite to suffering the penalty of the law, the act of Congress may
						work intolerable hardships. The accused will thus be obliged to prove his
						innocence whenever the registry of the Provost Marshal is adduced against
						him. No decision of a board of election officers will protect him against
						the necessity of renewing his defence at every subsequent election, and each
						time with increased difficulty arising from the possible death or absence of
						witnesses. In many cases this may prove a gross wrong. It cannot be doubted
						that in some instances there were causes that prevented a return to service
						or a report, by persons registered as deserters by Provost Marshals, that
						would have been held justifying reasons by a court martial, or at least
						would have prevented an approval of the court's sentence. It is well known
						also that some who were registered deserters, were at the time actually in
						the military service as volunteers, and honorably discharging their duties
						to the government. To hold that the act of Congress imposes upon such the
						necessity of proving their innocence without any conviction of guilt, would
						be an unreasonable construction of the act, and would be attributing to the
						national legislature an intention not warranted by the language and
						connection of the enactment.</p>
					<p>It follows that the judgement of the court below upon the case stated was
						right. The plaintiff not having been convicted of desertion and failure to
						return to the service or to report to a Provost Marshal, and not having been
						sentenced to the penalties and forfeitures of the law, was entitled to vote.</p>
					<p>And now, to wit, June 20, 1866, the judgement of the Court of Common Pleas of
						Franklin county is affirmed.</p>
					<p>GEO. W. WOODWARD</p>
					<p>Chief Justice.</p>
					<p>WOODWARD C. J.--I concur in the conclusion stated in the above opinion and in
						most of the reasoning by which that conclusion was reached. But I do not
						concur in treating the act of Congress as a valid enactment, for I believe
						it was an ex post facto law in respect to all
						soldiers except such as committed the crime of desertion after the date of the law. This is not a case of desertion
						subsequent to the enactment, but prior to it, and the penalties of the
						offence are such as were fixed by law when the offence was committed, and it
						is not competent for the legislature to increase them except in future
						cases. </p>

<b>Letter From Gen. W. W. Averell--The Battle of Moorefield--War Department
					Brevets</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Includes a copy of a letter sent to the Chairman of the Military Committee,
					by W. W. Averell, requesting that the board reconsider its findings regarding
					the Confederate raids on Chambersburg in 1864. As the senior officer responsible
					for the defeat of the raiders, Averell feels as though he and his men have
					failed to obtain proper recognition for the feats. The origins of his endeavor,
					therefore, rests with his desire to "correct the trifling errors," which, he
					fears, are "being forced into history."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The following letter, dated Raymond, West Virginia, May 18th, and addressed
						to Hon. Robt. C. Schneck, Chairman of Military Committee, will be read with
						interest by many who served under Gen. Averell on more than one hard-fought
						field. The letter is as follows: Sir--In the Congressional reports of the
						15th instant I observe that a resolution was offered by you, and adopted by
						the House of Representatives, directing the Secretary of War to communicate
						a statement of the brevet promotions made in the regular army since April
						12th, 1861.</p>
					<p>It is not clear that it was intended by this resolution to gain information
						of the brevet volunteer promotions made in the
						regular army; but, presuming that such a statement may properly come within
						its scope, and believing that it will not be furnished from any other
						source, I beg leave to lay before you, with the request that it may be
						referred to the proper committee, some information concerning a brevet Major
						General of Volunteers bestowed upon me August 8th, 1864, for services at
						Moorfield, West Virginia, but which was not confirmed. </p>
					<p>The want of political friends, and perhaps the want of a sufficient regard
						for the brevet itself, prevented me making any inquiries upon the subject,
						but now an imperative duty to myself and to the officers and men who served
						under my command, obliges me to avail myself of this opportunity to correct
						some trifling errors which are now being forced into history, and if
						possible to substitute for them a few facts.--The operations in West
						Virginia, under your Insturctions as Department Commander, did not appeal
						for much public or official consideration amidst the events transpiring with
						the grand armies on either hand, but they were so insignificant as to
						deserve the oblivion of utter ignorance on the part of those in authority.
						It was that command which attacked and defeated the enemy at Droop Mountain,
						captured guns, colors, prisoners and baggage, and for the first time drove
						him from the State of West Virginia, November, 1863--the identical column
						which, shortly afterwards encountering the rigors of a terrible winter and
						vastly superior numbers of the enemy twice passed the Alleghenies,
						penetrated the enemy's lines to Salem on the Tennessee Railroad, and
						destroyed the supplies and communications of Longstreet, tending to cripple
						his operations against Burnside, and to oblige him to abandon that line--the
						same division which co-operated with Crook in breaking the Tennessee
						Railroad a second time in the spring of 1864, and participated in the
						campaign against Lynchburg.</p>
					<p>In the latter part of July, 1864, that division, after having marched over
						four thousand miles on the various expeditions of that year, without rest or
						remount, found itself reduced in strength to about seventeen hundred mounted
						men, stretched along the north bank of the Potomac from Hancock to Antietam
						Furnace, in Maryland, a distance of about thirty miles.</p>
					<p>The enemy, under Early, crossed the river at three points on the 29th,
						breaking my thin picket line into several fragments. To save and assemble
						these, to observe and oppose the enemy while his advancing columns occupied
						every road, consumed the evening and night of the 29th, during which time
						one column under McCausland passed around my right to Chambersburg, which he
						burned at daylight on the morning of the 30th. At McConnellsburg, he was
						overtaken and attacked by my command, and pursued toward the Potomac at
						Hancock, whence he fled up the river, burning the bridges and blockading the
						road, behind him to Oldtown, thirteen miles below Cumberland, where he
						captured an out post of Gen. Kelley's command, escaped across the river and
						took his way southward.</p>
					<p>In the meantime my command crossed at Hancock, passed through Bloomery Gap,
						striking the enemy's trail at Springfield. The pursuit was continued with
						the loss to us of nearly two hundred horses exhausted and abandoned, to
						Moorfield, where, attacked at daylight, August 8, the enemy lost his
						artillery, the Baltimore battery and three (3) colors, about one hundred and
						fifty killed and wounded, four hundred and twenty prisoners, thirty-six
						officers, nearly seven hundred horses and saddles, and all his baggage,
						&amp;c., all of which, excepting the killed and mortally wounded, were
						brought in. The casualties in my command were only thirty-four. Our strength
						was about seventeen hundred, while captured papers of the enemy exhibited a
						total present of about thirty-two hundred.</p>
					<p>We regarded the results of the pursuit and encounter with satisfaction. They
						had not been achieved without the exercise of the greatest possible
						resolution, fortitude, and intrepidity of my command. To the proud
						consciousness of having performed their duty well, was afterwards added the
						satisfaction of knowing that their gallantry had been for once recognized by
						the War Department--their commander had reaped the bravest of major general
						from their meritorious conduct. This gratification was changed to
						disappointment and chagrin when subsequently in looking through the report
						of the Lieutenant General for some record of that march and combat that
						those soldiers who had returned to their homes, read the following paragraph
						intended as a report of the question, viz: "The rebel force moved down the
						valley and sent a raiding party into Pennsylvania, which, on the 30th burned
						Chambersburg, and then retreated pursued by our cavalry toward Cumberland.
						They were met and defeated by General Kelley, and with diminished numbers
						escaped into the mountains of West Virginia."</p>
					<p>The historical value of the above extract is somewhat lessened by comparison
						with the facts previously stated, and by remembering that Gen. Kelley was
						not within fifty miles of Moorfield; that the only portion of his command
						was encountered McCausland was captured; and that no officer senior to
						myself gave any direction not already taken, nor any information not already
						obtained and acted upon by myself. It may have been that not enough of my
						command were killed to justify a remembrance of the name of the place or
						commander, but those noble officers and men, who, on broken down horses or
						on foot, in rags, hungry, without sleep, untiringly pursued McCausland,
						overtook and pubished will not soon forget Moorfield.</p>
					<p>I am, sir, very respectfully,</p>
					<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<b>The Danger of Delay</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Accusing the Republicans of passing the constitutional amendment in order
					to maintain their grip on power and force their radical agenda upon the country,
					the editorial asserts that their political chicanery will impede the restoration
					process, and will thus have an adverse effect on the nation's future.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>It must be apparent to all right-thinking persons that the sooner the Union
						is restored the better for the whole country, North as well as South. The
						effort of the radicals to postpone the restoration of the seceded States to
						their constitutional relations in the Union is full of dangers to the future
						peace and welfare of the country; and it will be well for the people to look
						these dangers squarely in the face and apply the proper remedy before it is
						too late.</p>
					<p>When the conflict of arms ceased, it was hoped that the long agony was over,
						and that the Union was restored. The South seemed disposed to accept even
						terms that the Government had no constitutional right to impose; but the
						temper of the Radical party at the North was not to be appeased by the manly
						surrender of the South. A mere restoration of the Union was not what they
						desired. The Union must be "reconstructed;" made something else than what
						our fathers made it; other conditions than those imposed by the Constitution
						must be exacted to suit party purposes under the plan of "security for the
						future," The entire influence of the South must be destroyed, so that the
						dominant party may hold power forever.--This is the radical scheme, and
						these the motives by which they are governed.</p>
					<p>After armed rebellion ceased, common sense dictated that a generous and
						conciliatory policy was necessary to bring back peace and harmony to the
						country. Yet Congress has been in session eight months, debating and
						wrangling and abusing the South, and fixing up measures to make the
						Government as distasteful and odious as possible. Is this wise? Does it show
						any honest purpose to bring about the result most anxiously desired by all
						true friends of the country? Or must it not, from the very nature of things,
						lead inevitably to total ruin and anarchy?</p>
					<p>Congress has passed a Constitutional amendment, which is to be adopted before
						the Southern States can be admitted into the Union. Whether these States are
						in or out of the Union does not appear. They seem to be in when it suits and
						out when it suits. It is quite apparent that the plan now proposed, and upon
						which the party is acting, is nothing more than a plan to keep the States
						out of the Union. As there is no probability that any Southern State will
						adopt the Amendment, they must remain out in the cold as long as this policy
						is supported. If the radical party retain power, we may as well surrender
						all hope of a restored Union, not withstanding the success of our armies.
						All the blood shed during the last five years will have been shed in vain,
						and all the treasure expended uselessly wasted.</p>
					<p>The radical party never can restore the Union as it was. Indeed they do not
						intend that it shall be restored, if they can prevent it. Their purposes are
						revolutionary. They aim at subverting the rights of the State and
						centralizing power in the Federal Government. As far as the government of
						the South is concerned, it will be one of restraint, and not of consent.
						Does any one for a moment suppose that the South will long patiently submit
						to be governed in this way? Is it not apparent that this policy must breed
						new dissentions, and result in consequences the most disastrous to the whole
						country? Who so blind that he cannot see this? Those who supported the
						Government to restore the Union as it was, not to carry out party purpose
						and establish the domination of one section over another, cannot look at the
						prospect before them without the most gloomy foreboding of the future. We
						can never have an Ireland, or a Poland, or a Hungary in this country, and
						remain a free people. We must have a government with the consent and
						co-operation of the people, or no free government at all.</p>
					<p>We hear a great deal about the Southern people adhering to their old views on
						the right of secession and the like. This is the sheerest nonsense. What
						difference does it make about the sentiments they entertain, if they behave
						themselves properly and obey the laws, as they are now doing? It has never
						been held to be a part of the business of the Government to compel people to
						think alike. A man in South Carolina has as much right to think his own
						thoughts as a yankee in Massachusetts. Think what they may about the
						abstract right of secession, the Southern leaders, without exception, no
						admit that practically the doctrine is a nullity and must be abandoned--that
						they submitted the question to the arbitrament of arms and the issue was
						decided against them. How utterly foolish and absurd it is then to be
						eternally harping on the sentiment of the South on a question, acknowledged
						by its own votaries to be obsolete, and main that a pretext for putting
						obstructions in the way of a speedy restoration of the Union.</p>
					<p>No, if we ever expect a Union of these States again, the South must be taken
						as she is, with representatives of her own restrained choosing. The longer
						it is postponed the worse. This cobbling and tinkering with plans and
						schemes, and Constitution patching, only increases the difficulty if the
						Southern people cant be trusted now, they will be less to be trusted a few
						years hence.</p>
					<p>The only safety for the country lies in the wise, conciliatory and
						constitutional policy of President Johnson. The radical track is beset with
						the snags and breakers on every side. If the radicals crew are permitted
						much longer to steer the ship of State, without the guidance of the chart of
						the Constitution, she will inevitably spring a leak and go down beneath the
						waves of fanaticism and faction. It is high time that the people of the
						whole country should awake to the importance of the pending issue between a
						patriotic President and a revolutionary Congress. Their votes in the fall
						elections will determine whether our constitutional form of government shall
						be perpetuated, or whether hereafter we shall be compelled to live under the
						tyranny of a central despotism. Let the votes of the people this fall
						strengthen the hands of the President, by returning a popular verdict in
						favor of his policy, and the dangers now threatening our free institutions
						from radical misrule will pass away forever--a speedy restoration will be
						accomplished, and peace and happiness will again smile upon the land from
						one end to the other.--If they fall, the prospect will be indeed gloomy.</p>

<b>The National Convention, Again</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial welcomes the announcement that a National Union Convention
					will be held in August, proclaiming it an "unexpected quarter of chance of
					rescue" from the ruin promised by continued Republican rule.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Age</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We hear of numerous letters from the South addressed to prominent citizens,
						Democrats and non-Radical Republicans, inquiring with deep solicitude, as to
						the prospects of the coming Convention. It is most natural that this
						solicitude should exist, and it will be most unnatural if it should not be
						satisfied. It is conceded on all hands, though different solutions of the
						problem are attempted, that, when the armies of Lee and Johnson surrendered,
						and the submission of the South was an accomplished fact, the feeling in
						that region was better and more kindly than it was a month ago, or perhaps
						is now. How it was changed and acidulated, and hardened, we do not pause to
						inquire, though on the subject we have clear opinions. That it has changed
						is enough for us. The cruel, intolerant fanaticism of Congress is of
						necessity encountered, in the Southern heart, by sullen despair. Is there to
						be, say they, no sympathy with our sorrows, even on the theory that we
						brought them upon ourselves? Are we to be punished forever? Are we to be
						proscribed and disfranenished to the crack of doom? To this there is but one
						answer from the Radical majority in Congress and their retainers outside. It
						is the stern decree of modern Pharaohs, who would neither let the people go
						out nor come back. It is the turning of the imperial thumb to the wonderful
						gladiator. It is Lauderdale ordering the executioner to drive the wedge
						deeper into the iron boot. It is, to descend very much in the scale of
						illustration. Allegheny Williams begrudging a flower or a stone on a
						confederate tomb. It is Stevens, tottering on the edge of his own grave
						talking about the "bayonets of hell." It is the Cerebus of our own "loyal"
						press here, barking for vengeance and trying, safely to lap more blood. In
						vain in the path of fanaticism stood the President. He announced to the
						world his policy of justice and mercy, but he was powerless in effecting
						legislation. He is powerless in another sense. Like one of our early
						Presidents in this, though unlike in other respects, he inherited a Cabinet.
						By it, he has been hampered and he is hampered yet. He has done all he can
						to restore the Union as it was. He does not seem much disposed to have any
						other than the Constitution as it is. Still, we repeat, he is relatively
						powerless</p>
					<p>In this condition of helpless and hopeless antagonism there appears in an
						unexpected quarter a change of rescue. A number of public men, holding no
						executive position, but, strictly speaking, representatives of the people
						and the States, make an affectionate and respectful appeal--the only one
						that has been made to the whole people and all the States--to Texas, to
						Maine, to Iowa, to Florida, to men of all parties (not of all colors), and
						of varied political antecedents to meet in Convention, National Convention, and deliberate. That appeal reaches the
						South, which had almost given itself up to despondency, and is it any wonder
						that a little hope brightens in their saddened hearts, and that they write
						to their Northern friends (for they have friends in their hour of
						adversity), and ask, is this all illusory? Are there no such beings as
						moderate, merciful Republicans? Is Democracy, War Democracy or peace
						Democracy, so fierce or so feeble, that it dare not come into council with
						Southern men who are disarmed and powerless for evil? Is ruin still to rule
						the hour? Is there no hope? </p>
					<p>Our answer as Democratic journalists and we hope and believe the answer of
						the Democracy of Pennsylvania, is very distinct.--We favor this Convention.
						There is nothing or little in what we may describe as its preliminary
						platform that repels us. The Convention implies
						no derangement of the political organization to which we belong, and are
						proud to belong. Indeed it strengthens it. Let it meet. Let every
						Congressional District of the North be represented, and then let it, as it
						certainly will, give a grand example to Congress, in session or out of
						session, of admitting representatives from all the Southern States, and
						deliberating ith them, their ancient friends,
						their brethren yet. Let them admit them with generous confidence and without
						the wretched conscience-traps of oaths of abjuration and supremacy. Thus
						deliberating, we doubt not of the result in theory and in practice. The
						sight of Southern men in council with the North as equals will invigorate
						the truly national spirit everywhere.--Philadelphia in 1865 will be as
						Philadelphia in 1787. Christ Church bells will ring as they used long ago to
						do, not for bloody victories in civil war, but for the new creation of a
						nation and the resurrection of a Federal Union. Practically, a Convention
						thus animated and thus deliberating, will for the machinery by which its
						patriotic designs are to be carried into effect, rely mainly, though not of
						necessity exclusively, on the great and compact organization of the State
						Right Democracy, now as ever the true supporters of the Union. Hence we wish
						the Convention success.--Age.</p>

					<p>WASHINGTON, June 30, 1866.</p>
					<p>A call has emanated from the National Union Club of Washington, to which are
						appended the names of Messrs. Doolittle and Randall, of Wisconsin, Browning,
						of Illinois, and Cowan, of Pennsylvania, with the indorsement of Senators
						Dixon, of Connecticut, Hendricks of Indiana, Norton of Minnesota, and

						assembling of this convention is to result in the fusion of the conservative
						Republicans and Democrats into a permanent national party, under some new

					<p>ENDORSEMENT OF THE UNION CONVENTION.</p>
					<p>The Democratic members of Congress held a caucus last night in which the

						publication on Monday. OPNIONOS OF THE PRESS OF RICHMOND.</p>
					<p>The Richmond Dispatch remarks that the convention
						"will be the most important event of our time, and will look more like Union
						than anything that has happened since the war." The Richmond Enquirer considers the call "liberal in its terms."
						The Richmond Examiner asserts that the "South is
						the party most immediately and vitally interested in the success of the
						movement," and that no Southern State should "hang back" from it.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Soldiers' Convention which met in Pittsburgh on the 5th of June last, and
						which pledged their comrades in the State to the support of the radical
						measures of Congress in opposition to the just and constitutional policy of
						President Johnson, and which promised their votes to John W. Geary, the
						radical candidate for Governor, misrepresented the sentiments of the great
						mass of the officers and soldiers of Pennsylvania. In order that a true
						expression of opinion might be had from the late defenders of the government
						in the field, and to counteract the injury attempted to be done to the cause
						of the Union, it was deemed advisable by the late officers and soldiers of
						the Federal army in this State to hold another Convention.</p>
					<p>A preliminary meeting of returned officers and soldiers, with this object in
						view was holden on Thursday the 28th of June, when it was resolved to hold A
						state Convention at Harrisburg, on Wednesday, the first of August prex., at
						10 o'clock, A., M., to be composed of such honorably discharged officers,
						soldiers and seamen of Pennsylvania, as subscribe to the following doctrine,
						viz:--</p>
					<p>1. Who are in favor of carrying out, in good faith, the joint resolution of
						Congress adopted July 22d, 1861, which declared that, "This war is not
						prosecuted on our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of
						conquest or subjugation, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the
						Constitution and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and
						rights of the several States unimpaired." These were the conditions of the
						bond the soldiers signed and sealed in blood with the government and a
						refusal now to carry them out is a gross violation of a solemn agreement.</p>
					<p>2. Who are in favor of restoring the states lately in rebellion to all their
						constitutional relations with the Federal Union as they stood before the war
						broke out, according to the humane and constitutional policy laid down by
						President Johnson;</p>
					<p>3. Who are in favor of representatives from the South, loyal to the
						Constitution and the laws, being immediately received by Congress;</p>
					<p>4. Who approve President Johnson's vetoes of the Freedman's Bureau and Civil
						Right's Bills;</p>
					<p>5. Who are opposed to any interference by Congress with the rights of the
						States reserved by the Constitution, and who are opposed to the right of
						suffrage being conferred upon the negro;</p>
					<p>6. And who are in favor of the election of Hiester Clymer, Democratic
						candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania, the representative of the
						constitutional and conservative doctrine stated above.</p>
					<p>Each county will be entitled to seven delegates to the Convention; and where
						a county has more than one member in the House of Representatives, such
						county will be entitled to seven delegates for each additional member. The
						delegates are to be selected by the honorably discharged officers, soldiers
						and seamen of the counties respectively.</p>
					<p>In addition to the delegates selected, all other honorably discharged
						officers, soldiers and seamen who sympathize with the object in view, are
						invited to meet at Harrisburg on that occasion</p>
