                    <p>[From the Congressional Globe, December 31.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowan-Mr. President, I am not disposed to allow the speech of the
                        honorable Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Sumner) to go to the country
                        without a very brief reply. If that speech be true, and if it be a correct
                        picture of the South, then God help us; then this Republic, this Union, is
                        at an end, then the great war which we waged for the Union was a folly; then
                        all the blood and treasure which we have expended in that war in order to
                        restore ourselves to companionship with the people of the South have been
                        equally follies. But, Mr. President, is it true? Or is not this series of
                            <emph rend="italic">ex parte</emph> statements made up by anonymous
                        letter-writers, people who are down there more than likely stealing cotton,
                        people who are down there in the enjoyment of place and power, people who
                        are interested that the distrusted condition of things which exists there
                        now shall always continue because they make profit of it? Is there any man
                        who has had any experience in the trial of causes, any man who knows
                        anything about the nature of evidence, who does not know that the honorable
                        Senator could have sent his emissaries into any one county in the lately
                        rebellious States, and gather the expressions of knaves and fools and
                        discontented single-idead people, far more than he has given us in this
                        speech? </p>
                    <p>We are told here of the exceptional instances of bad conduct on the part of
                        the people of the South. Why, what a large volume it would take to hold all
                        that? If a man were to go about anywhere in the loyal States and hunt up
                        what he might suppose to be treasonable expressions, heretical expressions,
                        how many could he find? And yet we are treated to all this here as if it was
                        the whole of the evidence in the case. One man out of ten thousand is brutal
                        to a negro, and this is paraded here as a type of the whole people of the
                        South, whereas nothing is said of the other nine thousand nine hundred and
                        ninety nine men who treat the negro well. One man expresses a great deal of
                        dissatisfaction at the present state of affairs, and that is paraded here
                        while nothing is said of the other ten thousand men who are contented to
                        accept it and make the most of it.</p>
                    <p>What, then are we to do? We are to suppose that the people of the Southern
                        States lately in rebellion have common sense; and when their utterances are
                        in accordance with what is common sense and the dictate of their own
                        interest, we have a right to presume it to be true. But according to what we
                        have just heard, everything that has come from the people of these States,
                        and from their public bodies, from the representatives of these people, is
                        to be taken as false; and why? Because some cotton agent, some correspondent
                        of a radical newspaper in the North, some office holder who has been making
                        a profit of the state of things there chooses to say it is all false! The
                        heresy of States rights is not destroyed there, the honorable Senator says.
                        Have we not heard from almost all the public men of the South that that
                        question was put to the arbitrament of the sword; that they have lost, and
                        that they submit? Have they not acquiesced in the abolition of slavery-that
                        things of all others which was the last, in the opinion of many, that they
                        would submit to? But still further guarantees are wanted; we are not told
                        what they are. What are they? What is wanted? Everybody admits that the
                        negro ought to have his natural rights secured to him. I believe all the
                        moderate, conservative men of this Chamber are fully agreed that every man
                        should have his natural rights secured-the rights to life, liberty, and the
                        pursuit of happiness; the protection of property, limbs and reputation; that
                        he should have the right to sue and be sued, and to testify in courts of
                        justice. The negro has not hitherto been allowed in the Southern States to
                        testify in courts of justice, and why? Because he was a slave, and if I had
                        been a citizen of the Southern States when slavery prevailed there, I would
                        have resisted his right to testify in courts.</p>
                    <p>A witness, like a voter, ought to be a free man; he should not belong to
                        another man. What chance would a litigant have against the master of slaves,
                        if the salve could testify? It seems to me that the slaves ought not to
                        testify for the same reason that the wife ought not to testify either for or
                        against the husband. Would you ask a negro to testify against his master, to
                        go back to that master and be subjected to his ill-will because of his
                        testimony? Would you allow him to testify for the master as against a party
                        on the other side? Certainly not. But now this state of things has passed
                        away. Now the people of the Southern States themselves, so far as I
                        understand them, are in favor of opening the courts to all these classes of
                        people. And, sire, they must open them for their security. I am willing to
                        leave that to themselves; their own interest will compel them to allow all
                        people to testify, unless they are excluded by those disabilities that have
                        heretofore excluded witnesses from testifying. If the honorable Senator from
                        Massachusetts, and those who think with him, desire that these people should
                        have the right of suffrage, why not say so broadly?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner.-I do say so.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowan.-Very well; that is so much that is clear; make it broadly; we may
                        differ from him, but the people will decide. I am perfectly willing to
                        acquiesce in their decision; I do not care which way it is; but the people
                        will decide that question, and they will decide it promptly. If the
                        honorable Senator from Massachusetts wants to hold the doctrine that these
                        States are no States, that they are no constituent members of this Union,
                        let him say so; there is a tribunal to which they can be referred. If he
                        wishes to take issue with the President on these points, let the issue be
                        made fairly and squarely, and it will be met. Thank God, in this Government,
                        not like that of Russia, which he has eulogized, there is a power above us
                        all; there is a power to whose arbitrament and award we can appeal, and who
                        will settle this thing conclusively.</p>
                    <p>Now, Mr. President. I am for reconciliation. I want to have this Union
                        restored; and a Union means a Union by consent, not by force. I would like
                        to make friends of all the people with whom we have been at enmity
                        heretofore. I do not want the contest to go on any longer. But are we to
                        make friends with them, and are they to be reconciled to us, and are they to
                        behave better by such speeches as have been made by the honorable Senator
                        here to-day? I very much doubt it. I do not think that he will improve the
                        condition of the Southern heart or the condition of the Southern mind, by
                        thus parading these exceptional cases to the people of this country, and
                        stimulating and exciting their angry passions more than they are not now
                        against this unfortunate people-unfortunate in every respect; unfortunate on
                        account of their errors, unfortunate on account of the penalty which has
                        followed those errors, and which they have suffered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, let us look at this testimony. The honorable Senator, as I
                        said before, reads from anonymous letter writers, from cotton agents, and
                        people of that kind. Now, it does so happen that we have some testimony upon
                        this subject; we have the testimony of the President of the United States,
                        not a summer soldier or [unclear] patriot.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sumner.-I have not read anonymous letters.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowan.-They are anonymous so far as we are concerned; and I commend the
                        Senator's prudence in keeping the names of their writers from the public,
                        because I have no doubt that if their names were shown they would not be
                        considered of much importance. I very much doubt whether there is a single
                        man among them who has ever wielded anything more than a pen during the
                        rebellion. But I say that we have the testimony of men of unexceptionable
                        veracity; we have the testimony of the President of the United States, who
                        was a Union man, and who was in favor of the Union at a time an din a place
                        where there was some merit in it. I do not suppose that there was any great
                        merit in being a Union man from Massachusetts. I suspect a man would have
                        been very likely to get a lamp post if he had been anything else there; but
                        the President of the United States was a Union man in the very thick and
                        storm of the battle. He was waylaid while coming hither in order to attend
                        to his official duties in this body. He has stood by the Constitution, by
                        the Union, all the way through, steadily and firmly; and, as a compliment to
                        him, the great party to which I belong, and to which he did not belong, and
                        never pretended to belong, conferred upon him the office which, in the
                        Providence of God, has made him President of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Now, sir, you are told here that this man, in his official communication to
                        the Senate of the United States, whitewashes the condition of things down
                        below. Yes, sir, "whitewash" is the word. The honorable Senator says that he
                        will not accept the definition of "whitewash" given by the Senator from
                        Connecticut or the Senator from Wisconsin, but he has not told us what he
                        means by the word "whitewash." It is not necessary that he should say what
                        he means by that word. Everybody understands it. I suppose even his colored
                        friends, in whom he takes so much interest, would know what the meaning of
                        the word "whitewash" was. [Laughter]. He says that this man, who stood firm
                        when everybody else faltered-this man, who stood almost alone in the midst
                        of an enraged group of the worst civil war perhaps the world has ever
                        seen-comes here to "whitewash." What does he mean except that the President
                        of the United States, in an official communication to this body, comes here
                        to lie; that is the plain English of it; comes here either to suppress the
                        truth or to suggest a falsehood.</p>
                    <p>What does the President say? I will read what he says as a sufficient answer
                        to the state of affairs there, and I do not find it necessary to deny
                        thousands of instances of exceedingly heretical talk that may have taken
                        place, and of treasonable talk if you please; and I have no doubt that is a
                        state of things unparalleled in the history of the world, heretofore, wrongs
                        and outrages innumerable happen there; but that is not the question. The
                        question is what is the condition of the mass of the people in the South;
                        what is their disposition and tendency; no to love the North, not to love
                        the honorable Senator from Massachusetts-because I very much fear that that
                        will not be brought about soon unless there is a change in the temper of
                        both parties-not to have hearts overflowing with love and gratitude to those
                        who they think persecute and hunt them in their submission; who kick and
                        strike at them after they are down, after they have cried "enough"-but the
                        question is what is their disposition to obey the laws? What do we care
                        about their hearts or their dispositions if they are obedient to their laws,
                        and submit to the laws? Now they have submitted to laws which impose the
                        heaviest penalty, for if they are traitors the law imposes the penalty of
                        death and confiscation of estates by means of fine. I will read what the
                        President says now of the condition of that people from the information he
                        has received: "In that portion of the Union lately in rebellion, the aspect
                        of affairs is more promising than in view of all the circumstances could
                        well have been expected." I think there is no candid man who will not
                        indorse that sentiment. "The people throughout the entire South evince a
                        laudable desire to renew their allegiance to the Government, and to repair
                        the devastation of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful
                        pursuits."</p>
                    <p>Why should they not? To suppose anything else is to suppose that they are
                        demented. That they have no kind of common sense left; that four years of
                        the most terrible war, and the most terribly punishment ever inflicted upon
                        a people, have been without their lessons. It cannot be, Mr. President; it
                        is not in the nature of things that it should be.</p>
                    <p>"An abiding faith" on the part of this man who suffered from these people;
                        who suffered from this war and the doctrine of secession, and the attempt to
                        break the Union. He says, "And abiding faith is entertained that their
                        actions will conform to their professions, and that in acknowledging the
                        supremacy of the Constitution and the laws of the United States, their
                        loyalty will be unreservedly given to the Government, whose leniency they
                        cannot fail to appreciate, and whose fostering care will soon restore them
                        to a condition of prosperity."</p>
                    <p>And here, Mr. President, allow me to ask when in the history of this world or
                        of the human family, has it happened that severity, cruelty, persecution,
                        refusal to recognize common rights, has reconciled a people and pacified a
                        distracted country; and when has it happened that clemency, leniency, as the
                        President expresses it, has failed to produce beneficial results? Is it not
                        necessary to go very far back for instances to show this. Look at the
                        treatment of England toward Ireland. What has been the result of holding the
                        people in a species of vassalage? A Fenlan insurrection upon her hand now,
                        after hundreds of years of attempt to dominate over that people. Look at
                        Poland; look everywhere. And if it be necessary to see what clemency, what
                        leniency and justice, and trust and confidence can do to restore a people
                        once in revolution, take the conduct of Hoche in La Vendee. There, by the
                        genius of one man, high enough to be above vulgar passion, statesman enough
                        to look to the future, La Vendee was restored to France, and is there now,
                        part and parcel of it, with every recollection of the revolution effaced.</p>
                    <p>"It is true that in some of the States the demoralizing effects of war are to
                        seen in occasional disorders"-these effects are to be seen in the North as
                        well as in the south,--"but these are local in character, not frequent in
                        occurrence, and are rapidly disappearing as the authority of civil law is
                        extended and sustained. Perplexing questions were naturally to be expected
                        from the great and sudden change in the relations between the two races, but
                        systems are gradually developing themselves under which the freedman will
                        receive the protection to which he is justly entitled, and by means of his
                        labor make himself a useful and independent member of the community in which
                        has his home. From all the information in my possession, and from that which
                        I have recently derived from the most reliable authority, I am indeed to
                        cherish the belief that sectional animosity is surely and rapidly merging
                        itself into a spirit of nationalist, and that representation, connected with
                        a properly adjusted system of taxation, will result in a harmonious
                        restoration of the relations of the States to the National Union.</p>
                    <p>There is a little more testimony yet, Mr. President, and it is worth while to
                        consider while we are here to take counsel and to know what we ought to do
                        in the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves, from whom will we
                        take that counsel. Are we to take it from men, the purpose of whose life
                        seems to be to wage war upon these people and their institutions? Shall we
                        take it from men whom they hate personally and by name, and to whom it is
                        almost impossible to suppose they ever will be reconciled, or in the nature
                        of things, can be reconciled? Or are we to take it from the men, who have
                        not made this a personal war; who have treated it as a national war, and
                        who, in their conduct of [unclear], have won the applause of both
                        sections?-The President says that part of his information has been received
                        from Gen. Grant. Who is General Grant? Who is to be put in the scale with
                        that scarred soldier, and whose testimony is to weigh down his? Is he
                        "whitewashing" here too? Has he forgotten the position he occupies before
                        the American people? With the highest military character of any man to-day
                        upon the earth, has he condescended to come here to deceive the Senate of
                        his country, and to lie about the condition of affairs in the South, which
                        he has recently visited? Let us hear what he says, and listen with patient
                        reverence to the utterance of a man of sense, a patriot, and a prudent man,
                        who desires not to embroil, not to embitter, not to widen the gap that
                        already exists between the two peoples, who ought to be fraternally united,
                        but a man who desires to heal and to pacify; a man imbued with the spirit of
                        Hoche when he wen tot La Vendee, and where he succeeded when the others had
                        failed? What does he say? It is not the tone or manner of the letter writer,
                        but it is in the manner of a man and a soldier.</p>
                    <p>"I am satisfied"-says he; and when he is satisfied who dares say he is not
                        satisfied upon the score of honesty and good intent toward the Republic?</p>
                    <p>"I am satisfied that the mass of thinking men at the South accept the present
                        situation of affairs in good faith."</p>
                    <p>That is what General Grant says. Is that "whitewashing"?</p>
                    <p>"The questions which have heretofore divided the sentiments of the people of
                        the two sections-slavery and State rights, or the right of a State to secede
                        from the Union-they regard as having been settled forever by the highest
                        tribunal-arms-that man can resort to."</p>
                    <p>It is now said that they do not think so; that they are only pretending, and
                        have a covert purpose of doing something hereafter about this thing, nobody
                        can tell exactly what. Perhaps we will be told that they will not abide the
                        result.</p>
                    <p>"I was pleased to learn from the leading men whom I met, that they not only
                        accepted the decision arrived at as final, but that now, when the smoke of
                        battle has cleared away and time has been given for reflection, this
                        decision has been a fortunate one for the whole country, they receiving like
                        benefits from if with those who opposed them in the field and in council.</p>
                    <p>Why, Mr. President, the common sense of that last utterance is worth more as
                        testimony than that of a thousand scribblers who merely look at detached
                        points of this great field. They have resolved to accept the decision as
                        final; and, what we ought all to be glad to know, they have found that it is
                        for their benefit. They have found, too, after the smoke has cleared away,
                        that they are really in a better condition than they were before, that they
                        have been relieved from the incubus which oppressed them for so long a time,
                        and they are ready now to take their places in the Union, and along side of
                        the Northern States who have made liberty their great principle rather than
                        slavery. Why should they not? If any man can give a reason why they should
                        desire to keep up this strife longer, with their devastated fields, with
                        their treasuries empty, with their society disorganized, I should like to
                        hear it.</p>
                    <p>I therefore hope, Mr. President, that we may meet them in a different spirit;
                        that we may show to them that we made this war, not to make them eternal
                        enemies of ours, not to humiliate them, but to rescue them; that we made
                        this war to go and get them out of the clutches of the bad men who had
                        misled them into the gloomy realm of secession and disunion; and that we
                        intend, after the great military victory which we have achieved, to achieve
                        another by magnanimity and clemency in our conduct toward them. That we will
                        win them back to be as they were before, our friends and our brothers, of
                        the same race and the same lineage. I hope too that this angry, irritating,
                        and exciting mode of treating this subject, which is calculated to make us
                        anything else than friends, will be discarded hereafter, and that we shall
                        cooly and calmly, and in the spirit of the nation (because that is the
                        spirit of the nation,) examine this question, and do with it that which will
                        be calculated to restore the old harmony and peace, and the old Union
                    again.</p>

                    <p>The breach between the radical majority in Congress and the President is
                        daily growing wider and wider. The issue is becoming more and more clearly
                        defined as time advances. The parties to the contest are marshalling their
                        forces, and an open rapture cannot be much longer postponed. When the
                        conflict comes, as come it must, it will be found to be the fiercest of any
                        ever recorded in the political history of the country. It may be sharp,
                        quick and decisive, but it will be fierce nevertheless. The radicals will
                        fight with desperation knowing full well that their lease of power and
                        plunder depends on their success in this issue. Defeat will be utter and
                        irretrievable ruin, politically, to themselves and party. Their only hope
                        for future political power and preferment rests on their ability to hold the
                        South as conquered territory; and to do this it is necessary to subvert our
                        republican form of Government and establish on its ruins a central
                        despotism. This is their purpose, for this they are striving; and to
                        accomplish which, they will resort to any and every means, however
                        revolutionary and violative of the principles of the Constitution and Public
                        Liberty, that promises success.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, with a firm grasp on the helm of State and his feet firmly
                        planted on the rock of the Constitution, the President is preparing to meet
                        the assaults of his enemies. The Purest and best men in the republican party
                        are arraying themselves on his side. Already Senators Doolittle, Dixon and
                        Cowan have taken their stand by his side, and spoken out boldly for the
                        Constitution and the Union and against the destructive theories of the
                        radicals.-Raymond has spoken for the President in the House. Others will
                        soon follow the lead of these distinguished Republicans, and these united
                        with the Democracy, who are a unit in support of the President's policy,
                        will make him invincible in this contest. Justice, right and truth are on
                        his side, and "he is doubly armed that hath his quarrel just." The issue
                        cannot be doubtful.</p>
                    <p>The radicals are alarmed, and what has alarmed them most is the fear that the
                        President will make sue of this official patronage to defeat their purposes
                        in Congress and insure the success of his own policy. We think it quite
                        likely he will. Indeed he would not act wisely if he did not. The results
                        depending on the issue are of untold importance. The union and future
                        harmony of the States, the preservation of the Constitution and the rights
                        and liberties of the citizens under it, all hang on the success of that
                        policy. Every means within their reach, the country will justify the
                        President in using to make it successful. If it be necessary to bring into
                        play the executive patronage as an element of power wherewith to crush his
                        own and his country's foes, let it be done and done freely, and the people
                        will say, Amen! Let him strike the assassins down in their infamous efforts
                        to murder the liberties of the country.</p>
                    <p>Evidence is daily accumulating which goes to prove a state of demoralization
                        in the Republican party which will soon overwhelm it in ruin. The leaders
                        are panic-stricken, the ranks are breaking at every point, and it needs but
                        one vigorous blow from the strong arm of Andrew Johnson to wind up, finally
                        and forever, its career of evil to the country.</p>
                    <p>When Congress assembled a little more than a month ago, radicalism was
                        rampant. Sumner, Stevens, &amp; Co. doubtless imagined that all they had
                        to do was to announce their programme, and the President, like Davy
                        Crockeett's coon, would at once "come down." But the result proves that they
                        had sadly mistaken their man. Instead of "coming down," as they supposed he
                        would, he has gone steadily on in the line of policy he had marked out for
                        himself long before Congress assembled. Totally ignoring the action of
                        Congress, he has recognized the re-organized State Governments of the South,
                        and handed them over, one after another, to the officers chosen by people.
                        How galling it must be to the radical leaders to see <emph rend="italic"
                            >their</emph> plan of reconstruction thus contemptuously ignored. </p>
                    <p>Instead of frightening the President, as they intended, they themselves have
                        become frightened. The tables are completely turned. The loss of executive
                        patronage is the ghost that haunts their troubled minds. The Washington
                        correspondent of the Chicago <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> informs us
                        that Mr. Wilson, a radical member of Congress from Iowa, called on the
                        President to ascertain "whether he meant to recognize the right of Congress
                        to determine upon the mode of re-organizing and restoring the rebel States
                        to the Union according to the views of the majority of both Houses, or
                        whether his purpose was to bring the influence of patronage, and other
                        agencies at his command, to bear in order to secure an endorsement and
                        adoption of his own plan of reconstruction." After giving the substance of
                        Mr. Wilson's remarks to the President, and the President's reply, the
                        correspondent adds; "However pressed by Mr. Wilson in this direction, he
                        would <emph rend="italic">not</emph> give the assurance desired of him. That
                        he would have made a formal disclaimer of a purpose to meddle with Congress,
                        if he did not entertain it, may be fully presumed." A sensible presumption,
                        we think. </p>
                    <p>The communication closes with the following significant paragraph:</p>
                    <p>Much earnest feeling has been created among radical members by the
                        announcement that the President had directed certain heads of departments
                        "to make no further appointments upon the recommendations of Congressmen at
                        present." The fact of the existence of this order was communicated by the
                        chief of a department to some radical Congressmen who had made a request for
                        a certain appointment. But one construction is given to this executive
                        mandate, viz: that support of the Executive policy is to be hereafter the
                        price of patronage.</p>
                    <p>If this be the firm and fixed purpose of the President, and we believe it is,
                        then the struggle between him and Congress cannot be protected. It will be
                        fierce but not long. With this powerful weapon of warfare vigorously
                        applied, he will be able, in a very short time, to rout the radical
                        disunionists in Congress "horse, foot and dragoons;" and the honest portion
