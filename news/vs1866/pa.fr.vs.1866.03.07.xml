				<head>Nomination for Governor</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Before this week's issue reaches our readers, both parties will have
						nominated candidates for the office of Governor. But two persons are named
						by the Democracy, either of whom we can be proud of--Clymer of Berks and
						Cass of Pittsburg. These gentlemen are so well and so favorably known in the
						State, that they need no endorsement from us. Mr. Clymer has displayed rare
						abilities as a legislator and debator, and has acquired that enlarged
						experience in public affairs, whilst in the Senate, which would fit him
						peculiarly for the efficient and fearless discharge of the functions of the
						office. His integrity has never been questioned. Even his political enemies
						approve of it. The latter gentleman is by acknowledgement one of the first
						Democrats in the State. He is reputed as possessing great executive and
						financial abilities, and although he may not possess the same amount of
						experience in affairs of State as his competitor, yet it is conceded that
						the interests of the Commonwealth would be safe in his hands. Open, firm and
						fearless Democrats, having stood by the party in the days of its trials and
						adversities, these gentlemen possess the un-we limited confidence of the
						party, and [we] shall be glad o do battle under the leadership of either.</p>
					<p>In numbers, if not in respectability and capacity, our opponents are in
						advance of us. Four champions have entered the lists to secure the "loaves
						and fishes." And strange to say three of the four are renegade Democrats.
						These men remained with us whilst we had favors to bestow, and when there
						were no further favors for them, they deserted to the enemy. Gen. Morehead,
						of Pittsburg, is one of these aspirants. How he obtained the title of
						General deponent saith not. We are sure that he did not earn it on the
						"tented field." He is not of the kind to seek the "bubble reputation in the
						cannon's mouth." As he had this handle to his name when years ago he battled
						by our side, we conclude that he acquired it under the old militia system of
						wooden swords, corn stalk guns and potato buttons. Such titles, in those
						warlike days, were cheap, easily earned, and conduct, courage and merit were
						not considered pre-requisites. His present political importance is the
						result only of accident. As a politician he is obsolete. The Convention will
						consign him to oblivion.</p>
					<p>The next of these aspirants is the redoubtable Brig. Gen. Geary, who
						seemingly has the "inside track." He received his title legitimately. He was
						one of the great <emph rend="italic">paper</emph> captains of the wars of
						the Rebellion. The title was the result, not of prowess, warlike skill, or
						distinction on the battle-field, but of the efforts of army correspondents,
						and indiscreet friends at Washington city. Aside from the capture of a
						Quaker gun at Harpers Ferry, we know of no heroic feat to ascribe to him.
						His greatest difficulty will be to settle his own political latitude. For if
						his recent professions are to be credited, he is now as sound a Democrat as
						ever. If this be true he has got into strange company. Alas for office
						seeking Geary, the prospective title of Governor was too powerful for his
						political integrity. We prefer the militia General by far. </p>
					<p>The last of the three is our quondam friend Major General John Cessna, of
						Bedford. This gentleman has battled long and eagerly for the office, and in
						his pursuit of it has had at least a bushel and a peck of trouble. He also
						found that the way of the transgressor is hard. A short time ago he was
						ready, willing and anxious to be the candidate of the Democracy, on any
						platform which might be erected, but as the material in the man was too
						slender he was passed by, whereupon the disappointed seeker after political
						favors, had a <emph rend="italic">full and immediate revelation </emph> of
						the horrible tendency of Democratic principles, and forthwith he left in a
						blaze of glory and became the wickedest and most unscrupulous defamer of the
						party in the State, exemplifying the old adage that "one renegade is worse
						than two Turks." He was scarcely warm in his new seat until he started in
						pursuit of his favorite phantom, but was treated scarilly by his new
						friends. In his own county he had to meet and defeat Jordon. He won Bedford
						and with it he has just five votes out of 123 for the office. Bright
						prospects them. If we were in his position we would consider ourselves as
						dead as a harring. This deplorable condition of the defunct political hack
						excited our pity. We have no doubt that he was <emph rend="italic"
						>lured</emph> from the Democratic faith by the promise of preferment, and
						now to be treated in this shameful way. It is heart breaking. Well "doubtful
						things are mighty uncertain" and he has found that whilst he has incurred
						the scorn and contempt of the party he deserted and for the manner of that
						desertion, he has no secured the respect nor confidence of the party that
						seduced him. WE gave him a position far beyond his merits, but his vanity
						and ambition were inordinate and his selfishness all absorbing--we speak
						politically. He was for himself and only for himself and was eternally
						grasping for offices and positions for which he was not qualified. Failing
						in his aims he deserted. Now our opponents have put their foot on his
						ambitious longings forever. </p>
					<p>One of the secrets of his want of success is that he is no Chesterfield. His
						manners are not of the style which the world admires. They are destitute of
						polish and the softness of good breeding and culture, and somehow or another
						these accomplishments are always considered as pre-requisite to the office.
						His we do not charge as fault but as a misfortune.</p>
					<p>From these men we expect to see the nomination made. Our opponents, strange
						enough, prefer an apostate Democrat to a regular "Simon pure" of their own
						party. They not only accept the <emph rend="italic">treason</emph> but
						reward the <emph rend="italic">traitors</emph>, and that to at he expense of
						life-long members of their own party. Mr. Ketchum is named, but as he is an
						original Republican of course he has no chance. Of his qualifications we
						know but little. He is we believe a lawyer, but courtesy at least. Was once
						in the Senate, but is otherwise unknown to fame; but not being a General or
						an Apostate he has no chance of success whatever.</p>

				<transcript>
					<p>HARRISBURG, March 3, 1866.</p>
					<p>The Legislature was in session this week from Tuesday until yesterday when it
						adjourned over until next Tuesday. One of the most important bills
						introduced into the Legislature this session was passed in the Senate this
						week, it having previously passed the House. It is an Act to authorize the
						Philadelphia and Erie Railroad Company to build branch roads in any
						direction through the counties through which the main road passes, and the
						counties adjoining said counties. It authorizes the company to have surveyed
						within two years such routes as they may choose, and have plots thereof
						filled in the Auditor Generals offices, which secures to the Company the
						exclusive right to such routes against all other corporations for the period
						of five years. This act will doubtless interfere materially with the grand
						scheme of the Atlantic and Grate Western Railroad Company to build and brad
						gauge road though the northern section of the State. It was violently
						opposed by Lowry, of Erie; Bigham, of Allegheny, and others in the Senate,
						but their opposition was of no avail. The passage of this bill will probably
						end the controversy between these two mammoth corporations for the present
						session.</p>
					<p>The Senate yesterday passed a resolution by a strict party vote requesting
						Senator Cowan to resign his seat in the United States senate. At the very
						hour this action was being taken by the Senate of Pennsylvania, he was
						making a powerful speech in the U. S. Senate in favor of the policy of
						President Johnson and against the destructive and revolutionary schemes of
						Summer, Stevens &amp; Co. I confidently expect to hear within a day or
						two of his <emph rend="italic">prompt</emph> resignation "over the left."
						The radials may rave and howl and pass resolutions of censure, but the noble
						record of Senator Cowan will stand in history an honor to his name longer
						after the names of his radical revilers will have been sunk in infamous
						oblivion. He is now of the Pennsylvania's noblest sons, and he will yet be
						honored and regarded by his native State for his unflinching fidelity to
						constitutional principles and his steady defence of the right. </p>
					<p>The Republican members of the Legislature hold a secret caucus on Tuesday
						evening at which the breach between the President and the majority of
						Congress was considered. Rumor has it that it was a stormy one, during which
						some violent discussions took place, almost resulting in blows between
						Senators Lowry and Hall. What a happy and harmonious family this party of
						"grand moral ideas" just now seems to be! The action of the caucus only
						became definitely known here through the proceeding of Congress several days
						afterwards, when Mr. Stevens announced that "the <emph rend="italic"
						>Union</emph> [unclear] members of the Pennsylvania Legislature in caucus
						had unanimously endorsed the action of Congress." This commits the party in
						this State squarely against the President and in favor of the revolutionary
						and the disunion measures of Thad. Stevens &amp; Co. </p>
					<p>Prominent politicians of both parties are beginning to arrive here
						preparatory to the struggle for gubernatorial nominations to come off next
						week in their respective conventions. Gen. Geary has taken rooms at the
						Jones House where he has been stopping for several days. Mr. Ketchum is also
						in town, and Geo. W. Cass, a prominent competitor for the Democratic
						nomination, has taken rooms at the Brady House. Mr. Clymer, being a member
						of the Senate is here as a matter of course. The contest in both conventions
						promises to be quiet lively and interesting.</p>
					<p>On the Democratic side, Clymer's chance is decidedly the best, and I think he
						will be nominated on the second ballot. There will, however, be a vigorous
						effort made to defeat him, but I cannot see at present how it can be
						successful. He will receive from , fifty to fifty-five votes on the first
						ballot, and if he will be able to hold these his nomination will be assured.
						Cowan is spoken of as a probable compromise candidate, as is also General
						Meade, but the contingency in my judgement will not arise which would enable
						either of them to come in. You will know more about this, however, before
						your readers will have an opportunity of seeing this letter.</p>
					<p>As to the Republican Convention, it is likely to have a stormy time both on
						the candidate and the platform. The party of "great moral ideas" is in a
						great quandary now to know whether it would be best to hold on to the negro
						or make another effort to hold on to the "loaves and fishes." I have no
						doubt they would abandon the negro and "smother their convictions," if by so
						doing they could have any <emph rend="italic">assurance</emph> that they
						would be permitted, by "A. Johnson, Esq.," to retain the <emph rend="italic"
							>offices</emph>, buy on this point everything is doubt and uncertainty.
						They poor fellows will be compelled to grope their way in the dark as best
						they can. </p>
					<p>On the candidate they are equally in the dark. Up o the day that President
						Johnson vetoes the Freedmen's Bureau bill, Gen. Geary seemed to have
						everything his own way, but since then his star has been rapidly declining.
						Republican politicians have become extremely "<emph rend="italic"
						>scary</emph>" at renegade Democrats since Johnson gave them the "cold
						shoulder." It would surprise now to hear of Geary's defeat, and the
						nomination of either Ketchum or Mooorehead. It matters but little however
						who they nominate, as it is a mere matter of form. The Democracy are going
						to win next fall, by such a majority as has not been heard of in
						Pennsylvania for many years. This is "<emph rend="italic">our year</emph>." </p>

					<p>BY THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH LINE, Office at the Railroad Depot</p>
					<p>Democratic State Convention</p>
					<p>NOMINATION OF HON. HIESTER CLYMER.</p>
					<p>The Democratic State Conventions, met in the Hall of the House of
						Representatives, in Harrisburg, at 3 o'clock by Hon. William A. Wallace,
						Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee.</p>
					<p>A permanent organization was affected by the selection of Hon. Wm. Hopkins,
						as Chairman, and F. M. Hutchison, of Pittsburg, as Secretary, when the
						Convention adjourned to seven o'clock.</p>
					<p>At the re-assembling of the Convention, the Committee on Resolutions reported
						the following which was unanimously adopted:</p>
					<p>WHEREAS, the Democracy of Pennsylvania, in convention assembled recognizing a
						crisis in the affairs of the Republic and esteeming the immediate
						restoration of the Union paramount to all other issues, do</p>
					<p><emph rend="italic">Resolve 1st.</emph> That the States whereof the people
						were lately in rebellion, are integral parts of the Union, and are entitled
						to representation in Congress by men duly elected, who have true faith to
						the Constitution and laws, and in order to vindicate the maxim that taxation
						without representatives should be forthwith admitted, </p>
					<p>2d. That the faith of the Republic is pledged to the payment of the national
						pledged to the payment of the national debt, and Congress should pass all
						laws necessary for that purpose.</p>
					<p>3d. That we owe obedience to the Constitution of the United States, including
						the amendment prohibiting slavery, and under its provision will accord to
						those emanicipated all their rights of person and property.</p>
					<p>4th. That each State has the exclusive right to regulate the qualifications
						of its own citizens.</p>
					<p>5th. That the white race alone is entitled to the control of the Government
						of the Republic, and are unwilling to grant to negroes the right to vote.</p>
					<p>6th. That the bold enunciation of the principles of the Constitution and the
						policy of restoration contained in the recent annual and Freedmen's Bureau
						veto message of President Johnson, entitle him to the confidence and support
						of all who respect the Constitution and love their country.</p>
					<p>7th. That the nation owes to the brave men of our armies and navy a debt of
						lasting gratitude for their heroic services in defence of the Constitution
						and the Union; and that while we cherish with a tender affection the
						memories of the fallen, we pledge to their widows and orphans the nation's
						care and protection.</p>
					<p>8th. That we urge upon Congress the duty of equalizing he bounties of our
						soldiers and sailors.</p>
					<p>The Convention proceeded to nominate candidates for Governor when Gen. Geo.
						W. Cass, Hon. Hiester Clymer, Richard Vaux, Daniel M. Fox, John D. Stiles,
						Asa Packer, Charles Dennison, J. P. Jenks and Wm. A. Galbraith were placed
						in nomination.</p>
					<p>On motion, the nominations closed, and the Convention proceeded to ballot
						with the following results:</p>

					<p>A Committee was appointed to notify Mr. Clymer of the action of the
						Convention, soon appeared and addressed he Convention, in an able and
						eloquent speech, which was enthusiastically applauded, after which the
						Convention was addressed by Gen. G. W. Cass, Hon. Richard Vaux, and others.
						The best feeling prevailed and everything augurs well for the success of the
						nominee.</p>
