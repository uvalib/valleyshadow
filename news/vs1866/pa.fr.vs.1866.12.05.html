<b>Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In response to a Chicago Times article that contends Democrats should
                    simply accept black suffrage "in order to get rid of the negro question in
                    politics," the Spirit editor blasts the idea as sheer nonsense, and asserts that
                    such a decision would "inevitably result in the total disbandment of the
                    organization of the party."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Much sensation has been created in political circles during the past few
                        weeks by the publication, in the Chicago Times,
                        of an article advocating "impartial" or negro suffrage. The argument of the
                            Times goes on the assumption that negro
                        suffrage is inevitable, and therefore it would be wise policy in the
                        Democratic party, in order to get rid of the negro question in politics, to
                        take up the doctrine and make it hereafter a part of the Democratic creed.
                        In other words, in order to get rid of the negro question in politics, all
                        the Democratic party has to do is to adopt the doctrine of its opponents and
                        that does away with the question in dispute. On this principle we can
                        readily see how not only the negro question but all other questions which
                        have heretofore divided the two great political parties of the country could
                        be disposed of. But would that inure to the success of the Democratic party
                        as the Times contends? Certainly not. On the
                        contrary, it would inevitably result in the total disbandment of the
                        organization of the party; for there would be no reason or sense in keeping
                        up an organization after the distinctive principles and measure which gave
                        it vitality and life had been abandoned. </p>
                    <p>We are glad to note that the heresy of the Chicago
                        Times has been denounced in fitting terms, with great unanimity, by
                        the Democratic press of the country. This shows that the Democratic party is
                        still sound to the core on this great issue, notwithstanding the cowardly
                        conduct of a few craven-hearted poltroons like the Chicago Times. The great historic part of the country, which has
                        passed unscathed through so many fierce political contests, and battled so
                        long and nobly for constitutional principles, will not now strike its colors
                        and surrender to the enemy. There is nothing in its present condition to
                        warrant such a course. It is numerically stronger to-day than ever before,
                        taking into account the whole country. All it has
                        to do is to bide its time, remain true to the great principles which
                        underlie its organization, and before many years, when the "sober second
                        thought" of the people shall have resumed its sway, it will arise from amid
                        the gloom of temporary defeat, strengthened and invigorated by the fiery
                        ordeal through which it has passed.--It will again be the ruling power in
                        the nation. If it be true for itself, it must continue to live while free
                        government endures. Indeed, the one cannot long exist without the other. But
                        if it abandons principle at this crisis for the mere sake of temporary
                        expediency, it will go down beneath the tramp of the mailed hoof of
                        Radicalism in a common wreck, with the liberties of the country. </p>

                        before it. It will worship no false gods, and follow no false teachers,

                            Times that it could be made to endorse the odious doctrine of
                        negro suffrage and negro equality. It holds with the late lamented STEPHEN
                        A. DOUGLAS, "that this Government was made on the white basis by white men, for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever: and should be
                        administered by white men and NONE
                        OTHERS."--There the party has stood in the past, and there it will continue
                        to stand in the fuBut we have faith in the integrity of the Democratic

<b>The Late Election</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the article, the results of the last election demonstrate that

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The late elections clearly demonstrate the fact that a [UNCLEAR] was
                        [UNCLEAR] the multitude--the [UNCLEAR]. The Southern people become involved
                        in a war through the machinations of a few persons. It is so now in the
                        North: false prophets are misguiding the unsuspecting--political doctrines
                        and introduced calculated to bring ruin upon this country.--The people do
                        not think sufficiently for themselves regarding the issues of the day, they
                        blindly believe what is told them by a few rapacious and selfish
                        politicians, who have not the welfare of the nation at heart. Forney strikes
                        for Forney; Wilson strikes for Wilson; Sumner, for Summer, and so on. Look
                        at this picture--reflect what these men have accomplished--see the
                        devastation these evil spirits have created from city to city, from village
                        to village. Everywhere a [UNCLEAR] of sorrow can be found erected by these
                        individuals, and the result of their diabolical scheming. Is there a family
                        throughout the land that is not burdened with taxation to keep the negro
                        comfortable? Such constitutes the philanthropy of these Radical agitators.
                        Let the white man labor--let the negro go idle. But this state of things
                        cannot must not, last long. The people will
                        awaken to the enormity and danger of the terrible dogmas which are heralded
                        over country; a reaction will come--light will
                        take the place of darkness--a genial sun will again illume this distracted
                        land, and once more shed in God's providence, happiness and prosperity in
                        all its length and breadth, and throughout its borders.--"So [UNCLEAR]it
                        be."</p>

<b>The Advanced Position of the Radicals</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Radicals in Congress have proposed new legislation mandating the
                    approval of only three-quarters of the loyal states to ratify constitutional
                    amendments. If the measure is approved, says the article, a partisan Congress
                    will be able to "usurp all power, change the system from a republic to a
                    despotism and thus enslave the people."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The constitutional amendment having played its part in the drama of treason
                        and disunion, is now withdrawn, and a new failure introduced for the purpose
                        of continuing the agitation which is distracting and dividing the country.
                        This feature is, "that three-fourths of the loyal or adhering States are
                        sufficient for the ratification of the new constitutional amendment, and
                        that it is the duty of Congress to pass enabling acts under which the
                        communities that seceded from and fought to destroy the Union, and by their
                        failure to do so became thereby subjugated, may be organized for the purpose
                        of securing republican governments to such of their inhabitants as were true
                        to the Republic." The Press, in commending this
                        new movement to the party of which it is an organ, declares "that the remedy
                        proposed is equally simple, constitutional, and clear. The seceded States
                        themselves, even if their rights had not been destroyed in the downfall of
                        the rebellion, are estopped by the act of seccession, which, if it meant
                        anything, meant not only severance from the Union, but from all obligations
                        to it." </p>
                    <p>Now, to fully apprehend the infamy of such a proposition as that suggested,
                        it is only necessary to remember how this question of secession was treated
                        by the Radical party during the war. They denied that such a right existed,
                        and stigmatized those who maintained the opposite doctrine as traitors
                        deserving imprisonment, in the casements of Fort Delaware or death upon the
                        gallows. They claimed that the acts of the State Legislatures denying the
                        authority of the national government were null and void, and the ordinances
                        of secession not worth the paper on which they were inscribed.--The
                        Governors of the several Confederate States were denounced as usurpers, and
                        the State officials pronounced incapable of exercising any authority which
                        was blinding upon the people. In a word, the Radicals held and taught that
                        secession was a right nowhere to be found in the Constitution or our system
                        of government, and that as a matter of law and logic, the attempt on the
                        part of a portion of the States to exercise a right amounted to nothing.</p>
                    <p>This was the position of the Radical party during the war. When the rebellion
                        ceased, the different States composing the late Confederacy were called upon
                        to act with reference to the amendment to the Constitution abolishing
                        slavery. The acceptance or rejection of an amendment to the fundamental law
                        of the land is one of the most important functions of State sovereignty. If
                        a State is in a political condition to perform that act, it is certainly in
                        the Union for all other purposes. The Southern States voted upon that
                        amendment as States. They were named as States by Seward, the Secretary of
                        State, in declaring the amendment adopted and slavery abolished in the
                        United States, and the act was recognized by the executive, legislative and
                        judicial departments of the governmement, as well as by the people of the
                        nation. The Radical party then contended that the claim set up by certain
                        States that they had seceded from the Union did not establish the fact that
                        they had ever been out of the Union or lost their political identity--that
                        they were still States under the Federal compact, and therefore their votes
                        could be cast and were absolutely necessary to make up the constitutional
                        number required to engraft an amendment upon the Constitution of the nation.</p>
                    <p>If the votes of the Southern States were necessary to amend the Constitution
                        in the instance named, why not now? The idea that "three-fourths of the
                        loyal or adhering States" can change, alter or amend the organic law of the
                        land was not entertained at that time. All the States were recognized as in
                        the Union, and being in, the Constitution made it imperatively necessary
                        that their voice should be counted. And they were so enumerated. There has
                        been no change in the political condition of the States since that time to
                        take them out of the position in which they were placed by the official
                        action of the national authorities, nor has the Radical party declared that
                        the anti-slavery amendment was not legally adopted because certain bodies
                        not legally States voted for it. But now, when it is ascertained that
                        another amendment of a political character and intended to perpetuate the
                        power and influence of a sectional party, cannot be adopted if all the
                        States are recognized as being in the Union and their votes necessary to
                        make it a portion of the Constitution, the Radical faction changes front and
                        declares that "three-fourths of the loyal or adhering States" can alter the
                        charter of the people's liberties, anything in that instrument to the
                        contrary being overlooked and disregarded. This is a bold movement. If it is
                        consummated and carried out, all that a partisan Congress has to do in the
                        future is to propose an amendment to the Constitution, declare certain
                        States not in the Union, deprive them of their right to vote upon the
                        amendment, and thus revolutionize the government, usurp all power, change
                        the system from a republic to a despotism, and thus enslave the people.</p>
                    <p>This new, dangerous and unconstitutional mode of amending the fundamental law
                        of the land is to be followed by a bold usurpation of power on the part of
                        Congress. That body, representing only the "loyal or adhering States" is to
                        pass "enabling acts under which the communities that seceded from and fought
                        to destroy the Union, and in their failure to do so became thereby
                        subjugated, may be organized for the purpose of securing "republican
                        governments" to such of their inhabitants as were true to the Republic. In
                        other words, Congress is to invade the States, break up their government,
                        destroy their individuality, and reduce them to the condition of conquered
                        provinces, to be governed by laws passed by Congress and enforced by
                        authority from that body.--Where is the authority for such action as that
                        proposed? The Constitution does not confer it upon Congress. It is not a war
                        necessity, for the strife has ended. There is, truth, no warrant or
                        precedent for such a procedure, and if consummated it will be an act of
                        usurpation which should cost the actors in it their heads, and would do so
                        in any country where the laws were properly executed.</p>
                    <p>This advanced moment of the Radical party demonstrates the fact that they
                        mean to hold power by any agency which can possibly be used. The
                        Constitution and its safeguards will not cause a moment's pause in their
                        march of usurpation and aggression. Even the existence of the States
                        [UNCLEAR] recognized or ignored as that fact tells for or against the
                        success of party measures. The very foundations of a republican form of
                        Government are to be undermined as a means of securing the control of the
                        next presidential contest. In the meantime, the country is kept in a state
                        of constant agitation, and all its material interest suffer. The remedy for
                        this diseased condition of the politics of the nation is in a speedy return
                        to the wise, safe, and conservative teachings of the Constitution through
                        the Democratic party.--That instrument points out the true and only path in
                        national peace, State repose and individual prosperity, and those who attack
                        the Constitution are enemies to the best interest of the country. The fresh
                        attack upon the Constitution and the existence of the States mediated by the
                        Radicals is but a part of the scheme to destroy the Union, and it should be
                        resisted by all just and proper means.--Age</p>

                    <p>The forthcoming report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the national
                        finances has been completed and printed for distribution to the country on
                        the day of its presentation to Congress. The views which it will present
                        will not be new, in so far as a line of financial policy will be laid down
                        yet the resume  of facts and figures will show
                        the national financial situation to be in a much more flattering condition
                        than at the opening of the First Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress, or at
                        the close of the fiscal year on June 30, 1865. The coming report will show
                        that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1866, was one of great prosperity. The
                        balance of the Treasury on that day stood as follows: </p>

                            Excess of receipts
                            $37,691,857.36
                        
                    
                    <p>This excess of receipts all occurred during the last few months of the fiscal
                        year, and is not a fair criterion of the ability of the government to
                        liquidate its debt. For instance, the expenses for the quarter ending in
                        September 30, 1865 were $165,000,000; but during the quarter ending June 30,
                        1865, they were but $12,000,000. The balance in Treasury on June 30, 1865,
                        was but $858,609.15. The year ending December 31, 1865, showed a deficiency
                        in the Treasury of $619,000,000. But six months from the time (June 30,
                        1866) there was an excess of receipts over expenditures of nearly
                        $37,000,000. The estimates of the War Department for expenditures for the
                        coming fiscal year would be nearly $250,000,000 less than for the year 1865,
                        were it not for the Equalizing Bounty Bill, passed at the last session.</p>
                    <p>But the revenue from all sources for the next fiscal year is estimated by the
                        Secretary in the neighborhood of $600,000,000. The full expenditure for the
                        next fiscal year is estimated within $350,000 including interest on the
                        matured debt, and a fair sum over for a sinking fund.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary's report will also state that, under the law of Congress, the
                        Treasury has withdrawn from circulation during the past six months the limit
                        of ten millions of dollars of paper money. The total amount of United States
                        legal-tender notes in circulation is therefore $386,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The most important and gratifying fact of the report will be in the reduction
                        of the public debt. It will be shown that the public debt has been reduced
                        during the past twelve months nearly two hundred millions of dollars. The
                        actual figures of the reduction are $193,637,721.</p>
                    <p>Seven millions of compound interest notes (legal-tenders for their face) have
                        been cancelled, and the temporary loans reduced nine millions.</p>
                    <p>The full amount of currency authorized for national banks has been issued;
                        which, with the United States notes, gives a circulating medium of nearly
                        $700,000,000, not including the fractional currency. On the 1st of last
                        November, the total, including the fractional currency amounted to
                        $734,218,038.20, and $95,000,000 of authorized national bank notes remained
                        unissued.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of the Treasury will not present in this report what may be
                        called strictly a new plan for returning to specie payments. He has changed
                        none of the views which he maintained in his last report and which were
                        enunciated in the Fort Wayne speech. He believes that the Secretary of the
                        Treasury should have the power to control the currency to the extent of
                        being authorized, at his discretion, to sell bonds, bearing interest not
                        exceeding six per cent., and redeemable and payable at such periods as may
                        be conducive to the interests of the government for the purpose of retiring
                        all United States notes. He will ask Congress to authorize a long five per
                        cent. bond, it to be exempt from taxation in which to fund the obligations
                        that are soon to mature. He will lay great stress on the question of urging
                        Congress to adopt at an early day a fixed policy of
                            contraction, which, when adopted, will cause the business of the
                        country to gravitate to it, so that specie payments may be reached without a
                        great diminution in the revenues, or a wide-spread financial panic. He does
                        not propose to state any definite time for the resumption of specie
                        payments, but believes that with a proper system it can be attained with the
                        retirement of over two hundred millions of United States notes. </p>
                    <p>It will be shown (by the figures above given) by the Secretary, that the
                        government is on the high road of prosperity in reducing the national debt,
                        and the Treasury will cling to the simple and experienced policy of
                        liquidating the debt by keeping the national revenue above the national
                        expenditures. To this end, a draft of a bill prepared by Mr. Wells, the
                        Special Revenue Commissioner, will be submitted with the report, (or at some
                        future day) proposing equalization in internal taxation, and a modification
                        of the existing tariff. Important reference will also be made to the raw
                        cotton tax of 3 cents per pound, imposed last session.</p>
                    <p>In 1867 and 1868 $830,000,000 of seven-thirty notes fall due. A large amount
                        of the first series are now being funded in five-twenty bonds.</p>
                    <p>Improvements in the national banking system will be suggested and urged.</p>
