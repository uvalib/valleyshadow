                    occurred at Bull Run on July 18th. The article gives few details and assures
                    readers that the Confederate battery will "undoubtedly be taken tomorrow."</summary>

                <summary>The Spirit sharply criticizes the federal government for releasing
                    incorrect information about the battle at Manassas (Bull Run). The report, which
                    is printed in column four, portrays the battle as a rout of the Confederates.
                    However, the Spirit received a report on Monday night which stated that Gen.
                    McDowell had "met with more resistance than anticipated . . . and had fallen
                    back on Washington with the loss of his cannon and horrid slaughter of his
                    troops."</summary>
