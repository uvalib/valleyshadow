<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Defends the Democratic party as the true Union party in the North.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democratic party has ever maintained the proud position of being the
                        sincere friend of the Union. It has never expressed itself as being in favor
                        of "letting the Union slide." It possesses the same ardent devotion to the
                        Union to-day that it has ever exhibited, and is ready to pour out its best
                        blood in upholding that glorious Union. It is not now, or never, has been, a
                        Union party for the North, or a Union party for the South, but for the WHOLE
                        UNION. For the sake of the Union it has joined hands with its political
                        opponents, to enable the Government to put down rebellion, that the Union
                        may be restored; but in doing this it has not agreed to adopt the principles
                        of the Chicago platform by any means. The Democratic party draws a wide
                        distinction between supporting the Government and sustaining the corruptions
                        of the present Administration, and detests Republican principles now as
                        cordially as it ever did. It holds that the Chicago platform has broken up
                        the Union and that it cannot be restored or maintained by standing on that
                        rickety concern. Let the Democratic party maintain its organization
                        everywhere--stand by the Union--condemn the abominabe [sic] doctrine of
                        Secession, and while upholding the Government in the War, fearlessly condemn
                        the corruptions of the present Administration and its attempts to trample on
                        the Constitution and the rights of the people.</p>

<b>A Republican Member . . .</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that some Republicans are advocating the abolition of slavery in

                    of action.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"A Republican Member of Congress presented a bill
                        before that body, a few days ago, asking to have slavery abolished in all
                        territory in Virginia now taken in possession by the Federal troops. Of
                        course, it is laid by for the present. Such acts as this in the halls of
                        Congress will not help the cause of the Union, but do much to weaken it.
                        This is not the time to talk about abolishing slavery, in or out of
                        Congress. All abolitionists ought to have a halter slipped around their
                        necks the moment they open their mouths on the subject of abolishing slavery
                        anywhere at this critical moment. They have the Government to sustain and
                        the Union to reconstruct which should be done at all hazards.</p>

<b>Peace Resolutions</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit reprints the text of the resolutions presented to the House of
                    Representatives by Congressman Cox of Ohio. Mr. Cox proposed that Congress
                    appoint a commission made up of seven Northerners who would meet with a similar
                    commission appointed by the Confederate Congress. These men would confer and
                    attempt to "bring about a reconstruction of the national unity." The resolution
                    was not approved.<br>
