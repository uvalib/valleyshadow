</blockquote>
<b>More Secession Masked Batteries Erected Near Alexandria</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Confederates have one or two masked batteries near Springfield station.
                    In addition, the troops' pay has been delayed because regimental officers were
                    unable to get their rolls into shape. This problem has been straightened out, so
                    the regiments should soon receive their pay.<br>

<b>From Washington</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Miscellaneous war news from Washington. Senator Andrew Johnson made a
                    speech in which he "eloquently combatted Secession as a heresy, destructive of
                    the Government, which should be effectually crushed out. The war now in
                    progress, he contended, was not of the North against the South, but as conducted
                    by the Government for the perpetuation of the Union, the maintenance of the
                    Constitution and the enforcement of the laws, made in pursuance of that

</blockquote>
<b>From Fortress Monroe</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

                    "little knot of traitors in this city" who have begun holding peace meetings.
                    These provide aid to the enemy. The Journal castigates the Mercury for calling
                    peace advocates "traitors" and states that the right to peaceably assemble and
                    fight government tyranny is in no way traitorous.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Newark Mercury and Newark Journal</blockquote>
<b>Kentucky and the Union</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mr. Crittenden defined his position on the present conflict during his
                    campaign for Congress. He stated that he wanted the war to end, but he didn't
                    want a war of subjugation. Instead, the South should present its demands to
                    Congress and Congress should attempt to redress the Southern grievances. He
                    declared himself loyal to the Constitution, not to Lincoln.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Lieut. Tyler, U.S.A., who was arrested a night or two since for uttering
                    sentiments at variance with the popular feeling of the country on the war
                    question and handed over to the military authorities, has taken the oath of
                    allegiance at the Brooklyn Navy Yard."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Peace Movement in Connecticut</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After a peace resolution was introduced in the Iowa legislature, a
                    virtually identical bill was proposed in the Connecticut legislature. The
                    resolution states that they are opposed to the war and want hostilities to end.<br>

<b>What Can be Done for the Country</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit is "warmly in favor of adjusting our troubles by other means
                    than the sword." They agree with Mr. Crittenden's recent statements.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The "Subjugation" of Maryland</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit claims that it is impossible to listen to the Maryland
                    secessionists without "mingled feelings of contempt and indignation. Their
                    everlasting whining about the 'subjugation' of their State is the poorest
                    exhibition of manhood that ever has come under our observation." Maryland wasn't
                    really subjugated, as the secessionists claim, because the federal government
                    had the right to send its troops through the state on their way to Washington.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Three Months [sic] Soldiers</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The period of enrollment for the three-month volunteers will expire in
                    about two weeks. The Spirit fears that their poor treatment and their dislike of
                    their officers will cause many of the volunteers to not re-enlist.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>War News</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A Spirit correspondent visited Williamsport and Hagerstown and found
                    "everything pertaining to the army at a dead lock. Everybody seemed to be
                    waiting for something to turn up but nobody could tell when or where a move
                    would be made."<br>

<b>Reserve Corps</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

                    in the right place. We know him to be a good German scholar, a first-rate
                    printer, a sound Democrat and an honest man."<br>

<b>Judicial Conferees</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
