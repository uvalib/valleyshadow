<b>Emancipation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The New York World expresses its disagreement with the Independent, which
                    advocates the adoption of a policy of abolitionism. The World believes that "a

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Independent of this week is brimfull of
                        pestilent abolitionism. The most objectionable part of it, to be sure, is in
                        articles written by correspondents, but the prominence assigned them in the
                        make-up of the paper, and the strong leaning in the same direction in its
                        editorial columns, justify us in attributing to the Independent a deliberate purpose to make itself a vehicle of
                        abolition sentiments. It allows Dr. Cheever to expatiate on "the
                        irretrievable mischief produced by the Northern Government and
                        Administration in refusing to direct the war against slavery," and on the
                        infinite importance of immediately striking that blow against slavery, and
                        which will retrieve our affairs and our reputation, and save us from the
                        dreadful disaster," etc. It gives space to a long article by Charles L.
                        Brace, entitled "The Key to Victory," which opens with the inquiry, "Why
                        will not we people see that the only key to victory is a Proclamation of emancipation."</p>
                    <p>It is plain to people of practical sense that a proclamation of emancipation
                        would have no other effect than to weaken and brake [sic] down the
                        Administration. If it should be stupid and foolhardy enough to venture in
                        this experiment it would not only stultify itself by contradicting all the
                        professions it has heretofore made that the war is to be waged for the
                        attainment of none but constitutional objects, but it would totally divide
                        the North, and render powerless all the friends of the Union in the rebel
                        states when the time shall come for its re-construction. But Mr. Brace sees
                        so little need of the cooperation of loyal slaveholders in restoring the
                        Union, that he admits that his plan would result in blotting them from the
                        face of the earth. He winds up his article as follows:</p>
                    <p>The slaveholding class in such a contest would inevitably
                            be almost exterminated, and if any class of men ever deserved punishment
                            from the Almighty for countless wrongs done to the innocent and the
                            weak, it is they. The non-slaveholding class would, no doubt,
                        after a while see the utter uselessness and folly of resistance and settle
                        down under what, for a time, will probably be a military rule.</p>
                    <p>This is not the method we should any of us have chosen for emancipation. But
                        Providence has forced it upon us. We must choose between that and defeat.</p>
                    <p>Instead of being shut up to choose between a proclamation of emancipation and
                        defeat, such a proclamation would bring sure and irretrievable defeat from
                        the day on which it was promulgated. Two-thirds of the army would refuse to
                        march another step or serve another day in such a crusade. Men would no
                        longer enlist, (except a few abolitionists,) capitalists would no longer
                        furnish means for prosecuting a war; and we should immediately have a
                        powerful revolutionary party at the North as well as at the South. It would
                        plunge the country into general anarchy, and destroy the hopes of the Union
                        forever.</p>
                    <p>But would such a proclamation emancipate the slaves? Pray, how would it ever
                        reach them? Who is to carry copies of the proclamation to the plantation and
                        distribute them there? If the agents of distribution go, singly or in small
                        squads, they will swing from the next tree. If it is carried by armies, it
                        cannot reach the slaves until the opposing armies have first been conquered.
                        But how can it be the means of victory if it can take place only after
                        victory has been achieved?</p>
                    <p>It would not be strange if the enemies of Secretary Seward and the
                        administration should infer his sympathy with this reckless abolitionism
                        from the fact that along side of it he orders the publication of the aws
                        [sic] of the United States. Independent journals of large circulation,
                        however, are not dwindled to government organs because the Government finds
                        it profitable to advertise in their columns, and President Lincoln and
                        Congress have left the cavilers no excuse for supposing that any authority
                        exists for such utterances or any sympathy with the sentiments which the
                            Independent advocates, except among
                        Abolitionists and the most radical of Republicans.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are a few unscrupulous papers published in the North that so far forget
                        their own honor, and the interest of the country, as to insist that the
                        North is full of secessionists. The Chicago Times
                        says of this class of treasonable papers:--"We believe that they desire and
                        design to give aid and comfort to the Southern Confederacy, by causing the
                        rebels to believe that they have a large number of influential friends at
                        the North. What other design can they have? Certainly the traitors will
                        fight with more energy against a divided than against a united North. This
                        is so plain a fact that the journals which assert that there is a submission
                        'party' in the loyal States must understand it, and therefore by publishing
                        falsehoods intend to encourage the enemies of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>The newspapers we refer to continually harp upon the theme that there is a
                        'party' dangerous in designs and formidable in numbers, who are determined
                        to dishonor she [sic] Republic by submission to the Southern traitors. The
                        result is, that the South believes that we are divided in sentiment as to
                        the conduct of the war--that we are losing what little sympathy lingers in
                        the hearts of foreign powers for the United States, and that our own people
                        are kept in a state of agitation which seriously interferes with their
                        business and conduces to inaugurate scenes of panic and violence.</p>
                    <p>We repeat it, it is the worst of crimes to deceive the people. Men and
                        newspapers who do it deserve the severest reprehension of the Government as
                        disturbers of the public peace and as friends of the enemy."</p>

                    has decided not to hold the Annual Fair this year because the troops that were
                    stationed at the Fair Grounds so destroyed the property that it has become unfit
                    for use. The directors asked the leading businessmen of Chambersburg to
                    contribute to a fund to improve the grounds, but their request was "responded to
                    so illiberally that the Directors feel no encouragement in undertaking the usual
                    responsibility attending the holding of the Annual Fair."<br>(Names in announcement:  W.S. Everett)</blockquote>
