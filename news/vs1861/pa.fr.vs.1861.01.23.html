<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A Meeting of the Citizens of Franklin County will be held in the Court
                        House, in this place, on Friday evening, 29th inst., to consider the project
                        of constructing a Railroad from Chambersburg to connect with the Pittsburg
                        and Connellsville road. Mr. J. B. McIlroy, Civil Engineer, will be present
                        and address the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The importance of having a connection by Railroad with the Great West cannot
                        well be over-estimated, and it is with sincere satisfaction that we notice
                        this effort now being made towards the accomplishment of this highly
                        desirable object. We do not deem it necessary to repeat all the arguments we
                        have from time to time advanced in favor of this road--we have already
                        presented them in every shape to enlist inquiry and secure co-operation.
                        There is too much indifference manufactured by our citizens in this great
                        enterprise. We are the parties that will be most benefitted and we should
                        show, if we do not subscribe a dollar, that we properly estimate the great
                        and permanent benefits which must result from the completion of this road.
                        It is not too late to repair our past negligence. This meeting may give a
                        fresh start to the project that may result in much good. The farmers along
                        the line have taken hold of the matter with much earnestness, and they now
                        appeal to the citizens of the towns for active co-operation.</p>
                    <p>Fortunate will it be for Chambersburg when that day arrives that this great
                        avenue to wealth will be opened up for its benefit. There is not an
                        individual in the community to whom it will not bring immense personal
                        advantages.</p>
                    <p>We are not asked at this time to subscribe a dollar. Let us attend the
                        meeting, one and all, and learn all we can about the prospects of
                        constructing the road. Let us by our presence at the meeting show that we
                        feel some interest in the progress and prosperity of our town, and that our
                        hearts are in the work and it will afford some encouragement to others to
                        lend us a helping hand.</p>
