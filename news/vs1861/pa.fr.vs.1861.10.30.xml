                <transcript>
                    <p>A glance along the line of the army shows one of the most remarkable views
                        which the world has ever presented.--In the history of civil wars
                        heretofore, and in general in the history of wars between nation and nation,
                        the contest has been confined to one or two prominent points at a time, and
                        the lines of armies have been extended but a few miles. In America we seem
                        to do everything on a grand scale, so that in our very civil wars we present
                        the picture of perhaps a more extended array of hostile lines than the world
                        has hitherto witnessed.</p>
                    <p>Beginning at Fortress Monroe, says the <emph rend="italic">Journal of
                            Commerce</emph>, and passing thence to Annapolis, Baltimore, Washington
                        and westward, we find the vast hosts of the Northern and Middle States,
                        numbered by hundreds of thousands, stretching their camps along the Potomac
                        or occupying the most important strategical positions between the ocean and
                        the mountains. West of the mountains the Union forces are pressing downward
                        into Virginia, clearing Kentucky of the enemy, driving the hordes of General
                        Price southward into Arkansas, and preparing for the great advance down the
                        Mississippi. Thus from Kansas to the ocean every State, almost every county,
                        is occupied by one or the other of the two forces now striving for the
                        supremacy or overthrow of the Union. The line of war is more than a thousand
                        miles, and the men that are on it, or thronging toward it, arms in hand,
                        will soon be nearly a million. This stupendous display of force may well be
                        compared with the greatest wars which history has recorded. Nor is the
                        subject matter of dispute one of any less grandeur than the magnitude of the
                        array. Perhaps no war was ever entered upon by nations, in which the stake
                        was so great or demanding such outlays of treasure and blood. It is no
                        diplomatic quarrel, no dispute over the prices of goods, nor even the
                        succession on a throne of a line of kings. But the question is whether a
                        nation shall continue to exist, first among the nations of the earth, or
                        shall be henceforth two, or ten, or thirty petty provinces. It is no
                        question of dynasty. The noblest struggles of European armies have been upon
                        family rights to reign, seldom upon questions of national existence. But
                        this is for the life of a people.</p>
                    <p>For eighty years the name of the United States of America has been on the
                        roll of nations. During that time it has assumed a steadily increasing
                        importance. Feeble at first, and not recognized as having a voice among the
                        great powers, it has become strong, its fleets sailing on every sea, its
                        citizens the equal of princes in every land, and its voice has been as loud
                        and effective in decreeing the destinies of the world as the voice of any
                        nation, however ancient.</p>
                    <p>The proposition is to blot the name out of the roll, and let the world go on!</p>
                    <p>It is humiliating to our pride to reflect that the world would go on. We have
                        not been omnipotent, though we have boasted our invincibiity. We have not
                        been so important to the equilibrium of power, though we have laughed at the
                        thought of calamity, and believe ourselves immortal.</p>
                    <p>But this is no ordinary crisis in the history of a nation, and the question
                        which is now discussed along this line of a thousand miles is one whose
                        decision will cover many pages of the world's history to be read a thousand
                        years hence. It will not be mere history of the battles; but the results
                        will be felt for ages. If the country be stricken down, in the splendor of
                        her strength, the world's history will change thenceforth. If the Union be
                        sustained, the future of the nation will be from strength to strength.--Let
                        men then confine their thoughts to this one issue, the only issue, in the
                        war. Setting aside for the time all minor considerations, let them
                        deliberate on the question how to save the American Union for ourselves and
                        our prosperity. In the magnitude of this issue, the slight reverses which we
                        may meet with from time to time--the slight successes which we may here and
                        there achieve, will cease to excite us to undue regret or rejoicing, while
                        we look to the grand end to be accomplised [sic] by the great armies of the
                        Union.</p>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt>"Emancipation as the means of subduing rebellion is sheer humbug."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Notwithstanding Congress solemnly resolved that the war was not waged for
                        emancipation, the Abolition press of the country is determined that
                        emancipation shall be declared by the Government, and is persistently
                        agitating to accomplish this purpose. It is confidently argued that a
                        proclamation declaring the freedom of the slaves would materially assist in
                        putting down rebellion and restoring the Union. So on this point that they
                        seem to have nothing stands in the way of the complete success of our armies
                        but the hesitation of the Government to abolish slavery by proclamation. The
                        virtue they attach to these literary projectiles is as great as the
                        confidence of a Mexican General in the same sort of warlike missile. The
                        theory upon which their longing for a proclamation of emancipation is based
                        is, that the Union needs the co-operation of all its friends to crush out
                        rebellion; that the slaves are all for the Union--and therefore should be
                        liberated and taught to fight against their rebel masters.</p>
                    <p>This sounds very pretty--but like the old receipt for cooking a fish, which
                        had the important preliminary instruction, to first catch the fish--the
                        great difficulty is to first catch the negro before proceeding to confer
                        upon him the blessings of freedom. Gen. Fremont tried the virtue of a
                        proclamation of emancipation in Missouri. Was it followed by favorable
                        consequences to the Union cause? Let the series of disasters in that State,
                        closing with Lexington, answer. It certainly produced little good impression
                        upon the negroes, and worked considerable mischief to the Union cause in
                        Missouri and Kentucky. No set of men were better pleased with the original
                        proclamation than the Secessionists in these States--it was grist to their
                        mill. As far as the slaves were affected, it was a dead letter.</p>
                    <p>A proclamation of emancipation by the President would not be worth the paper
                        on which it is written in assisting our armies to victory. It is necessary
                        to whip the rebel armies before we can reach the slaves--and after we do
                        whip their armies the supposed necessity for arming their slaves would no
                        longer exist. Emancipation as the means of subduing rebellion is sheer
                        humbug. The South was never as secure against the danger of slave
                        insurrections as it is at this time, when the white population is in arms.
                        If the slaves were ever so much disposed to rise they could make no headway
                        so long as every rifle, and sword, and shot gun, and every ounce of
                        ammunition in the South, is in the possession of their masters.
                        Proclamations could not reach them, much less the implements to a successful
                        rising.</p>
                    <p>The whole agitation of this subject is a practical absurdity, as irrational
                        as all the theories of the crazy Abolitionists. But they are never easy
                        unless plotting some sort of mischief.--Happily the Government turns a deaf
                        ear to their outcries. We have no idea that the policy of emancipation will
                        be attempted--and have therefore confined ourselves to exposing its utter
                        folly and absurdity as a means of suppressing rebellion.</p>

                    <p>The Night Police appointed by the Town Council have been on duty for several
                        weeks past and have established order and quiet in our borough to an extent
                        never enjoyed before. So well have our municipal laws been enforced against
                        all disturbers of the peace, and so thoroughly have order and good
                        government been established that the Council find they can dispense with the
                        services of four of the watchmen. The reduction in the number of watchmen
                        was made at a late meeting of Council and thus the expenses of the borough
                        curtailed. When the Night Police was first placed on duty our town was
                        nightly the scene of tumultuous proceedings that were fast bringing the good
                        name of our ancient borough into deep disgrace. The torch of the incendiary,
                        too, had been lighted and a general uneasiness was felt by our citizens for
                        the safety of their property. Under these circumstances the Council very
                        wisely concluded to appoint a sufficient police force to guard the town, and
                        all good citizens approved their action. A competent head was placed over
                        the police and trusty men selected for the subordinate positions. A system
                        of signals was established and all other necessary regulations adopted for
                        the thorough organization of the force, which entered upon its duties
                        determined rigidly to enforce the laws and free the town from all sources of
                        danger and disorder. They have accomplished their work well and thoroughly
                        and our citizens cannot but feel grateful to the Council for the prompt and
                        judicious measures taken to preserve the good name, and protect the
                        property, of our town.</p>

                    <p>A. N. RANKIN, Esq., has disposed of the <emph rend="italic">Repository
                            &amp; Transcript</emph> establishment to SNIVELY STRICKLER, Esq. The
                        latter will take charge of the paper as sole proprietor and editor on the
                        1st of November. Mr. STRICKLER has the ability to make the paper all his
                        party can desire, and in all his dealings with the public, we can say for
                        him, he will be found liberal and honorable.--With the retiring editor we
                        part with many regrets. If we now and then found it <emph rend="italic"
                            >necessary</emph> or <emph rend="italic">convenient</emph> to indulge in
                        no very amiable spats, editors very well understand what these things mean,
                        and never "nurse their wrath to keep it warm" against each other. Mr. RANKIN
                        retires from the printing business on account of ill health. We hope he may
                        hereafter find health of of body, peace of mind, and "a pocket full of
                        rocks" in some position in life less vexations than that of pubishing a
                        newspaper. We must do Mr. RANKIN the justice to say that he has labored
                        faithfully for the good of his party and that under his control its organ in
                        this county has well sustained its former high reputation.</p>
