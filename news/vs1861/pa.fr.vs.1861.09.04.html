<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Easton Argus, in noticing the mob that
                        destroyed the Sentinel office, at that place,
                        remarks as follows:</p>
                    <p>It is gratifying to know that all well disposed citizens condemn the riot
                        that disgraced our town in the beginning of last week. After reason has
                        resumed her away over the pubic mind, our people begin to see how dangerous
                        it is to invoke the spirit of mob law in redress of real or fancied
                        grievances. Nothing can excuse such proceedings as we witnessed here.--They
                        are disgraceful alike to these engaged in them, those who countenance them
                        and the community in which they are tolerated. This is a land of laws, to
                        which the publishers of public journals are amenable, the same as all other
                        individuals. If they commit any wrong they can be reached in a legal way.
                        There is a remedy provided by law, for the punishment of every offense in
                        the catalogue of crime and no man is justifiable in taking the law into his
                        own hands or encouraging others to do so. The man who either directly or
                        indirectly sustains mob law, is an enemy to the cause of the Union and a foe
                        to public order. We are carrying on a war to crush the violators of law in
                        the South. If we follow their bad example and set all laws at defiance, at
                        our own doors, in what respect are we better than they? We are now engaged
                        in a war to establish the authority of the violated laws, and it is
                        therefore an inconsistency as well as a shameful precedent, for citizens of
                        the loyal States to adopt the violent practises [sic] of the rebels, which
                        in the one case can be no more justifiable than in the other and which all
                        loyal citizens condemn. In alluding to the late mobs in New England the
                        Boston Post well says:</p>
                    <p>"These repeated riots are sowing the seeds of anarchy destined to destroy all
                        the rights which raise an intelligent man above the savage--a Christian
                        community above a barbarous one, and a civilized state above a congregation
                        of freebooters. No matter what is the provocation, the violations of law in
                        trampling upon the rights of person and property are alarming indications of
                        the sway of unbridled passion, and the substitution of everything dreadful
                        in the madness of revenge for that justice which the observance of law and
                        order only can secure. People of N. England, beware! You are placing your
                        feet upon dangerous ground."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>BY REV. WM. M. CORNELL</p>
                    <p>Take one of your city young ladies,--give her the highest moral and
                        intellectual culture,--let her excel in every study now taught in our
                        schools; add to this, loveliness of disposition, amiability of temper,
                        gracefulness of motion,--make her all that we admire in a young woman, so
                        far as mind and heart
                        are connected, and then let her be so far diseased that she can perform no
                        active duty, and what does her intellectual and moral improvement avail
                        towards earning an independent and honorable livelihood? Just nothing. She
                        cannot do house-work, for she has not bodily strength. She cannot write, for
                        her hand trembles.--She cannot read aloud, for it fatigues her, and makes
                        her hoarse. She cannot teach,--that in which above all others females
                        excel,--for it makes her head ache, and sends her home to bed. What is she
                        good for? take one of these well educated young
                        ladies, such as we often see around us: she is fit for nothing but to be the
                        crooked-spined, debilitated, nervous, fidgety thing that she is. Why? The
                        first, and most important step in her education has been neglected.</p>
                    <p>The fact that young ladies, educated as too many of them have been, are
                        utterly unqualified to gain a livelihood, for want of proper physical
                        culture, is one which meets us at every step. Parents are inexcusable for
                        ever becoming parents until they have made themselves acquainted with the
                        laws of health--the laws of our Creator which are fixed and unchangeable.</p>
                    <p>If in the education of females, they were properly instructed in the laws of
                        their system, and judiciously trained to observe these laws, what a noble
                        result would follow? How many children who now die at an early age, would
                        live to grow up! How many nervous invalids would be cheerful and happy! How
                        much suffering would be avoided! How much money saved! How much life better
                        enjoyed!</p>
                    <p>But these are not all of the benefits that would spring from such a physical
                        education as might and ought to be given to our youth. The greatest benefit,
                        the richest boon from such a training would be found in the increasing stamina, the more vigorous constitutions of the
                        present generation; and let this proper system of physical training be
                        continued for a few generations, and the more than fabled "golden age" of
                        the world would return, and we should have a race of men and women such as
                        God intended should bless the world.</p>
                    <p>The most deplorable effect of neglected female physical condition, is seen
                        when such girls enter the family relation; when they become mothers. They are wholly unable to sustain the
                        duties and responsibilities that devolve upon them.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt but that by an improved education, and more enlarged views
                        of the laws of health, and obedience to them, the average duration of human
                        life might be increased to seventy years; as it has, during the last two
                        centuries, increased from an average duration of eighteen, to forty-five
                        years. If life is worth anything, is not this worth thinking of? Will it not
                        more than repay all the labors of the physician, the teacher, the parent,
                        the journalist? The mortality from disease has diminished more than twenty
                        per cent. within the last half century. Is not this worth naming? The man
                        who says that we have labored in vain in hygienic measures to benefit our
                        race, is a miserable economist, and void of common sense, or common
                    honesty.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There seems to be a systematic effort on the part of some unscrupulous
                        persons to circulate slanders in regard to the good people of Orrstown. To
                        believe their stories Orrstown is a perfect hot-bed of treason, and the
                        inhabitants, in and around it, a set of 'rebels,' 'traitors' 'secessionists'
                        and everything else that it vile! To accuse one's neighbors of disloyalty to
                        their country, and of being such vile characters, would, once upon a time,
                        have been looked upon as very unChristian-like conduct, to say nothing of
                        punishing the slanderers as the law provides, but in this LINCOLN era the
                        largest liberty may be taken with men's characters, persons and property,
                        and there is no redress, nor dare you raise a finger or utter a word against
                        it. We know the people of Orrstown to be as loyal as any in the State, and
                        will give more substantial aid to the Government, in all Constitutional
                        means that it may adopt to restore the Union, than those who are denouncing
                        them as traitors. There are no people in the land more patriotic than the
                        inhabitants of Orrstown, and their political enemies cannot intimidate them
                        or drive them from their loyalty by slandering them. What is the mighty
                        offence that Orrstown has committed that it must be thus ostracized? A few
                        copies of the N.Y. Day Book are taken there! What
                        a heinous offence!! Was it a thousand copies of the New York Tribune, the paper that has made all the mischief
                        in the country, it would all be right. Orrstown would then be considered a
                        very loyal place. It might get up a John Brown rebellion on its own hook
                        without damaging its character in the least, in the estimation of a single
                        Republican paper in the country.</p>
                    <p>It is high time that these would-be Unionists cease their slanders about
                        their neighbors. Do they wish to make the South believe that the North is
                        full of secessionists? They won't go to war themselves and they think they
                        must be doing something to keep up a show that they are very efficient in
                        the cause of the Union. They think there is less risk in calling Democrats
                        "traitors," than fighting the real traitors of the South, and they
                        accordingly pitch in, behind our backs, on all convenient occasions. The
                        result is that the Democratic party are getting about tired of it. There is
                        no better way in the world to divide and distract the North than these
                        constant efforts to slander the Democracy and place it in a wrong position.
                        If any are really guilty, or even suspected, of treason and secession
                        sympathies let the charge be made in the proper form and let them at once be
                        arrested. How much more honorable this would be than to encourage mobs by
                        cowardly inuendoes [sic] made behind one's back. So far as the Democracy of
                        Orrstown, and every other part of the county, are concerned they will not
                        yield to any one in the country in their devotion to the Union, the
                        Constitution and the enforcement of the Laws. But when it comes to bearing
                        patiently the abominations of our State Administration, they are incapable;
                        when they see distractions and dissensions in and out of the Cabinet,
                        paralyzing the bravery of our soldiers and squandering the means of the
                        people, they will "talk out." When our brave and enthusiastic army is forced
                        against an overwhelming foe to almost certain defeat by men who, as Douglas
                        said, hope to accomplish Disunion by means of war, they protest. If
                        Democrats were to say half the hard things that are said by members of the
                        Cabinet, we would feel disposed to look suspiciously upon them ourselves;
                        but there certainly can be no treason or secession sympathy in denouncing
                        misdeeds and incompetency on the one hand, or defending the reputation and
                        ability of men like Gen. Scott, whose whole life and every act and deed has
                        proven them incapable of treachery on the other.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party will stand by the Government in the pending contest with
                        the rebels of the South, and will not be driven from their position by all
                        the abuse that can be heaped upon them. The Republicans had much better turn
                        their attention to the real Secessionists than to be constantly charging the
                        Democrats with treason and thereby breeding dissensions and paralyzing the
                        Union sentiment among the people of the North.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. EDITOR:--I am a plain man and not much used to writing, but still I can
                        give my brother Democrats a bit of advice that will be of use to them if
                        they will pay attention to it. And my advice to them is to stay away from "the office of McLellan &amp;
                        McClure." I mean of course so far as politics or political movements
                        are concerned. McLellan &amp; McClure's office is a good enough place to
                        go to on law business, but it is the worst place in Chambersburg to go to
                        for politics. I need not go into an argument to prove this, as all my fellow
                        Democrats in the county know that that office has for years been the very
                        place where every plan has been laid to overthrow the Democratic party of
                        old Franklin. Any Democrat who will go there for political advice now, will
                        be an out-and-out Black Republican in twelve months, if the Black Republican
                        party can catch green or rotten Democrats enough to keep it alive that long.</p>
                    <p>This new "Union" affair is just another Know Nothing trick. The Know Nothing
                        leaders pretended that there was need of a new party, and they bamboozled a
                        good many Democrats into joining them. And what kind of a party did it turn
                        out to be? It disgraced everybody that belonged to it. It broke up the good
                        old Whig party and would have broken up the Democratic party too if the
                        great body of Democrats had not held off from it. But that plan to destroy
                        the Democratic party did not succeed, and now our old opponents are trying
                        at other. They want to get up a patriotic Union party! Well, let any
                        Democrat join them who thinks he can't be a Democrat and a lover of the
                        Union at the same time. But I think the tricky politicians who meet at
                        McLellan &amp; McClure's office will find out that the Democrats of this
                        county are too patriotic and too good Union men to give up the old
                        Constitution and Union Jackson Democracy and join the Union-breaking Black
                        Republicans.</p>

                    <p>We notice considerable repairing and improving of the Roman Catholic Church
                        edifice, in this place. The building is now surmounted by a handsome cupola,
                        and a new roof of slate has the place of the old shingle roof. This week it
                        is intended to commence the removal of the old pews and erect new ones,
                        leaving a middle and side aisles. The exterior is to be repainted and made
                        more attractive. A new bell of splendid tone will be suspended in the Cupola
                        (it will be raised to its position, this afternoon, (Tuesday) at 2 clock.
                        These alterations and additions have been made under the direction of Rev.
                        Father McKee, pastor of the church and a Committee consisting of Messrs.

                        will cost about $1000.</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday evening last a white girl named Caroline Toms, from Adams county
                        we believe, but who has resided in this place for a few months, gave birth
                        to a child and deposited the body in the vault of a Privy at the residence
                        where she was hired. Information of the occurrence was laid before the

                        over it. The medical examination determined that the child though fully
                        matured had never breathed. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the girl
                        on the charge of fornication and bastardy and concealing the birth of a
