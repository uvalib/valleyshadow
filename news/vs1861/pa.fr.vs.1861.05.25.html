                    to the Union as any people in the State. I must not omit to mention that
                    Chambersburg has a history in connection with the later stages of the slavery
                    excitement, that her citizens rarely allude to. It is said that here the
                    notorious John Brown first saw the light, while it is certain that he made it
                    the rendezvous of his conspirators previous to their attack upon Harper's
                    Ferry."<br>

                    the true metal and express in admirable terms, the sentiments of the Democracy
                    all over the country." In the resolutions, they vow to oppose both secessionists
                    and abolitionists while vigorously supporting President Lincoln in his battle to

                    and the Republicans "are now found among the foremost in defense of the
