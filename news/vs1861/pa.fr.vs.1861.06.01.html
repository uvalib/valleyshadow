<b>Important from Fort Monroe</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A force of 2,500 federal troops made an entrenched camp near the mouth of
                    the James River near Fortress Monroe. About 100 slaves arrived in the camp, were
                    given rations and put to work. Col. Butler met with the President to ask what he
                    should do with the fugitive slaves. He was told that the government endorses his
                    policy of protecting them and putting them to work.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Important News from Western Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The rebel troops have evacuated parts of Western Virginia and Union troops
                    have moved in. Gen. McClellan issued a proclamation stating that his troops came
                    as friends, that the property of the local residents would be protected, and
                    that "no interference would be made with their slaves; but on the contrary, any
                    attempt at insurrection would be crushed with iron hand."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>From Washington</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Secession forces have thrown up earthworks of perhaps two hundred feet
                    square at Manassas Gap Junction, and commanding the track for perhaps a mile.
                    They are under the command of Gen. Bonham of South Carolina."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Miscellaneous News from the Capital</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Union navy has changed its signals, since the Southerners know the old
                    signals. Gen. Walbridge urged the government to sign up four or five hundred
                    thousand men into the army. "This demonstration, it is thought, will make the
                    war a bloodless one, and establish the military character of the nation abroad,
                    as well as overcome treason at home."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Affairs at Alexandria and its Vicinity</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Secretary of War made application for large quantities of the rolling
                    stock of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad for use on the Orange and Alexandria
                    road. The Union army will probably first attempt to seize Manassas Gap Junction,
                    which is a highly important position on the Richmond Road. "The citizens [of
                    Northern Virginia] appear to submit to the new occupation with a sort of sullen
                    can't help myself feeling; they stand around in small squads, but appear
                    desirous of avoiding the military."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Sad Condition of the Troops at Lancaster</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The poor conditions in Camp Johnson, where the 14th and 15th Pennsylvania
                    Regiments are quartered, have utterly demoralized the troops. The commissariat
                    serves the volunteers rancid meat and an insufficient amount of bread.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"The people of Missouri have been assured that the President will not
                    require that State to take sides in the present conflict. No aggressions will be
                    made on the rights or property of her people."<br>

                        Fever, on Wednesday night last. His remains were sent home to his friends.
                        On Thursday night two deaths from the same disease occured in the Hospital.
                        There are no new cases of this desease now among the soldiers at this post.
                        Two of the cases were among the troops that have just arrived and the

<b>Shame!</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"The 4th and 5th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers are familiarly known
                    in Washington as the ragged Militia. Is this right? or is it a burning shame on
                    those who should have taken pride in putting them into the field in a condition
                    at least equal to those from New England and New York. Are the homes of men who

                    a total of fifteen will be here and then will march on Harper's Ferry. "They
                    will make short work at that point; but we still hope that the rebels will see
                    how wrong they are acting, lay down their arms and swear fidelity to the
                    Constitution and the Union, and not provoke the slaughter that must surely
                    follow if they attempt resistance."<br>

</blockquote>
<b>"A Strong Smell of Thieves"</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Republican papers don't appear to be surprised that Mr. Purviance
                    resigned as Attorney General. They knew he was an honest man, and no honest man
                    "can long stand the strong smell of thieves that fairly poisons the atmosphere
                    around Gov. Curtin." The Spirit believes that the Republicans made a mistake
                    when they nominated Curtin, who is hopelessly corrupt.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Position of England</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit believes that the British government's position vis-a-vis the
                    Confederate States is correct. Its recognition of the Confederate States as a
                    belligerent merely means that it will take no part in the struggle.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>Choice Language</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit has found a "choice morsel" from a paper published in Boston and
                    New York by a group of black and white men. The quote states that "If freedom
                    can only prevail through the agency of vengeance, so be it; if the Temple of
                    Liberty can stand securely on the corpses of slaveholders, so be it . . ." The
                    Spirit believes that the black publishers are taking advantage of the present
                    turmoil of the country, and that the liberty to express such statements will be
                    curtailed.<br>

                    with the aid of the government, this "important opening through Maryland into
