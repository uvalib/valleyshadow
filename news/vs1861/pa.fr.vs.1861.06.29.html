<b>The War! From Washington</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A sentiment exists amongst Northern visitors to Washington that the federal
                    government should seek a compromise. It is rumored that Lincoln holds a similar
                    belief. Gen. Scott, while training the volunteers for battle, "is not disposed
                    to strike a decisive blow until after the meeting of Congress."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Interesting News from the Virginia Line</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A Maryland secessionist recently arrived in Frederick from Winchester
                    reports that the main body of the rebel army that had been at Harper's Ferry is
                    stationed at the Fair Grounds at Winchester.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Western Virginia Convention</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>Guerilla War in Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Parties who have come in to-night from the interior counties [of
                    Virginia], represent them to be in a state of guerilla war. Great anxiety is
                    felt here [in Wheeling]. Effectual means should be taken to rid the State of the
                    scoundrels who now disturb its peace."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>From Fortress Monroe</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The gun boat Monticello made a reconnaissance trip up the Rappahanock river
                    and landed a small party at the home of a friend of the pilot. While the sailors
                    conversed with the ladies, three companies of rebels rushed into the party and
                    shot two men. The Captain of the Monticello opened fire on the rebels and killed
                    or wounded a large number. The house was completely demolished.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Southern News</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Louisville Journal printed a letter stating that voters in the first
                    congressional district were asked whether they were for the North or the South.
                    A friend of Mr. Crittenden denies that Crittenden would offer a compromise or
                    advise Kentucky to secede.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Interesting Army Intelligence from the Upper Potomac</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Intelligence has arrived in Hagerstown indicating that Gov. Wise has
                    decided to go by steamer to Lewisburg, Greenbrier county with a force of 4,000
                    men to repel an expedition.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Later from Grafton--Anticipated Attack on the Federal Troops at Philippi</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paymasters of the army are paying off the regiments in the Washington
                    area. The President will not call for any compromise in his speech at the
                    opening of the extra session of Congress. Instead, the administration will
                    continue to follow the policies set out in the inaugural address.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Correspondence N.Y. Herald</blockquote>
<b>From Harper's Ferry</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Confederate troops returned to Harper's Ferry to recommence their
                    destruction. They set fire to the bridge over the Shenandoah and threw a
                    railroad locomotive into the water. When townspeople saw the troops coming, they
                    ran into the river and attempted to swim or wade to Maryland. The Confederates
                    arrested a number of prominent Unionists.<br>

<b>The War</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper has little war news because nothing is happening in the field. It
                    appears that Gen. Scott will not make a move until after Congress meets. The
                    President has no power to increase the regular army or enroll volunteers for
                    three years, so Scott will not enter the field until he knows what Congress will
                    do about the volunteers. The South appears ready to accept a compromise as long
                    as it can back down with grace. The Spirit doesn't want the South to receive an
                    offer that is dishonorable to the country. Instead, the secessionists should be
                    made an example of in order to prove a warning to the abolitionists. "Let both
                    be made to understand that they cannot trample upon the Constitution, and
                    disturb the peace of the country, whenever they feel disposed to ventilate their
                    peculiar ideas or exercise their bad propensities."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Baltimore</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Major General Banks arrested the Baltimore Chief of Police because he
                    protected men who resisted the laws of Maryland.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Cameron vs. Curtin</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Pennsylvania volunteers are barefoot and more or less naked because of
                    the shoddy clothing provided to them by Gov. Curtin. Curtin's followers have
                    gotten rich as a result of their state contracts to provide clothing for the
                    army.<br>

                    paper will go out of business.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>An Unfounded Rumor</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Confederacy is increasingly determined to prosecute the war. There is
                    no evidence that Davis wants an armistice.<br>

                    that Jefferson Davis had attempted to suspend the hostilities.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Frank H. Pierpont</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Frank Pierpont has just been elected Governor of Virginia. He took a firm
                    stand in defense of the government at the first outbreak of secession. He was a
                    member of the first Wheeling Convention and opposed the effort to organize a
                    provisional government.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Daniel Paisley</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Daniel Paisley is the new Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. At the first
                    Wheeling Convention, he proposed the policy of declaring Virginia state offices
                    vacant because all who held them were treasonous.<br>

<b>Election in Kentucky</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>All the Kentucky Congressional districts, with the exception of the First,
                    elected Union supporters.<br>

<b>Ben McCulloh</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Ben McCulloh, who is frequently referred to as a man of military renown,
                    never, except on one occasion, commanded more than a company of men. He is a man
                    of undoubted courage, but he isn't a soldier.<br>

                    of our officers in Alexandria.'"<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Unflattering description of the contractors in front of the office of the
                    Secretary of War. Many of them are from "some rural village of the Keystone

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is rumored that the Administration is about to appoint Henry Winer Davis
                    to the Austrian Mission. Davis was defeated in his run for Congress from
                    Baltimore. The Spirit believes that "appointing discarded politicians to foreign
                    missions is at best doubtful--but no greater insult could be offered to the
                    Union men of Baltimore than to commission Henry Winter Davis."<br>

                    restoration of Peace. . . . But for the unfortunate troubles now surrounding our
                    country, we ought to have most prosperous times. The country had recovered from
                    the reverses of 1757 [sic] and was ready to enter upon a career of unexampled
                    prosperity. With the establishment of a just and honorable peace, prosperity

                    believes that many Union men have been impressed into the rebel army. He
                    believes that the soldiers cannot compare in stature with the Union soldiers
