                <summary>Text of speech given by Gen. Butler. In it, he stated that, while he loved
                    his state, "we love the Union and the country with an equal devotion. We put no
                    State rights, no State pride, no love of the old Commonwealth of Massachusetts
                    before, above and beyond our love to the Union."</summary>
