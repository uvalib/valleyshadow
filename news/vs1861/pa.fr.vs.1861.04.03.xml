                    <p>Ever since the adoption, by the last General Conference of the Methodist
                        Episcopal Church, of a new chapter in their discipline on the slavery
                        question much dissatisfaction with and opposition to the chapter, has
                        existed in the Baltimore and East Baltimore Annual Conferences, among the
                        members and ministers of the church. These two conferences which have
                        recently closed their labors, the one at Staunton, Va., and the other at
                        this place, have each taken very decided action on this troublesome subject.
                        The East Baltimore Conference disposed of the subject by repudiating the
                        chapter, declaring it unconstitutional, and of no binding effect upon the
                        Church, demanding its repeal by the next General conference, and the leaving
                        of the slavery question to be disposed of by those Annual Conferences where
                        the institution exists, and in case its demand is not acceded to by that
                        body at its next session, that then its connection with the Northern portion
                        of the Church will be severed.</p>
                    <p>The Baltimore Conference, by its action, assumes an independent attitude
                        towards the Northern portion of the Church, declares the offensive chapter a
                        nullity, demands its removal from the discipline by the General Conference,
                        and the leaving of the slavery question to the adjustment of the Annual
                        Conferences, where the institution exists, and bases their return to the
                        connection upon a compliance with these conditions.</p>
                    <p>The following are the resolutions adopted by the East Baltimore Conference,
                        the ayes and noes were ordered on the question of their adoption with the
                        following results--ayes 165, noes 9:--</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, the late General Conference, by the adoption of the new chapter on
                        Slavery, has given serious offense to a large number of our members upon the
                        Border, disturbing the peace of our Societies and tending to the disruption
                        of the Church: therefore,</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That in the judgement of the East
                        Baltimore Conference, the substitution of the <emph rend="italic">new</emph>
                        for the <emph rend="italic">old</emph> chapter on Slavery, was an
                        unnecessary and injurious change, and it ought, therefore, to be repealed.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That there can be no administration
                        under said new chapter in this Conference.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we respectfully ask the several
                        Annual Conferences, at their ensuing sessions, with a view to the harmony of
                        the whole Church, to give their assent to the following: That the next Gen.
                        Conference be, and is hereby requested to repeal the chapter on Slavery,
                        and, instead, thereof, empower each Annual Conference, within whose bounds
                        Slavery exists, to make such regulations upon this subject as in their
                        judgement may best subserve the interests of the Redeemer's Kingdom among
                        them.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the Bishops be, and are hereby
                        requested to submit the above resolutions to the several Annual Conferences
                        for their concurrence.</p>
                    <p>The Western Virginia Conference at its late annual session at Wheeling
                        adopted the following preamble and resolutions on the subject:--</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Whereas</emph>, The General Conference at its late
                        session at Buffalo has inserted a new chapter in our Book of Discipline on
                        the subject of slavery; and whereas, there exists some difference of opinion
                        as to its meaning; and whereas uniformity in administration and harmony
                        among ourselves are very desirable: Therefore,</p>
                    <p>1. <emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we deeply regret the action of
                        the General Conference changing the chapter on slavery, we regarding such
                        action as unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>2. <emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That in our judgement, as a
                        Conference, the new chapter is not to be regarded as law; that no
                        administrative or judicial action can be had under it against any member or
                        minister; and that we are left under it to be governed by the Scriptures,
                        amenable as individuals for our administration only to God and our Annual
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>3. <emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we utterly condemn any attempt,
                        in any way whatever, to interfere with the legal relations of master and
                        servant, and that we will seek to promote, as did our fathers, their best
                        interests by preaching to them the unsearchable riches of Christ, and by
                        teaching them their reciprocal duties as taught in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                    <p>The Philadelphia Conference, which concluded its labors on Saturday last,
                        adopted the following resolution in reference to the subject of the New
                        Chapter on slavery. The vote on the adoption of the resolution relating to
                        the action of the East Baltimore Conference stood as follows:--yeas 174,
                        nays 135.</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, It is indispensably necessary for allaying the excitement and
                        restoring peace and harmony in the Southern borders of our Conference, that
                        the new Chapter on Slavery inserted in our Discipline by the last General
                        Conference be repealed, and that the Annual Conference be left to make their
                        own regulations on this subject, therefore,</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we concur in the resolutions of the
                        East Baltimore Conference, requesting the General Conference, at its next

                        we are gratified to learn is liberally patronized. No man is better
                        qualified to give instructions in the Art of Fencing than Maj. Hershberger,
                        and there is in exercise that young men can engage in so harmless and so
                        conducive to health as that of Fencing. Fencing is considered a gentlemanly
                        accomplishment while boxing is looked upon as brutal. As our Gymnasium has
                        proved a failure there is no better place for our young men to spend an hour
                        of healthful recreation than in Mr. Hershberger's Fencing Class. Apply at
                        the Armory of the Chambers Artillery.</p>

                    <p>--We are pleased to announce to our readers that Morrison's Grand Pan-tec-na-
                        thec-a, one of the largest and most splendid exhibitions in the world, will
                        visit this place and exhibit at Franklin Hall, for four nights, commencing
                        Monday, April 8th.</p>
                    <p>We copy the following description of this exhibition from the New York
                        papers. It will be seen that the attractions offered surpass anything ever
                        yet brought to Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>This Great Exhibition consists of five splendid Panoramas, painted in a new
                        and novel style with Dioramic effect on a scale of magnificence never before
                        attempted. They present to view as distinctly and plainly as though one
                        stood on the spot represented the following scenes:</p>
                    <p>The City of Washington--the Capitol, with the new Dome and Marble
                        Extension--the inside of the Capitol--the new Senate Chamber, with its
                        gorgeous decorations--the Hall of Representatives--the Public Buildings of
                        Washington--the Patient Office--the U. S. Treasury--The Smithsonian
                        Institute--The President's House and Grounds--and the famous East Room in
                        the President's House where all the Levees are held--showing all its
                        furniture, marble mantles, magnificent mirrors, and glittering chandeliers,
                        even to the colors and pattern of the two thousand dollar carpet that covers
                        the floor.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Then come five splendid views of Niagara
                        Falls</emph>--showing them in every aspect in summer and winter--the Lake of
                        a Thousand Isles on the River St. Lawrence--the Hudson River--and the entire
                        scenery of the White Mountains, from the snow covered Dome of Mount
                        Washington to the old man of the Mountain-- magnificent scenes in New
                        England, Virginia, Minnesota, and California, with three beautiful views in
                        Mammoth Cave--showing the great Gothic or Arched Gallery-- Echo River--Lake
                        Lethe and the Fairy Grotto with its Starry Dome, magnificent columns and
                        limpid waters, making the scene on great resplendency of Gem-Work. Blazing
                        Carbuncies, Rubies and Molten Gold. <emph rend="italic">But the Great
                            Feature in this Exhibition</emph> is the Voyage across the Atlantic
                        Ocean from New York to Liverpool with Storm at Sea, in which all the
                        incidents of a three thousand miles travel on the water are presented to
                        view, with a distinctness and vividness mocking reality, and leading the
                        spectators to believe themselves on the briny deep.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">The Great Phenomenon of the Moon Rising from the
                        Sea</emph>, is to be witnessed by all, while in the Storm at Sea all the
                        elements in their majesty are to be seen and heard with such startling
                        reality as to cause old men to shiver and the young children to cling closer
                        to their parents.</p>
                    <p>Arriving at Liverpool we have a view of that city--then a splendid view of
                        the great City of London--with the River Thames and Bridges--the New Houses
                        of Parliament, St. Paul's Church, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Leaving London, the beautiful scenery of the River Rhine is presented to
                        view-- the Swiss Alps--Scenery in Italy--Ruins of Pompeii--the whole
                        exhibition concluding with a grand view of the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius,
                        as it appeared in the year '79 when it destroyed the cities of Herculaneum
                        and Pompeii.</p>
                    <p>This Magnificent Entertainment was first exhibited in London for 280
                        consecutive nights, was visited by more than half a million of people. It
                        has recently been brought to America, and exhibited in the New England
                        States, where it has been visited by admiring thousands.</p>
                    <p>The Exhibition will be shown in this place precisely the same as in Loudon,
                        and all who visit it are guaranteed two hours of amazement, wonderment and
                        delight.</p>
