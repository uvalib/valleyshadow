                        professions and occupations--whether Merchants, Hotel-keepers, Mechanics or
                        otherwise--to close their respective stores, houses, shops or offices on
                        that day. We cannot doubt that this will be cheerfully done by all.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Monday afternoon two gentlemen--solid looking farmers--arrived in Camp
                        Curtin, who sought an interview with the officer of the day, and informed
                        him that they were in search of a girl who had strayed away. The officer
                        thought a military camp a queer place to hunt for stray girls, especially as
                        it reflected on the virtue and dignity of the men at arms, nevertheless the
                        gentlemen were at liberty to make search. As the old song says, 'they hunted
                        her high and they hunted her low,' but they did <emph rend="italic"
                        >not</emph> hunt her 'when a year passed away,' for lo! in less than an hour
                        she was found on guard doing duty as a sentinel, in the uniform of Capt.
                        Kuhn's company of Sumner Rifles, of Carlisle--We do not know what name she
                        enlisted under to protect the honor of her country's flag, but her real name
                        is Sophia Cryder, and her residence only about a mile from this city. She
                        had been in Capt. Kuhn's company a week, is a plump lass of only sixteen
                        years of age, and had so completely unsexed herself that she could safely
                        bid defiance to any one not acquainted with her to detect her. How she
                        shirked an examination, which is said to be made with great strictness by
                        the medical men of Camp Curtin, we are not informed.</p>
                    <p>She is represented as a girl of unblemished reputation, and did not, as
                        generally happens in such cases, enlist to be near the object of her
                        affections, but merely in a wild spirit of adventure. It does not speak well
                        for the modesty of Miss Sophia, however, to say, that she was in the habit
                        of accompanying the men on their excursions to the river to bathe; but she
                        may have done this to ward off suspicion especially as she took precious
                        good care to keep out of the water herself. This is the first case of the
                        kind that has been brought to light, but we are informed that the most
                        reckless dare-devil attached to the Seventh regiment of the three month's
                        volunteers was a woman--<emph rend="italic">the mother of four
                        children</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Miss Cryder was taken home, where she can reflect over what she did not
                            see--<emph rend="italic">Harrisburg Patriot</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The girl above mentioned, previous to joining Capt Kuhn's company, was in the
                        employ of a gentleman in this place, as hostler, alleging that she had been
                        several years in the employ of the Messrs. Ahl, at Newville, as a teamster,
                        but her sex being discovered she was promptly discharged from his service,
                        after which she was picked up by one of Capt. K's men and enlisted. Her
                        friends lie near this place and not near Harrisburg, as stated above.</p>
                    <p>P. S.--The girl above alluded to was brought to jail on Sunday last, charged
                        with setting fire to the barn of Mr. George Kuhns, at Plainfield, with whom
                        she resided. It is supposed she fired the barn as a revenge for interfering
                        with her course of conduct. The barn was entirely destroyed.--<emph
