<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a few days the time for holding the annual election will be here. It comes
                        this year on Tuesday, Oct. 8th. Remember the day and be prepared to do your
                        duty to your country and your party. Matters of great importance for the
                        present and the future will be decided on that day. The acts and doings of
                        the State Administration will be endorsed or condemned. The flag of the good
                        old Union-loving Democratic party will be thrown to the breeze in triumph;
                        or will continue to trail in the dust. If it trails, sectionalism,
                        Abolitionism and fanaticism will triumph.</p>
                    <p>Fellow Democrats, the issue is upon you. It must be met, and should be met in
                        a spirit of exalted patriotism and devotion to country; whilst you have
                        given men and money without stint, to put down and rebuke the sectionalism
                        of the South, rise in the majesty of your power and rebuke at the ballot box
                        the sectionalism of the North.</p>
                    <p>The issue is forced upon you, to decide in favor of Democracy or of Sectional
                        Black Republicanism and Abolitionism.</p>
                    <p>The cry of "no party," is one of the most flimsy devices of the enemy, to
                        gull the people, whilst this and other similar schemes are continually
                        prated around by the Republican party; they are at this very time more
                        intensely and uncompromisingly partizan than they have every been in the
                        past. And in the very face of these unblushing protestations of 'Union' and
                        'no party,' they have offered and are now most industriously laboring and
                        planning by all means in their power for the election of a ticket composed
                        entirely of partizans of the strictest sect, whose greatest recommendation
                        is their devotion to Republicanism--their opposition to Democratic men and
                        measures.</p>
                    <p>Is there anything in the nominees of that party to induce Democrats to
                        support them? Is there anything in their principles or the acts of their
                        State or National Administration, that entitles them to a preference over
                        Democratic candidates?</p>
                    <p>We most unhesitatingly say there is not. We present to you a ticket of which
                        any party should be proud. Men well known to you, and we believe very
                        favorable know. Men eminently qualified for the positions for which they are
                        offered. Men of ability and character, and the foulest enemy dare not
                        dispute it. Men whose lives have been devoted to the good of the country and
                        for the supremacy of the laws--men, in whose hands the interests of the
                        people will be safe.</p>
