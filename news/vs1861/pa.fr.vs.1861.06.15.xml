                <excerpt>"Some of the nigger worshipping papers are calling upon the Administration
                    to put arms in the hands of the slaves and let them butcher their masters and
                    their families. None but cowardly Abolitionists would entertain such a thought
                    as that. These fellows being too timid to engage in the struggle, and fearful
                    that they will be called upon, are anxious to change the aspect of the contest
                    so that their safety will be sure. They would sit, and calmly look on, upon the
                    horrible disasters that would result from such a course as they propose, with a
                    grin of satisfaction, fully contented so long as they were sure that their own
                    worthless bodies were out of harm's way."</excerpt>
