<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The federal government's "programme of the military campaign" is being
                    developed. The army will not move forward or in an offensive manner until the
                    troops are better trained. The Administration will try the "slow but sure
                    process of exhausting the rebels by the delays and privations which always
                    destroy a weaker power."<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Another spy was arrested in Cairo, Illinois. The Army is blockading the
                    Mississippi near Cairo. However, they are very worried because a very strategic
                    point, named Bird Point, Kentucky, is controlled by the secessionists. They
                    could attack Cairo and thus make it difficult for the North to control the
                    river.<br>

<b>President Lincoln Visits the Rebels</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>President Lincoln made a reconnoitering trip around Washington, including a
                    visit to Great Falls. He crossed the Potomac and passed the pickets on the
                    Virginia side. They didn't capture him, however, since they "did not know so
                    valuable a one was within their grasp." A separate report states that the
                    Confederate Congress has decided to move the capital of the Confederacy to

                    different Southern ports and is engaged in selecting men of energy. . . adapted
                    to fulfill the important functions confided to them. The duties will be
                    collected in the decks of men-of-war, whatever may be the opinion of legal
                    authorities here or elsewhere on the subject."<br>

                    breaking into the Sutler's Shop--an 'institution' at Camp Slifer which seems to
                    be in bad odor with the men."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Horses Stolen</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    Chambersburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Movements of Southern Troops</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Nine hundred Confederate troops appear to have moved from Harper's Ferry to
                    Williamsport, Md., presumably to seize flour stored in the homes there. The
                    Spirit doesn't understand why the 7th Regiment isn't moved to protect the
                    property of the Williamsport residents.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>McClure Rifles</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The members of the McClure Rifles took a vote on re-enlisting for three
                    years. One half the company seceded. Capt. Reilly, the commander, "is quite
                    sanguine that he will have his ranks filled up with good and true men in the
                    course of a few days."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Quiet Sunday</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The previous Sunday had "the appearance of one of our old fashioned Days of
                    Rest." The Spirit hopes that Sundays continue to be calm and holy days. "We
                    cannot chime in with the belief that being a soldier releases a man--a
                    Christian--from his moral obligation to 'remember the Sabbath day and keep it
                    holy.'"<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Governor in Town</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gov. Curtin arrived in Chambersburg last Saturday on the 11 o'clock train.
                    He reviewed the troops and returned to Harrisburg in the evening. Although his
                    reception was polite, it was hardly enthusiastic. The Spirit is not surprised at
                    this, since "it could hardly be expected that our soldiers would have heart
                    enough to cheer, dressed up in the degrading uniforms provided for them by the
                    Head of State."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Arrested</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Judge Mason, a prominent Maryland citizen, was arrested in Chambersburg on
                    suspicion of being a secessionist. He was arrested by General Williams and
                    released by Judge Chambers, who knows Judge Mason. The Spirit believes that
                    spies should be dealt with "as the law provides."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Pennsylvania Volunteers</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since there has been some confusion in understanding the manner in which
                    Pennsylvania volunteers were mustered into the Army, the Spirit explains the
                    process that occurred.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Union and Disunion</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Enumerates the reasons that South Carolina ratified the Constitution and
                    argues that "every one of the reasons here enumerated holds good at the present
                    day."<br>
