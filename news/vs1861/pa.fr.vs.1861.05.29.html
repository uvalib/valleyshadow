<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A detachment of Col. Corcoran's regiment seized a train of railroad cars
                    that contained three hundred passengers. It is difficult for journalists to
                    determine the particulars of the seizure because the government refuses to let
                    civilians cross over into Virginia. The paper complains that "This role is
                    applied to the members of the press with peculiar severity."<br>

</blockquote>
<b>Stoppage of Another Albany Bank</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The National Bank of Albany has decided to close. "Their circulation is

                    and trampled on it. When he was coming down, he ran into the owner of the house,
                    who shot him. Another Zouave promptly killed Ellsworth's killer.<br>
</blockquote>

                    federal troops in the fort attempt to prevent the Confederates from seizing

<b>Peculations in Pennsylvania Army Supplies</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A U.S. Grand Jury has opened an investigation into the "evident peculations
                    perpetrated in furnishing the army supplies in Pennsylvania." The Spirit worries
                    that the poor supplies and food have so demoralized the three-month recruits

                    voted for a Union candidate to the state convention three months ago. Frederick
                    County also voted for secession.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In Virginia, some of the secession leaders appealed to General Butler to
                    return runaway slaves to their owners under the provisions of the fugitive slave
                    law. The runaways have been hiding behind federal lines in hopes that they could
                    achieve their freedom. General Butler "replied in characteristic style, at the
                    same time putting the fugitives to work in the camp."<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Inspector General of Kentucky informed the legislature that it would

                    million and sixty thousand dollars to arm the state.<br>

<b>Newspaper Postage</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit states that the Times is "writhing under the shower of
                    indignation it has brought down upon itself" because of its article on postage
                    for semi-weekly papers.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Rights and Duties</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Sun states that citizens of Maryland live under the Constitution of the
                    U.S. and thus have a duty to support the Constitution and obey the laws.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Baltimore Sun</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>The following article "seems to us to be a very correct exposition of
                    the rights and the duties of citizens of the United States." While every man has
                    the right to express dissent, every man also "owes certain duties to the
                    government which he cannot escape."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Robbed and Disgraced</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is clear to the Spirit that the state of Pennsylvania is being robbed
                    and its volunteers treated badly. The volunteers are often poorly dressed and
                    poorly equipped.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Capt. Campbell's Artillery</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The incompetence of state officials may destroy Captain Campbell's fine
                    artillery. The government never made a requisition to the state of Pennsylvania
                    for artillery and there was thus no authority for recruiting this company.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Arrival of Troops</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>On Tuesday morning the members of the 2nd and 3rd Regiments from Camp Scott
                    arrived unexpectedly at the Depot. Companies A and B of the 2nd are from
                    Chambersburg and Company C is from the county. The men look well and believe
                    that they are on their way to Hancock, Maryland for possible action at Harper's
                    Ferry.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Sickness Among the Soldiers</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit states that the rumors that an unusual amount of sickness exists
                    at Camp Slifer are untrue. Only about thirty men have been on the sick list at
                    any one time, not very great for a camp of three thousand.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Lying Dispatches</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit states that the rumors put out by a man named Samuel J. Rhea
                    that say that the residents of the Cumberland Valley fear an invasion are false.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Samuel A. Purviance, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, has tendered his
                    resignation. The Spirit believes that this is a bad sign for the administration
                    because Mr. Purviance "was, in fact, considered the only honest man that Curtin
                    had about him."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Army Correspondence--Letter from Camp Scott</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter from J.S.K. In it, he states that the men are spoiling for a fight,
                    so much so that they hung Jefferson Davis in effigy and buried him in a mock
                    funeral.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Letter from Camp Curtin</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter from G.W.M. His battery arrived in Harrisburg and is headed for
                    Chambersburg. He wonders whether it is true that camp fever prevails at Camp
                    Slifer and whether there will be an invasion of the Cumberland Valley.<br>(Names in announcement:  Dave Chambers)</blockquote>
<b>The State Supplies for the Volunteers</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>

<b>Collapse of the American Union</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes both the North and the South for fighting a civil war, which
                    hasn't been seen in Europe since the "dark ages of history." Neither North nor
