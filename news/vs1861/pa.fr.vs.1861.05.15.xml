                <summary>The Spirit responds to an inquiry from the Charleston Mercury as to where
                    the Northern friends of the South have gone. The Spirit states that they are
                    where they have always been--"on the platform of Southern rights, the
                    Constitution, and the Union." They blame the Southern secessionists for
                    abandoning the North and going beyond the Constitution and the Union to defend
                    their rights. "The Northern Democracy have no share in the responsibility, but
                    they are unanimously taking a hand in the work of preserving the Union."</summary>

                <summary>The Bank of Chambersburg paid its stockholders a dividend of four percent.
                    The Spirit believes that the stockholders are "blessed," especially since
                    Railroad stock and state bonds have paid so poorly. They point out that the
                    Democratic Party was once considered hostile to banks. Now, they claim that the
                    Party is only hostile to corrupt and fraudulent banks.</summary>

                <summary>Union soldiers captured General Frost's brigade of Missouri militia. Before
                    the surrendered troops marched back to St. Louis, a disturbance broke out
                    between U.S. volunteers and a crowd that included many women and children. The
                    crowd threw several rocks at the soldiers and fired a few pistol shots. When
                    Capt. Blanlawsky was shot, he gave the order to fire, which was obeyed. More
                    than twenty persons, including two women and several children, were killed. "The
                    unfortunate occurrence has produced an intense excitement in the city. Large
                    bodies of men are thronging the streets."</summary>
