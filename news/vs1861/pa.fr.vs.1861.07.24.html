<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Briefly reports that the first major engagement in eastern Virginia
                    occurred at Bull Run on July 18th. The article gives few details and assures

<b>The War News</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit sharply criticizes the federal government for releasing
                    incorrect information about the battle at Manassas (Bull Run). The report, which
                    is printed in column four, portrays the battle as a rout of the Confederates.
                    However, the Spirit received a report on Monday night which stated that Gen.
                    McDowell had "met with more resistance than anticipated . . . and had fallen
                    back on Washington with the loss of his cannon and horrid slaughter of his
                    troops."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Rally for the Union</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Vows that the defeat at Manassas has not conquered the North and promises
                    that "the masses are ready by thousands and tens of thousands to rally and fill
                    up the broken and diminished ranks of the army." Encourages Pennsylvania to
                    rally to the Union cause.<br>

<b>General Tyler</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reminds readers that General Tyler, who led the Division of the Union army
                    in the battle at Bull Run, is the same man who managed the reconstruction of the
                    Cumberland Valley Railroad a few years ago.<br>

<b>Let the Democracy Stand by the Flag of the Union and by their Own Flag</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Says that the Democrats with a clear conscience participate in the fight to
                    save the Union, but it is only for the Union's sake that they should fight,
                    having no interest in abolition and no other common interest with the
                    Republicans.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Falsehood Nailed</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit takes exception to a malicious article printed in the
                    Chambersburg Dispatch regarding the loyalties of the Spirit and the Democratic
                    party.<br>

<b>The American Eagle</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Responds to a Shippensburg report of an eagle sighting near McCray's Mill.
                    The Spirit alleges that the eagles sighted were Mr. Christian Eagle and his son
                    and that the person who reported the sighting was playing a pun on the editor.<br>(Names in announcement:  Christian Eagle)</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>Terrible Defeat of the Federal Army</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A despatch from July 22 states that earlier reports of a Union victory at
