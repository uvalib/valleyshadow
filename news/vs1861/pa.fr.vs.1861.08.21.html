<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Nothing could be more fortunate for the cause of the Union as involved in the
                        current war, than the enactment of the confiscation bill now before
                        Congress. As sent back to the Senate from the House, it seems to amount to a
                        scheme for taking any and every man's negroes from him, who choose to fancy
                        to be turned loose upon society. Or, in other words, to a virtual
                        proclamation on the part of the Government that the end and aim of the war
                        is to abolish slavery throughout the South.</p>
                    <p>So far as the hope of ending the contest speedily and at a reasonable
                        pecuniary cost, is concerned, the enactment of such a law, will be eminently
                        disastrous in its effect upon the Union cause. Were Congress to vote the
                        oligarchy a hundred thousand soldiers, and raise, equip, and provision them
                        for a year, the latter would not be as much strengthened for a prolonged
                        contest, as by making the bill in question, law.</p>
                    <p>More than half the population of the South stand ready to side actively and
                        earnestly against the oligarchy, so soon as the United States cripple their
                        power by military means. Had we won the battle at Bull's Run instead of
                        losing it, not one in ten of the people of Fairfax, Loudon, Jefferson,
                        Frederick and Hampshire counties who failed to follow the oligarchic army,
                        would have adhered twenty four hours afterwards to the "Southern
                        Confederacy." With this bill a law, however, the effect will be to unite the
                        most of the South as one man against the cause of Union, as being in reality
                        a mere cover for a war for the extermination of slavery from the United
                        States; and to engender throughout the North wide spread and embarrassing
                        opposition to its prosecution with energy likely to bring it speedily to a
                        triumphant issue.</p>
                    <p>We sustain the cause of the Government with heart and soul, as being the
                        cause of the restoration of the Union; and there are millions on millions of
                        the most reliable supporters of the Government's war policy, who, with us,
                        deprecate a resort on its (the Government's) part to unmistakable
                        revolutionary means to checkmate the oligarchy, as heartily as they
                        deprecate the revolutionary means to which the oligarchy have resorted to
                        compass the revolutionary ends at which they aim.</p>
                    <p>While we do not pretend to look to the Constitution and laws as they now
                        exist, to furnish the means through which alone the Union may be restored,
                        in the name of the millions of non-sympathizers with abolitionism now
                        sustaining the Government with might and main, we protest earnestly against
                        the unnecessary apparent entire change of the purpose and character of the
                        war, that bids fair to be involved in the enactment of the bill in question,
                        as amended in the House.</p>
                    <p>The Government may get volunteers without limit as to numbers, and money
                        without stint, with which to fight for the restoration of the Union--but not
                        apparently to work out the mere purposes of abolitionism.--Washington Star.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a strong effort being made by a few men, in this place, who had
                        assumed the lead of the Douglas wing of the Democratic party, to keep up
                        division in the party, and in case they cannot succeed in that to go over to
                        the Republicans and take all they can with them. They will signally fail in
                        both these under-hand movements. The party has only to be told of their
                        designs to eschew both them and their treachery. The Democratic party is no
                        longer divided and as to any portion of the sound Democracy going over to
                        the Republicans we have no fears on that score. The Democratic party is a
                        party of principles and not the blind follower of any particular politician.
                        When the party unfortunately divided in the late Presidential contest
                        neither wing gave up or changed its name. That issue being over old feuds
                        are buried and the Democratic party is this day as firmly united in one
                        solid phalanx as ever it was before. To be told that Democrats must join the
                        Republican party in order to "save the Union," or be loyal to the
                        Government, is an insult that the Government, is an insult that no Democrat
                        with a soul in him will brook. The Democratic party has ever stood up for
                        the WHOLE COUNTRY, its CONSTITUTION and its LAWS, and has never changed its name or its principles, and will
                        not likely do so now to SAVE a corrupt sectional party that has brought upon
                        the country all the ruin and disgrace under which it is suffering.</p>
                    <p>We have no apprehensions that the Douglas wing of the party will join hands
                        with the Republicans. The men composing it are as true to Democratic
                        principles as any other portion of the party. There are now no differences
                        in the party, and the Republicans, much as they would desire to effect it,
                        will not be allowed to create any. When the first Douglas Meeting was held
                        in this place one of the resolutions adopted at that meeting read thus:--</p>
                    <p>"It is the duty of every Democratic organization to recognize the principles
                        for which the party has BATTLED IN THE PAST and to which she is IRREVOCABLY
                        COMMITTED FOR THE FUTURE, as the creed of the party, and that every failure
                        to give adhesion to these principles, by individuals or organizations,
                        places those individuals and organizations outside the Democratic Family."</p>
                    <p>Douglas Democrats must not be told, with this resolution adopted at their
                        meeting before them, that the principles for which they "battled for in the
                        past" and to which they pledged themselves as "committed for the future" are
                        the principles of the Chicago platform. They know better than that and can
                        therefore, never act upon principle in joining hands with the Republicans.
                        Whenever that "unholy alliance" takes place they must, according to their
                        own showing, be considered "outside the Democratic
                            Family."</p>
                    <p>The preamble to the "Douglas and Johnston club," organized at this place, set
                        forth that--</p>
                    <p>"The success of the Democratic Party--the only true national organization--is
                        essential to the PEACE AND PROSPERITY OF THE COUNTRY, the INTEGRITY OF THE
                        CONSTITUTION, and the PERPETUITY OF THE UNION."</p>
                    <p>Let those who do not believe now what they professed to believe then, that
                        this is the mission of the Democratic party, slide over to the Republicans.
                        We want no man in our ranks who is so stupid that he can be made to believe
                        that the only way to save the Union is to save the Republican party! If
                        there are any such we would like to see a formal withdrawal of their names
                        from the Constitution to the above named Club before they stand side by side
                        with Republicans on the Chicago platform. If they have changed their
                        opinions and no longer believe that the "success of the
                            Democratic party is essential to the peace and prosperity of the
                        Country, the integrity of the Constitution and the perpetuity of the Union,"
                        they should; for consistency sake, withdraw their names from the "Douglas
                        and Johnston Club" before amalgamating with Republicans.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The burdens of taxation are increasing, and the wages of the working people
                        are decreasing. These facts will not be denied, and the result none can
                        foretell. They throw over the future a gloomy prospect, and provoke the
                        enquiry as to the causes.</p>
                    <p>It will not be forgotten that our State Legislature appropriated $3,500,000
                        for war purposes; besides legislating out of the State Treasury many
                        millions more for the benefit of two soulless railroad companies. Then a law
                        was passed to increase the State taxes yearly two and
                            one-half mills, to pay the interest on the war loan; and another
                        law was passed to authorize the county Commissioners and Associate Judges,
                        to increase the County taxes to pay for the support of the families of
                        absent volunteers. This additional tax programme is not for one year only,
                        but for many years--with the certainty of a like increase being made to the
                        same annually as long as the war continues and corrupt legislation is
                        tolerated for the benefit of railroad speculators. Next we see Congress pass
                        a tax bill providing for the raising of $20,000,000 as an additional revenue
                        for defraying the expenses of the government--Pennsylvania's quote of the
                        tax is $1,916,719. A direct tax shall be laid on the value of all lands and
                        lots of ground, with their improvements and dwelling houses, which several
                        articles subject to taxation shall be enumerated and valued, by the
                        respective assessors, at the rate each of them is worth in money on the
                        first day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-two. A tax of 8 per cent per
                        annum is to be laid on all yearly incomes of over $800. Gold watches are to
                        be taxed $1; silver watches 50 cents. Carriages are to be taxed from one to
                        fifty dollars each, in accordance with their value. The tariff laws of the
                        last session have also been changed, providing an indirect tax upon the
                        consumptions of life--that is, a duty or war tax has been fixed upon sugar,
                        coffee, teas, molasses, spices, &amp;c., &amp;c., which will
                        increase their price about one third. Of these
                        articles the laboring man consumes as much as the President of the United
                        States or as the millionaire, consequently, under the operation of this new
                        tariff, the laboring man who works for seventy-five cents a day must pay
                        towards the support of the Government, on these articles, just as much as
                        the richest man in the land, or else must deny himself the use of these
                        articles which have become necessaries of life, and more so to the poor than
                        to the rich. The laboring man, who, in his family, consumes 100 pounds of
                        coffee, 200 pounds of sugar, and ten pounds of tea in a year, will, under
                        the operation of this tariff, pay towards towards [sic] the support of the
                        Government, on these articles alone, a tax of
                        from twelve to fifteen dollars per year, and at
                        the same time, his wages must be reduced in consequence of the prostration
                        of trade and the scarcity of labor and employment. Is this the protection promised by the Republican leaders last
                        fall? Is this the change for which so many of our
                        laboring men were induced to vote for Curtin and Lincoln? These are
                        Republican "good times!"--this is the way they propose to restore the
                        country back to the primitive days of its prosperity!--this is what the
                        "Union Savers" were such fools for trying to prevent! May Heaven protect us
                        from the rule of Republican rulers.--Allentown
                        Democrat</p>
