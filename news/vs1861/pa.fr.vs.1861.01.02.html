<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Telegraph invites the Legislature which meets
                        on Tuesday next to appropriate a million of
                        dollars for the purchase of arms to supply the citizen soldiers of
                        this State. What for? Pennsylvania is not threatened with an attack from any
                        quarter. This large expenditure of money is not necessary for her defence.
                        Neither is she called upon to declare war against any state of the Union. As
                        a manner of the Federal Union she has no right to assail any member of the
                        Confederacy. We can see no other motive for this extraordinary proposition
                        than to inaugurate a civil war at home. The moment Pennsylvania commences
                        making military preparations, that moment will the border States take the
                        alarm, and proceed to arm their citizens for defence. Then the revolution
                        will be upon us. Not cornered to the distant cotton States; but right at
                        home, upon our borders. Are the people of Pennsylvania prepared for this.</p>
                    <p>The only approach to a reason even for this warlike demonstration is that it
                        will strike "terror into the ranks of the disunionists of "the South." This
                        is Chinese reason--an attempt to frighten the enemy by a great noise and
                        flourish of trumpets. The difficulties now distracting the country are not
                        to be settled by such child's play.</p>
                    <p>We trust that the Legislature will not be guided by such incendiary advice as
                        this, which, if it is not intended to embroil the State in a civil war, is a
                        huge scheme to extract a large sum of money from the Treasury.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Republicans are constantly talking about the violent tone at the South,
                        but we find warm, patriotic, conservative feeling there as often as
                        anywhere. Here is a preamble and resolution adopted at a large public
                        meeting holden in Lumpkin county, Georgia, on the 4th instant:--</p>
                    <p>"The people of Lumpkin county view with regret the continuous manifestation
                        of the spirit of aggression on the part of a portion of the Northern States
                        against the people of the South, and the election of a sectional man to the
                        Presidency of the United States, gives renewed evidence of their intention
                        to continue their acts of aggression. And at the same time they view with
                        dread the hasty action, as contemplated by many Southern patriots who are in
                        favor of immediate secession; therefore,</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we are opposed to immediate
                        secession, and are in favor of redressing existing evils by constitutional
                        measures, believing that a prudent exercise of the powers preserved by our
                        Constitution to the States and the people will be found a remedy for
                        existing evils, and that it would be unwise to destroy our government until
                        all constitutional measures of redress have been tried without producing the
                        desired result."</p>
