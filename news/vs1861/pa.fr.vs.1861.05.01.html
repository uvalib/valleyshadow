                    the troops and swore their allegiance to the Confederacy. Once the tracks were
                    blocked, the troops disembarked and marched through the streets. The mob blocked
                    their path and threw paving stones at them. The troops fired at the mob and a

                        this important post than Mr. EYSTER. He is indefatigable in his exertions to
                        procure the best produce our market affords suitable for soldiers fare, and
                        in having it prepared in the most careful manner. We noticed wagon loads of
                        bread constantly arriving at his warehouse that has the appearance of being
                        prepared out of the first quality of flour and baked in the very best
                        manner. There need be no apprehensions that the supply of substantial and
                        wholesome provisions will fail while Mr. EYSTER holds the contract to supply
                        this department.</p>

                        gentlemen have been killing some of the largest and finest cattle ever
                        brought to this market to fulfill their contract. They slaughter from six to
                        eight head a day and many of the cattle killed weight over a thousand
                        pounds. They supply the soldiers with salt as well as fresh beef and are
