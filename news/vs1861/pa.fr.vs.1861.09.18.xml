                <excerpt> "The right of the Government to confiscate rebel property, says the <emph
                        rend="italic">Albany Argus</emph>, is admited [sic] on all sides. But the
                    moment the slave question becomes mingled with it, it becomes embarrassing." </excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The bill confiscating property of men in arms against the Government, was
                        signed by President Lincoln with great reluctance. Wendell Phillips, in a
                        recent speech, said the Senate had to go down on its knees to Mr. Lincoln to
                        implore his signature. Mr. Russell, in a recent letter to the London <emph
                            rend="italic">Times</emph>, corroborates this. He says:</p>
                    <p>On the very last day of Congress the bill which sets free slaves belonging to
                        rebels engaged in war was signed with reluctance by Mr. Lincoln, and was all
                        but lost by lapse of time, for had he not been persuaded to overcome his
                        scruples the Congress would have adjourned without the signature could not
                        have been obtained, as the President at first refused peremptorily to put
                        his name to the bill, alleging that "It will lose us Kentucky;" but there
                        was a pressure of Senators put upon him, and he yielded at last, but ten
                        minutes before the House rose. On such occasions the President comes down to
                        his room in the Capital, and affixes his name, or receives the official
                        visits of the legislators, and if the clock had not been put back, and the
                        sittings carried on beyond the time agreed upon for the adjournment, this
                        bill could not have been presented to the Senate.</p>
                    <p>The right of the Government to confiscate rebel property, says the <emph
                            rend="italic">Albany Argus</emph>, is admited [sic] on all sides. But
                        the moment the slave question becomes mingled with it, it becomes
                        embarrassing. The Secretary of War took the ground that only those slaves
                        who had been employed upon batteries, or with regiments, or some other way
                        contributing to the support of the war, should be confiscated. But the
                        effect of this was to reward service against the country with the boon of
                        emancipation! The ground was untenable and had to be abandoned.</p>
                    <p>It is now proposed to emancipate the slaves of all disloyal men in the
                        rebellious States; and many imagine that this can be done with the
                        concurrence of the loyal Union-loving population. But is it true? can half
                        the slaves in Missouri be set free; and the other half be retained in
                        servitude? Do not all Southern men recognize the impossibility of retaining
                        a large free black population (especially one suddenly emancipated) in the
                        midst of slave communities?</p>
                    <p>This feeling is certainly strong in the South, to make schemes of partial
                        emancipation, very odious to even Union men. It is well to strike terror in
                        the ranks of the rebels; but it is not well to sow distrust in the ranks of
                        the loyal.</p>
                    <p>Measures of this kind must be judged by their effects; and the President
                        should see to it that under the pretence of "confiscation," a scheme of
                        emancipation is not attempted that would consolidate against us the
                        sentiments of the now-divided South.</p>
