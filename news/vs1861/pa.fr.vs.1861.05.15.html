                        night last. They came there intoxicated and were so uproarious that Mr.
                        Brand was obliged to eject them from his house. In doing this, he received a
                        severe blow from a brick in the hands of one of them. Another man named
                        Johnston was severely beaten. In the melee a
                        pistol was fired which, it is said, wounded one of the soldiers in the

<b>Three Year Soldiers</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit dislikes the plan proposed for enlisting the three-month
                    volunteers for three years. These men have been badly clothed and badly treated
                    and have received neither money nor glory, so asking them to "'prolong the
                    agony' is taxing their patriotism rather severely."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Where We Are</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit responds to an inquiry from the Charleston Mercury as to where
                    the Northern friends of the South have gone. The Spirit states that they are
                    where they have always been--"on the platform of Southern rights, the
                    Constitution, and the Union." They blame the Southern secessionists for
                    abandoning the North and going beyond the Constitution and the Union to defend
                    their rights. "The Northern Democracy have no share in the responsibility, but
                    they are unanimously taking a hand in the work of preserving the Union."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Bank of Chambersburg</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Bank of Chambersburg paid its stockholders a dividend of four percent.
                    The Spirit believes that the stockholders are "blessed," especially since
                    Railroad stock and state bonds have paid so poorly. They point out that the
                    Democratic Party was once considered hostile to banks. Now, they claim that the
                    Party is only hostile to corrupt and fraudulent banks.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Washington is quiet, and reports have reached the city that there are no
                    signs of northward troop movement in Virginia. Numerous Southern troops have
                    congregated at Richmond. Fifteen hundred Alabama troops and twenty cannon

<b>Important from St. Louis</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Union soldiers captured General Frost's brigade of Missouri militia. Before
                    the surrendered troops marched back to St. Louis, a disturbance broke out
                    between U.S. volunteers and a crowd that included many women and children. The
                    crowd threw several rocks at the soldiers and fired a few pistol shots. When
                    Capt. Blanlawsky was shot, he gave the order to fire, which was obeyed. More
                    than twenty persons, including two women and several children, were killed. "The
                    unfortunate occurrence has produced an intense excitement in the city. Large
                    bodies of men are thronging the streets."<br>
