<b>An Abolition Despotism to be Established by the Sword</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Accuses Lincoln of pursuing a war policy and indicates that violent
                    opposition to civil war will spring up in the North.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The bill of Mr. Stanton, of Ohio, authorizing the President to accept the
                        services of volunteers, is but a part of the war policy which the Republican
                        party is pursuing. The design is to invest the incoming Administration with
                        every function and attribute of military power, so that the anti-slavery
                        programme may carve its way and enforce its triumph by the sword. Despotism
                        has been defined--a union of the purse and sword. As if to effectuate this
                        definition in the person of Mr. Lincoln, the Black Republicans are engaged
                        in hurrying money and force bills through Congress. If they succeed, when
                        Mr. Lincoln comes into power, he will, through a superserviceable Congress,
                        find himself ready to begin his projected war, that is if he can raise the
                        troops and the money voted. Fortunately, curses cling to sin, and often
                        paralyze it in its hour of anticipated triumph. To vote money is one
                        thing--to raise it another. We have abundant reason to suppose that
                        capitalists will refuse money which is designed to be used in the
                        prosecution of a civil war. As for volunteers, there will be few, we opined
                        for such service. Volunteers have to be paid as well as regulars, and
                        without money they cannot be paid. They may be promised plunder, but they
                        will have to fight hard for all the plunder they get in the South. There are
                        few large cities there to be sacked. Besides, such as they are will have to
                        be captured before they can be pillaged. Houses may be burned and fields may
                        be laid waste--but negroes, although property there, would, if carried off,
                        be unproductive here. The volunteer would get a plenty of bullets but find
                        scarcity of plunder. They would, in the language of Mr. Corwin, be 'welcomed
                        with bloody hands to hospitable graves.' But is it not unlikely that they
                        would have to do some fighting here before marching South. The generous and
                        gallant old tar, Commodore Stockton, is reported to have said in his speech
                        before the Peace Conference, that--'for every regiment that would be raised
                        in the North to coerce the South, another would spring up in the same North
                        to oppose the first.' This sentiment of the noble Commodore is fast becoming
                        the popular sentiment here, for all patriots and all reflecting men are
                        convinced that a Black Republican sectional war will forever destroy the
                        Union and place it beyond the possibility of re-constructing, and they
                        regard with horror and will oppose to the last the reckless men who would
                        inaugurate such a war.</p>
                    <p>To see with what horror those movements in Congress, that even squint at such
                        a war, are regarded by all save the blind and infatuated Republicans, we
                        have only to glance at the debate that took place on Tuesday on Mr.
                        Stanton's bill.</p>
                    <p>Said Mr. John Cochrane, of New York--'Pass this bill when you may, it will
                        indeed be the mourning hour for the country.'</p>
                    <p>Mr. Burnett, of Kentucky, said--'You are attempting to
                            involve the country in war.'</p>
                    <p>Mr. Boteler, of Virginia, said--'There is no more
                            efficient mode to break up the Union'</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cox, Ohio, said--'While the Peace Congress is here, I
                            regard this as a disunion measure.'</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sickles, of New York, said--'The people of the North
                            will regard this measure as substituting coercion for justice, and the
                            abandonment of conciliation for war.'</p>
                    <p>The Republicans are seemingly acting with steady and consistent reference to
                        the permanent dissolution of the Union. The border slave States make the
                        preservation of the public peace and the careful abstinence from all
                        measures tending to bring on collision the condition of their remaining in
                        the Union long enough to test the willingness of the free States to render
                        them a constitutional adjustment; and the Republicans, in utter disregard of
                        that condition, and of the obvious and inevitable consequences of such
                        conduct, are, with unexampled energy and despatch [sic], hurrying war bills
                        through Congress.--Their policy seems to be to make war in order to create
                        peace, a paradox as senseless as it is dangerous. They seem to be
                        endeavoring to drive the border States from all conference by outing off all
                        hope of agreement, and act really as if their object was not to arrest, but
                        to promote secession; not to save, but to destroy the Union; not to give the
                        blessings of peace, but the curses of war.</p>
                    <p>Having driven off seven States, they are endeavoring to drive off eight more,
                        and then after driving them off they are resolved to crush them under the
                        armed heels of their Abolition soldiers. They ask the Northern Democrats and
                        conservatives to unite with them in this, so as to make the whole North an
                            Abolition unit. They impudently ask men, who
                        have always voted against them, to fight for them and thus establish, what to them is
                        of all things the most abhorrent, an Abolition despotism.</p>
