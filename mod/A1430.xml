                <p>Ryan discusses the battles of their company and regiment, also sending along a

                    <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Yours or recent date duly received and would have been replied to earlier but for
                    the fact that I have been confined to my bed as the result, principally, of a
                    wound received during the "late unpleasantness". I enclose brief extracts from
                    the only Muster Roll surviving, relating to our old Company. They are certainly
                    authentic as far as they go. They came into my possession - the Rolls of the
                    whole Regimen<del hand="h1">t</del>t soon after I was disabled, the officer who
                    had them in charge being terribly wounded and the Rolls covered with his blood,
                    a large "splotch" falling on and almost obliterating your name. The Company and
                    Regiment were engaged in innumerable battles and skirmishes, after which you
                    were again wounded and captured (at Fisher's Hill, I believe) in the Wilderness,
                    Petersburg, Richmond and Appomattox. Up to the time you "wound up" our Company
                    had been in about thirty general engagements, and you well know we had the
                    "knack" of having somebody killed and wounded in each. There was no general
                    re-union of soldiers at the Fair.</p>

                <p>"Jim" Bryan is still living and his finger hasn't "growed out" yet. He is nearly
                    dried up and withered - sends his respects. I may at some future time get up and
                    publish a sketch of the old Company and Regiment. If so, will send you a copy.
                    The date is so hard to get at. Such of the members of the Company a<del
                        hand="h1">r</del>s are now living are considerably "scattered" - the most of
                    them, I believe, are prospering.</p>

                <p>In regard to yourself, as the commanding officer of the Company for about two
                    years, I take pleasure in saying that your standing in said Comp<del hand="h1"
                    >a</del>any, both as a gentleman and soldier, all the time, was "A. <abbr
                        expan="Number">No.</abbr> 1".</p>

                <p>I was grateful to see from the paper you sent me, that in your adopted home you
                    were prospering. It is my sincere wish that you may "live long and be prosperous
                    and happy". As for myself I don't want any more "war" in mine. I got enough of
                    it. You, it seems, were not satisfied with "whipping" you got but must needs go
                    out to fight the "Injine".</p>

                <p>Like old Bob Tombs, I will always believe that we were not whipped but "wore
                    ourselves out whipping the other side". Excuse everything. I am compelled to
                    write by amanuensis - being in bed.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Fraternally yours,</salute>
