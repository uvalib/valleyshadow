<p class="p10">July 29th 66</p>
<p class="p10">Rose Dale</p>
<p class="p10">My dear friend</p>
<p class="p10">This is a beautiful Sabbath morn &amp; all nature
                    seems to be sending up its praises to the great &amp; good God yes I say
                        <i>[added: good]</i> (good when he gives supremely good
                    nor less when he denies) &amp; it is Him who
                    deserves the praise for he does all things well. Willie
                    I was not well this morning nor have not been for a week &amp; could not go
                    to church so I thought I would respond to your dear missive that I received last Thursday Oh you
                    know not how I felt when I got it I feared to open it my hand trembled when I
                    grasped it &amp; saw it was from you; but you will say what caused the fear
                    now do not censure me for my weakness, I feared it
                    would be cold &amp; indifferent &amp;
                    perhaps bid me never to write
                    again but when I saw dear Kate it cheered me up yes I
                        felt strong again &amp; thought perhaps there were some hope &amp; now I am replying with you
                    last request (<u>write soon</u>) yes I will try &amp;
                    comply with every request that you make though I have
                    been denied of every one I have made. I will try
                    &amp; return good for evil, I am resigned to my
                    fate. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>but I must hasten to respond to your dear sweet letter. you say
                    mine caused your sensitive nature to mourn over the past my dear friend I am
                    sorry that I caused you to mourn over the past for it is
                    wicked for me to mourn over it let alone being the cause of another one to be
                    sad forgive me for making you thus. God in his goodness has some wise device for doing this so I am willing to bear though the chastening
                    rod has been severe it has brought me nearer <u>him</u> &amp; made a better
                    girl of me &amp; I hope ere long dear brother that you will exclaim God is good &amp; does all things well.
                    Willie you wish a release you have loved me I do not
                    doubt that but your affections have changed &amp; you soon wish to be free
                    again &amp; can I hold thy pure &amp; noble heart bind it to me that is
                    so impure as mine for I have been the cause of you being unhappy &amp; I
                    know not but what I am the cause of you losing your
                    religion though I hope not so Willie I am not worthy of you. I love you
                    &amp; can not help it but Willie I will never harm you love works no ill to
                    any one I never expect to love another nor do not wish to no could I trust
                    another could I ask my dear Father to change that which
                    I asked him to do but with in my bossom no never, but
                    can I claim you when you are changed; Oh my Heavenly
                    Father forbid no no Willie I care not what may be my fate I can not hold thee to
                    me if you do not wish it nor can I spurn you no Willie I blame myself in part
                    for it yes the letter that I wrote last winter just after Christmas I blame for
                    it yes dear Willie I will take half of the blame or all of it if it will make
                    you happy for I have bore the blame &amp; censure
                    of the people for it &amp; swore then it yes Willie I have bore the burden
                    in the heat of the day I caused &amp; cast it all upon thee now but will bear half of it with
                    you. I will tell you some things that has (come) been said to me Kate you look
                    sad you kicked Billie thinking you could do better &amp; I dont pity you one bit what could I say I denied the charge but it is generally
                    believed that I did kick you yes I am blamed with your drinking which I never did believe you did though you thought I did no
                    Willie I could not believe it I would see you laying dead drunk in the mud I
                    would (not) think it was not you there oh you said the next to the last time you
                    were down here if I ever kicked you that you would get to
                    drinking but Willie here is the hardest thing I had to endure that I had kicked
                    you &amp; you got to drinking on the account of it &amp; that now I had
                    lost my mind on the account of it Oh Willie is it not a <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>wonder that I
                    have not lost my mind as be blamed with so much that
                    I hope I am innocent of &amp; yet I believe it is all for my own good "all work together
                    for good to those that love God yes dear Willie God in all his ways is just
                    &amp; merciful &amp; if we really trust him
                    though we pass through fire it will not harm us.</p>
<p class="p10">Willie do not think that I wrote this to make you sad no no dear one I would do
                    anything in my power to make you happy; you say you would like to see me why do
                    you think then it is best for us not to meet; I sort of believe you are a little contrary ha ha
                    &amp; what do you think of that no Willie but why is it do you think I can
                    not bear to meet you I have taught or rather God has
                    taught me to bear much I think I could meet you as
                    cheerful as ever I met you in my life. you say my cup has been bitter it has
                    been bitter Oh far worse than you have any idea of but
                    dear Willie there was some sweets with it at times; you say blame you with it
                    not all dear one can I blame you no no you could not help it for I think that
                    the wicked one has done it not your good heart dictated but you were not happy
                    &amp; he wished to claim you for one of his servants &amp; persuaded you that you did not love me yes Willie he
                    knew that I was trying to win you back to God &amp; that he would get you to
                    dismiss me at once but my dear Father ordered other wise he bid me noy to give
                    thee up Willie dear I believe he has directed me how to write every letter that I have written to you since you were here
                    &amp; Oh I pray that my dear Savior may make them
                    the instrument of bringing you back to God Oh dear one you say you are willing
                    to bear my malice if it but make me happpy my malice Willie no Malice if I have
                    any in my heart I pray to my dear Savior (to) to pluck
                    it out Willie come to see me &amp; I will tell you what will make me happy
                    Willie I will treat you as a fond sister would a brother mistreat you no never &amp; as for the rest of the family mistreating you there are no danger of that I
                        don't think none but Susie knows how you have
                    treated me I think that she pitied you now as for Pa
                    &amp; Ma Willie I do not think they will ever mistreat you for they see my perfect indifference to every other man so Willie I don't think you need to fear at all S was not at the Barbecue nor none of
                    our family nor I do not regret that I was not there I think Willie there is more
                        <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>harm done at such places than good they had a picnic at Mint Spring &amp; danced in the church Oh that these
                    dances were turned to prayer meetings how much sooner
                    could we expect the blessings of God upon our country.
                    Willie All have gone to Sabbath school this eve but Pa Ma &amp; myself &amp; I feel very
                    lonely Alone yes Alone shall it always be thus Oh my Father forsaken &amp;
                        forgotten no one to care for me how long Oh how
                    long but enough thy will <i>[added: be done]</i> The health

                    though I hope it is nothing serious I have been taking
                        medicine but it has had but little
                    effect I hope I will be

                        every day to meet our God than to spurn his
