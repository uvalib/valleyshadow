<h4>Augusta: D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, March 18,
                    1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Snyder tells his wife that he has no idea when his unit will return to the
                    Staunton area but hopes that it will be soon.</p>

<p class="p10">Saturday morning, March 18th '65</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">An opportunity presents to forward my Letter and I hope, dear Rachel, you may
                    receive it in due time. I can give you no definite idea as to where we will be
                    located on the return of the Command. We are looking for orders daily to take
                    the Train to the Command and I am of opinion we will be returned to the
                    neighborhood of Staunton. I cannot therefore tell you which I think the best
                    route to take in case you come out. It may be several weeks before the Cars run
                    to Staunton and it may not be more than a few days as I do not know the extent
                    of damage done the road. But I suppose they will run up as high as
                    Charlottesville soon. I will write you again as soon as opportunity occurs. Do
                    what you may deem best about coming out and act accordingly.</p>
<p class="p10">I want to see you so much and hope the opportunity may occur during the Summer to
                    get home and see you all. Tell Johnny I have no way in the world to send him the
                    Tobacco. Can't he take you to Orange Court House to the
                    Cars and then he could lay in a Box for you and himself also? If you have the
                    opportunity lay in a good supply to trade for such work as you need. Kiss the
                    dear little children for me and remember me to all the family.</p>
<p class="p10">In Haste I am As Ever<br> Your affectionate
                        and Devoted Husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
