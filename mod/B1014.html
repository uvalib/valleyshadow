<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, July 31, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson writes that while the condition of most freedmen in Augusta County is
                    tolerable for the present, more support will be needed as winter approaches.
                    Jackson renews his request for a medical requisition, but also mentions the need
                    to try to reunite the familes of the aged and orphaned. His report also
                    discusses temperance and the political attitudes in the county.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 31/1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with the requirements of Circular Order
                    Number 6 S. 1866 (Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands) I have the honor to report on the conditions of Bureau Affairs
                    in 4th Division 9 Sub-District that since date of my last report there is no change in the
                    general condition of Freedmen. The amelioration and elevation of their condition
                    is progressing favorably, slowly it is true but perhaps all the more surely.</p>
<p class="p10">Employment continues abundant, much of the crop not yet being housed and
                    threshing of that already saved, pretty general. So far as has been brought to
                    my notice the farmers have paid <u>harvest</u> wages promptly
                    and in cases of disagreement under old contract where the amount involved is
                    within the jurisdiction of magistrates I can obtain prompt settlement, but with
                    the larger claims of which I have several I can make very little progress as the
                    Freedmen are too poor to sue in the courts in form of law and contend with their
                    richer debtors.</p>
<p class="p10">The physical condition of the aged, sickly and orphan colored persons is much
                    alleviated by fine weather and abundance of vegetable food and although there
                    are cases of need they are within reach of the local <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>authorities and
                    I do not expect to have to draw any rations until the Fall of the year unless
                    sickness becomes prevalent. Having by ample notice prepared the persons who have
                    hitherto been assisted for a suspension of Bureau aid, I hear few complaints on
                    account of the stoppage of issue of Rations.</p>
<p class="p10">The political relations between white and colored present no change in this
                    Division. The whites say little except occasional individual threats, being at
                    last satisfied it is useless to continue the endeavor to make the Freedmen
                    believe they are their "best friends" and the large majority of white over
                    colored voters registered 3,484 white &amp; 1,206
                        colored = 2,248 White majority in Augusta County and a still greater proportionate majority in
                    Highland County makes them more indifferent, as they
                    think they can easily out-vote them at the Polls. The conduct of the Freedmen is
                    most praiseworthy and I do not anticipate any collision in case of an election.
                    In reference to Circular Number 14 Headquarters
                    Assistant
                    Commissioner
                    Virginia July 10, 1867 I
                    respectfully refer to my Report of Bureau Affairs forwarded June 3, 1867 "If a copy of the Constitution and By-Laws of
                    the Central (Lincoln Temperance) Society at Washington can be furnished to me, I
                    have no doubt branch organizations can be established here" As yet I have not
                    received such copy of Constitution &amp;c Drunkenness is more prevalent
                    among white than colored people in both counties and with but two exceptions
                    white men <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>are the keepers of the drinking places.</p>
<p class="p10">I regret that some provision cannot be made to furnish medicine for poor Freedmen
                    here. Sickness is most common in families where poverty exists and although Dr.
                    C. R. Harris continues to prescribe gratis for the needy poor colored people, as
                    I have reported in previous months, he cannot furnish medicine also and in some
                    pressing cases I have had to pay for prescriptions out of my own pocket. A
                    trifling appropriation by the Bureau would do much good and if this cannot be
                    made with a small assortment of medicine be furnished to me on requisition?</p>
<p class="p10">The aged and orphan colored people will need much attention through the coming
                    winter and I know nothing which will tend more to alleviate their condition than
                    affording facilities for the reunion of familes most of the needy old colored
                    people in this county having been deprived of their natural supporters by the
                    sale of their now adult chilren to other States.</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be, General,<br>Your obedient servant</p>

                    Jackson</u><br>Agent</i></p>
