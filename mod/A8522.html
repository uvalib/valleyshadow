<p class="p10">April 30/59</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">Your two letters came in my absence from home &amp; since my return I have
                    been so disturbed by this calamity which has befallen Stuart that I have had no
                    thoughts of anything else.</p>
<p class="p10">You have no doubt seen from the papers that Baldwin Stuart is dreadfully if not
                    fatally injured by the Steamboat explosion near Memphis He lives there now
                    &amp; his mother &amp; father have by this time reached him. Our
                    accounts of his condition are very meager but they are
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>such as to excite the worst apprehensions, of hideous
                    disfigurement or of death.</p>
<p class="p10">I need hardly assure you how sincerely gratifying it has been to me to hear of
                    your friendly &amp; active efforts in my behalf in the late election. A few
                    more such friends would have changed the result.</p>
<p class="p10">It would seem absurd to say that I feel no disappointment or annoyance at my
                    defeat &amp; yet I assure you I am astonished to find how little it affects
                    me. The truth is I ran for the office at the suggestion of my vanity rather than
                    of my <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>judgment, &amp; vanity having been knocked on the head
                    judgment is getting up once more.</p>
<p class="p10">The official count makes Robertson's majority <u>512</u></p>
<p class="p10">Remember me cordially to Whitehead &amp; believe me to be</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John B. Baldwin</i></p>
