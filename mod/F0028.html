<p class="p10">Feb 8<sup>th</sup> 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp 16th Pa Cav, Near Warrenton, Va. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cynthia </p>
<p class="p10">It is a week yesterday since I have received a letter from you. This is
                    occasioned some time ago in writing by my delay. You are waiting a letter from
                    me. Yesterday I got that Cake &amp; can of apples. I hoped to get a letter
                    in the box but their was nothing for me except the eatables which pitched into
                    &amp; I tell you they were good, expecially coming from your fireside. I
                    would have been pleased if Josey, Lucy, Bell, &amp; Jimmy were by me to get
                    a piece of it. They thought it would be good to make Pa better so Aunt Mary
                    writes. Well Pa is as well &amp; hearty as ever but the cake made him feel
                    better. Made the fireside of home more distinctly into view. Will Potters box
                    was brought without having anything in it disturbed or spoiled. Some of the boys
                    that get boxes don't
                    fare so well. Will keeps hearty &amp; well. Will
                    Carrol has pretty good health. George McDaid has tolerable health.</p>
<p class="p10">I got a letter from home on last Friday. They are all well. Mary says she was
                    down to see you &amp; found you all in good health. She wrote about Josey
                    wanting to go home with her &amp; Lucy told him to wait until Jimmy came
                    &amp; he could go home with her. Lucy wanted to go with Mother &amp;
                    Jimmy. Aunt Mary wrote too how Jimmy sat on her knee &amp; tried to talk to
                    her with all his might. He can't say yes can he.</p>
<p class="p10">There was cannon firing in the direction of Rapidan on Saturday. We could hear it
                    all day. We see by the paper today that the rebs moved some of their force down
                    to the river and opened on our men, when our forces turned on them &amp;
                    turned them back. The report here is that the pontoons were run down to the
                    river &amp; the 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> Corps crossed over &amp; thrashed the Johnnies. This is camp rumor
                    here how true it is I don't know. The papers don't give any particulars.</p>
<p class="p10">Our division has been quiet ever since my return. We were saddled up one night
                    sometime ago expecting the rebels. Morning came but nary
                    a rebel. The boys unsaddled.</p>
<p class="p10">The pickets up about Warrenton have a few shots sometimes. The rebels are getting tired of it so we are having a quiet time.</p>
<p class="p10">Dr. Lemon of the 9<sup>th</sup> Pa Reserves has been made Surgeon of
                    our Regiment. Dr. Hermann is still the Assistant
                    &amp; we can't have but one so my hopes are deferred
                    for the present.</p>
<p class="p10">I certainly looked for a letter from you at the time the box would come but have
                    received none yet. Did you write. Mr. James Howe sent me a Washington Tribune
                    &amp; a Cincinatti paper. Will you give him my
                    compliments for the acceptable reading matter.</p>
<p class="p10">The Paymaster has not been here since my return &amp; I now have 5 months pay
                    coming. I don't know when he will pay off, probably not
                    soon towards spring. How are you getting along for money. Your wood won't cost as much as I supposed it would. The 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Virginia Cavalry have got home. I hear the folks will be
                    very glad to see them. You will find that I have broken my promise about
                    writing. I felt so sure of getting a letter on Sabbath day from you I thought to
                    wait until yours would come &amp; then I could answer it. The box came but
                    no letter. You wrote I feel sure but it is lost.</p>
<p class="p10">Everything is quiet today. No firing that we can hear. The boys feel better in
                    their cabins these times than they do bivouacking
                    these cold nights. We are having frost at night with clear bright sunshiny days.
                    Hoping to hear from you soon I remain your </p>
<p class="p10">affectionate husband </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S.M. Potter </i></p>
<p class="p10">Send me a few stamps if you please. </p>
