<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, March 24, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In this montly report, Jackson relates many of the problems in the black
                    communitites to the lack of education and the "vices engendered by slavery." He
                    also reports on the diverse employment opportunities in his Division, as well as
                    the tense relationship between whites and blacks over the issue of the State
                    Constitution.</p>

<p class="p10">March 24, 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular Order
                    Number 6 S. 1866 Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands I have the honor to make the following report of
                    condition of Bureau Affairs in 4 Division 9 Sub-District
                    Virginia
                    comprising the counties of Augusta &amp;
                    Highland.</p>
<p class="p10">Settlements of wages for labor in 1867 are generally concluded, still this office
                    is much sought by freedpeople asking aid and advice on the many questions of
                    account which ever arise between employer and employed. With some exceptions,
                    more than is desirable, but less than could be expected, considering their
                    recent condition of ignorant servitude, freedmen in this Division are
                    industrious and orderly. Surplus earnings of last year have been largely
                    expended in bridging over the long winter, but save in cases of sickness or
                    desertion there has not been much actual suffering. There is much diversity of
                    employment in this Division - farming, coaling, in connection with iron mining,
                    rail road repairs, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and supplies of fuel, etc., preparing material for building, such as brick, lumber etc. and this causes more regular demand for labor
                    than in a purely agricultural district. If freedmen could but better understand
                    the value of time and short intelligent money reckonings, they would advance
                    much more rapidly in material prosperity. The desire to own a homestead is
                    general, but the plan pursued by many freedmen is fraught with great danger, if
                    by any disaster present system kind officers should retain power. Purchases are
                    made with agreement to make so many annual payments and when purchase money is
                    all paid then a deed to be received. Unless where I can influence them, most
                    take but a simple receipt and may have to sue for title, but I advise all to
                    have a legal contract drawn executed and recorded, but many do not. Written
                    contracts for labor by the year for 1868 are not so general as usual. As I have
                    before reported I think the change to casual hire will in the end prove a
                    disadvantage to the laborer and have advised permanent contracts through this
                    office. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>The social and moral condition of freedmen is not what it
                    should be. The vices engendered by slavery are too deeply rooted to be easily
                    eradicated and I fear until the community at large realize that the freedman is
                    a citizen and seek to elevate him by example and precept, he will in many
                    respects disappoint his friends. The relations of freedmen and whites to each
                    other is in an unsatisfactory condition. The pernicious teachings of the
                    conservative leaders and press have unbounded effect on ignorant whites, who
                    look upon the freedmen with contempt and hate and do not hesitate to use
                    violence where their leaders use abusive language. Assaults on freedmen during
                    this month have been trifling except attack on Jefferson Davison (colored) by William Hite and Joseph Trimble. The wounds
                    caused by a stone, the pistol though drawn not fired. This case is referred to
                    Mr. Joseph Wilson Justice of the Peace for
                    investigation. The political relations of white and colored to each other are
                    directly antagonistic. The conservative leaders have through District
                    Superintendents, Chiefs of 50 &amp; Captains of 10 fully <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>organized themselves to defeat the Constitution about to be submitted to the
                    people of Virginia I do not anticipate there will be
                    any armed and organized public demonstration to drive voters to or from the
                    polls but every effort short of what would necessitate military interference
                    will be used to secure the defeat of the Constitution no matter what its
                    provisions. No progress has been made by me in organizing Temperance
                    Associations in this Division. I have striven earnestly to establish such
                    societies but without any success. There is not much drunkeness among freedmen
                    here but there is more spirits drank than is good for them even were their
                    circumstances better than they are.</p>
