<p class="p10">October 20<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Charlestown</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">Cousin Ash just told me that Claborn Mason was going home tomorrow
     and I thought the best way I could occupy my time <i>[deleted: was
      to]</i> would be to write you a few lines the sun is going down and camp is in quite a stir
     about roll call and laughing about the men
     who fell off their horses today on drill. When sent my horse home I
     commenced riding a yankee horse I had captured in eastern virginia
     which I traded Ash Garber &amp; then <i>[deleted: traded]</i> traded with cousin Asher
     &amp; I have traded again with a man in (Co. I) for a large bay horse which was captured in
      Pennsylvania so I am now well mounted. Tell ma that the pants I
     have are all torn up and tell her to send me a pair by Mason if she can if you can't get any
     cloth I can get some here for <i>[illeg.]</i> five dollars ($5) <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/garb10b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/garb10b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      Tell Sister Addie that I like the shirt very well she sent me by
     Capt. Eskridge and tell her that if she wants to write to cousin Martha that if she sends it
     down to me I think I can send it for her</p>
<p class="p10">You must excuse this short letter as I did not know it in time to write before dark give my
     love to Ma &amp; the girls and ask sister Seal if she ever got my letter and if she did why
      don't she answer it write soon to your son</p>
