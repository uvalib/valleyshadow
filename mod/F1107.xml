                <p>I have been nursing Freedley for two days and he appears to be doing well. The
                    pain has been less I think since I have been here He is lying on a hair mattress
                    on the floor of Mr Wills' parlor I bought a set of Bed Springs and a mattress in
                        <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Phild<hi rend="super">
                            <hi rend="underline">a</hi>
                        </hi></abbr> which will make him a much better bed. He seemed much pleased
                    by this attention. He telegraphed and wrote repeatedly since he was wounded -
                    but, as you know, he never received them I mean he got others to do it.</p>
                <p>He made many inquiries about you, and thought it very brave to stay in the house
                    as you did with the Rebels about. I am<pb n="2"/> having a <orig reg="Mosquito"
                        >Mosketo</orig> net made to keep off the Flies. This wound is from a sound
                    bullet through the head of the leg Bone the large part of the Bone just below
                    the knee joint. It may stiffen the joint partly, for a while, but I think
                    finally he will have the use of it.</p>
                <p>It will take a long time however for him to have a tolerable use of his leg.</p>
                <p>He desires to be kindly remembered. I shall give him Maria's letter this Evening.</p>
                <p>I am staying at McClelland Hotel, where I once stopped with you and Maria going
                    to Caledonia Springs. I have not yet had a scrape of a Pen from home. This goes
                    to <abbr expan="Chambersburg">Chambs</abbr> this afternoon<pb n="3"/> and if you
                    have not do so at once. but don't try to telegraph as the charge is simply an
                    Extortion which no one should countenance. That is unless something occurs to
                    make it an imperative necessity. I will stay with <abbr expan="Freedley"
                    >F</abbr> a few days longer - with love to all</p>
