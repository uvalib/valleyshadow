<h4>Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris, July
                    16, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Pastor writes in the aftermath of a battle defeat, describing deaths and men lost
                    as prisoners. One of those he mentions missing and presumed captured is Franklin
                    Carson. This letter also hints that Pastor was recently at home, perhaps on
                    furlough.</p>

                                <sup>th</sup>
                        </u> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Darksville Beakly County Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10"> Once more in the providence of God it is my happy privilege to seat myself (on
                    the ground) for the purpose of holding sweet Converse with <u>one</u> who is <u>dearer</u>
                    <u>to</u>
                    <u>me</u> than all others in this wide world. All written
                    words are weak &amp; powerless to express the throbbings of a heart where
                    love has made it home. But all this is useless. I wrote to you from Martinsburg
                    on my way down, <i>[unclear: but]</i> so I was not posted in regard to the
                    Casualties of our Regiment &amp; more
                    particularly of our Company. I will again endeaver to give you a more full
                    account. Our Regiment lost 5 killed 58 wounded
                    &amp; some 8 or 10<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> missing. In our Company we had one killed,
                    namely, Benson Buchanan. Also 10 wounded, only 3 of them are considered bad,
                    namely James Furn, John A. Wilson, &amp; Charley <i>[unclear: McGuppin]</i>
                    Furn, &amp; Wilson are in the hands of the enemy, with John Clemmer who was
                    slightly wounded &amp; left to wait on them. The rest of them have gone home
                    excepting 2 who were so slightly wounded that they would not leave. 4 of the
                    company are missing &amp; doubtless taken prisoners, namely, D.A. Black,
                    L.V. Nupanan, D. A. Spitter, &amp; Franklin <i>[unclear: Carson]</i>. I
                    left the same day that I wrote you before &amp; met with the boys in
                    Nagerstown the night following. They seemed to be very glad indeed, and I assure
                    you I was equally as much so to see them. The first thing that they<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    said after asking me for a chew of tobacco (for which they were almost starved)
                    was, if I got married while at home, of course I told them no, but some of them
                    believe yet that I was. I tell you our boys have had a hard time sure, since
                    they left Fredricksburg. They have been on the march for more than a month,
                    during which time they have not had a change of clothes, they are now both dirty
                    &amp; ragged, &amp; a great many of them barefooted, yet notwithstanding
                    all these things they seem to be very cheerful indeed. We drew up in line of
                    battle this side of Nagerstown &amp; fortified where <i>[added: we]</i> remained two days waiting for the enemy to attack us
                    but this they did not do, excepting to skirmish a little, &amp; on Tuesday
                    morning about<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> day eight we crossed the river at Williamsport. wading it up to our shoulders.</p>
<p class="p10">We are now about six miles this side of Martinsburg in camp, how long we will
                    remain at this place I can't say. It is thought by some
                    the yankees are making for Fredricksburg again, if so we will be on the march
                    for that place in a few days.</p>
<p class="p10">There is some canonading in the direction of Harpers ferry this evening It may be
                    the yankee Cavalry are trying to cross. The 12<u>

                    </u>
                    Virginia Cavalry had a fight there on yesterday in which
                    Ash Harman it is said was mortally wounded, &amp; left with the enemy. Captain Strickler &amp; nearly all of his Company
                    were taken prisoners in the late fight. John Muck had his left arm shattered, it
                    was amputated above the elbow &amp; near the shoulder. I saw all the
                    Rockbridge boys a day or two ago. Also Sam Thompson, they are all well. I must
                    stop my scribbling for I know you will be tired
                    reading this, if you can read it at all. <u>Please</u>
                    <u>
                        don't
