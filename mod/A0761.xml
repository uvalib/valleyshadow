    <p>I received Mamas letter two or three days ago and received yours and cousin Kate's yesterday.
     I have had quite a nice time since I have been in camp. I have made the acquaintance of a good
     many nice officers. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Steptoe is one of the nicest <orig
      reg="gentlemen">gentleman</orig> I ever saw and is so kind to me. I understand that <orig
      reg="Flood's">Floods</orig> &amp; <orig reg="Picket's">Pickets</orig> divisions are camped
     near here &amp; Jones, Imboden, Hampton, Jenkins and W.H. Lee are and in fact all our
     cavalry forces are here. We expect to leave here for some unknown point in a day or two. I
     shall try and fill your memorandum if possible. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> intend to write
     long letters to you when you have nothing to do and write short ones. Judge is here and sends
     his love. I will write to Ma in a day or two. Never forget to mention <abbr expan="brother"
     >bro</abbr> Jim in your letters. I will write to him soon. Love to all. I am your <abbr
      expan="Brother">Bro</abbr>, Kent.</p>
    <lb/>
    <p>Dear Cousin <lb/> I received your two very short notes and regret to write as I have nothing
     in the world to write. I have not seen your <abbr expan="brother">Bro</abbr> yet. I shall give
     him your memorandum in full and shall tell him not to apply for a furlough <orig reg="until"
      >untill</orig> he hears from you. Forbear he may not get another in time <orig
      reg="especially">espetially</orig> if you are in as big a hurry as cousin Nannie R. I shall
     try to get the veil and dress. What cotton will you have it. The paper is unruled on the other
     side and I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> write on my knee. Judge sends love and speaks of you
     very often. I am your attached cousin, Kent. </p>
    <p>I shall expect to hear from you all often but you <orig reg="must  
 not">musent</orig> look
     for letters from me more than every 2 weeks.</p>
