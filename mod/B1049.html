                    <i>[deleted: 6]</i> (Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands) Series 1866 I have the honor to report that during the month of
                    October at the several trials in which the rights of Freedmen were involved,
                    equal justice was accorded, but in matters of controversy between Freedmen and
                    their employers it is nearly impossible to exact justice as the employees are
                    too poor to avail themselves of legal process in the courts, and much of the
                    evidence in proof of their accounts is powerless against the book accounts of
                    employers.</p>
<p class="p10">Everything I see goes to show that if not check existed on the action of courts
                    &amp; justices, Freedmen could not obtain justice in this Division.</p>
