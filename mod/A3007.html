<p class="p10">Sept 5<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10">I have just returned from witnessing the execution of ten North Carolinans belonging to the
      2<sup>nd</sup> Bridgage of our Division. They were shot for desertion, or rather
     for killing the officer who was arresting them. The <i>[unclear: affray]</i> took place near
     Scottsville Albemarle County Virginia. I tell you it was a solemn scene to witness. Each one of
     the men were tied to seperate stakes placed about 10 paces apart in a large field. Out entire
     division was then formed in two ranks around the field; <i>[unclear: there]</i> were so many
     men detailed out of the different Companies to shoot them &amp; they were divided into 10
     squads, with a reserve to each. After everything was ready the command fire was given All
     firing at the same time: the shots did not <i>[added: all]</i> take effect.
     Consequently the reserve had to be called in, this <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>looked still harder, to see them
     shot at the second time when they were in the agonies of death! but such was their lot. I trust
     they were prepared, and are now uniting their songs of praise with the Angels of God around his
     throne on high.</p>
<p class="p10">I must close for the present as it is now getting so dark I can scarcely see. Good night.
     Good night.</p>
<p class="p10">How are you this morning? Well I hope! I will add a few lines, although I am sorry to say
     that I have no news worth relating. The most news and the most we have now is, that we are
     going to Tennessee. It is said one division of our Corps has
     already gone. I trust however <u>we</u> will not go: would rather not. Everything remains quiet on the Rappahannock up to this time. Some
     little canonading has been heard in the direction of Fredricksburg during the past <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>week. Charleston still continues to hold out &amp; the greatest confidence prevails among
     the men &amp; the people of that place. Last Saturday week there was a <u>picnic</u> given by the Commissary <i>[unclear: &amp;]</i> Quartermasters &amp; of
     our division as a testimonial of their regard to General Johnson. All
     our Generals with the exception of Lee was present together with
     more than 100 ladies from the surrounding <i>[unclear: Country]</i>. They danced from early in
     the morning till sundown. everyone seemed to enjoy themselves very
     much some one way &amp; some another, strange to say I did not speak to a lady on the
     occasion but was merely an idle spectator. had the crowd been graced with <u>your</u> presence, I then could have enjoyed myself. But I must close.</p>
<p class="p10"> My love to all &amp; believe me to be as ever <u>yours</u>.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Frank</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Don't forget what I wrote you before</p>
