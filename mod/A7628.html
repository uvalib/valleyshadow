<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, June 22, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife that business is slow, and he is thinking about
                    shutting down. He discusses his health, his loneliness, his desire to come home,
                    and mutual friends. He sends messages for his children, and gives news of recent
                    battles and casualties.</p>
