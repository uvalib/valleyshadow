                        expan="received">recd.</abbr> and although I wrote you last night, I do so
                    again, here in my office, send on this formidable looking business sheet of
                    paper. You say you are going to Brunswick next week, and this may reach you
                    before you start. I am so sorry your sister Ella's letter has unsettled your
                    mind again as to the time. You now say <hi rend="underline">May</hi> instead of
                        <hi rend="underline">March</hi>. Well let it stand till I see you, and I am
                    sure we can agree. And if you are not a very firm and obstinate little woman I
                    will argue you into my views or be greatly mistaken.</p>

                <p>You have heard "jokes" on me? And want to know when I saw Miss Parke Perkins of
                        <abbr expan="Prince">Pr.</abbr> Edward. I saw the lady you mention in <abbr
                        expan="Prince">Pr.</abbr> Edward during the fall, though she does not live
                    there. She &amp; I were reported months ago to be engaged &amp; have had
                    a good deal of fun over it. We are the very <hi rend="underline">best</hi> of
                        <hi rend="underline">friends</hi> - <hi rend="underline">nothing more</hi>,
                    &amp; I hope we shall never be less. She is not a marrying woman - declares
                    she never will marry any man upon earth, &amp; I believe she will not. <hi
                        rend="underline">She certainly will never marry me</hi>. She is a Poet of a
                    good deal of genius &amp; I have several of her poems now in my hands to
                    have published - besides she is very beautiful. Now <orig reg="aren't"
                    >ain't</orig> you jealous? She sometimes comes to Richmond &amp; when you
                    are mistress of my household I shall want you to invite her to visit us. If
                    there had been any truth in our reported engagement, I shouldn't have so
                    hopelessly fallen a victim in Mecklenburg last August. I <orig reg="don't"
                    >dont</orig> deny that I felt <add hand="h1" place="inline">once</add> mighty
                    tender towards Miss Parke, but it has all ended in nothing but an abiding
                    friendship - and when I see her in Richmond this winter I'll tell her I belong
                    to you, and ask her if she isn't sorry?</p>

                <p>Now what are the other "jokes" - I am honest &amp; own up to the truth like a
                    man. I send you a slip from a Richmond paper of this week <orig reg="showing"
                        >shewing</orig> how near you will have a church to go to.</p>

                        sweet words to my dearest little sweetheart. "Bye bye" with a kiss.</seg>
