<p class="p10">June 9th</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Culpeper Court House</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I now seat myself to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well but very tired as
     we have been marching for several days. We left Fredericksburg
     last friday and got to Culpeper today. We are now camped on the road
     that leads to Sperryville Some think that we are going to the Valley and from there to Maryland
     &amp; Pennsylvania but I have no Idea myself where we are going all that I know is that I
     think it very probable there will be another battle near the Old Manassas fighting ground as the Yankees have all fallen back that way You should have
     been along to hear the cheering done by the men as they came in sight of the blue ridge many of
     them had not seen it since last fall when we crossed over from the valley. I must now close as
     I have not time to write we are cooking three days rations and I suppose the march will be
     resumed in the morning</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more but remain as ever your brother</p>
