<p class="p10">February 28<sup>th</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">
                        General
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit in compliance with Circular Number 6 C.S. 1866 the following Report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub-District for the Month of February 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">The Freedmen are generally at work, at an average rate of wages of ($10) ten
                    dollars per month and board for males and ($5) five dollars and board for
                    Females. There are but comparatively a few cases of extreme destitution among
                    them. them, and these are generally confined to the Aged, Sick and Crippled, and
                    those who have very large families of small children. About fifty person have
                    been assisted, by the gratuituous distribution of Clothing, during the month
                    sent here by the Pennsylvania
                    Freedman's Union Commission
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>There is a general complaint among them that they cannot collect
                    their wages when due which of course is a great disadvantage to them, and the
                    only assistance which can be rendered them by the <u>Bureau</u>
                    <u>
                        Agent
                    </u> is to draw off their Bills, and put them in the hands of an Officer for
                    collection. And this often results in judgement being deferred from one Court to another until their patience becomes
                    exhausted, and perhaps their families suffer for bread.</p>
<p class="p10">There is considerable suffering among the Sick, for want of proper medical
                    attendance, and I would earnestly recommend the employment (by the Bureau) of
                    one of the local Physicians, to attend to such as are unable, on account of
                    extreme destitution, to pay a Physician. Am of the opinion that one could be
                    employed at a salary of ($25) twenty-five dollars per month, who would attend to
                    all such cases, and to this point I would respectfully invite your special
                    attention.</p>
<p class="p10">I am General with much Respect<br>Your Obedient
                        Servant</p>

                        Superintendent</i></p>
