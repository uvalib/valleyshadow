                <p>I have a most agreeable surprise for you both, and you Ma would have given
                    anything had you instead of me, been the first one who met and welcomed back the
                    wanderer to his native soil. Last night I was standing in the passage with a
                    candle, when a very <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> looking man asked me if "Mrs <del hand="h1"
                    /> the confectioner lived here"! Told him "yes" he smiled then I knew him, it
                    was no other <orig reg="than">then</orig>

                    <hi rend="underline">S. <unclear>L.</unclear> Savage</hi> safe and well. Now you
                    will be pleased to learn how he got here and how he came released from
                    imprisonment. well he told those who had the authority to give him freedom, that
                    he was a union man, and Yankee from the city of New York, so <pb n="2"/> he was
                    exchanged, and sent to New York with other prisoners, he then left that city,
                    and came on to Norfolk, there he run the blockade, paying a man one hundred
                    dollars to pilot him across the river, came on to Richmond without further
                    molestations after that. He left this evening on the train for
                        <unclear>Grandma's</unclear>. I do think he is the happiest man to get back
                    I ever saw, he was going to Mt. Solon <orig reg="today">to day</orig>, but then
                    thought how anxious they were at home about him, concluded to go down at once.
                    You may look for him between the 9, and <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> next month, he is going
                    to Richmond and will come up by Mt. Solon, so he requested me to tell you, is
                    very anxious to see you and pa and asked about all the family <hi

                    dinner, which he praised wonderfully Oh! he had a severe time of it in prison
                    indeed, heard of Grandfathers' death while a prisoner said the
                    <unclear>sun</unclear> almost deranged him, heard in Baltimore that Grandma was
                    dead he Met Mr. Adam Deane in Richmond <pb n="3"/> who told him all about the
                        <unclear>battles</unclear> Mr. Mchenry, and Mr Mafus, Which grieved and

                    more of a union man, <orig reg="than">then</orig> papa, he really hates the
                    Yankees says it was grandpa's <unclear>sentiments</unclear> that placed him in

                    <unclear>who</unclear> fight. Which he could not prevent he had a high command
                    offered him in the federal Army which he quickly and firmly refused. The Yankees
                    had him in prison in Washington city for betting that Gen. <orig reg="McLellan"
                        >McLlelen</orig> could not defeat our Army on the Potomac. No indeed it
                    cannot he said with truth that Uncle Savage even entertains a single union
                    sentiment <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> never believe it in the world nor would you Ma and
                    papa. He said I should tell papa that he had beat him in <hi rend="underline"
                        >patent rights</hi>. The inventor Conrey of the Submarine fuse or battery,
                    sold or I think give him the liberty to sell his right to the Yankee Navy before
                    he was arrested, he came South last spring for the purpose of selling it to our
                    Navy <pb n="4"/> when <unclear>he</unclear> was made a prisoner not <del

                    but just one private who with others went and arrested him as a traitor to our
                    cause. You see he came here to sell this Submarine battery to our men for the
                    purpose of destroying the <unclear>masonry</unclear> of those <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>

                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> there dams. This new invention has proved its efficacy by
                    repeated trials. I wonder papa never thought of inventing something of the kind.
