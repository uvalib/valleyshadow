<p class="p10">My Dear Sister Sallie 
 </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 3<sup>rd</sup> inst was received last  
 week, and I was very glad to hear from you for I had not had a letter from you  
 for some time.  I would have written Sooner if I could  
 have Sent it.  The mail has not gone from here for the last week.  I thought I  
 would write this and have it ready when it does go.  I suppose<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> 
  
 you have arrived Safe in old Callensburg.  You will be quite a Stranger there  
 after being away so long.  And no doubt you will be very lonesome for a while.   
 It must be very quiet about the old Town; I would like very much to pay you a  
 visit this fall.  But I don't know whether I will or not.  It is pretty hard to get away, and  
 we can only get from twenty to twenty-five days leave and that is a short time  
 to go so far.  I would only have a few days to stay at home.  It is now over a  
 year since I saw you all at home.  And it seems like a long time.  But I hope  
 that this cruel war will<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> 
  
 soon be over (not that I am tired of fighting for the Cause in which we are  
 Engaged) so that we may be able to return to our homes and Enjoy peace and  
 happiness once more.  I suppose the <u>young</u> <u>gents</u> that just returned from the <u>War</u> have been telling you of the many <u>thrilling</u> <u>adventures</u> and  
 <u>hairbreath</u> <u>escapes</u>  
 which <u>they</u> <u>have</u>  
 made.  I suppose there was quite an Excitement about the time the Draft was  
 made?  No doubt there was a great many very uneasy.  We have one consolation.   
 <u>They</u> <u>can't</u> <u>draft</u> <u>us</u>.  Colonel Maxwell returned  
 last week but didn't bring any men with him.  We will  
 not act any until the next draft.  They are filling the Army of the Potomac  
 first.  Tell<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> 
  
 Father that I am looking for a letter from him.  I suppose Mother is busy  
 putting up Tomatoes.  give her a kiss for me.  I believe I have <u>nothing</u> <u>more</u> to  
 communicate this time.  Much love to Father, Mother, Grandmother, Uncle, Aunt  
 &amp; reserve a good portion for you Self. Write Soon &amp; often good byer.</p>
