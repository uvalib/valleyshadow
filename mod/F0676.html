<p class="p10">November 1<sup>st</sup> 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Bowling Green </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">I now take the opportunity of writing these few
                    lines to you to inform you that I am well hoping that they may find you all
                    Enjoying the same blessing I received a letter from
                    you some time ago but I never got a Chance to answer it for we have been
                    Marching ever since we stopped at Pinch Him Slyly on
                    the 25<sup>th</sup> of October and our
                    Tents came up to us there. the first time we saw them since we left Battle Creek
                    which is 2 month and five days ago and we had just got them Pitched when it
                    began to snow - it snowed the whole night and in the morning the snow was about
                    6 inches deep. <i>[added: it was]</i> the luckiest thing Ever happened us that they did come for
                    it was an awful cold night<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> we had four days skirmishing in which we
                    lost over 100 men Mike Huffnagle was among them but we heard since that he was
                    Paroled. Buell has been superceded by Rosenbrans Hambrights regiment is now about 2 or three miles behind us they
                    form Part of the left wing I see <i>[unclear: Nood Everly]</i> often he looks
                    first Rate and is doing well Hambright's men are satisfied that the Rebels don't fear gun
                    Powder and they say they don't care whether they get in another fight or not they say they wanted to get
                    into one fight and they had that so they would just as soon not get in any more
                    - they fought well and it's no telling how the Battle
                    would have gone if it hadn't been for the 79<sup>th</sup>
                    Pennsylvania and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Wisconsin for the 24<sup>th</sup>
                    Wisconsin were supporting Terrels Battery and they Ran the first fire and
                    Hambright had to make a flank<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Movement and <i>[added: thats]</i> where he got his men cut up so I <i>[deleted: what]</i>
                    don't know what forces were fighting on the Rebels side
                    for there was a dutchman of the 24<sup>th</sup>
                    Alabama that Deserted from Bragg's Army and he told us
                    that Bragg &amp; Kirby Smith were looking at us
                    crossing the Mountain at Lawrenceburgh They
                    had us pinned on the Mountain for about four hours. they
                        attacked our Rear and thought to draw us out
                    There was only our Division but Sills was too sharp for
                    them he hurried on the teams but they made out to get
                    16 of our wagons and 551 Prisoners out of the Division 75 our of our regiment the Dutchman said that Kirby smith had 35,000
                    under him and that Bragg was laying there with a heavy force, he didn't know how many but he said
                    that Bragg had 52,000 under him at one</p>
