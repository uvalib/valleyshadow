<p class="p10">Dear Pa</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to Ma from the Ferry on Saturday &amp; I will now write you a few lines. We got
     here yesterday from the Ferry, &amp; am quartered in a large hall opposite the United
     States Hotel &amp; am boarding at the Central &amp; Union Hotels. We have a very good
     time but I don't know how long it will last. I send you by James
     Patrick a Minnie Musket a present to you from John Lipscomb. I will get the moulds when I go to
     the Ferry. We don't know how long we will stay here. Tell Ma I stopped
     in Shepherdstown yesterday &amp; got my dinner at Grandma's. I saw all the folks they are
     all well. Grandpa came up here with me &amp; got his supper at Mr Rawlins. I went over this
     morning to see Mr Rawlins &amp; family. They are all well &amp; very glad to see me.
     Mrs R sent her son up for me. They send their love to all of you. Mollie says Sallie must write
     to her. They say Clinton &amp; Sallie must come down this summer. I am very well satisfied
     with camp life &amp; think I can get along very well. Grandpa says you &amp; Ma must
     come to see them this summer. I was introduced to Maj Robinson this morning he sends his
     respects to you. He seemed glad to hear you were improving. He invited me to his house for
     dinner. I intend going to Mr Rawlins tomorrow again. I want to see his tan yard. Our men behave
     very well. Any letters you write direct to Harpers Ferry care Capt James Patrick. There is a
     great many union men here &amp; black Republicans but I think we can get along with them
     without any difficulty. My <i>[unclear: horse]</i> stands it very well. I attend to her
     myself. I could have gotten Alfred Plumb to attend to her for $5 per week but I concluded I had
     better save it as all the boys attend to theirs. Tell Ma I will take good care of myself
     &amp; not keep any bad company. How are you getting along tanning. I saw Mr Kiblinger as I
     came up &amp; also Mr Connoly in Shepherdstown. I will go down and stay half day or so at
     Shepherdstown if we stay here. Capt Patrick says he will write to you in a short time. The
     Pistol you sent him he did not need he was made a present of one when we got here. He loaned it
     to James McClung who is a member of our company he will take good care of it. Should you need
     it let me know &amp; I will send it to you if I have a chance. As I have written an
     unusually long letter &amp; have some business to attend to I will stop. Write soon give my
     love to all. I will write again in a few days. Tell them all to write me.</p>
