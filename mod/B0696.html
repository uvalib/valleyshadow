<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waldo writes regarding the use of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the conflict

<p class="p10">By direction of the Assistant Commissioner
                    Richmond Virginia I most respectfully <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    in the matter of the difficulties existing <i>[unclear: between]</i> the
                    Methodists and Baptists in regard to the use of the Church building at
                    Waynesboro <i>[unclear: &amp;c]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: that the]</i> grant of $150 was made by the Bureau toward its
                    Erection with the express understanding that the building was to be used as a
                    house of <u>worship</u> by the <u>Methodist</u>
                    <u>denomination</u> and <u>as</u> a <u>schoolhouse</u>
                    <u>for</u>
                    <u>all</u>
                    <u>children</u>
                    <u>without</u>
                    <u>distinction</u> of <u>sect.</u> It is
                    expected <i>[unclear: therefore]</i> that the Methodists will do themselves no
                    discredit and their people no harm by trying to make the school in any way
                    denominational. It is further hoped and expected that both denominations will
                    unite in harmony in the use of said building for school purposes and that no
                    further difficulty may arise regarding it.</p>
