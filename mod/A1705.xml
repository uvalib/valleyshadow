                <p>I seat myself once more to write you a few more lines to let you know that I am
                    well and <orig reg="hearty">harty</orig> and I hope that when those few lines
                    reaches you they may find you all the same I haven't <orig reg="been writing"
                        >writting</orig> to you all in a good while nor haven't heard from you since
                    I left Culpepper and <orig reg="there">thare</orig> I wrote you a letter giving
                    you all the news up to that time but after that time <orig reg="we">wee</orig>
                    came very near having a fight <orig reg="there">thare</orig> but it turned out
                    so see did not fight and then <orig reg="we">wee</orig> took up our line of
                    march and marched to Berresville and <orig reg="there">thare</orig>
                    <orig reg="we">wee</orig> found 1600 <orig reg="Yankees">Yankes</orig> and <orig
                        reg="we">wee</orig> flanked <orig reg="there">their</orig> breastworks but
                    when <orig reg="we">wee</orig> marched up to fight they <orig reg="were"
                    >ware</orig> gone so <orig reg="we">wee</orig> did not get them but <orig
                        reg="we">wee</orig> continued the march and <orig reg="we">wee</orig> soon
                    got to Bunker's Hill <orig reg="where">whare</orig> General Jinkins had a fight
                    killing two of the enemy and wounding 11 and took 16 prisioners and the Yankes
                    wounded two of our men <orig reg="we">wee</orig> drove them to Martingsburg and
                        <orig reg="we">wee</orig> rushed in <orig reg="there">there</orig> and run
                    them out <orig reg="we">wee</orig> captured a piece of artillery and a good deal
                    of provisions but they run so that <orig reg="we">wee</orig> did not get them so
                    the next day <orig reg="we">wee</orig> marched and waded the Potomac and then we
                    were in Williamsport Md and then <orig reg="we">wee</orig> came to Hagerstown
                    and <orig reg="there">thare</orig>
                    <orig reg="we">wee</orig> took up camp bud did not stay long <orig reg="there"
                        >thare</orig> before <orig reg="we">wee</orig> started again and when <orig
                        reg="we">wee</orig> got to Middleburg <orig reg="we">wee</orig>
                    <orig reg="were">ware</orig> in Pennsylvania and the next town was named
                    Greencastle and you may believe that the people was very near <orig reg="scared"
                        >skerd</orig> to death but <orig reg="we">wee</orig> treated them with
                    respect and yesterday <orig reg="we">wee</orig> marched through Chambersburg and
                    it is a very nice place but in <orig reg="there">thare</orig> I found a good
                    meny disbanded soldiers from the <orig reg="Yankee's">Yankes</orig> army the
                    militia here is going to fight us I suppose but <orig reg="we">wee</orig> will
