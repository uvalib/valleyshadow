<p class="p10">Dec 6<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Gordonsville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister Addie</p>
<p class="p10">You complain of my not writing home often enough I have not been making excuses before this because I have none to make but here lately I have <i>[deleted: had not]</i> not had any paper and today I went to Capt Eskridge and he gave me
     this little bit. I would like to have been home when Mike was there but I would much sooner
     come home X Mass &amp; from what you said in your letter I expect to be there then. Dr.
     Williams got here last tuesday &amp; said the Col would certainly be here on the next
     tuesday I hope he will how did you like him I like him very much he is a nice man. Dr Burton
     &amp; Col Burks had a little fuss and the Dr sent in his resignation the Col accepted it
     &amp; forwarded it this took the <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/garb11b.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/garb11b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      little fellow by surprise and he begged to withdraw it stating as his reason
     that he intended to get a transfer &amp; then he applied for that and in a few days he
      withdrew that so we can't get rid of him
     which every man in the Regiment wishes to do. Has Capt Balthis
     resigned or not tell me in your next letter. Where is Mike Company at now. I heard that Earley division was in the Luray Valley I hope it is left there for then the
     boys will have a chance to get home X Mass. On the 29th of Nov we had
     a little fight with the Yanks they had got in between us &amp; Winchester before we knew
      anything about it. Old Allen the driver had riden one of the
      wagon horses out to get some clothes washed when the news came so I
     put my horse in the wagon and got on the one of the Col and started for Berrysville with the
     Regiment Major Massie in command we only had about 100 men we cut off a squadron of the yankees
     and could not get the men to charge them the Major ordered a charge &amp; about half of the
     men went the flag was in front in that crowed the rest of them stayed <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="/papers/images/garb11c.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/garb11c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     in the woods the Major ordered me back to bring them up I went back
     and tried to get them to come but could not do it they were cowards
     and would not go they started towards town I went with them and when we got there I heard there was some Yanks on the other side I asked the men would they go
     with me they said they would so we started off at a gallop and just
     before I turned the corner I looked around and saw the men going up sneak like the old boy was
     after them I then determined to see how many Yank they were &amp; report to the Major I
     went on around the corner and looked down the street and there was a whole Yankee Regiment I
     had my pistol in may hand I raised it up and fired it wheeled my horse and started up the
     street 8 or 10 Yanks after me shooting and howling like brave men after one man with a flag, I
     never run a horse faster in all of my life. And the next morning <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="/papers/images/garb11d.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/garb11d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      when I got to town I came in by myself with the <u>old flag</u> hanging on my shoulders as hungry as a bear (for I
     had not anything to eat <i>[deleted: since]</i>for 24 hours) an
     old lady was at standing at the door as soon as she saw me she hollered at the top of her voice Oh Sally come here here is that Color bearer &amp;
     then she pitched in to thus come in sir come in I so glad to see you I was sure the yanks had
     gotten come in &amp; get your Breakfast I told her certainly &amp; I went in &amp;
     got a firstrate breakfast so much running out of town with the
     Yankees after me. I hope to be with you X mass if not it won't be
     because I don't want to come for I don't know hardly how much I would give to see you all Good by give my love
     to Pa Ma Kate &amp; Nellie and Sister Seal &amp; Margie.</p>
