<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">it is with much pleasure that I embrace
     the present opportunity of answering your most welcome letter that I received on the 15 instant I was glad
     to hear that you was well and getting
     along well. I had rather Come to the
     Conclusion that you had forgotten your promise
     about writing but I believe that you are a man
     of truth. what has become of Jas Mc I have not
      heard from him since he left. I would be glad
     to hear from you all often. Well Thomas I
     Suppose you was in the last battle that <u>Jack</u> had with the yankees how
     did you come out was you hurt or not<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley13b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley13b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
    I have had no Correct news from the Company
     Since the Battle. I heard that Baylor and
     Bowers was killed I am truly Sorry that it is too true I heard that
      there was Some three or four wounded but Could
     not learn who they
     were except <i>[unclear: John Gabboit]</i>
     there is so many reports going that we cant tell
     what is Correct. you Say that you heard that I am to be married this
     fall I think Sir you have
     been misinformed about that matter but I only
     hope it may be true if it Should be the case I certainly will take
     Pleasure in Sending you Some of the Cake but I fear that there is no Such good luck as that the Girls all
     want to wait until the war is over if that be the Case I dont think
     that I will Stand much chance. Well Thomas I dont think I have
     any news to tell you at this time there is a
      great deal of Sickness in the neighborhood you Can hear of a death most
     every day<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley13c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley13c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
