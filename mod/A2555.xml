    </opener>

    <p>I have gotten up this early to write you a few lines -- I have not heard from you for a long
     time though I know you have written, but our course has been so erratic that letters have not
     been able to find us. We have gained a great advantage here -- we went into <abbr
      expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> leaving some 12000 of the enemy here in the Valley -- by going
     into <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> we cut them off from their communication, left a force
     to keep them cut off - then swept round by Frederick, Middletown &amp; Williamsport and
     then swept them out of Martinsburg and gathered them all into Harper's Ferry &amp; then
     came down here Saturday last and completed the <unclear>investment</unclear> of the peace --
     having troops on all sides of it - - we put cannon on the Blue Ridge, drove them off the <abbr
      expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> Heights and turned the artillery there against them, so by Monday
     Morning we had everything in readiness &amp; when we opened on them they found opposition
     of no use with raw troops such as they had and they surrendered unconditionally 11000 men, over
     1000 horses, any quantity of wagons, tents, ammunition, 60 pieces of artillery,
     <unclear>7</unclear> splendid guns, about 15000 stand of arms, all new &amp;c &amp;c --
     one of the greatest captures of the war &amp; we hardly lost anything -- true McClellan
     came on in force to relieve the place and Longstreet had great difficulty in keeping him at bay
     &amp; lost some men by it, some distance from us in <abbr expan="Maryland">Md</abbr> -- --
     There were two complete Regiments there from Cayuga &amp; Wayne Co. N.Y. -- The best of the
     people there, only 4 weeks from home many of them knew Dr. Rounds &amp; the Hotchkisses of
     Cayuga. I wrote by Col. <unclear>Segom</unclear> a line to let our relations know that we were
     well &amp;c -- We paroled all the prisoners &amp; sent them off home yesterday I found
     all the New Yorkers glad they were taken, and anxious to go home -- the officers, many of them
     intend to resign at once -- a Major from Palmyra gave me his revolver &amp; told me four
     weeks was enough for him &amp; had altered his opinions completely. I never saw a more
     splendidly dressed set of men -- the officers were all splendidly equipped &amp; every
     thing there was new -- artillery &amp; all - nothing escaped but 1000 Cavalry that got out
     along the tow path up the Potomac by a mile -- We have had a good many skirmishes with
     McClellan &amp; have lost something because our main force was directed here, but our
     troops were massed night before last and a battle was fought yesterday morning from which
     nothing reliable has been heard, though it is rumored that Burnsides &amp; 13000 men were
     captured near Sharpsburg &amp; Shepherdstown I hardly believe it. I am going there today --
     We blew up the <abbr expan="Railroad">R.R.</abbr> bridge at the Ferry yesterday -- I bought
     some goods for Allen a suit of clothes yesterday, will send home the first chance &amp;
     this will be soon I suppose. Everything here goes towards <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr>
     again --</p>
    <p> Write often &amp; through the old channel -- for I am anxious about you all -- If
     victory keeps with us, as heretofore we shall end this war soon &amp; may God grant it that
     we may soon get home. Read the news to the neighbors &amp; thank God for our victory --
     Love to all -- &amp; kisses for Nelly and Anna -- We got about 1500 slaves back -- Good bye
     &amp; God bless you </p>
