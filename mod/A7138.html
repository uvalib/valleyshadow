<h4>Augusta County: John Scott to E. P. Smith, January 18, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott expresses satisfaction over the arrival of a new teacher, Margaret Burke.  He also applauds the efforts of other teachers in Staunton, but comments that he is frustrated with local blacks, saying that the "colored people are so crotchety here there is no telling how long they will permit Northern Societies to labor for them." [Scott misdates this letter]</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Burke came Saturday night went into Sab Schl yesterday and will take charge of her department in the day school to day.  She is truly welcome</p>
<p class="p10">We have now 150 day scholars--<u>and still they come</u>--as ever.  The beding has not arrived but as Miss Burke has some already with her I doubt whether we shall need it  Shall I sell it to some of these Colored people now while it is winter and they need it--if I can get nearly cost.</p>
<p class="p10">We might make permanent arrangement for a Mission House I presume but as the colored people are so crotchety here there is no telling how long they will permit Northern Societies to labor for them.</p>
<p class="p10">Mrs Davison is doing <u>first rate</u> and we could not now part with her.</p>
<p class="p10">The Ladies would live very much the "New York Independent" and we should be glad of the "American Missionary"--no numbers of which have yet been received by us.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
