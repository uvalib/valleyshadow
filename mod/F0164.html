<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind letter and was very happy to hear from you and to hear that you were all well we
                    are all well but myself i have been sick for a few days
                    with the <i>[illeg.]</i> in my head it was the awfullest pain i ever had today i am sitting up but have still pain above my right eye i was
                    down at Sturgeon bay last week after ducks and geese there is where i caught
                    cold Wasburn and i went down in a sailboat and it
                    rained all the time we were gone three days we only shot 2 geese 7 ducks and 1 <i>[illeg.]</i> CS Mull
                    was down the week before I was and shot 4 geese &amp; 3
                    <i>[unclear: brants]</i> &amp; 4 ducks when i was down i trapped 9 muskrats &amp; a groundhog when i was
                    washing my gun in camp there was a deer came swimming and stopped right in front of me it then heard or saw me and swam over to
                    the other side, nothing of importance going on here at present<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> we don't
                    hear much war news anymore
                    leave me know whether there is anything going on
                    there leave me know if you hear from John or Josey
                    Walker leave me know if Peter Ziegler has gone to war
                    when you write me give me all the particulars
                    nothing of importance going on here, times are very dull the people won't get
                        anything done until after the war is over and
                    that is hard to tell when that will be we can only hope it will be soon</p>
<p class="p10">No more at present We all unite in sending our love
                    to you</p>
<p class="p10">Your Brother </p>
