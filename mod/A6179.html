<h4>Augusta County: Buford C. Tynes to Achilles L.
                    Tynes, January 26, 1948<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Buford C. Tynes writes his brother Achilles L. Tynes responding to his inquiries
                    about their father's association with McCausland in the burning of Chambersburg

                    tells of an incident between his uncle Charles A. Fudge and Col. Peters and asks
                    Achilles if he knows any of the details.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>BUFORD C. TYNES<br>ATTORNEY &amp; COUNSELLOR<br>HUNTINGTON, W.VA.
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 26, 1948</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton,<br>Virginia.</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Achilles:</p>
<p class="p10">Your inquiry as to what I recall concerning Father's association with McCausland
                    in the burning of Chambersburg on July 31st [1864] is quite an order.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Freeman gives somewhat more than average space to the notorious Chambersburg
                    raid and its aftermath and consequences (Lee's Letters, Volume 111, pages 571-574). In order that
                    you may contrast what Freeman says with what General McCausland himself said on
                    the subject, sixty years after the event, I am sending you under separate cover,
                    to be returned to me when you are through with it, copy of the September 1940
                    issue of American Legion Magazine which carries an interview General McCausland
                    gave Mr. Garnett Laidlaw Eskew in the summer of 1925, nearly two years before
                    the General's death (on January 27, 1927) at the age of 89 years. I enclose
                    herewith, for like and to my mind more authentic comparison with the American
                    Legion article and with Mr. Freeman's account, a typed reproduction of the
                    following communications from Father to Mother, all written in pencil, much of
                    it on horseback, and some of it scarcely decipherable, recounting the incidents
                    immediately preceding, coincident with and following the Chambersburg raid:</p>
<p class="p10">1. <u>Memo</u> bearing the date line "<u>Two
                        miles below Bunker Hill, 5 o'clock A.M., July 25, '64"</u>, from which you
                    will note that he was aware of the fact that something momentous was in the
                    planning, just what he obviously did not know.</p>
<p class="p10">2. <u>Letter</u> bearing the date line "<u>Headquarters 5th Cavalry
                        Brigade, Haynesville, near Williamsport,</u>
                    July <u>28, 1864</u>", which indicates that he had by that
                    time been apprised of what was in the offing and of its dangers.</p>
<p class="p10">3. "<u>Notes</u> on the Battlefield and in the Saddle for
                    Hattie", commencing with July 29th and ending with August 8th, 1864.</p>
<p class="p10">4. <u>Letter</u> bearing the date line, "<u>Headquarters McCausland's Brigade</u>., <u>Mt. Jackson,
                        Va.</u>, <u>August 9th,
                    1864</u>", enclosing and supplementing the foregoing "Notes", which might have
                    been before Mr. Freeman when writing his report and estimates of Chambersburg
                    and its dramatis personae.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Father's line command had been, of course, the ith Va. Cavalry, but
                    at Chambersburg he was A.C.S. (Acting Commissioner of Supplies?) of McCausland's
                    Brigade, seemingly outranking General Bradley's Commissioner of Supplies on this expedition into
                    Pennsylvania for the same reason that Brigadier General McCausland (27 years
                    old) outranked Brigadier General Bradley Johnson, vis. because General Early had
                    placed McCausland in overall command of the Confederate Forces. The September
                    1910 Confederate Veterans article on Aunt Mollie Tynes "Ride" gives the
                    following biographical data on Father:</p>
<p class="p10">"8th Virginia Cavalry. Served as Lieutenant one year, then as Regiment, Brigade
                    and Division Commissary. Served on staffs of Colonel Corns, Brigadier Generals
                    Jenkins and McCausland and Major Generals Lomax and Rosser."</p>
<p class="p10">I enclose a typed copy of Father's parole, on the face of which you will note he
                    is described as "Captain
                    Acting Commissioner of Supplies 8th Va. Cavalry", while Father's longhand notation on the back
                    refers to the fact that at Appomattox he was "Acting Commissioner of Supplies of Confederate States of America, General Rosser's
                    Cavalry Division". According to his notation, "This division, or part of it,
                    broke the Federal Lines on the day of the surrender" (Lee's Lieutenants, Volume 111, page 737) and "with McCausland's Brigade I came to
                    Lynchburg, thence home to Tazewell County, Va.".
                    Brownstown (now Marmet), mentioned in this notation of Father's, is on the south
                    or east side of the Kanawha River, about 18 miles above Charleston. As you know,
                    following his parole, Father took the boat to Cincinnati where he purchased and
                    transported by boat up the Ohio <i>[deleted: T]</i>to Catlettesburg, then up
                    the Big Sandy, as far as push boats could go, and then over the Sandy Ridge to
                    Rocky Dell, Tazewell County, by pack horses, the first carding machines ever to
                    be installed west of Lynchburg.</p>
<p class="p10">Until I unearthed Father's parole, some fifteen years or so ago, Colonel George
                    S. Wallace and other historians in this part of the country seemed to have
                    assumed that General McCausland "never surrendered" but had, on the day before
                    Lee surrendered at Appomatox, fled to Mexico where during the next two years he
                    enjoyed intimacy with Maximillian, for whose wife he named his only daughter,
                    Charlotte. General John Hunt Oley, (New York State) USA, Provost Marshal for the
                    Department of West Virginia, mentioned in this notation of Father's, remained in
                    West Virginia following the war, coming to Huntington the year of its founding
                    in 1871, where he became and remained, up until his death in 1888, the City's
                    "first citizen" -- capitalist, educator, churchman, having founded and for
                    fifteen years being the Senior Warden of Trinity Episcopal Church.</p>
<p class="p10">Now as to the date of Father's visit to General McCausland. I came to Huntington
                    in September 1910 and I know that Father immediately began writing me about
                    paying me and General McCausland a visit "next summer". About April 1, 1911, I
                    went to the new Kentucky river Region coal fields, in consequence of a three
                    months contract with Kountze Brothers coal interests which was extended over
                    thirty years, and did not get back <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> to Huntington again for about six
                    months. I am pretty sure it was during this six months period in 1911 that
                    Father paid the visit to General McCausland. I remember Mother saying to me
                    afterwards that she would love to have looked in on Father and the General
                    during the second evening of their reminiscing, by which time she was sure they
                    must have been at each other's throats. The General's daughter, Miss Charlotte,
                    is still living at the old home place up the Kanawha River some twenty miles
                    from Point Pleasant. Either two of his sons, whose tempers are quite up to that
                    of their Father and who were quite as embittered as he, have been tried for
                    murder during past years, or else one has been tried twice, with one conviction,
                    for which he has long since been paroled. I planned several times to visit Miss
                    Charlotte, but never did so, in view of the circumstances just mentioned. I
                    purpose yet doing so.</p>
<p class="p10">Reminded of the circumstance by Freeman's reference to Colonel William E.
                    Petters' brief imprisonment by General McCausland for refusing to carry out his
                    (really Early's) orderto burn Chambersburg (Lee's Lieutenants, Volume 111, page
                    572), I recall the following colloquy which ensued between Colonel Peters and me
                    at the close of my first Latin lecture in September, 1901:</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel
                    Peters: I see from my class roster that you are from
                    Tazewell, Sir. Did you ever know Captain C. A. Fudge, and is he still living?</p>
<p class="p10">Buford C. Tynes: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel
                    Peters: Will you be seeing him again soon? I have not
                    seen him since the summer of '64.</p>
<p class="p10">Buford C. Tynes: Yes, Sir, I hope to see him if and when
                    I get home for Christmas. He is my uncle -- my Mother's only brother.</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel
                    Peters: (Embracing me, with moist eyes). Captain Fudge
                    and I had some heated differences at <u>Chambersburg</u> (or
                    so I seem now to recall it) which we mutually agreed to settle on a personal
                    basis rather than under the rules of war, with the consequence that we parted
                    company with the tacit understanding that he with the quickest trigger and
                    truest aim would tell the story of our next encounter. Hearing, while passing
                    through Charlottesville, the Captain Fudge was in our old infirmary here,
                    suffering from a gangrenous shoulder wound, I called to pay him my respects and
                    to extend to him my apologies, but finding him under the influence of an
                    anesthetic I was unable to see him. Our paths never again crossed. When you <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> see him I want you to convey to him assurances of my high esteem and
                    affectionate regards and to say to him that he was right and I wrong and that I
                    trust he has forgiven me.</p>
<p class="p10">I immediately wrote Mother the substance of this colloquy. Beyond telling me that uncle Charlie had been greatly touched
                    by Colonel Peters' message, I do not recall that either Mother or uncle Charlie
                    ever added to Colonel Peters' narrative. According to Freeman, at Chambersburg,
                    Colonel Peters was Commander of the 21st Virginia Cavalry which doubtless was a
                    part of either McCausland's or Johnson's Cavalry Brigade. Why uncle Charlie, who
                    was then Captain of Company H, 45th Virginia Infantry, should have been at
                    Chambersburg, has never been clear to me since according to cousin Newt Harman's
                    Annals of Tazewell County, Volume Two, page 454, uncle
                    Charlie "was desperately wounded and was captured by the enemy and remained in
                    prison until the close of the war", in the Battle of Piedmont, which Freeman
                    says was fought on June 5, 1864. Cousin Newt, of course was in error about his
                    "remaining in prison until the close of the war", the fact being that he was not
                    taken prisoner at all in that battle, but after being wounded was taken across
                    the Blue Ridge to the Confederate Hospital in Charlottesville, later the
                    University of Virginia Infirmary, Left, as you know with a limp shoulder and
                    arm, he never again saw service.</p>
<p class="p10">A further circumstance that throw cold water on my recollection of my above
                    quoted colloquy with Colonel Peters is the fact that uncle Charlie condemned and
                    deplored the burning of Chambersburg just as much as did Colonel Peters and
                    Father, so that that incident would not have been a matter upon which uncle
                    Charlie and Colonel Peters differed to the point of being ready to shoot one
                    another at sight.</p>
<p class="p10">It is inescapable, therefore, that the incident to which Colonel Peters referred was in nowise connected with the burning of
                    Chambersburg, as I have for so long thought, but took place prior thereto,
                    indeed, prior to the Battle of Piedmont on June 5, 1864. Can you help me out on
                    this, or the subject, or if not can you tell me who can? I have thought of
                    writing Don Peters on the subject, but do not know whether he is still living,
                    and doubt if he could shed any light on the subject if he is. I know Don
                    slightly, when I returned to the University for my law in 1908-10.</p>
<p class="p10">Trusting that you will find what you want in the foregoing hastily prepared
                    narrative,</p>
<p class="p10">Affectionately your brother,</p>
