      >wee</orig> have had orders to send <orig reg="off">of</orig> our <orig reg="extra">extry</orig>

     request of the men I do not <orig reg="know">now</orig> how it will <orig reg="be">bee</orig>

      <orig reg="been">bin</orig> assigned to command of the <orig reg="valley">valey</orig> he
     wants us mounted and assigned to his command. I am afraid this will fail but wish it may not if
     I must fight I would rather fight in the <orig reg="valley">valey</orig> than <orig
      reg="anywhere">eney wheare</orig>
     <orig reg="else">elce</orig>
