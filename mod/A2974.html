<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Amanda C. Armentrout,
                    January 9, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William writes to Kate that he does not feel for her as he once did because he
                    thought that she had changed her feelings for him but that he still loves her.
                    He also describes how he spent Christmas and New Years while discussing family
                    members.</p>

<p class="p10">Jan 9th '66</p>
<p class="p10">Alone Mills</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter yesterday. after reading
                    &amp; rereading it my feelings were tinged with a
                    degree of sadness now I have taken your letter before me, for the purpose of
                    trying to answer its details something I never tried before &amp; believe it
                        impossible now. While I gaze on you epistle my
                    mind wanders &amp; I cannot center it on no one
                    subject. Now believe me I am going to try to write what my heart shall dictate.
                    You are well aware I once loved you devotedly yes passionately up to the time of
                    our first estrangement
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Since then I have never have ceased to love
                    you. But I cannot confine it to the burning love I once enjoyed. Can I help it
                    that I changed, I withdrew my affections at a time when I thought all was lost
                    that was dear to me. Oftimes since then I have tried to be the same loving
                    Willie I once was, but it seems that I have failed Now don't
                    believe that you are forgotten for no other woman has
                    ever touched a tender cord within my breast. You are
                    in my mind from morning till eve, yes my only desire to live is to perpetuate
                    your happiness, give your hand to another &amp; I will <i>[added: leave]</i> this country which will be a proof of
                    my feelings for you <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I am so careless my
                    bright visions of the future may soon fade your mind must have been pushed to an
                    unusual degree of termperament when you wrote I
                        don't
                    believe I could commit to memory all the charges you
                        preferred, I will not attempt to excuse my self
                    of any for very probably I am guilty of all I spent a Merry Christmas
                    &amp; a pleasant New Year, Every girl that fell to my lot to entertain was flattered to a limited extent So you may term me a cold careless
                    flattere &amp; of the world worldly my early
                    landmarks have all nearly been erased, what do I live for. My heart says thee
                    while my actions do not prove it you may doubt this writing <i>[added: but it is the truth]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>What more shall I say shall I fill this page with loving ephithets or
                    with the sad realities of my changed nature. You once knew me as a devout follower of our meek &amp; generous Savoir. But
                    alas for a long time I had only a name to live while dead. This may be the saddest letter you ever received from me I never intend to hide any of my faults from you. I
                    know not what kind of a reply this may bring be what it may I hope it may have
                    its desired effect. Alas you will say Willie will soon be a ruined youth it may
                    be so, but I hope to the contrary I am certain the intoxicating cup shall never
                    drag me down in its ruinous path of misery. <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>Since I left Augusta The
                        great I am has called for some of her fairest
                    duels. It seems that the fairest flowers are always smitten first. I received a letter some time ago from my darling sister
                    oh how I long for her embrace. Brother C was up to
                    see me last night got here late yesterday evening
                    &amp; started early this morn. He is looking quite well, don't seem to take it very hard about loosing Bette, mans hard heart
                    is hard to break Dear Kate I pick up your letter and
                    look at it. Then say I cannot answer it, do not know how to commence so I will
                    wait hoping I may soon see you, when I can answer it more satis<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>factorily than by writing I expect to make my apperance in old Augusta
                    Saturday week will call on you unless sooner
                    prohibited Do not let this unintelligible
                    letter give you any trouble. If your hand is given to
                    another before I get down I hope you will let me have the pleasure of taking it once more Bro C told
                    me that J.V. &amp; J.H. was at a party at your house some time ago very good
                    joke on them</p>
<p class="p10">Please write soon I will promise to try and do better
                    next time If I have written any thing to hurt your feelings please excuse I
                    remain yours in hope in love &amp; until death
                    shall us divide</p>
<p class="p10">Your</p>
