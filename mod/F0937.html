<p class="p10">Nov. 19, 1862.</p>
<p class="p10">Mercer,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">The papers announce your return, and if I could afford it, I would make a trip to
                    see and have a talk with you.</p>
<p class="p10">I have just received a letter from my son, announcing that he has joined his
                    company, in the regular army, at New Orleans. The commission to which his is
                    indebted to you for, never reached him till the whole peninsular campaign was
                    ended. He was in most of the battles there.</p>
<p class="p10">Where is my friend Pritchette? The papers do not record his outgoings and
                    incomings as they do yours, and I would be glad to hear from him or of him.</p>
<p class="p10">Our democrats are quaking in their boots, lest you are again in the field for
                    Senator - and feel a little<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> like the coon that Capt. Scott pointed
                    his rifle at. They are willing "to come down," when they learn who is after
                    them.</p>
<p class="p10">Wm.G. Rose, Esq. of this place is an applicant for paymastership in the army, and
                    has papers on file at Washington. He has asked me to write to you on the
                    subject. He was your friend in this county against Stewart, when you were up for
                    the Presidency, and was the principal man. He got the nomination for the county
                    for Congress last fall, and when this county gets the candidate, Rose will be
                    the man. He now holds the political influence of this county in his hands,
                    having got ahead of Stewart by his industry and tact. It would be well for you,
                    if you desire to retain your hold on the county, to keep him your friend. I
                    would be glad to see Rose get anything that he<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> wants, but I make no
                    request on the subject. He asked me, I promised, and I have now performed.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Wm. S. Garvin</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Hon. S. Cameron<br> Harrisburg
