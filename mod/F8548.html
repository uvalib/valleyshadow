<h4>Franklin County: Andrew G. Curtin to Edward
                    McPherson, August 22, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Andrew G. Curtin [the future Governor of Pennsylvania] writes McPherson about his
                    discussion with a Mr. Jordan, successfully urging Jordan not to run for
                    governor. Curtin asks McPherson to contact people about Senatorial candidates in
                    his district.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Honorable Edward McPherson
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">22 August 1859</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Bellefonte
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir--</p>
<p class="p10">After you left Bedford Mr. Jordan and I had a full and frank
                    <i>[unclear: consation]</i> on the subject of the renomination for Governor by
                    our party next year.</p>
<p class="p10">The result was a perfect understanding of each other, and he will not be a
                    candidate. The time at which he <i>[unclear: should]</i> answer this
                    determination he has not fixed. I've a letter received from him on Friday he seems to think he had
                    better not assume it immediately He intends to write you and no doubt you will
                    hear from him.</p>
<p class="p10">In the meantime I understand the senatorial delegate
                    in the Mifflin Juniata Perry and Cumberland district
                    will be appointed at the <i>[illeg.]</i> to nominate a candidate for the
                    Senate--</p>
<p class="p10">Will you <i>[unclear: pass]</i> to look after it a little -- Write (if you so
                        <i>[unclear: incline]</i>) Patterson and <i>[unclear: Sellars]</i>, and do
                    whatever else your judgement may indicate-- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I write you as Mr Jordan
                    thought that you would help us, and I am encouraged by the conversation we had
                    at Bedford.</p>
<p class="p10">I think you can secure the delegate-- Mifflin is all right but I do not know of
                    any active <i>[illeg.]</i> I have in the other counties--</p>
<p class="p10">Patterson is not for sure but I presume can be influenced.</p>
<p class="p10">I will be much obliged for any assistance you can give me--</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>A. G. Curtin</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I will try and see you in <i>[illeg.]</i> where I
                        wish a full conversation with you -- Where will
                        you be after the 12<sup>
                            <u>th</u>
                        </sup> of the month.</p>
