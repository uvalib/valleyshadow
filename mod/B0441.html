<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, October 26, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson writes to McDonnell about the case of York Kidd, who would be able to pay
                    his way to Tennessee to live with his children if he were able to settle a claim
                    against R. W. Smith. McDonnell instructs Jackson what action to take in the
                    attached endorsement.</p>

<p class="p10">October 26 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">I respectfully ask if Transportation can be furnished from Staunton, Augusta
                        County
                    Virginia to Nashville Tennessee for York Kidd freedman.
                    York is now about 60 years old and in failing health. his family sold from him
                    to Tennessee, write they will take good care of him if he can reach there. There
                    is about his case a circumstance it is proper to mention, that York has a claim
                    against a Mr. R.W. Smith of Staunton which could he collect, would more than pay
                    his expenses, but I cannot compel Smith to settle even partially &amp; York
                    has not means to sue.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient servant</p>
