<p class="p10">Monday Morning -- 15<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Monterey </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sara</p>
<p class="p10">The stage is now going &amp; I only write for fear you did not get my letter from
     Yeager's saying I was &amp;c -- We got here last night -- shamefully hurried on -- a
     disgraceful retreat, but the loss will be regained -- the men came in slowly, but will most of
     them get here I think &amp; our loss will not be much. There is a large body of troops here
     now &amp; I hear that orders have been issued for going back -- &amp; I am glad of it
     -- our Col. has not come yet -- I led out the men on one side -- I got drawers, coat &amp;
     socks in Beverly, took them from the public stores just before the enemy came in -- I only need
     2 shirts -- but you need not send me anything now -- I will send you the money tomorrow to get
     some grey cloth for a pair of pants -- I do not want anything sent now. As I wrote before, only
      <i>[unclear: Wymont]</i> &amp; James Wilson are missing of the
     Cavalry &amp; they are thought to be killed surely. The rest of the Augusta men escaped
     safely -- I got yours of the 19<sup>th</sup> last night -- made me feel happy --
     hope you <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> are all well -- love to all Kiss the children -- Pa often wants to be with
     them &amp; ma -- I am now entirely at sea &amp; do not know what I shall do -- All the
     Augusta Militia will be here tomorrow I will write again -- God bless you -- Did you get the $5
     I sent you -- Write to me here -- I have had no time to write &amp; am pretty much used up
     after a retreat of 60 miles day &amp; night -- but got cleaned up last night &amp;
     slept well -- I will write to Nelson too if we stay here at all </p>
<p class="p10">Truly</p>
