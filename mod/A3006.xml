<salute>Dearest Annie,</salute> 
</opener> 

<p>In obediance to the Presidents proclamation, followed by an <hi rend="underline">order</hi> from <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Lee, all military operations will be suspended (so far as practicable) during this day and religious exercises be conducted throughout the Brigade. I had the pleasure of listening to an excellent sermon this morning delivered by the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev<hi rend="super">d</hi></abbr> Mr. <unclear>Cee</unclear>, Pastor of Tinkling Spring Congregation.</p>
<p>He read for his morning's sermon the 4<hi rend="super">th</hi> Chapter of Daniel, prefaced by a few remarks &amp; then took for his text, the words found recorded in the 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> Chapter of the 1st Epistle general of Peter and 6<hi rend="super">th</hi> Verse. This evening at 4 we will have another sermon by one of our Chaplains &amp; again <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig> by the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev<hi rend="super">d</hi></abbr> Mr. Filetoken.</p>
<p>So we will have plenty of preaching, &amp; I trust will be profited thereby. I will stop writing now, as our dinner is ready, and <pb n="2"/>if I don't go in time won't get anything, as our rule is, "never to quit, <orig reg="until">untill</orig> every thing has been eaten._ Will finish this evening.</p>
<p>Saturday morning. Aug <del rend="none" hand="h1"/></p>
<p>Annie:      I failed to finish my letter yesterday owing to the fact that there was a lot of clothing came in to the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> which had to be issued out to the different Companies, which necessarily consumed some time and then the preaching. I must say that yesterday was one of the most interesting days I hve ever spent in camp; it <unclear>appeared</unclear> more like sunday that if it had been, so quiet was every thing around. By the way there were some dozen ladies in camp too who added very much to the interestingness of the occasion.</p>
<p>I would have liked so much could I have been with you all. Suppose the <unclear><abbr expan="Doctor">Dr</abbr></unclear> held <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> at Providence or was it his time at the Ridge? Suppose you had a gay time while the Miss <unclear>Corrans</unclear> were down. Would liked <pb n="3"/>to have happened in some night about the time you were cutting up, as I know you did. Every thing is quiet, there has been no fighting on our lines <orig reg="for">fore</orig> some time, &amp; is thought by some wont be for some time to come. The bombardment is still going on at Charleston &amp; it is said, is beginning to tell on Fort Sumpter. Shouldn't be <orig reg="suprised">supprised</orig> to hear of Sumpter falling at any time; however we will hope for the best.</p>
<p>Did you get a letter I wrote you from this camp? You have not acknowledged the receipt of it as yet.</p>
<p>I must close for the present, with the hope of hearing from you soon.</p>
