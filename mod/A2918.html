                    cloth to make a winter cloak, but tells Enos not to buy any in Richmond unless

<p class="p10">Willow Row</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">Hannah received your letter Saturday we were glad to hear from you we are all well Henry is cutting up the meat and salting. we have a good snow the ground is covered and it is quite
                        cold. the mercury stood at 12 last night and this
                    morning. M<sup>r</sup> Black and James Cooper
                    went down to Staunton last Tuesday. J told me your
                    papers come monday evening so they got there the right time they were laying on the table when
                    they went down. what are they doing with our men from the valley I think they
                        might have left them here M<sup>r</sup>
                    Row has
                    your boots made but I think they are too small. he was
                    to start to the army or to Staunton Saturday. you spoke
                        about going to Richmond
                    the next day after you wrote to see about the cloak cloth I did not expect you to pay over a 100 a yard when I wrote to you
                    last when I sent the sample you spoke about a piece that was less than one 100.
                    I thought maybe it was as good as Hannahs if so it would
                        do I thought I had told you that if I did not that
                    was what I meant if you haven't
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>got it yet never mind when I sent the sample I expected you to look at that cheapest
                    piece. one course I wouldn't have the two 100 $ cloth. Virginia M<sup>c</sup>Corkle and Sterret was married last week she got cloth in Lexington for
                    her cloak for a 100 dollars
                    a yard. our cloth looks very well we have been talking about
                    making them up but was afraid you might get cloth. I want you to write as
                    soon as you get this and let us know as we want to make them up. what is the
                    latest style for cloaks try
                    and find out if there is any
                    later than Estalines I want you to get it for me and send by mail if no other
                    way you can get papers from someone to cut a pattern as mantuamakers
                    haven't plenty of papers do you know what kind of a
                        cloak Esta has it is a
                        loose
                    cloak with sleeves in it hangs in the back something like wormes but
                    comes down nearly to the bottom of her dress, if you can find out a new
                    pattern if it is not too much trouble get if you can
                    and you can fetch it with you I hope you will be able to get home before long
                    let me know as soon as you get this if you have the cloth or not and if you get
                    the pattern maybe you can send by someone before you
                    come home if you get a pattern be sure that it is a new one or they might put some old thing on you. send by mail if no other chance if you get it write soon</p>
