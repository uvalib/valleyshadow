<p class="p10">Winchester, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 6th inst.
                    (No 351), and to make the following report.</p>
<p class="p10">When I was at Staunton, the last of April, Mr Jackson informed me that the
                    authorities were <u>willing</u> to support their own poor,
                    but that their means were inadequate. Concerning the want of clothing, I
                    respectfully refer to enclosed copy of a letter received from Mr Tukey in March
                    last, which is the only communication referring to clothing ever received from
                    that Sub-District. No application for a supply has ever been made to me by
                    either Mr Jackson or his predecessor. In regard to Rations: I have the honor to
                    report that the office of the agent at Staunton was furnished with a copy of
                    Circular No 32, from your <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Head Quarters, series of 1866, but that no
                    Estimate, as therein required, has been received at this office for that Sub
                    District since the month of January last.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Jackson has been directed to make application for such supplies of Food and
                    clothing as are necessary to prevent suffering.</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully, General<br>Your Obedient
                        Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John A. McDonnell<br>Captain, Veterans' Reserve Corps<br>Sub Assistant Commissioner</i></p>
