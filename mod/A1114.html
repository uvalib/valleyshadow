<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10"> I had intended writing to Ma this time, but never mind. My cold has gotten a
                    good deal better. but it is might bad yet. Mary Betty Griner has had diptheria
                    in a mild form...is better now. Mag &amp; Laura Howard, Bettie Guy Hannie
                    Groch &amp; Maysie all went out to Maggie Eidson's this morning. May
                    &amp; Laura were both laid up with the cold this week. Colonel East is to be married the 12<sup>

                    start to Niagra. next morning after they are married. Miss Ginnie Dudley is to
                    be one of hers. &amp; Doctor Trevy &amp; M<sup>c</sup>Nutt are two of his.
                    Miss Lancy Howell and Miss Dudley came up to Captain
                    Byers yesterday evening. &amp; Mary went up there too <i>[deleted: yesterday evening]</i> Miss Howell was down street this morning buying her
                    wedding fixings, got two elegant silk dresses cloak, set of furs, bonnet, and a great many other<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> things in
                    proportion. I reckon we will hear all the news when Mag comes home this evening.

                    until this morning &amp; they certainly have been quarreling today because
                    their Uncle Rudolph didn't send for them. I think it will <i>[added: be]</i> real mean if Fulton's don't
                    invite you to their weddings, and living so close too. Oh well, If they do ask
                    you it will be well and good &amp; if they don't it
                    will be no odds. who will keep house for Bill now? I suppose he will try
                    &amp; get Becca now. I think every person must be going to get married this
                    winter. Miss Mary has concluded to have the Cantanta Thursday night before
                    Christmas. The girls are all to be dressed in white. They are to be divided into
                    two parts. Zephyrs &amp; Gelowers all the tall girls are Flowers, each girl
                    to impersonate a flower. the dresses are to tbe
                        trimmed in green. Miss Anna says it is might
                    pretty.</p>
<p class="p10">I think I'll get some black velvet to trim my hat in. Have you seen M<u>

                    Lank's/Lanks' bonnet yet? and what did you think of the
                    fashion of Lucy's &amp; Mary's. They have a heap of
                    talk about Mr C. Charlie &amp; Billie. since they come back, like as if no
                    person else ever had any beans. I certainly do laugh in my sleeves sometimes.</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Mary sent for me <i>[added: to go]</i> over to her room
                    today. I tell you I was scared thought maybe she <u>must</u>
                    be a going to take my head off. But she told me M<sup>

                    &amp; asked me if you would teach. I told her you would like to teach but
                    didn't know whether you could leave home this winter or not. The salary would be
                    $200. there were five children in the family &amp; you could take in
