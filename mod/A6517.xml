     <salute>Dear Miss Mary:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>Your long and interesting letter was received yesterday evening and perused with the greatest
     pleasure. Indeed I do owe you many thanks for your punctuality in writing and for your long
     letters; they assist very much to relieve the monotony of camp life, but even that reason for
     appreciating them is small when compared with that of cultivating the friendship of one whom I
     love so much, though a recent acquaintance. But "time is measured by heart throbs not by
     figures on a dial".</p>

    <p>I am sorry that I am compelled to write with a pencil. I know that in going so far it must
     become very dimm, but it is almost impossible to procure ink and pens which will write, so that
     it has become an almost universal custom in the army--and I believe with soldiers <pb n="2"/>
     at other places to write with a pencil.</p>

    <p>We are now encamped about six miles from Leesburg, eight from home and about half that from
     the enemy. At <orig reg="present">preasant</orig> we are living next door to a cornfield and of
     course live very well, as the owner is a patriotic Southerner and has given us full permission
     to pull and eat. Besides this my cousin and myself have a nice little box in one corner of our
     tent which is usually plentifully supplied with provisions from home. So you see as we have a
     private tent, made at home for us we live quite pleasantly and do not stand so much in and of
     your sympathies as you supposed. All this is very fine but I can't tell how long it will last
     we were ordered this morning to pack our knapsacks and be ready to march at a moment's warning,
     so by <orig reg="tomorrow">to- morrow</orig> we <hi rend="underline">may</hi> be down on the
     river without either tent or bed other than one blanket. We have one company of howitzers
     attached to our Brigade, two <pb n="3"/> of the pieces are here with our regiment and the other
     two have been down on the river for the last three days during which time they have fired
     upwards of a hundred rounds and killed a good many of the Yankees. One field officer was seen
     to fall dead after a fire on yesterday. When we cannot get provisions from home our fare is so
     bad that it is almost impossible to eat it unless near starvation. We can get enough grease by
     skimming the coffee to oil our boots, and the bread is much worse than the coffee. War is
     unpleasant, we all wish it over, but nevertheless I have seen very few soldiers who will not
     volunteer again when the time of their enlistment has expired.</p>

    <p>You ask if I do not think a just God will forgive those who kill the enemies of the South. I
     believe we need no forgiveness for ridding the earth of such as in defiance of justice and
     religion attempt to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the <pb n="4"/> chains of slavery upon our glorious
     country. I think I could say like Pendleton after pointing his guns, "God have mercy on their
     sinful souls, and may this volley kill a thousand; fire boys". Indeed I long to begin the march
     to Washington. Thousands of Marylanders would flock to our standard if once we could cross the
     river. That ever brave little state has already sent over many to assist in the <orig
      reg="defense">defence</orig> of Virginia's Soil and when fighting in their own land in <orig
      reg="defense">defence</orig> of their homes how many more might we expect to join us. Kentucky
     alone has <unclear>deceive</unclear> me and acted the coward. The degenerate sons have
     disgraced their illustrious sires; may they soon repent and turn. Tennessee the old "volunteer
     state" has not changed and the Yankees will find that her sons are as brave now as when in
     Mexico the retreating <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> formed behind them. But I fear I shall weary even you
     with writing about the war; few persons would have had <pb n="5"/> the patience to read even
     this much.</p>

    <p>We heard not long since from our Orderly Sergeant, who was taken prisoner in the battle of
      <orig reg="Manassas">Manassa</orig>, he is confined in the capitol and <orig reg="treated"
      >treaded</orig> very kindly.</p>

    <p>I know you <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> wish more heartily than I do that I could be in
     Augusta once more. I know, with <hi rend="underline">you</hi> for a guide and companion, I
     could never weary of rambling over that beautiful county. I am devoted to horseback riding and
     then with such company--it really makes me dissatisfied with camp life to think of its
     depriving me of such pleasure as that. But Bobby Burns says that "man was made to mourn" and
     the best way to obviate the necessity of always wearing a long face is to learn to bear
     disappointments with resignation.</p>

    <p>I received a letter from Chum a day or two after I last wrote to you and wrote him a long one
     in return.</p>

    <p>The evening you last wrote I was not <pb n="6"/> on duty. I do not remember the dreams of
     that night but I can assure you that among my sleeping and waking fancies no form, oftener
      <orig reg="adds">ads</orig> joy to the picture, than that of a lady in Mt. Solon. Two nights
     after you wrote I was on duty. I was very unwell and it was a dark, rainy night. No soft moon
     smiled on me, as I relieved the weary sentinels, to remind me of an absent dear one; but the
     dismal pattering of the rain accorded with the dull aching of my head and the despondency of my
     spirits. Then I could hardly believe any one <hi rend="underline">cared</hi>
     <hi rend="underline">for</hi> me, even now I can not imagine any one dreaming of <hi
      rend="underline">me</hi>.</p>

    <p>You say that "you would freely die to save the life of one soldier". Who is that happy <hi
      rend="underline">one</hi>? I will not tell. Confide in me. Does Georgia number him among her
     brave sons? From wherever he may hail he is the most fortunate of men. There is the drum for
     Battalion drill and Dress Parade so you must excuse me for two hours. <pb n="7"/></p>

    <p>Well Dress Parade is over at last and although supper is ready, it has not enough attraction
     to make me postpone any longer the conclusion of my little "chat" with you. The Battalion Drill
     is the hardest thing we have here, and as left guide of the company I have to notice all the
     time as the Major has an especial spite against me and is always trying to find some fault if
     possible. One of my great objections to camp life is the total disregard of Sunday. In fact our
     Sunday drills are generally the hardest for then we have so many visitors that the officers try
     to show off and nearly kill us in the attempt. You speak of the difference between Northern and
     Southern treatment of private citizens. This is especially marked in our Regiment, we are
     encamped at present in a union neighborhood, where most of the inhabitants are abolitionists
     and yet although secessionists have been robbed and driven from their homes only a few miles
     from here <pb n="8"/>we take not a cent's worth without offering the cash for it.</p>

    <p>I shall write to you as often as possible that is if I do not think I could weary you. And
     please remember at the same time that <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi> can give me greater
     pleasure than receiving your kind long letters as frequently as possible. An ambrotypist came
     to Leesburg last week and I was able to get a picture to leave with Ma if I am killed. I have
     been wishing for some time to get a good one for her and although this is not very good it will
     serve to recall to her mind how I looked as a soldier. Now you see I have written you the
     longest letter I have mailed for a long time and written punctually too, So you will greatly
     oblige me by following my good example.</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>And believe me ever to <hi rend="underline">be</hi> your <hi rend="underline">most</hi>
      devoted and <hi rend="underline">unchanging</hi> friend,</salute>
