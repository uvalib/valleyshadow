<p class="p10">Oct 21th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Brandy Station</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">After so long an absence I again seat myself for the purpose of dropping you a few lines My
                    health is very good and I hope this may find you enjoying the same There is no news of importance transpiring at present along <i>[added: the lines]</i> I hope our fall campaign is over
                    &amp; that we may soon go in to winter quarters We have had a right severe campaign for the last two weeks I think we
                    will move to some camp today we had orders last night
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to move this morning at nine oclock you
                    must pardon me for not writing soon while on the march
                        there was little or no chance to send letters back
                    and I was always so tired after the days march that I felt more like lying down
                    than writing I received yours of the 6 on the 8th
                    was truly glad to hear from you oh how I wished that I could come home for a
                        few days to see your Cousin and my friend united in
                    holy wedlock but alas I had to serve my country first; then wait on my friends;
                    since writing the above we have moved our camp near
                    five miles. The boys are generally busy now policing &amp; putting up bunks
                    we are camped two miles south of Brandy Station I think
                    we will stay here
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>for some time we have a very nice camp; but the water is not very
                    good. You asked me questions in you first letter I neglected answering, hope it
                    is not too late now. I mess with my old messmates Trotter,
                    Abny, Grever, Hatten Britton &amp; two Ruebushes, they all say it will not
                    do to break up our mess while the war lasts hope that
                    may not be long. Tom is well he was unwell for a week or two. This march has
                    improved his health greatly John has been unwell for a day
                    or two but is getting something better Hunter is very unwell I think he is threatened with the fever. Capt is right unwell I
                    think he was sent to some private house today Jake is getting quite well again
                    he got along better through the campaign <i>[deleted: better]</i> than I
                    expected he would The boys will all recruit up now I hope. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I suppose
                    your cous Kate is married before this Oh how much I would like to have been
                        there I know I could have had my own fun I wish
                    them much hapiness through this changing world of
                    ours. I received a letter from John B dated the 8th
                    he did not now what day it would come off I herad that
                    John was to be a waiter. I was surprised to hear of your cous Fannie getting
                    married. Mr Baker is from Winchester is he not; I had thought that Capt Burke
                    was waiting on her if so I suppose she gave him the slide. I will not have room
                    or time to give you any of the particulars of the
                    campaign as I have to do my part in policing our quarters; oh I wish I could be
                    with you for a while to tell you of the many pleasant dreams I have had about
                    you last nights in particular Oh I hope the time
                    may soon come when I may have the pleasure of stealing a sweet kiss from your pure lips oh dear Kate I can never
                    forget you &amp; would wish to never be forgotten by the ones that I think
                    as much of as my life I received your note enclosed in Jakes letter was truly
                    glad to hear from you. if I have omitted any thing in
                    this please forgive write soon. I will write again as soon as we get fixed up in
                    our new camp</p>
<p class="p10">Good bye from yours only</p>
