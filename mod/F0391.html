<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 27<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Warrenton Junction, Va. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister Louisa </p>
<p class="p10">I received your welcome letter of March 31<sup>st</sup> and it gave me
                    great pleasure to hear from you. As you will see by the heading we have left
                    Bell Blain. I intended to answer your letter before we left there but could not
                    get time to do so. We left our camp near Bell Blain Landing on the 13<sup>th</sup><i>[illeg.]</i> and marched up along the Rappahannock
                    river with all the rest of the cavalry in the army of the Potomac, and some
                    horse artillery; on the evening of the 14<sup>th</sup> we arrived at
                    Beathon Station on the Orange and Alexandria R. R. near which place we were to
                    cross the river, but it commenced to rain that night and the river swelled so
                    that it was not fordable next day. the rebels in the mean time got aware of our
                    intentions, and again the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>roads were fit march again they had made
                    preparations to prevent our crossing at that point. On monday the 20<sup>th</sup> we continued our march again up the river but it
                    commenced to rain again and the roads got so bad that our reserve artillery
                    could not get along and we halted that night near Warrenton having no supply
                    train with us and being delayed so long by the unfavorable weather we had to
                    fall back to Warrenton Junction for more supplies, at which place we are at
                    present. As we expect to march again tomorrow I thought I would write you a few
                    lines to inform you of our whereabouts, not knowing when I may have another
                    opportunity as we will have no more communication after we start from here until
                    this campaign is over; you will perhaps not hear from me for some time, but I
                    will write to you as soon as an opportunity will present itself, if I am spared
                    to do so.<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>We have undoubtedly some pretty hot work before us; where we
                    are going is not publicly known, but the general
                    opinion is here that we are to get rear of the rebel army of the Rappahannock
                    and cut off their communications from Richmond, while Gen. Hooker will attack
                    them with the Infantry. We have had splendid weather here since saturday. </p>
<p class="p10">I am very much pleased with the letter Frankilin sent me.
                    it is written and composed better than many letters I have seen written by grown
                    up persons, I am sorry that I cannot send him an answer today but he must excuse
                    me as circumstances will not permit me to do so. Give my love to him and all the
                    rest of the family. I must now come to a close hoping that you may all be in as
                    good health as I enjoy at present. </p>
<p class="p10">I remain Your affectionate Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Christian Geisel </i></p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse haste </p>
