<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to
                    Orlando Brown, December 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McDonnell submits his last quarterly report to Bureau headquarters in Richmond.
                    In relation to Augusta County, he mentions the persistant problems with
                    contracts and the efforts to defraud free blacks. But he also notes the progress
                    made in education, and the decline in intemperance. McDonnell closes his report
                    with some pessimistic observations about the fate of blacks once the Bureau is
                    dissolved. He writes: "after restrictions are removed the colored people will be
                    again reduced to servitude for a compensation of the coarsest food and
                    clothing." He also commends General Brown for his work in the Bureau.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 31<sup>st</sup> 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular No 5 Series of 1864, from Head Quarters Assistant Commissioner, Virginia; I have the honor to render
                    the following report of the condition of Freedmen's Affairs in the <u>Ninth Sub District</u>, comprising the counties of <u>Frederick</u>, <u>Clarke</u>, <u>Warren</u>, <u>Page</u>, <u>Shenandoah</u>, <u>Rockingham</u>, <u>Augusta</u>, and <u>Highland</u>, for
                    the quarter ending December 31, 1868.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>First Division</u> comprising <u>Frederick</u> County.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>1<sup>st</sup></u> The Freedmen as a general
                    class continue to improve socially and morally. They are rapidly becoming aware
                    of the importance of self-dependence <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and the value of time; and
                    consequently idleness is disappearing and a healthy <i>[unclear: toned]</i>
                    system of daily labor is effecting a comparative independence, which promises
                    permanent good.</p>
<p class="p10">A demand for labor during the summer and fall gave constant employment to all who
                    wished to avail themselves of reasonable compensation and many have earned and
                    invested their little surplus earnings in a house for the future.</p>
<p class="p10">Not a single complaint of violation of contracts has been made against the
                    Freedmen, while a large number have been made against the Whites.</p>
<p class="p10">In contracts for labor on shares of the crop, many advantages are taken by
                    land-owners, frequently where the Freedmen contract to receive one half or one
                    third of the wheat or corn crop, at the time of settlement they receive their
                    part of the grain, but are defrauded out of their just and valuable portion of
                    the straw or fodder. Still in other cases where employed by the month, legal
                    measures have too often to be resorted to, in order to compel a settlement.
                    Until men are activated by a sense of Justice towards the Freedmen <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>this wrong will continue.</p>
<p class="p10">Considerable difficulty was experienced in procuring a building for school
                    purposes in Winchester. No White man having suitable buildings would let them
                    for that purpose, and this may be regarded as an evidence of the feeling toward
                    the education of the colored people.</p>
<p class="p10">Although no encouragement has been given, nevertheless, the schools have
                    prospered, and in many cases a marked degree of proficiency has been attained.
                    It is believed now that the schools in existence will compare favorably with any
                    others of similar grade in this County.</p>
<p class="p10">It is very generally conceded, even by the enemies of the Freedmen that the
                    children of the latter are acquiring an education as rapidly as the children of
                    the middle and lower class of whites, so that when the rising generation shall
                    aim at manhoods estate they will be sufficiently advanced to detect and prevent
                    the annoyances to which their fathers are subjected.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>2<sup>d</sup></u> At present it does not appear
                    likely that full and complete justice will be given to Freedmen <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>in
                    cases where they are interested against whites. Although their evidence is
                    admitted, it is not received with that credit which a white mans would in like
                    cases. Especially in jury trials, local prejudices are so strong that it makes a
                    great difference as to the result whether the complainant is a white or colored
                    man. Cases sustaining the opinion herein expressed have heretofore been reported
                    to the Assistant Commissioner.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>3<sup>d</sup></u> The Register of Marriages for
                    this Division is believed to be complete - no additions have been made to it
                    within the past year. Paragraph 1 of Circular 11 dated Head Quarters Assistant Commissioner State of Virginia, Richmond
                    March 19<sup>th</sup> 1866, is believed to be fully carried out,
                    according to the best information obtained from parties interested. Paragraph 2 has been frequently read and explained at
                    all the religious meetings of the colored people in the district, and is
                    believed to be thoroughly understood. Paragraph 3. The
                    state authorities take no action for the prevention of lewdness or adultery
                    among the colored people. The agent would willingly co-operate with them if they
                    would take any action in the <i>[unclear: premises]</i>. As it is, we endeavor
                    to do all we can to <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>discountenance and discourage such practices.</p>
<p class="p10">Licenses are required for all proposed marriages since January 24<sup>th</sup> 1866.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 4 is fully carried out.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>4<sup>th</sup></u> The County authorities
                    manifest a disposition to provide for their own indigent Freedpeople as they do
                    for Whites, and the means at their disposal is ample for the present demand.
                    Pecuniary embarrassment probably prevents more comfortable quarters being
                    furnished the inmates of the Poorhouse as the buildings are sadly out of repair.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>5<sup>th</sup></u> The supply of labor in the
                    summer months is not equal to the demand, but in the latter part of the fall and
                    winter it is in excess. Wages range from seven to twelve dollars per month,
                    according to the quality of the help. In a large number of cases the Freedpeople
                    experience great difficulty in obtaining pay for services rendered.</p>
<p class="p10">An evident intention on the part of many employers to take advantage of their
                    ignorance, and by fraud in accounts and otherwise cheat them on settlements, is
                    often manifest.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>6<sup>th</sup></u> Miss <u>Lizzie A. Linchcome</u> in charge of school at <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>colored Methodist Episcopal Church at Winchester is fully
                    qualified to teach, but lacks the ability to govern. Her school is deficient in
                    part of discipline.</p>
<p class="p10">The school sustained partly by the Bureau in charge of Mr. <u>Oscar M. Waring</u> promises to be a success in numbers and efficiency.
                    Mr. Waring has had several years experience as a teacher, and his school is
                    creditable not only to himself, but to its patrons also. As soon as a teacher
                    can be procured, a school will also be opened at Newtown, which with those here
                    will be ample to meet the necessities of the people in this county.</p>
<p class="p10">Second Division comprising <u>Clarke</u>, <u>Warren</u> and <u>Page</u> Counties.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>1<sup>st</sup></u> The Freedpeople appear to be
                    in a prosperous condition in the Counties comprising this division. No great
                    number being in any one place, labor is equally distributed, and all who were
                    able to work are employed. In Clarke County the colored people are erecting a
                    church at an estimated cost of $3000.</p>
<p class="p10">It is probable however, that before completing it, they will be compelled to
                    appeal to charitable friends for assistance. Warren and Page Counties are
                    equally prosperous with Clarke, but for the reason that no large number can be
                    found together it is considered inexpedient to organize schools at other than
                    those places where schools are now in operation, viz: Berryville, Clarke, County Front Royal, Warren County and Luray, Page County. Although the people are constantly employed
                    and labor is abundant, there does not seem to be that disposition on the part of
                    the people to acquire property or homes for themselves that is manifested by the
                    Freedmen in the First division. No suffering exists, and the demand on the
                    Counties, by indigent freedpeople, if any are very few.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>2<sup>d</sup></u> For some months past, no cases
                    of injustice to Freedpeople were reported, but so long as local prejudices
                    exist, full and complete justice will not be given by juries. A much larger
                    amount of evidence than would be required to sustain the <br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br>the cause of
                    a white man, would alone establish facts in his case, and complaints made by
                    them do not receive equal attention as if made by a white.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>3<sup>d</sup></u> The Register of Marriages is
                    complete for each County.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 2 of Circular 11
                    series of 1866 has been fully explained to the Freedpeople in each County by
                        Captain Ripley the officer in charge, and is
                    stated to be well understood.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 3 as in the first division, the civil
                    authorities do nothing to prevent lewdness or adultery. The people however, have
                    been cautioned against such practices. Licenses for marraiges subsequent to
                        January 24<sup>th</sup> 1866 are
                    required.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 4 is carried out.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>4<sup>th</sup></u> In each County, indigent
                    Freedpeople are provided for by the authorities as are the same class of whites.
                    From superstitious causes the most indigent are
                    unwilling to avail themselves of the privileges of the Poorhouses, and
                    consequently few if any seek relief from that source.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>5<sup>th</sup></u> The demand for labor in each
                    County is greater <br><br>[<i>page 9</i>]<br>than the supply for nine months in the year and
                    about balanced for the remainder. Wages range from ($7) seven to ($12) twelve
                    dollars per month, which is generally paid in produce, clothing, &amp;c. As
                    the most exorbitant prices are demanded for
                    articles thus given, it cuts the wages down to a cash value of at least two
                    dollars per month less than the above quotation.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>6<sup>th</sup></u> The condition of the school
                    at Berryville in charge of Miss <u>Sarah S. Jackson</u> has
                    attained a fair degree of discipline, and the proficiency of the pupils is of
                    the average in primary schools in Country districts. At Front Royal the school
                    in charge of Miss <u>Mary E. Perry</u> is well conducted and
                    promises to be profitable. The school at Luray would be much improved if a more
                    competent teacher was in charge. <u>Rev<sup>d</sup></u> Mr. Jones although an excellent man is not qualified for the work,
                    as not being master of words of one syllable himself, and therefore unfit to
                    instruct others.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Captain Ripley</u>, the officer in charge has done all in
                    his power to promote the interests of the Freedpeople in his Division.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Third Division</u>, comprising the Counties of <u>Shenandoah</u> and <u>Rockingham</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Except at Harrinsonburg and Woodstock, the colored people are well distributed in
                    this division, and constant employment is obtained without difficulty the
                    greater part of the year. The people however are very poor, and appear less
                    ambitious than elsewhere. Seldom obtaining cash for labor, they depend on
                    employers to furnish the necessities of life for their families, forgetting that
                    when a settlement comes, they will have to pay the highest store prices for what
                    they had. Except also at the first mentioned place, they appear to have but
                    little interest in education. They would attend schools if furnished them
                    without the expense of Rooms, Teachers, or fare, but no great importance seems
                    to be attached to gaining knowledge through the slow progress of books. The
                    advancement of those who live remote from large towns or settlements, and in the
                    mountains is extremely slow. Few contracts for the coming year have been made.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>2<sup>d</sup></u> Reports from the officer in
                    charge indicate <br><br>[<i>page 11</i>]<br>that full and complete justice is given to Freedmen
                    in cases where they are interested against white men. This is probably so as far
                    as the courts are concerned, but in trials by Jury it is certain that mens
                    prejudices operate against the Freedmen especially in cases of assault, or in
                    the settlement of accounts. Mr James has reported one or two cases where it was
                    evident the juries did not regard the evidence.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>3<sup>d</sup></u> The Register of Marriages is
                    complete. No additions have been made to it for some months.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 2 Is understood, it having been explained to
                    the people at all the religious meetings in the division.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 3 Although the authorities take no action for
                    the prevention of lewdness and adultery, few cases are known to exist. The
                    officer in charge does all in his power to prevent such practices.</p>
<p class="p10">Paragraph 4 is carried out.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>4<sup>th</sup></u> Indigent freedpeople are
                    provided for by the authorities of the County, and the means <br><br>[<i>page 12</i>]<br>adequate. Few colored people will consent to become inmates of the Poorhouse.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>5<sup>th</sup></u> The supply of labor is
                    greater than the demand, except at the dullest season. Even at present all are
                    employed who are able to work.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>6<sup>th</sup></u> But one school is yet in
                    operation, it is located at Harrisonburg, in charge of Miss <u>Elizabeth James</u>, a lady fully competent and devoted to the work. A
                    healthy interest, and a very fair degree of proficiency on the part of the
                    pupils indicate the success of Miss James' efforts. Schools will also be
                    commenced as rapidly as teachers can be secured, at Woodstock, Strasburg and New
                    Market.</p>
<p class="p10">Since <u>Mr. James</u> has been assigned to this Division, an
                    improved state of feeling has existed between the white and colored people.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Fourth Division</u>, comprising the Counties of <u>Augusta</u> and <u>Highland</u>.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>1<sup>st</sup></u> In this Division the
                        <i>[unclear: general]</i> of the freedpeople has <br><br>[<i>page 13</i>]<br>not
                    perceptibly improved. As in other cases, they are defrauded by many employers,
                    who with pretended words of friendship, bind them by contracts which are unjust
                    in many particulars. Numerous complaints have been made to Mr. Waldo, the agent
                    in charge, by Freedmen, against parties for whom they have labored, on contracts
                    and by the month, to the effect that they cannot obtain their pay. In settling
                    such claims, the evident intention, in very many cases, to defraud the laborer,
                    becomes manifest, and many freedmen suffer in consequence. Intemperance is
                    happily decreasing. Labor is in active demand and the Schools will do much to
                    enlighten and instruct the people in their rights, and the manner in which to
                    obtain them.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>2<sup>d</sup></u> Until past prejudices are
                        <i>[unclear: removed]</i>, and loyal men occupy the positions of
                    Magistrates, Sheriffs &amp; Juries, full and complete justice cannot be
                    expected for the Freedmen.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>3<sup>d</sup></u> The Marriage Register is
                    complete, and each of the four Paragraphs have been carried out as far as
                    practicable. The County Authorities do <br><br>[<i>page 14</i>]<br>nothing for the prevention of
                    lewdness.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>4<sup>th</sup></u> Ample arrangements have been
                    made by the County Authorities for the care of their own indigent freedpeople,
                    the means at their disposal is sufficient for all purposes.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>5<sup>th</sup></u> Labor is in good demand, even
                    at this late season all who can work find employment without difficulty at from
                    eight to twelve dollars per month.</p>
<p class="p10">In Highland and a large portion of Augusta Counties, very little money is paid
                    the laborer, who is content with such commodities as he can use in his family,
                    obtained at prices in advance of what the same goods could be purchased at the
                    Stores. By this system, employers take back the whole of the employees wages,
                    and still have a balance in their favor, and the Freedman is compelled to work
                    on trying to liquidate the debt, and getting deeper into it the longer he works.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>6<sup>th</sup></u> The schools at Staunton,
                    although recently opened are doing well. Mr John Scott has a flourishing and
                    well regulated school with a remarkably large average attendance and a
                        <i>[unclear: corresponding]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 15</i>]<br>degree of interest. Reverend Jackson Strange also has a good and orderly school. The
                    attendance however is not so large, nor the discipline scarcely so good as at
                    the school of Mr. Scott.</p>
<p class="p10">There are two other smaller schools in Augusta County, which was impracticable to
                    visit.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. <u>Waldo</u> the agent in charge is an efficient and
                    faithful officer, and has discharged his duties to the satisfaction of this
                    office and the Freedpeople of his division.</p>
<p class="p10">With low wages and large families, many working men, even with good health, find
                    it difficult to maintain their families and furnish clothing.</p>
<p class="p10">The advantage which employers take of ignorant freedmen, the manner in which they
                    defraud them of their pay, knowing that they cannot resort to law for want of
                    means to employ counsel - the advantage taken in drawing up and explaining to
                    the Freedpeople contracts which bind them to labor for a whole year for a
                    trifling portion of the crop all point with gloomy certainty to the fact that
                    after restrictions are removed the colored people will be again reduced to
                    servitude for a compensation of the coarsest food and clothing. It is also a
                    matter of regret that the better class of the community, as well as the civil
                    authorities take no heed of the looseness in morals by which they are
                    surrounded. Outside of the Bureau, no efforts appear to have been made to
                    correct this evil. Although perhaps not quite so bad as formerly, still it
                    exists to a much greater extent than would be tolerated in any well regulated
                    community.</p>
<p class="p10">In conducting a service of nearly three <br><br>[<i>page 17</i>]<br>years in the Bureau, we
                    desire to acknowledge and thank the Assistant Commissioner for the uniform courtesy and kindness
                    which has marked his official relations with this office, ever ready to advance
                    the interests of those for whom he labored, he has given
                    <i>[unclear: permanency]</i> to the Schools throughout the Valley, encouraged
                    temperance and protected labor, thereby placing the Freedmen on the surest and
                    safest road to intelligence, health, and independence and true happiness.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John A. McDonnell</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Sub Assistant Commissioner
                    </p>
