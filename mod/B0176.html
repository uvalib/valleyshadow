<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. L. Clark to Thomas P.
                    Jackson, July 9, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Clark once again responds to an unspecified claim made against his congregation,
                    asking Jackson to see the complaint, so that he and his congregation may have
                    the chance to respond properly.</p>

<p class="p10">July 9, 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of this date in reply to my note of yesterday is duly received &amp; I
                    beg leave respectfully to say:</p>
<p class="p10">As the party I represent is in possession of the Church edifice referred to we
                    must, I presume be in the position of a defendant against some adverse claim.
                    Occupying this position, I submit for your consideration whether it is not in
                    accordance with what is usual &amp; proper that we shall know, before we
                    answer the claim or complaint which we are called upon to respond.</p>
<p class="p10">I had supposed that the investigation was founded upon some assertion of right
                    adverse to ours, but it now appears that the conflicting claims are to be
                    asserted before you &amp; that you have already received a statement of the
                    plaintiff's pretensions. I beg leave respectfully to <u>ask</u>
                    <u>that we</u>
                    <u>may</u>
                    <u>be allowed</u>
                    <u>to examine</u>
                    <u>the claim</u>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br><u>thus filed</u> in order that our congregation
                    may meet it fully &amp; with precision upon all its points.</p>
<p class="p10">It is proper to say that we are actively engaged in preparation for our defense
                    &amp; that we will ask no delay that can by possibility be avoided.</p>
<p class="p10">respectfully<br>Your obedient
                        servant</p>
