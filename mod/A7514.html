<p class="p10">June 2, / '66.</p>
<p class="p10">Cottage by the Lake</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. D.H. Evans,</p>
<p class="p10">I can scarcely thank you sufficiently for the exquisite bouquet you sent me. It
                    would give me more pleasure to acknowledge in person the sincerity of my thanks,
                    &amp; <i>[unclear: tender]</i> appreciation with which I received,
                    &amp; will keep this <i>[illeg.]</i>, but beautiful, &amp; expressive
                    token of your valued remembrance. I cannot decide
                    which I most admire, its <i>[illeg.]</i> fragrance, the rich variety of its
                        hues<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>or the artistic arrangement of the entire collection. All are
                    alike admired, &amp; enjoyed as a gift from you I love flowers, but
                        <i>[unclear: more]</i> especially when they come to me culled, &amp;
                    arranged by esteemed hands. With the beauty &amp; fragrance of your gift,
                    there came a regret resting like a blot upon each flower, &amp; bud, a
                    regret that its loveliness will so soon perish, that I cannot keep it always
                    fresh, &amp; blooming as now. The faded remains, &amp; remembrance<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>shall be mine, pointing back in future years
                    to the bright days when I enjoyed your friendship. May the pathway that God has
                    marked for you to tread bloom with flowers of unfading beauty, &amp;
                    happiness. And may the fair &amp; tender hands of her you select as your
                    wife gather for you flowers without thorns &amp; lead you onward to Heaven.</p>
<p class="p10">Very truly<br>Your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mary A. Sibert</i></p>
