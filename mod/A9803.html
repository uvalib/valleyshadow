<h4>Augusta: C. C. Baldwin to Alexander H. H. Stuart,

</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>C.C. Baldwin discusses family matters and a literary project, a "local color"

<p class="p11"><b>
                    A. H. H. Stuart, Esq
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan 14-67</p>
<p class="p10">Balcony Falls</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I hope my daughter sent you, according to my request, a copy of my sketch my
                    butler Jo, which appears in the Valley
                    Journal of the 9<sup>th</sup>. It swarms
                    with very great typograhpical errors -- many of which you must have observed.
                    The greatest of them <i>[deleted: in]</i> connects in changing <u>foibles</u> or the not horrible word <u>follies</u> in the sentence; "Undoubtably he had his foibles &amp; his
                    faults" &amp;. I have requested Sandy to correct <u>that</u> in his paper, &amp; and that alone out of a hundred, some of
                    which pervert my meaning.</p>
<p class="p10">I have sent a clean copy to the Richmond Whig, with
                    several additional paragraphs, &amp; and a number of smaller additions <i>[added: &amp; some vital changes]</i> throughout the
                    piece. If it appears in the Whig, I would thank you to read it there (if you <u>can</u>) &amp; then give me your candid opinion of it
                        <u>as a delineation of Jo's character</u>. I think it
                    paints the man to the life. If the coloring is rather warm, I agree with
                    Macaulay that the best portraits have something of caricature -- making up in
                        <i>[unclear: impessureness]</i> what they want in fidelity.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Is any trait omitted? Is any thing awry? Please run your pen through
                    any <i>[unclear: usage]</i> &amp; word you think ought to be struck out,
                    &amp; write me any additions. I want to make the thing as perfect as
                    possible.</p>
<p class="p10">I intend of course to send copies to our friends in California, &amp; if they
                    approve it, to submit the piece for De Bow's Review (De Bow having requested me
                    to write for it.)</p>
<p class="p10">I would like to have Aunt Martha's opinion, having the highest respect for her
                    literary taste. Present her with my kind regards.</p>
<p class="p10">I am sorry I did not retain the sketch to retouch at my leisure. I wrote it in
                    two days <u>currente calarro</u>, &amp; I hurried off to
                    Garter. I had just received a letter from Cornelia
                    giving me the particulars of Jo's last illness, &amp; enclosing a copy of
                    the proceedings of the San Francisco bank &amp;c. She returned from Europe
                    last spring. Her health is delicate but she thinks improving. I have
                    incorporated in my sketch nearly all the information she gave me. I do not know
                    what the surgical operation was, but I <u>guess</u> it was
                    for the <u>piles</u> -- an hereditary disease <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>in
                    our family -- I mean my father's. Pa is quite well for a man of 76.</p>
<p class="p10">By the way, permit me to introduce to you Briscoe G. Baldwin the 3<sup>d</sup>, a fine boy of mine, just a year old. Please introduce
                    him also to your family &amp; to Aunt Martha.</p>
<p class="p10">I have only two children by my present wife -- both boys -- the oldest Charles
                    Cornelius Cyrus -- 7 1/2 years old.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope to be in Staunton in a few weeks.</p>
<p class="p10">Favor me with an early answer.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C. C. Baldwin</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.: Among the typographical errors alluded to, let me
                        note the following: In speaking of my ever-revered mother -- the best human
                        being I ever knew -- I described her as <u>refined</u> --
                        not <u>retired</u> -- I said Jo's life was <u>un</u>eventful -- not eventful -- that his <u>instincts</u> were all chivalrous&gt; &amp; -- not
                        his interests -- that he was fond of field events &amp; horse-racing --
                        not <u>some</u> racing -- meaning racing horses along the
                        road -- that in conversation was well-<u>informed</u> --
                        not well-expressed -- that his tales were all <u>natural</u> -- not rational -- that there was no cant, bigotry, or
                        intolerance about him -- not <u>intemperance</u>
                        &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c <br><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Among the addenda in the
                        Whig, are these thoughts. <br>His sense of the
                        ridiculous was very keen, &amp;, when his blood was up, old Sam Kasm
                        himself could hardly excell him in sarcasm, ridicule, invective, and
                        denunciation. X X X <br>He was an original, adventurous, &amp; and
                        intrepid thinker, even to audacity -- I go on for ten or fifteen lines.
                        <br>His highest ambition was to be a chivalrous high-toned gentleman,
                        spotless &amp; reproachless; next and accomplished lawyer &amp;
                            a<i>[deleted: n]</i>
                        <i>[added: learned,]</i> professorial &amp;
                        philosophic jurist; &amp; then a justified scholar &amp; an eloquent
                        writer &amp; speaker -- a backwoods Lord Broughkam as he would have
                        expressed it. We <i>[added: are]</i> inclined to think
                        that he would have preferred the jures intellectual
                        sermon of Marshall as <u>the</u> great
                        Constitutional and philosophic jurist of America, even to the effulgent
                        glory which emblazons the name of Washington. <br>I beleive this is
                        strictly true. In all his letters to me he was a better lawyer than any
                        thing else &amp; that his highest ambition was to be a great jurist.
                        <br>I may show you some of these times portraits &amp;c drawn of you
                        &amp; Mr B in strong contrast in some respects. Neither of you had any
                        better friend in this world -- Excuse the trouble I give you.</p>
