                <p>Your will pardon, I feel well assured any feeling of what under other
                    circumstances you might think an undue liberty in my thus addressing you, when
                    the reasons for it are expressed, altho' independent of those reasons, I feel
                    almost impelled to claim the privilege by reasons of acquaintance and the always
                    to me pleasant associations connected with our brief intercourse. A most
                    melancholy duty devolves upon me, to have to communicate to you and <abbr
                        expan="through">thro'</abbr> you to our other friends whether now in
                    Arkansas or elsewhere, the death of your much esteemed young friend and my <hi
                        rend="underline">much</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">loved</hi> cousin Miss Evaline McCue after a brief illness
                    on yesterday evening (Wed) at twenty minutes past two oclock, of typhoid fever,
                    at this her <hi rend="underline">home</hi>, surrounded by her loving friends,
                    consisting of Father, step- mother and three brothers &amp; five sisters and
                    other relations and connexions. Living as I do some what remote, over twenty
                    miles in an opposite end of our county, I was summoned by business to our county
                    seat, when I heard of her illness, and immediately came to see her and
                    Providentially as I can but regard it, for I do not know how I could have born
                    the idea of her death without the opportunity of a personal knowledge of the
                        cir<pb n="2"/>cumstances attending it. I arrived here on Tuesday evening
                    when I found her in that situation despaired of by her physicians and suffering
                    no doubt extravagantly at then as throughout her entire <orig reg="illness"
                        >ilness</orig> without a murmur, or complaint. 'Twas difficult for her to
                    speak, yet she communicated her feelings by intellibible <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to the
                        <orig reg="interrogations">interrogatores</orig> of her friends when she
                    could not speak and her <orig reg="consciousness">conciousness</orig> remained
                    to the last moment. <abbr expan="Though">Tho'</abbr> not a professor of
                    religion, yet her whole walk through life had been an example even a reproof to
                    many Christians, and during her illness in the interviews a neighbouring
                    minister had with her, her expressions of acquiescence in the will of her
                    heavenly father and resignation gave every reason to believe that she is now
                    enjoying the smiles of a merciful redeemer--To one of the interrogatories
                    propounded to her by the minister as it regarded her hope for the future she
                    replied "I know there is no hope except in the Lord Jesus".</p>

                <p>A more lovely character than that possessed by our young friend it has never been
                    my good fortune to meet with. She possessed a well balanced mind, firm, decided
                    and prudent steadfast in her friendship when she formed the object or which the
                    feeling of friendship bestowed was worthy of it. She had improved very much in
                    the interval elapsed since your acquaintance with her, and independent of the
                    advantages she enjoyed by an intercourse with her friends in Ohio, and a very
                    agreeable and interesting journey from Ohio, home by the way of the Lake<hi
                        rend="super">s</hi>, the Fall<hi rend="super">s</hi>, and the Eastern
                    cities, she had employed her time at home, except that portion assigned to
                        the<pb n="3"/>Society of her friends to reading, and the most of this of a
                    solid and judicious character--Few possessed a more refined caste, and sensitive
                    modest and retiring, yet with a native dignity and reserve that kept at a
                    distance those with whom she had no desire to form an intimacy but yet
                    appreciated so fully, her position as a lady, as treating one with becoming
                    respect. She made friends every where she went. She endeared those who had known
                    her longest to her by hooks of steel.</p>

                <p> Beautiful as she was when you saw her, she was even more so at the time of her
                    death and now while her cold and inanimate form is lying in state in an
                    adjoining apartment, it would be difficult to picture to yourself a more
                    beautiful <orig reg="image">immage</orig>--Why my fair Friend, the loveliest
                    picture of that <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> ideal of pictures the "Madonna" it does seem to
                    me does not possess more <orig reg="symmetry">symetry</orig> of proportion or
                    beauty and expression of features than does her lovely face--Last evening as the
                    last rays of the departing sun shown across her face, and added to the angelic
                    expression which it bore, it would have been no stretch of <orig
                        reg="imagination">immagination</orig> to have conjectured her a seraph from
                    a bright world.</p>

                <p>It is an inscrutable Providence that has removed this bright, this pure and
                    spotless being from us to that Heavens she was so fitted to enjoy, just entering
                    as she was in the <orig reg="threshold">thresh- hold</orig> of life, and
                    possessing all those elements in so remarkable a degree that blended in her
                    life, constituted her almost a perfect character.<pb n="4"/>She alluded often to
                    our trip to Ohio and the meeting with your party on the Ohio river and the
                    pleasure enjoyed in the intercourse with you--'Twas only a few nights before she
                    became ill, that she entertained her two sisters until quite a late hour in
                    detailing the incidents that occurred on the Ohio river and during our stay at
                    the Burnet house. She was deeply attached to you spoke of you frequently and
                    nothing but a sort of antipathy to writing, prevented her from commencing a
                    correspondence with you.</p>
                <p> Miss Nannie, I have after a brief interval been in with some friends <orig
                        reg="tonight">to night</orig> (Thursday) to look again at the lovely Oh most
                    lovely form of my <hi rend="underline">dearest</hi> cousin and one of those
                    friends was M<hi rend="super">rs</hi>. Van Lear who came up this evening a

                    relative. She also speaks of you all often and would be much gratified to hear
                    of your welfare.</p>
                <p> Will you please to communicate to the rest of your family this mournful
                    intelligence, as well also to Miss Hough and Miss Buckner and be assured of my
                    sincere regard and respect--and convey to each of your friends my kindest wishes
                    for their welfare.</p>
