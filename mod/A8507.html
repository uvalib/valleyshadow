<h4>Augusta County: C. T. Wills to John H. McCue,

<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your esteemed favor of the 24<sup>th</sup>
                    October was received a few days since, but owing to the
                    engagements of our President I was not able until
                    yesterday to ascertain his views on the subject of your letter, and for this
                    cause I hope you will excuse my seeming neglect.</p>
<p class="p10">I am now instructed to reply, that the premium which M<sup>r</sup>
                        Ch<sup>s</sup> G. Lowe will give (3/4 %) is considerably lower
                    than our rates, at least so far as his shop is concerned. As to his dwelling
                    house we think that at least 1/4% too low, but if that is the rate charged by
                    other companies we would take it. The shop is lower
                    by 1 1/4% than any risk of the kind of which we have any knowledge, -- 2% is as
                    low <i>[unclear: as any]</i> risk <i>[added: of]</i> this
                    character is taken by us, but even at that rate, the building <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    fire proof, otherwise the risk is worth according
                    to circumstances from 2 1/2 to 5%, by most companies
                    such risks will not be taken, indeed they are desirable with none. From the
                    above you can gather the views of our Company as to Mr
                    Lowes risk, which I need scarcely add is at the rates proposed respectfully
                    declined. Your remarks about Mr Imbodens risk has been under consideration, and
                    although 1 1/2 % is as low as we have taken such risks, yet we are from our
                    knowledge of the character of Mr Imboden willing to
                    continue his risk at 1 1/4 % but we would be doing injustice to our other
                    customers to reduce his premium to 1% when the <u>very best</u> risks of the character of Mr Imboden are taken for others at not less than 1 1/4 %.</p>
<p class="p10">The risk of Messrs G. &amp; M Hirsh expires on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    and that of R H Phillips President &amp;c. on the 13<sup>th</sup>
                    December next. Should they
                    desire a renewal I will send you renewal receipts upon being informed of the
                    fact.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall be pleased to hear from you frequently.</p>
<p class="p10">-- November 1<sup>st</sup> 1853 --</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C. T. Wills, Secretary</i></p>
