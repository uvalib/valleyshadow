<h4>Augusta County: Andrew R. Barber to Mary Anna
                    Silbert, October 23, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Barber boasts about the recent military success enjoyed by Virginia reserves at
                    Saltville, laments the "depredations" of the Yankees (including the loss of one
                    of his own children), and expresses confidence that the day of God's judgment
                    upon the North is not far distant.</p>

<p class="p10">My Dear Cousin Mary</p>
<p class="p10">I have only time this cold Sunday morning to write you a line. Indeed I have
                    nothing of interest here to write you. I come out safely after taking a very
                    active part in late fight at Saltville. General
                    Burbridge U.S.A. was punished <u>very</u> severely for
                    bringing his mixed white &amp; Blacks in the vicinity of Saltville where we
                        <u>Reserves</u> could strike them a blow. Let it be said
                    "never more" that the silvery haired men &amp; the beardless &amp; downy
                    cheeked youths of old Virginia will not fight. They
                    have of late made their own record &amp; the faithful Historian, &amp;
                    future generations will give them a high place in the annals of their country.</p>
<p class="p10">The fighting for the Season in this country is over, &amp; I have accepted
                    the appointment of<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>"Medical Director &amp; Chief Surgeon of the
                    Reserve &amp; Local Forces of West &amp; Southwest Virginia" &amp; have established my Head
                    Quarters at this place &amp; am on duty.</p>
<p class="p10">"I am in fine health, hoping when these few lines come to hand they'll find you
                    enjoying the same God's Blessing."</p>
<p class="p10">I have just read a letter from Brother Gabl. &amp;
                    Daughter Mollie giving account of depredations &amp;c of the Yankees. <u>They</u> now know &amp; feel what I knew &amp; was
                    made feel near four years ago-- only they have never been made suffer from the
                    vandals as I have suffered. They have not felt &amp; known what it was to
                    mourn over the loss of a darling child-- the victim of a wicked relentless foe.
                    But enough. God is just &amp; merciful-- &amp; the day of Retribution
                    for the wicked ones who have stricken so many hearts &amp; laid waste our
                    beautiful &amp; once happy country is not<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>a far distant. Let it
                    come-- I repeat it let it come-- God speed it. Amen.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me kindly to your parents &amp; Sister-- would like to see you all.
                    With fraternal affection be kind enough please to remember me to Sammie
                    &amp; Mat. I wrote Mat a letter &amp; enclosed it to you-- She never
                    answered it, or if she did, I never recd. I love her very dearly, <i>[deleted: but]</i> &amp; it distresses me because she neglects me. Suppose she
                    got mad at me because Sammy foolishly <i>[unclear: did]</i>. I never wantonly
                    abused or wronged or injured any one.</p>
<p class="p10">I remember very pleasantly our delightful Boat ride-- I remember your kindness
                    &amp; affection towards me. I will not forget it or cease to remember you
                    kindly &amp; affectionately</p>
<p class="p10">Your cousin,</p>
