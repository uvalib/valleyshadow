<h4>Augusta County: Francis W. McFarland to Mary
                    McFarland Lewis, July 4, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Francis McFarland, Jr. writes to his sister Mary his feelings at the death of
                    their brother, Robert.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 4, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My very dear Sister,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter of June 25th instant on Friday evening, while Cousin Lizzie received her same date on Monday. I have written a
                    number of letters home since I last heard some or all of which I hope you have
                        received ere this.</p>
<p class="p10">I rode out Friday to find poor Robert's grave. It is in a very quiet place, not
                    on the battlefield, but at the foot of a walnut tree near the house of Mrs
                    Starke. He is buried beside Colonel Terrell. The lady
                    at the House said she intended to have the graves enclosed as soon as it could
                    be done. Cousin Lizzie &amp; every one else seem to think that the <i>[deleted: body]</i> remains had better not be moved until they are to be taken home.</p>
<p class="p10">I have never experienced such a blow as <u>his</u> death; I
                    could do nothing for several days. I loved him to the exclusion of nearly all
                    else, and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> that he returned my devotion in full measure, I well know.
                    He alone had my confidence and he alone never blamed me. I had feared his fall
                    for I knew how brave he was and any one who has seen the rain of death missiles
                    on a battlefield will wonder more that any escape than that any particular one
                    was killed, yet I had hoped he would escape.</p>
<p class="p10">When I saw him in the army, we had a great deal of conversation, he seemed to
                    have no fear of death at all, and said he was ready and willing to meet any
                    emergency; still he would talk of what we would do after the war. Poor dear boy,
                    I have often said and felt, and now, more than ever, that if I saw death coming
                    towards him I would gladly push <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> him aside and plant myself in his
                    footsteps that he might be saved rather than I. I would gladly have fallen in
                    his place. He used to put his arms around me and tell me how much he loved me
                    and show me the mug that I had given him years before &amp; how he had <i>[deleted: left]</i> held on to it &amp; prized it. <i>[deleted: above
                        all]</i> And to think <u>he</u> was killed, it was <u>too too</u> hard. He told me much of what he intended to
                    do for you &amp; that I must attend to his matters if he should be killed
                    &amp; carry out his plans as far as I could. Which I shall certainly do. The
                    day that Dr Brown got word that the body had been found I was not at congress,
                    nor the office. I did not feel like work &amp; had paid a man to write the
                    proceedings for me. Dr B. only had an hour &amp; a half's ticket <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
                    and in that time could not find me, though he looked for me. I had gone to a
                    friends house for rest &amp; have quiet. As soon as it is practicable I will
                    have the body taken home.</p>
<p class="p10">I will go home as soon as possible. I had fully expected to have gotten off
                    today, but my business keeps me here. I have suffered more with neuralgia for
                    the last six weeks, than for many <i>[deleted: weeks]</i> months past. And
                    lost time in consequence.</p>
<p class="p10">I rejoice that the Yankees did <i>[unclear: harm]</i> so little home, though
                    they have been such a scourge <i>[unclear: with]</i> lately. I had
                        <i>[unclear: enclosed]</i> the daily Enquirer the set of some two months
                    ago &amp; supposed it was going, but it seemed the necessary direction had been lost. I found the Sentinel had been
                    stopped, but had it continued. I started over to Chimborazo Hospital yesterday
                    (Sunday) to find John Wright, but had to turn back, not being <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> able
                    to walk over. I went up last night &amp; saw Dr Voden, surgeon in charge of
                    one of the Divisions &amp; he will find him if he is there, and tell me this
                    evening. I will write immediately, if he is found.</p>
<p class="p10">John Humphreys is in Albemarle. Tell William I will write him today or tomorrow.</p>
<p class="p10">I grieve to hear of Mary Lou's sickness, do hope it will be of short duration. I
                    have done all in my power to get a letter to James, but it is impossible to do
                    so. I will write to some friends North &amp; tell them that he is in Fort Delaware. I can send letters through to persons
                    living North, but not to a prisoner of War.</p>
<p class="p10">
                    <i>[deleted: With usual]</i>
                </p>
<p class="p10">I hope Father has recovered his strength ere this. With much love to all</p>
<p class="p10">Yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F.W. McFarland</i></p>
<p class="p10">I wrote a notice of Roberts death in the "Enquirer",
                        which I send you.</p>
