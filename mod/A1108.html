<h4>Augusta County: D. V. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother
                    (probably Hugh Gilkeson), September 27, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Gilkeson delivers news about the crops and discusses the season's fruit. He
                    provides updates about the children and mentions that several local women
                    believe the boy Willie looks like his grandfather. Gilkeson also writes about an
                    upcoming church election.</p>

<p class="p10">After 8 O'Clock at night and after helping to peal 2 Buckets of peaches since supper I set me down to answer your last which was
                    received several days since I am happy to inform you that we are all well, I
                    have been very busy for the last two or three weeks moreso I believe than usual trying to get through seeding finished yesterday
                    sowed about 50 acres of wheat, and 8 or 10 acres of ryes Must try and top corn
                    next week and then haul wood from white hill for two or three weeks which will
                    be about the last of October must then thresh at home <i>[illeg.]</i> and by
                    that time must go to gathering corn so my hands are full until christmas We have
                    a great quantity of apple this year and peaches too we are buying all we can
                    want to take some 8 or 10 Buckets to town tomorrow they
                    have been selling for a dollar a Bucket I understand
                        <i>[unclear: J.]</i> Culbreat was in this morning with about 20 Buckets which he sold for <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I
                    have been trying to keep the fruit from wasting any more than I can help have
                    made about 5 <i>[unclear: 
                        Barrels
                    ]</i> of cider which I intend for vinegar which if I can sell for even
                        20<sup>
                        cents
                    </sup> a gallon which is a low price is better than to let the apples not want to
                    make 3 <i>[illeg.]</i> Barrels yet must put away 2 Barrels for drinking Mary
                    has made 1 kettle of Pear butter and one kettle of Peach butter and want yet to
                    make 2 kettles of apple butter my young orchard is bearing this year the Baldwin
                    and <i>[unclear: Halawater]</i> are a large fine looking apple the Domino is
                    also a fine apple the trees are full they grow in clusters I wish you could be
                    here to see them and to enjoy them this winter when they get good to eat The
                    children are well and seem to be enjoying themselves wonderfully I don't know what to do with them their heads seem to be so full of play I am afraid they don't get along so well with their
                    studies they think so much about play I proposed to them tonight to give up their Arithmatic some person
                    would cheat them Mrs Dabney was here several days ago was very much struck with
                        Willie's likeness to father said she has noticed
                    him at church [continued on side of page] and remarked that he must be a son of
                    mine or some near kin as he was the very image of father, he took a horse over
                    to <i>[unclear: H G G.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> Mrs D to come over she said she knew him whenever he came from
                    his likeness to father, I think I shall take willie with me to town tomorrow
                    [continued side of first page] I believe I had better take him away as much as I
                    can when they are out of school to try and get their minds off of play so much
                    We have never had their linkeness taken yet <i>[unclear: last]</i> will the
                    first opportunity perhaps may have willie's taken tomorrow, they said yours was
                    not a good one Willie said at first he did not know it but I think he was joking
                    I think it was a tolerable good one the children I believe have written my paper
                    is about full <i>[unclear: excuse]</i> 1/2 sheet as I have been so busy that I
                    have not had time to write in daytime We are to have an election of elders in
                    our church next sunday but don't know who will be
                    elected <i>[unclear: H.G.G]</i> John Guthrie D. S. Bell and Mr Van Leas are the
                    present elders Mr Van Leas talks of resigning on account of his age I am afraid it will be hard to make a good selection
                    [continued side of last page] Will add no more but would pray that the richest
                    blessings both spiritual and temporal of our heavenly father may rest upon you
                    and yours</p>
