<p class="p10">May 3<sup>rd</sup>--</p>
<p class="p10">Gettysburg</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Many thanks to you my dear friend for your kind letter of
                    condolence. It is the first I have received from any absent one except my dear
                    children, and other immediate relatives. I have thought much about you since my
                    removal to this part of the town where I have enjoyed so many happy hours in
                    intercourse with loved friends, and to a house so well suited in every respect
                    to my present situation, I am delighted with my new home and you may well
                    imagine me most comfortably placed in it, surrounded with the same plain old-fashioned furniture of former years,
                    similarily arranged as at the old home down street. I feel quite contented
                    &amp; should be ungrateful if I was not, I have throughout all my trials of
                    affliction &amp; ill health for the last three years been mercifully and
                    kindly dealt with and now when permitted to step into this sweet little snug
                    home I feel doubly <i>[added: so]</i>, to my Heavenly Father
                    who has under all the circumstances provided so liberally for me. I wish you
                    could see how cozily I am fixed in your once happy
                    home, I have chosen your favorite seat in your little back parlor in the recess
                    by the window looking out on the alley, where you so frequently gave me the
                    kindest &amp; most cordial grettings. I like the house exceedingly &amp;
                    have never felt disposed to murmur or complain of the change. I am assured all
                    has been directed for the best. Of course it was painful
                    to resign <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> the long loved home, of 47 years standing, but I felt <i>[added: it]</i> a duty and was willing to submit to all
                    the melancholy changes, in my situation without the <i>[added: least]</i> repining: it is very sad indeed to realize that I
                    have <i>[added: lost]</i> so excellent a husband, yet I want
                    to feel cheerful and to remember he is not lost, but only gone before. I wish so
                    much you would come to Gettysburg &amp; make me a visit and if you will, I
                    shall promise if I <i>[added: am]</i> well enough to return
                    it in due time. I feel very anxious to see York once more in my life. &amp;
                    have often regretted the many years of absence from it. Edward remains with me,
                    he proves to be a most precious son to me, he is devotedly attentive &amp;
                    affectionate in all his feelings toward me he has taken his fathers place in
                    contributing to my comforts and home pleasures, he is so pleasant &amp;
                    cheerful that the domestic circle is very agreeable I do wish so much you would
                    come up, I have so many things to talk about, confidential talks, such as we
                    formerly enjoyed in bygone days: I want you to participate the pleasure of this
                    sweet little home. I like the neigborhood very
                    much everybody is so kind &amp; plain just
                    suited to my taste, we visit wearing our sun bonnets, without carrying card
                    cases &amp; remaining but a few minutes. I never can fall into those
                    ridiculous customs. There is so much style &amp; fashion here now among some
                    people <i>[deleted: here]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: now]</i>, it is scarcely like Gettysburg
                    I am surprised to observe, how much the people &amp; things have degenerated, in the past six or eight years.</p>
<p class="p10">Our dear church, is in a very lamentable &amp;
                    distracted state at present. I cannot go into detail now, there is so much to
                    communicate, I am too weak to write long letters, I have <i>[added: been]</i> obliged for two years to deputize <i>[added: 
                        Edward
                    ]</i> to attend to my correspondence he intended replying to your kind letter a
                    few days ago, but he went to Baltimore on business, &amp; I thought it would
                    be too long to wait for his return. So I concluded I would
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> attempt some sort of a letter myself -- Mr
                    <i>[unclear: Kouck's]</i> family are very estimable, we all are on the most
                    sociable cordial terms, we often talk of <i>[added: you]</i>
                    &amp; I am sure if they knew I was writing to you they would desire to be
                    remembered to you, poor old <i>[added: lady]</i> is in
                    feeble health, she suffers from spinal disease. but is cheerful &amp;
                    stepping about the house. O! do my dear Mrs. T-- come up right soon we shall all
                    be so glad to meet you again give my love to my sister, &amp; say to her I
                    shall be glad to have her come with you, you can come so nicely together
                    &amp; <i>[added: spend]</i> a week or two with us. I
                    think it will be charming I have not seen Anna, since I received your letter but
                    have inquired for her, she is quite well &amp;
                    very happy in the height of enjoyment with her young friends. Please excuse this poor dull epistle.</p>
<p class="p10">very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H. G. McPherson</i></p>
<p class="p10">remember me kindly to the Missess Durkee. Mrs. McGreary
                        is very well &amp; would desire her love too. she frequently speaks of
                        them with affection. she is truly a sweet lovely woman, she is like a
                        daughter in her treatment toward me. I love her very much indeed she has
                        three sweet little girls, they often run up to see "Aunty Phersy" as they
                        call me.</p>
