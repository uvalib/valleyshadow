<p class="p10">John h. reed of the 126th regiment of pennsylvania Vol: having applied for a
                    certificate on which to ground an application for an extension of his leave of
                    absence i hereby certify that I have carefully examined this officer and find
                    him suffering from partial paralysis of the left leg produced from an injury
                    recived from a shell at Fredericksburg, Va 19th December, 1862, from which time
                    he has been suffering from its effects and that in consequence therof he is in my opinion unfit for duty. I <i>[deleted: ]</i> declare my belief that he will not be able to resume his duties
                    in a less period than sixty days. His recovery is only a matter of time which
                    will at least take sixty days if not more. Johnstown <i>[illeg.]</i> County.
                    State of Virginia thu. 31st day of January 1863.</p>
