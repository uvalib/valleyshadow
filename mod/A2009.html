<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William B. Gallaher complains to his mother about the Yankee depletion of food resources
     which prompted raids on Yankee farms in Fairfax. He received his commission as second

<p class="p10">Dear Ma,</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote Pa a few lines yesterday but thought he might not get it. I am tolerably well. We are
     encamped at this place which is something larger than Fishersville. It is a rather poor looking
     town. The Yankees had been here some time &amp; ate pretty near everything that they could
     find. We manage to get pretty good fare when the boys go out in the country. They bring in a
     great many peaches chickens &amp; they get them off the Yankee Farms in Fairfax. Well I
     have rec'd a commission at last as a 2nd Lieut so whenever I get tired of soldiering I can
     resign &amp; come home which I think I shall do in a few weeks. Our company are generally
     well. Marshall Hanger has been loafing around here &amp; has never joined our company. He
     is going home today or tomorrow. As Augusta has furnished her quota of volunteers the militia
     will not be needed. Our Army is camped in every direction from the Junction. Jacksons Brigade
     is in camp about 3/4 of a mile below Centreville which is 6 or 7 miles from the Junction. I
     stayed all night there with Ed Waddell. Monday night I saw John Hill. He wanted a light woolen
     round about &amp; a pair pants of same quality &amp; if you could have them made you
     could send them down by some of his company who have gone home on furlough. I expect their
     company was paid off Tuesday &amp; John must have gotten his wages which amounted to
     between $20 &amp; $40. He told that he wanted me to take his pay &amp; send it to Pa to
     keep for him that he had very little use for money. Uncle Moore &amp; Post are at
     Centreville. I saw Martin Yontz on Monday. He had brought a wagonload provisions down to
     Hamtramels Guards. He says our folks are all well. I sent word by him to Grand Pa that you are
     all well. I don't think there will be a battle for a good while perhaps 2 months. Yes we have
     about eighty-five men in our company. Lib Davis came down with me &amp; Martin Palmer got
     here yesterday. There is still 2 of our boys left in Augusta Henry Miller &amp; George
     Layman. Well Ma I don't believe I need anything at present. I will send this letter by Marshall
     Hanger or Dr Walker. Write soon. Tell Pa to write to me. Give my love to all.</p>
