<h4>Franklin County: Diary of Anna Mellinger (1864)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About Anna Mellinger:<br></b>Anna Mellinger was the young wife of a Franklin County farmer.  She kept a diary throughout 1864 when Chambersburg was invaded and burned by Confederate troops.  In it she very briefly describes the invasion and aftermath of the raid.  Most of her diary, however, is concerned with the weather and the everyday activities in and around a Pennsylvanian farm.  She refers often to family members, friends, and church activities.  In November 1864 it appears that someone else wrote in her diary during Mellinger's absence from the farm.
