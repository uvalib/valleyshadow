<p class="p10">April 14<sup>th</sup> 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter was received several days ago. But owing to the mail communications
                    being cut off I did not think it worthwhile to write to you before there was
                    some news to write. All of the rail roads to the north were very much damaged so
                    much so that we had no northern mail for several days. The river rose so high
                    that it formed a connection with the dock and at one time looked like it would
                    flood the lower part of the city entirely. Boats were rowed about in the lowest
                    parts of Main and Cary streets. The river has subsided considerably and is fast
                    resuming its <i>[unclear: 
                        wanted
                    ]</i> bounds.</p>
<p class="p10">If I go south it will be for the double purpose of taking up arms and of
                    attending to the business connected with my grandfathers estate. But I shall
                    wait in Virginia until all hopes of secession or <u>revolution</u>
                    are killed. The feeling is growing here that we will have
                    to disperse this convention drive Letcher out of the eastern part of the state
                    divide the state and declare Eastern Virginia free of the West and of the Black
                    Republican Union. News of the surrender of Fort Sumter was received here yesterday after a bombardment of nearly thirty
                    hours (not counting the time that both parties ceased firing during the night.)
                    We fired a salute of one hundred guns in honor of the victory on the square
                    under the very noses of the <u>Traitors</u> to the state who
                    hold their daily "pow wow" in the capitol. After which we hoisted the flag of
                    the Confederated States upon the capitol where it remained until removed in the
                    darkness of night by the order of Letcher. Bonfires <i>[deleted: burnt]</i>
                    blazed in main street until
                    12 Oclock at night and the city looked like an<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> immense hive.</p>
<p class="p10">Things are growing warm here and members do not scruple to
                    say <i>[deleted: th]</i> in debate that they will divide from the west rather
                    than remain in this disgraced position which the west has made Virginia assume.</p>
<p class="p10">I can not have the stock transferred to my name
                    even with an order you will have to do it in person or send a power of attorney.
                    I think it had better remain as it is until you come down.</p>
<p class="p10">Enclosed I send you a piece taken from the Examiner by the
                    paper in which it appears. </p>
<p class="p10">I hope that you have recovered and that all are well. Give my respects to all and
                    believe me your</p>
<p class="p10">affectionate son </p>
<p class="p10"><i>John H. Cochran </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Fort Pickins has been reinforced. I think that after
                        its reduction Davis will march on Washington. <br> J.H.C. <br> P.S. 12
                        O'clock the river has again commenced to rise </p>
