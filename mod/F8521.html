                        </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Edward -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter announcing your intention to go to Harrisburg next morning, did not
                    reach me until late on Wednesday evening of that week, &amp; that,
                    containing the sad news of Dear E's death I received only yesterday afternoon.
                    It was what I expected to hear after getting your letter, &amp; what I
                    looked for after seeing her in Harrisburg, yet I did not think it would come so
                    soon, even though her father thought her decline was rapid. It is a sad, sad
                    event to me; I have one friend less, with whom I often held sweet converse
                    &amp; in whose society I have spent many pleasant &amp; profitable
                    hours. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>The ties to Earth are rapidly lessening &amp; the
                    "attractions of Heaven" increasing. I truly rejoice to hear, she did not suffer
                    more than was to be expected. I will be much obliged to you if you will write me
                    more particularly, when you have time, about her last days, &amp; I am very
                    anxious to hear how Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wallace are, under this <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    bereavement. However they will scarcely taste the bitterness of the cup, there
                    is so much sweetness mingled with it In her whole life as a daughter, &amp;
                    a Christian, they have everything to comfort
                    them. Mr W. told me when there, that a more dutiful child he had never known. I
                    do hope his mind &amp; body may be invigorated, for the sake of the dear
                    children, especially as Mrs. W seems so delicate. I wrote to Sarah after your
                    first letter &amp; will do so again in a few days. I have not been very well
                    I am so susceptible of cold this winter, &amp; my <i>[unclear: throat]</i>
                    has been a good deal affected. It has been very sore for some days &amp; my
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> cough tighter than it usually is. All have had colds more or
                    less. At the Dr.'s all are well but Nannie, who had been complaining, but I
                    suppose you know more about her feelings than I do. We are very glad to hear
                    Aunt was so much better &amp; hope she may be permanently so though I fear
                    E's death will have an injurious effect on both, her &amp; Uncle. We have
                    had intensely cold weather, indeed, it was quite a labor, the effort to keep comfortable. The high winds make it more
                    distressing. Lizzie has been enjoying the sleighing. Mr.
                    <i>[unclear: Maulsby]</i> talks of coming to town next week to board. Mrs. M.
                    is so dissatisfied with the country. My kind regards to Mrs. Taylor if in
                    Gettysburg, &amp; love to Mrs. <i>[unclear: McCrury]</i> &amp; all
                    friends. Our family join me in much love to each of yours.</p>
<p class="p10">Very affectionately yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        E
                    </i></p>
<p class="p10">Do you not mourn over the melancholy end of Hugh
                        Miller?<br>Tell your Father I thought so much about him during the cold
                        months. I suppose he kept the stores in fine order all the time.</p>
