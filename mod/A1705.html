<p class="p10">June the 25th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Chambersburg Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Pappy Ma and Mit</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself once more to write you a few more lines to let you know that I am
                    well and hearty and I hope that when those few lines
                    reaches you they may find you all the same I haven't been writing to you all in a good while nor haven't heard from you since
                    I left Culpepper and there I wrote you a letter giving
                    you all the news up to that time but after that time we
                    came very near having a fight there but it turned out
                    so see did not fight and then we took up our line of
                    march and marched to Berresville and there
                    we found 1600 Yankees and we flanked there breastworks but
                    when we marched up to fight they were gone so we did not get them but we continued the march and we soon
                    got to Bunker's Hill where General Jinkins had a fight
                    killing two of the enemy and wounding 11 and took 16 prisioners and the Yankes
                    wounded two of our men we drove them to Martingsburg and
                        we rushed in there and run
                    them out we captured a piece of artillery and a good deal
                    of provisions but they run so that we did not get them so
                    the next day we marched and waded the Potomac and then we
                    were in Williamsport Md and then we came to Hagerstown
                    and there
                    we took up camp bud did not stay long there before we started again and when we got to Middleburg we
                    were in Pennsylvania and the next town was named
                    Greencastle and you may believe that the people was very near scared to death but we treated them with
                    respect and yesterday we marched through Chambersburg and
                    it is a very nice place but in there I found a good
                    meny disbanded soldiers from the Yankee's army the
                    militia here is going to fight us I suppose but we will
                    not stop for them I reckoned
                    we will go to Harrisburg the capital of this state and
                        there
                    we will have to fight I guess but General Lee says that he has got the Yankees
                    just where he wants them it has been a grand move in
                    our army Brother Fuller is gone out on skirmish so I have to close his letter.
                        Uncle Jimmy Stewart is well and and harty send word to Aunt Mary that Uncle
                    Junuis is well and he has not time to write. The
                    militia is coming so I am in a hurry so you must excuse me for writing so bad. I
                    will close for this time. Sister you must not be uneasy about us for we are all
                    well and are doing well Give my love to all the friends. do write soon direct to
                    Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">from your brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J F Coghill</i></p>
<p class="p10">p.s. we must leave<br>[Note at bottom of transcription:
                        "(This must have been finished by Grandpa's brother who was also in the
                        army. There is a different handwriting at the end of the letter. Notice the
                        wording of the letter also.)"]</p>
