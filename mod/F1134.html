<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to Rosenbery,
                    John Abraham (father) and probably Mary Jane Snider (Franklin's stepmother),
                    April 23, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery discusses how to remove "gray backs" from his clothing and also
                    discusses the war, specifically his anticipation of coming clashes with
                    Confederates and his curiosity about the expected length of service for the
                    soldiers. He also mentions the constant drilling that soldiers face in camp.</p>

<p class="p10">April 23, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father and Stepmother:</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself to inform you that your letter of the 15th came to
                    hand the 21st. I was glad to hear from you. I am well at present. Hoping that
                    you are all enjoying the same blessings.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not recollect how much money you paid Miller. I
                    mind about the order that Forbes gave Miller but the amount I can't tell.</p>
<p class="p10">This morning we send all our extra clothing to the rear. It may be before this reaches you we may have an engagement on the 14th
                    of this month.</p>
<p class="p10">I expressed to you 20 dollars to Chambersburg. When you get it let me know.</p>
<p class="p10">I sent 2 shirts home. Tell Rachel to boil them well for fear there might be some
                        gray backs in them. Put them in a small tub. Put
                    some salt in the tub. Then put some boiling water on the shirts. Tell her to
                    keep them by themselves. Those gray backs are not the
                    body lice but still they know how to bite. I washed the shirts some time ago. I
                    did not notice any of the gentlemen about them. But they can easy be seen when
                    they come to a full growth.</p>
<p class="p10">There is still talk of no getting out of the Service when we have been in the
                    service 9 months, but still if we live we will see some hand battles before that
                    time.</p>
<p class="p10">When Rachel writes again, she may send me some threat in her letter.</p>
<p class="p10">I am nearly out of paper and envelopes there I shall mention that if you do not
                    get any letters for some time. Don't be uneasy for the report that the mail will
                    be stopped for some time.</p>
<p class="p10">I will still try and write as often as I can. I would like to be more prompt in
                    answering letters but it is impossible. People at home think the soldiers has
                    nothing to do. But it is a sad mistake we must drill so long then get ready for
                    dress parade-guns bright, boots black, white gloves and brasses bright.</p>
<p class="p10">These things we must keep clean-company drill in the forenoon, batallions drill in the afternoon, dress parade in
                    the evening and then we have other duties to perform.
                    Such as policing our streets, do our own cooking-washing.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon. No more at present. But I remain your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
<p class="p10">So farewell for this
                    time.</p>
