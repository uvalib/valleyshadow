     Mrs Sara A Hotchkiss Churchville Augusta Co Va --
     Sara A. Hotchkiss
    </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dec. 3<sup>
        <u>rd</u>
      </sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Morton's House</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I received yesterday a letter from you &amp; one today, both
     very welcome as I had not heard from you for some time &amp; had not heard of the reception
     of the money I sent you, but I have heard all now &amp; am very glad you are getting along
     so much better than I could have hoped -- I feel very grateful to our neighbors for their
     attention to your wants &amp; hope I may be able to repay them in some way.</p>
<p class="p10"> Well, we got back to our old quarters again today, Mr. Meade would not stay &amp; fight,
     he ran away night before last &amp; recrossed the river, we followed as soon as we saw that
     he was gone, but he had too much the start &amp; we only succeded in catching some 300 of
     the stragglers &amp; rear guard, so we turned round &amp; came back as the enemy had
     gone to his old quarters over in Culpeper. It was said by the prisoners that when Meade's men
     saw how we were prepared for them that they could not be induced to advance although ordered to
     do so. They behaved -page two- in that portion of the country they were in, stripping the
     people of every particle of food, burning the houses, almost over the heads of the helpless
     women &amp; children -- in one case carrying an old lady out of the house on a litter
     &amp; then applying the torch -- &amp; nearby committing atrocities too horrid to name.
     The ladies say the conduct of the negroes was worse than of the beastly Germans &amp;
     Irish. Meade's men were without food for over a day, our cavalry preventing a supply from
     reaching them. I am sorry we did not get a chance at the enemy -- we were ordered to advance on
     them the very day they fled &amp; a sanguinary battle it would have been. Gen. Lee was so
     hopeful &amp; thought we would be able to do them a great deal of damage &amp; punish
     them as they deserved. Meade thought to fall on our flank &amp; surprise us, but found all
     on the alert and ready for him when he came out of the immense body of woods that covered his
     movements. I have written to you twice since we started on this movement. Do not borrow any
     trouble about me -- I have -page three- two horses instead of none -- I have bought one, for
     which I pay $500 in monthly payments &amp; I have another that I found while looking for
     mine, a very good little horse, which I have been riding ever since -- Gen. Ewell says fall any
     way I may I will light on my feet -- so I suppose I shall always have a horse to ride.
     Pendleton had to put off his marriage on account of this movement of the army -- there was
     quite a party assembled at Moss Neck, but no bride groom came -- I
     suppose he will soon go, now we are likely to go into winter quarters --. We have had some very
     cold weather for a few days past &amp; have felt it keenly, exposed as we have been to it
     in the field - but today it has been very pleasant. I tell you I expect to enjoy a good rest
     tonight &amp; a long one - we have been roused up at 3 o'clock almost every morning for a
     week past &amp; then did not get to sleep until very late. </p>
<p class="p10"> Did you buy me any molasses of Mr. C. Bear or any one? I wish you would secure me some good
     if you can -- -page four- I have not yet made my application for a leave at Christmas, but do not doubt I shall be able to get one -- I will see if I
     can get some sort of a jacket for Allen -- I am sure one could have been gotten out for him of
     the kind worn by the soldiers, like mine at home, especially if something else, as my old
     jacket were used for all the inside pieces -- Get my pants made if you can -- I am very sorry
     for Mr. Erwine -- he has a large family to be thus turned out of doors -- I will try and get
     you some tallow &amp; bring it home -- I got Nelly's letter and will write to her again
     before long -- I can but think Capt. Sterrett did wrong by Allie, for he had cultivated her
     acquaintance long enough to know her well -- but I hope all will be for the best--</p>
<p class="p10"> I suppose Mr. Lacy will become one of my mess the next month -- he says many of his friends
     have offered to send him some good things to eat &amp; he will have them brought on. -- </p>
<p class="p10"> My love to all -- &amp; kiss the children for Pa -- &amp; may an ever present
     &amp; merciful God bless &amp; keep you all -- Write often -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your loving husband</p>
