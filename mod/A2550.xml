    <p>I wrote you <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of a letter 3 days ago, expecting to finish it the next day
     &amp; send it on to you, but, as in all other army doings, now or never, we were started
     off at dark that night, <orig reg="traveled">travelled</orig> most of the night, slept on my
     saddle blanket by the side of my horse, in a field, near Orange <abbr expan="Court  
 House"
      >C.H.</abbr> Then we were up by day the next morning, poking along through towards Culpeper
      <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> driving the Yankee picket before us, and camping along
     the road for several miles last night -- in fact reaching some 6 miles, the Division of Gen.
     A.P. Hill being in the rear. The enemy attempted to fall upon our rear last night, with a
     strong cavalry force, but they "caught a Tartar," finding us ready for them, &amp; were
     repulsed, we taking some 15 prisoners, at one point, and they attacked at another point
     &amp; met the same fate -- we have taken some 350 of Pope's Cavalry, now, some officers
     that we shall hold as hostages for the treatment of our people by Pope -- (<del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     here we were ordered forward &amp; away from my seat under a tree) I resume my writing on a
     hill top, in full view of several thousand of the enemy cavalry that have been drawn up all day
     in the hot sun, -- while we are maneuvering to take them, have been sitting round here all the
     evening -- trying to find out the enemy's position 4 P.M. the battle has opened -- &amp; we
     must <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> on -- it is about 6 miles west of Culpeper <abbr expan="Court  
 House"
      >C.H.</abbr> -- Sunday 6 A.M. -- the firing has opened again We had a bloody day yesterday --
     as desperate a fight as I ever saw -- but we drove the enemy away from the battle field, took
     12 leads of ammunition, 1 large piece of artillery, some 400 prisoners, one <abbr
      expan="Brigadier General">Brig. Gen.</abbr> &amp; a good many officers. The fight
     continued until 9 P.M. Our Gen. Winder was killed &amp; we had a good many others killed
     &amp; wounded -- We lost a good many men &amp; killed &amp; wounded large numbers
     of the enemy most of which they left on the battle field. I can write no more as the Gen. is
     about to start again &amp; we will have another bloody Sunday. Providence has kindly
     blessed our arms &amp; spared most of us -- May He still be near us. I <abbr
      expan="received">rec'd</abbr> my barrel. Send this &amp; let the rest see it. I will write
     this evening May God bless you all </p>
