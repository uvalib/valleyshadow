                            Virginia
                            Camped in the Woods 3 Miles below
                            Martinsburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind and much welcomed letter a few days since and was glad to hear from you. I should
                    have answered it sooner but we have been moving from place to place for the last two weeks &amp; hardly ever near a Post office &amp; to day I am Twenty five miles
                    from one but I have concluded to write at any rate hoping
                    that I might <i>[added: have]</i> a chance of sending it
                    before long. My health is very good and I hope these
                    uninteresting lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. Cousin Jas. V. is well and hearty. Your friend J.P. Lightner was here
                    yesterday evening he belongs to the Rockbridge College boys it is a fine company he said when he got
                    to Strasburg it was reported that we were fighting in Winchester &amp; when he got there
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> he heard that we were fighting in Martinsburg &amp; he pushed on and when he got
                        there he was told we were
                    fighting at our encampment it seems that it does some
                    persons good to lie just to keep up the excitement but it
                    will not be long I hope until we shall soundly whip
                    the demons of the North for the bloodthirsty villains
                    have invaded our soil at different points &amp; taken
                    property &amp; searched the houses for money. I
                    cannot write any thing to day that will interest
                    you it being Sunday &amp; to see no change in the soldiers if one did not
                    keep the account of the days he would not know when Sunday comes. Some of the
                    men are playing cards, oh that men would fear the
                    lord more &amp; serve him better. Sam Fitch has to
                    go on duty this morning for an hour or two &amp; he
                    looks mad I reckon he thinks he is violating the Sabbath but it is not his fault. I have had good luck I have not had to go on
                    duty on Sunday yet.</p>
<p class="p10">I had to stop writing for a little while as one of my mess wanted in his box he
                    took out his Bible and I opened it &amp; commenced reading at the sixty
                    third psalm and read three or four Chapters they
                    seemed to revive my low spirits I shall ever put my trust in the lord who is
                    able to do what so ever he will.</p>
<p class="p10">You asked me to send you my likeness to you I will the first opportunity though
                    it will not be a good one for I am burned almost black
                    with the sun.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not know when I may have the opportunity of having it taken. I must bring
                    this uninteresting letter to a Close hoping
                    that it may not be long until I may get back to old
                    Augusta give my love to all inquiring friends remember me <i>[deleted: when]</i> in the hours of your devotion if no where
                    else.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain yours &amp;C as ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Please write soon for I am most happy to hear from
                        at any time yours &amp;C. W.F.B.</p>
