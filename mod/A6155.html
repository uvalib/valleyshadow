<p class="p10">September<sup>the</sup> 5 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta County Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Affectionate Cousin Jimmy</p>
<p class="p10">It is with with the greatest of pleasure I comply with yours of
     the 12 which found me enjoying the best of health hoping the same may be your present Condition
     of health when Those few lines reach you I have nothing to write that will interest you at
     present but Sincerely hope this will find you with plenty to answer I always thought you placed
     more confidence in my Sincerity than to think I would go with the
     yanks when they came through here they knew I was to strong a secessionist to go with them &amp; I believe I am a purest one than ever they were the cause of a
      great   deal of excitement &amp; I believe
     a great many turned their long faces back to the Union but I never
     intend to do so as long as there yet remains one secessionist left
     &amp; I expect I will be the last one going into the Union. although I would do most anything to cause peace once more but it looks like we<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> will
     never again See the same times we once did we have some of the finest opportunities to have Sport making Apple butter but I can never enjoy myself as long as
     this war Continues I think we would all forget that times ever were to be enjoyed if this war
     lasts two years longer I don't think I Can ever forgive the Enemy for
     those they have killed I hope they will be made sorely repent for it but If they Continue
     fighting as they have recently there
     won't be a great number left on either side You stated in your letter
     of a young gentleman saying he was glad that I had accepted his Correspondance &amp; he
     thinks I have already received his address I don't remember of writing about any young gentleman but Cousin
     AM &amp; your brothers I'm almost in the dark about it I'm Sure I have never received his address I have
     a faint recollection since I have been writing of sending some word to you about something of
     the kind but I had almost forgotten<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> about it I want to know
     his name now &amp; what you told him I will have to give you a pounding the first time I
     see you about that I would like to know your reason for doubting my
     Sincerity when I told you that I was not Engaged you stated that you thought I was &amp;
     you Could guess his name etc. I would like very much to hear the
     name I'm in the dark about it myself I am anxious to know what my name is to be well Cousin we are having Some brandy made &amp; I expect
     I will kill myself drinking I am going to save some that I may get drunk when this Cruel war is
     over I was coming from greenville the other day &amp; I met a soldier he was as drunk as
     people generally get he insisted on me drinking but I told him I never drank any If I had only
     been acquainted with him I would certainly have plagued him enough but I was too bad scared to talk much if they had only some person been along with me I
     would have taken his brandy like I was<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>going to drink &amp; kept it he begged me
     to Excuse him for being drunk &amp; I told him I would if he would do so no more &amp;
     he promised he would do better but I know the boys promises are like pie
     crust they are made to be broken when they can get liquor to drink they never think of a
     promise he said the reason he had gotten so they was a lady Expressed a wish to see him so
     &amp; he had promised her she should I told him he was very excusable if he was fulfilling
     a promise but I told him I believed it was because he liked the
     taste of it instead of that I will Close by asking you to excuse this badly written &amp;
     Composed letter &amp; Correct all mistakes</p>
<p class="p10">believe me to be yours affectionately etc.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mollie M Houser</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS Please write soon again &amp; a   long
      letter give my love to your brothers &amp; other inquiring
      friends if there be any &amp; receive a due portion yourself please correct all mistakes I
      have been losing so much sleep I can't write yours Devotedly<br> MMH
