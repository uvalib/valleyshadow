<h4>Augusta County: William Cabell Rives to Alexander H.
                    H. Stuart, January 7, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Citing ill health, William Cabell Rives declines to write a national political
                    address; the context of the letter links the address with the constitutional
                    convention of Virginia.</p>

<p class="p10">7 Jan. 1868.</p>
<p class="p10">Castle-Hill</p>
<p class="p10">My dear sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Ever since the receipt of your letter of 19<sup>th</sup> ult., I have
                    been exceedingly indisposed, &amp; unable to give you a satisfactory answer
                    on a subject into which the state of my health necessarily intrudes as a ruling
                    element. Allow me first to address to my very deep sense of the great honor you
                    did me by placing me at the head of the committee to propose an address to the
                    people of the United States, &amp; I assure <i>[added: you]</i> of the devoted zeal with which I should assist in the execution
                    of this most important task, if my health enabled me to undertake it - on my
                    return from the Springs last autumn, I had a very violent &amp; obstinate
                    attack of nervous, inter<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>mittent fever, from the effects of which I am
                    still suffering. My health is so precarious that I cannot count upon it to
                    sustain me in any serious intellectual effort. Unless it should greatly improve,
                    therefore, it would be impossible for me to engage in the task, which, I
                    understand from what you say, devolves, in your opinion, on me as chairman of
                    the committee, unless <i>[deleted: it should be]</i> otherwise ordered by the
                    committee themselves. - If an address be expected at present, or at any early
                    period, I must of necessity decline the preparation of it in the actual state of
                    my health, &amp; turn it over to the able gentlemen you have associated with
                    me on the committee. If, on the contrary, the address be not expected now, or at
                    some early period, anx<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>ious I am to do whatever might be in my power
                    to justify your selection. I would still hold the matter under further
                    advisement. - I observed, from the proceedings of your convention published in
                    the newspapers, that the central or executive <i>[added: committee]</i> was to designate the time when the address should be
                    published, and I thought it likely that they would <i>[deleted: think]</i>
                    <i>[added: consider]</i> it expedient to postpone it, until
                    the convention now in session in Richmond should close their labours, &amp;
                    enable us to see what sort of constitution they intend for us. But I infer from
                    a letter received from Mr. Randolph <i>[unclear: Tucker]</i>, a day <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>or two ago, that an address is expected from the committee at an early day,
                    &amp; under these circumstances, I feel constrained to decline a task for
                    which I have <i>[added: not]</i> now requisite strength,
                    &amp; cannot expect from my present condition, to have in any short time. I
                    will, nevertheless, most cheerfully contribute my services as a member of the
                    committee in consultation with my colleagues when any address which shall be
                    proposed by any one of them. -</p>
<p class="p10">I remain, my dear sir, with the greatest respect most truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. C. Rives</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable A. A. Stuart
                            &amp;c &amp;c
