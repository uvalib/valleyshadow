<p class="p10">Saturday Aug. 9<sup>th</sup> 1862 &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10">Crooked Run church 1/2 way between
       Orange &amp; Culpeper Court Houses -- </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you <i>[illeg.]</i> of a letter 3 days ago, expecting to finish it the next day
     &amp; send it on to you, but, as in all other army doings, now or never, we were started
     off at dark that night, traveled most of the night, slept on my
     saddle blanket by the side of my horse, in a field, near Orange Court    House Then we were up by day the next morning, poking along through towards Culpeper
      Court House driving the Yankee picket before us, and camping along
     the road for several miles last night -- in fact reaching some 6 miles, the Division of Gen.
     A.P. Hill being in the rear. The enemy attempted to fall upon our rear last night, with a
     strong cavalry force, but they "caught a Tartar," finding us ready for them, &amp; were
     repulsed, we taking some 15 prisoners, at one point, and they attacked at another point
     &amp; met the same fate -- we have taken some 350 of Pope's Cavalry, now, some officers
     that we shall hold as hostages for the treatment of our people by Pope -- (<i>[illeg.]</i>
     here we were ordered forward &amp; away from my seat under a tree) I resume my writing on a
     hill top, in full view of several thousand of the enemy cavalry that have been drawn up all day
     in the hot sun, -- while we are maneuvering to take them, have been sitting round here all the
     evening -- trying to find out the enemy's position 4 P.M. the battle has opened -- &amp; we
     must <i>[illeg.]</i> on -- it is about 6 miles west of Culpeper Court    House -- Sunday 6 A.M. -- the firing has opened again We had a bloody day yesterday --
     as desperate a fight as I ever saw -- but we drove the enemy away from the battle field, took
     12 leads of ammunition, 1 large piece of artillery, some 400 prisoners, one Brigadier General &amp; a good many officers. The fight
     continued until 9 P.M. Our Gen. Winder was killed &amp; we had a good many others killed
     &amp; wounded -- We lost a good many men &amp; killed &amp; wounded large numbers
     of the enemy most of which they left on the battle field. I can write no more as the Gen. is
     about to start again &amp; we will have another bloody Sunday. Providence has kindly
     blessed our arms &amp; spared most of us -- May He still be near us. I received my barrel. Send this &amp; let the rest see it. I will write
     this evening May God bless you all </p>
