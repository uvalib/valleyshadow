<p class="p10">Dear Addie,</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 15th has just been received &amp; as I expect we will be marching soon
     I will answer it at once. I started Dear Tom's knapsack home on the 17th inst. in the care of
      <i>[unclear: Ferd Callighan ]</i> who took Uncle Ash's baggage home after his sad accident
     which I suppose you have heard of before this. I have also poor Tom's knife &amp; Testament
     which I failed to send by Ferd on the 17, I will take good care of both &amp; send them
     home to you by first opportunity. Unfortunately I did not see dear Tom on the morning after he
     died, as we moved forward at dawn in pursuit of the enemy, when I had gotten back in the
     evening he had been buried by a party of his Company who had been sent to bury the dear fellow.
     The poor fellow suffered very little Dear Cousin, &amp; I am sure he died as I wish to die
     &amp; all other brave soldiers fighting in our most just cause. When I see you which I hope
     will not be a very long time from this I will tell you all I know. You must excuse this short
     note, as I have not the heart to write after my late misfortune in loving my dear Uncle. Goodbye love to all</p>
<p class="p10">Yr affectionate cousin</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
