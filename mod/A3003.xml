                </opener>

                <p>As I am here doing nothing, &amp; can't get to the army, I will employ a few
                    moments this evening in writing to you. I will give you a brief history of my
                    trip to this place. I left Staunton on Tuesday morning after I left home in
                    Company with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Wilson &amp; several
                    other soldiers for Winchester. We had quite an interesting trip, had the company
                    of two very nice ladies, one of them however I am sorry to say was a married
                    lady. We arrived at Winchester on the next evening hired a four horse coach for
                    Martinsburg where we arrived Thursday evening, from this point we had to take it
                        <orig reg="afoot">a foot</orig>. On Firday morning <abbr expan="Lieutenant"
                        >Lt.</abbr> Wilson &amp; myself in company with <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt</abbr> Wharton of the 55<hi rend="super">th</hi>
                    <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> set sail for the Army, crossing the Potomack at
                    Williams Port, we went two miles into Maryland &amp; stayed all night with a
                    nice old fellow, good <hi rend="underline">
                        <unclear>cecist</unclear>
                    </hi> too by the way.- Saturday morning we started on expecting to get as far as
                        <unclear>Green</unclear> Castle <orig reg="Pennsylvania">Pensylvania</orig>,
                    but we had not proceeded very far on our way before we heard that the <orig
                        reg="Yankees">Yankies</orig> had made a raid into the town, however we
                    proceed on our way thinking we might be able to get through without much
                    difficulty. We stopped on the road side to rest &amp; were laying down
                    napping, when all at once we were startles by the noise of some cavalry riding
                    down the road at full speed <orig reg="hollering">hollorring</orig> the <orig
                        reg="Yankees">Yankies</orig> are coming! I tell you <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">we</add> got up &amp; left there in double quick time. We
                    fell back a short distance and made a stand but the <orig reg="Yankees"
                    >Yankies</orig> did not come on. Thinking that "prudence was the better part of
                    valor" we came back to this place, there being no chance of get through. We will
                    remain here <orig reg="until">untill</orig> the way is open to the army before
                    we try it again. We have had another big fight at <orig reg="Gettysburg"
                        >Getty'sburg</orig>
                    <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Penn</abbr>. Our loss is very heavy indeed, lost a
                    great many <pb n="2"/>officers.- none of our commanding <abbr expan="Generals"
                        >Genls</abbr> were wounded that we have heard of. <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr>
                    <orig reg="Ewell">Ewel</orig> was shot <orig reg="through">throu</orig> his
                    wooden leg, also had his horse shot from under him. Our Brigade suffered
                    severely. Our Company I am told lost a great many wounded &amp; one killed,
                    but cant find out any of the particulars - but one or two of the wounded from
                    our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> has gotten up yet. The enemy's
                        <unclear>loss</unclear> is said to be very heavy indeed. They lost two Major
                        <abbr expan="Generals">Genls</abbr>, several Brigadiers, &amp; a good
                    many <abbr expan="Colonels">Col's</abbr>. We captured about 13,000 prisoners
                    &amp; there has been a rumor here to day that <abbr expan="General"
                    >Genl</abbr> Lee had whipped the enemy badly on yesterday &amp; that he had
                    taken 40,000 prisoners this however needs confirmation. I must bring this to a
                    close for the present. The news we get is so conflicting that it is hardly to be
                    relied on Consequently I wont give you any more<lb/> I hope by the next time I
                    write you I can give you all the particulars.</p>
