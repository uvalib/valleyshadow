                <p>Catherine Cox, colored, this day personally appeared before me, a notary public
                    for the County of Augusta &amp; state of Virginia, &amp; made oath: That
                    she was employed in F. S. Tukey's family during the winter of 1866, as house
                    servant, &amp; during the time I recollect distinctly of his going to
                    Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Virginia on the day the last United States
                    soldier left here &amp; of his bringing home a supply of commissary stores,
                    among which were tea, coffee, sugar, soap, <unclear>beef</unclear>, candles,
                    &amp; a barrel of pork &amp; salted mackerel, the two last <del
                        hand="h1"/> together. Thats when Mr Tukey left home he did not tell Mrs
                    Tukey anything about his intent to go, &amp; she was somewhat
                        <unclear>anxious</unclear> consequently about him, &amp; that affiant
                    &amp; some of the teachers laughed at her, &amp; remarked in a joking
                    manner that her husband had run away from her. That when the articles already
                    named were unpacked, it was found that the coffee &amp; sugar, being in the
                    same box, were mixed, &amp; that said Tukey spent some time in trying to
                    separate them, one from the other. That one of the teachers, who was present
                    when the mackerel was taken out from among the pork, remarked that she hated
                    mackeral, &amp; always did: That <pb n="2"/>Mrs Tukey also remarked that she
                    was sorry they were put together, as she was <orig reg="afraid">affraid</orig>
                    the pork would taste of the mackeral. That affiant also recollects distinctly
                    that Mr Tukey separated them, putting the mackeral into a <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    barrel, &amp; then putting whole into his cellar, where he always kept the
                    government rations. That she never knew of Mr Tukey using government rations in
                    his own family, &amp; that she is satisfied he could not have done so
                    without affiant knowing it, for he told her which of the rations in the cellar
                    were his, &amp; what were the government's, and she (affiant) always got the
                    provisions as they were used, from the cellar herself. And, finally she has been
                    this particular in naming so many incidents, in order to show how it is that she
                    is enabled to speak with so much certainty as to how the groceries were received
                    &amp; used.</p>
