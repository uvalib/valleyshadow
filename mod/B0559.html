<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, February 15, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How responds to an order that appears to relate to his transportation supplies in
                    the district. In response, he relates the shortage of transportation available
                    to his agents, emphasizing the danger of Bureau agents traveling alone. He also
                    describes the problems arising from the fact that his district spans two
                    separate military departments.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Colonel O Brown Assistant Commissioner &amp;c
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">February 15th 1866</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have received your order to turn in the transportation in my possession, and in
                    reference to it desire to state that I have but one (1) officer acting as
                    Provost Marshall, under the order of Major General Terry, and he is at Lexington, Virginia and
                    he is at Lexington in charge of Sub-District
                    "A", three (3) counties. At Staunton there is a Civilian Assistant Superintendent in charge of Sub-District "B", two (2) Counties, and in these
                    five (5) Counties there are no United States Forces,
                    and no other effective means of interim communication, than by the mentioned
                    officer and civilians.</p>
<p class="p10">The boundary line between Augusta and Rockingham Counties separates the Department of Virginia from the Middle Military
                        Department, and compliance with this order will
                    leave the remaining (8) eight Counties, much the larger portion of the Sixth
                    District, without any means of transportation since the orders of Major General Terry are not effective here.</p>
<p class="p10">I have in use a spring wagon with two (2) horses, and I can more economically
                    traverse my District in it than by any other means of transportation.</p>
<p class="p10">I have also in use two (2) horses at Staunton by the <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Civilian Assistant Superintendent and me at Lexington by
                    the Military Assistant Superintendent
                    acting Provost Marshall and in my judgement
                    each officer should have at least two (2) public horses. One reason being that
                    it is unsafe for an officer of this Bureau to travel in these Counties
                    unattended and in the entire absence of Military support. In this Middle Military Department with the voluntary assistance
                    of <i>[unclear: 
                        officers
                    ]</i> I have managed as well as I might in the hopes that at some time
                        Quartermaster supplies might be obtainable, but am
                    unable now to make requisition <i>[illeg.]</i> officers on duty in this portion
                    of my District because they are not acting Provost
                    Marshalls awaiting instructions.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall proceed to Staunton, and retaining one (1) horse for the officer at
                    Lexington, turn in the other four (4) and the wagon, equipments &amp;c with
                    the least possible delay, as ordered.</p>
<p class="p10">I am &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W Storer How<br>Captain &amp;c</i></p>
