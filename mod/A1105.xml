                </opener>

                <p>The last letter we received from you was written last July, and reached us in
                    September. Since that David &amp; I both have written you, but I think it
                    doubtful whether our letters ever reached you. The last was written the last
                    week in December by David; which I infer never reached you, as Mollie has just
                    received a letter from the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr Lockridge,
                    which he commences by saying that he had promised her friends in Chattooga
                    County to write to her. I, hence, infer that he had recently seen her friends.
                    He closes his letter in these words: "My love to Mr Gilkeson and his aged father
                    if he is still alive." Now, my Dear Brother, if that last letter of Davids had
                    reached you it is not probable Mr Lockridge would have closed his letter in
                    those words: for that letter contained the mournful intelligence of the death of
                    our dear father. I will give you the particulars of his death, as this letter
                    will very likely convey to you the first intelligence of this sad event. He died
                    very suddenly on the 23<hi rend="super">rd</hi> of December, and on Christmas
                    day we laid him to rest by the side of our sainted Mother. Truly it was a sad
                    Christmas, and although seven months have elapsed, yet time seems to bring no
                    healing on his wings to me. His health had been quite as good as usual up to
                    within two or three days of his death, &amp; even then he did not complain
                    as much as he often did. Uncle David told me that he thought the last two or
                    three times he saw him he seemed to be more lively &amp; cheerful than he
                    had seen him for a long time. And this was strikingly true,<pb n="2"/> he
                    remarked, the last time he saw him, which was the Monday morning previous to his
                    death. On that morning they met at <abbr expan="William">W<hi rend="super"
                        >m</hi></abbr>
                    <orig reg="Guthrie's">Guthries</orig> on some business; and whilst there a
                    shower of rain came up, and cousin William took off their saddles and laid them
                    in his porch. When they left Father picked up his saddle and put it on his
                    horse, whilst <abbr expan="William">W<hi rend="super">m</hi></abbr> Guthrie put
                    on Uncle David's saddle. When ready to mount, Uncle David <orig reg="led"
                    >lead</orig> his horse some distance to a stump to mount from, but Father
                    gathered up his reins, put his foot in the stirrup, and mounted from the ground,
                    and at the same time looked back over his shoulder &amp; remarked in
                        <unclear>his</unclear> usual pleasant manner, "brother David, I have that
                    advantage over you yet, I can still mount from the ground." On the day before,
                    he went to church although it was a very rainy, disagreeable day. On Monday
                    night he complained of having caught cold, &amp; continued to complain of
                    not feeling well, although he went about as usual over the farm up to Thursday
                    night. On that night and Friday morning he took medicine. David asked him before
                    breakfast on Friday morning if he should feed his hogs for him; he replied, "oh
                    no, that he would attend <add hand="h1" place="inline">to them</add> after a
                    while" After breakfast, however, he told David to feed the hogs, as he would not
                    go out there. He went from the dining room into his chamber and amused himself
                    with the children as was his custom. He had the lounge drawn up before the fire
                    on which he reclined a portion of the time during the fournoon. About 12 O'Clock
                    he read a chapter or two in the bible verse about with David's oldest child,
                    whom he taught to read and whose <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and proficiency pleased him
                    much. Directly afterwards he went into the parlor and in less than half an hour
                    returned to the chamber and took a seat on the lounge and made some inquiries of
                    David, who<pb n="3"/> was present, relative to business. He very soon laid down
                    on the lounge &amp; almost immediately David heard him snore, and said to
                    him, "are you asleep already, Father" but receiving no answer went to him, but
                    says that he does not think that he drew a breath after he got to him. Thus, my
                    dear brother, passed away our dear Father. How we should cherish his memory, for
                    I know you will agree with me in saying that not many persons have been blessed
                    with such a Father. He was certainly one of the most perfect models of a man and
                    a christian I ever knew. Enclosed I send you an obituary which appeared in the
                    Central Presbyterian about a month after his death.</p>
                <p>He made a will in January 1863 in which he left all his property to David
                    &amp; me excepting his Bank stock ($2500) which he left to you; stating
                    that, in his opinion, that amount together with what he had already given you
                    would about make you equal with us. I very much fear, however, that in the
                    present conditions of the banks you will never be able to realize much from it.
                    Mr Stuart has just stepped in, &amp; says that it can never be worth <orig
                        reg="anything">any thing</orig>. Will it be possible for you to pay us a
                    visit this fall? Do try to come. We will be so much delighted to see you. It
                    would do my heart good to see you again, after the awful conflict we have passed
                    through. I would enjoy a visit from you now so much more than when you were here
                    before, as I am now keeping house. Do write immediately, and do say you will
                    visit us this fall. My little <add hand="h1" place="inline">family</add> are now
                    in pretty good health. My oldest boy Willie is just recovering from a severe
                    attack of dysentery. We thought for several days that we should certainly have
                    lost him, but without a relapse we now think he will get well. He is just
                    beginning to walk. He was six years old in April. We have four very inter<pb
                        n="4"/>esting children, two girls &amp; two boys. David and family are
                    all well.</p>
                <p>We have been very anxious to communicate with you ever since the close of the
                    war, but could not ascertain how we could send a letter in the absence of mail
                    facilities. One of our citizens starts for Georgia tomorrow, and I had made up
                    my mind to write you and enclose the letter in an Envelope directed to
                        <unclear>McClung</unclear> of Rome &amp; get this friend of mine to try
                    to convey it to <unclear>McClung</unclear>. But on yesterday Mr Lockridge's
                    letter came to hand, and he directs Mollie to <unclear>direct</unclear> any
                    letters she may write home to him at <unclear>Ringgold</unclear> &amp; he
                    will convey them to their destination. So I have concluded to send this by my
                    friend to convey to Mr Lockridge instead of to Mr <unclear>McClung</unclear>. Mr
                    L. does not say whether they have a mail to Ringgold or not, but if there is,
                    then will now certainty of his getting this if mailed in Atlanta or Augusta than
                    if mailed here. Therefore I will give it to my friend to mail in Georgia, or if
                    the mails are not running yet to convey it to Mr L. in some other way. We had
                    not heard a word from you since your letter written in July last until some two
                    or three weeks since David received a letter from James Gamble written in Camp
                        <unclear>Chaser</unclear> which gave us news from you as recently as March.
                    And Mr <orig reg="Lockridge's">Lockridges</orig> letter gives us news from you I
                    suppose up to about the first of this months. "Much has occurred here" which
                    will be news to you but I do not know where to begin. I expect you have not
                    heard of Carlisle Gilkeson's death which occurred in August last. Do write
                    immediately and if possible do visit us this fall. I feel so anxiously to see
                    you once more. <abbr expan="Emily">Em</abbr> joins me in much love to you
                    &amp; the children. Hoping to hear from and see you soon</p>
