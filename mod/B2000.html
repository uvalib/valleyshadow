<p class="p10">August 9th 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">You will probably recollect that some 4 weeks ago I submitted to you through
                        Professor Woodbury, a
                    <i>[unclear: propposition]</i> on taking charge of
                    one of your Mission Houses in Portsmouth. Since then I have moved to Staunton,
                    whilst on my way here I again saw Professor Woodbury
                    and he desired to know if I should <i>[unclear: start]</i> one in Staunton on the same <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> I told him yes, he said he would consult you and give me an
                    answer but I cannot hear a word <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>from him although I <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    written to him since I went to New Jersey Now will you
                    please take the matter in Hand and give me an <i>[unclear: immediate]</i>
                    answer.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton will be an <i>[unclear: entire]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> field of operations and will want about 4 teachers, and in
                    order for me to carry out my propositions one of them must be Miss McLeane and
                    both she and myself would be very glad to have her
                    sister, Mrs Dunn come with her.</p>
<p class="p10">Now if you will answer at <i>[unclear: once]</i> you will greatly oblige</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend and Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F.S. Tukey<br>Assistant Superintendent
                        Freedmen &amp;c</i></p>
<p class="p10">Direct to Staunton via care Captain W. S. How
                        Assistant Quartermaster</p>
