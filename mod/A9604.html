<h4>Augusta: John D. Imboden to Annie Lockett, December
                    4, 1870<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Imboden complains that Annie has not written to him for several days. He then
                    explains his reasons for urging her to write and shares his thoughts on the
                    importance of marriage to a man's happiness. He suggests that he will return to
                    Virginia soon on "Company affairs."</p>

<p class="p10">Sunday night Dec<u>
                                <sup>r</sup>
                        </u> 4, 1870</p>
<p class="p10">New York</p>
<p class="p10">My own darling-</p>
<p class="p10">If you are the dearest and sweetest little woman in the world don't you think I
                    am the most patient and kind hearted old gentleman of all your acquaintance?
                    Think of it, this is the <u>fourth</u> letter, at long
                    intervals, since I have had a reply to one of mine. Just three weeks ago to day
                    I parted from you, and that night wrote you from Keysville, and that is the only
                    letter to which I have received a reply. Couldn't you
                    have sent me a little note from Laurenceville? I won't
                    scold. I never scold, but if you could know with what avidity I read every word
                    you write me, and how anxiously I look forward always to hear from you, I am
                    sure you would admire my pa-<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>tience and my philosophy.</p>
<p class="p10">My darling is all the world to me now. I love my children as dearly as any father
                    ever did, and they are as lovable, but there is in the human heart a capacity to
                    love that is not gratified by mere paternal affection. A large part of my life
                    has been one of the deepest and tenderest love for woman. I <u>know</u> how glorious it is to be master of a woman's whole heart, and to
                    feel that she is mistress of mine. Long years of the purest pleasure in that
                    holiest of all earthly relations husband of a true and noble woman, has taught
                    me that outside of it, there is little worth living for. When I first met you I
                    was almost indifferent to the world. I did not know that it any longer contained
                    any one whom I could love again, as I had loved in the past. Ere I had known you
                    three days, I saw that I had found a woman at whose feet I could lay my whole
                    heart, and then my anxiety was to know how I <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> could win yours. You
                    know how earnestly I labored <i>[deleted: the]</i> to accomplish that result.</p>
<p class="p10">Providence favored my suit &amp; you gave me your young &amp; noble
                    heart. Ever since I have felt how blest I am. I feel the pain of separation
                    every day, I am sure more keenly than you, because the wreck of my happiness
                    that has occured more than once in the past, has prepared me by a bitter
                    experience, to appreciate the infinite pleasure of the Constant <i>[added: presence of]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: pleasure of loving]</i> one's heart's idol. But as a certain
                    period of separation is inevitable, I long to alleviate its pain as much as
                    possible by frequent communication with you. And had you a daily mail I would
                    write to you every night. Therefore you must pardon me for complaining a little
                    at your long silence. When you are at home again, please, as you value my
                    happiness, never let a mail leave without bringing to me a letter from you - a
                    long sweet letter - or if that may not be, even a little note will be prized.</p>
<p class="p10">When you are my dear little wife I may spoil you, if petting can do it, for I
                    feel that the debt of gratitude I owe you for making me so happy can never be
                    paid off by all the endearments I can bestow on you.</p>
<p class="p10">This week I will probably know when I may expect to return to Virginia. I expect Colonel Flournoy tomorrow. Indeed he may now be here, as
                    I wrote urging him to come on yesterday, or as soon afterwards as possible. I
                    suppose our company affairs will require me to spend some weeks of the winter in
                    your County &amp; Brunswick. If so <u>where</u> would you
                    advise me to make my head quarters? especially to spend my Saturdays and
                    Sundays? Do you know any pleasant place in Mecklenburg where I would sometimes
                    be a welcome guest? I will be guided mainly by your advice.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not a line from sister Lou sisnce her first short &amp; hasty note and
                    not a word from Sis Ella - will quarrel with them.</p>
<p class="p10">With love to all, I am always yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
