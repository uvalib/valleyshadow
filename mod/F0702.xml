 Dear <name type="person">Henry</name>:--  
 </salute>  
 </opener>  
   
 <p>Yours of the 22nd   
 <abbr expan="ultimate">ult.</abbr> was received in due time, but<lb/>   
 not answered as soon as its demands required, but "better late than<lb/>   
 never." <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">"</add><orig reg="So">so</orig> here goes."    
 In my last I spoke of the sight presented in our<lb/>   
 streets, but since that time things have changed considerably, and<lb/>   
 the scenes presented in our streets on Friday and Saturday of last week<lb/>   
 were quite a different aspect reality be stamped on every move.<lb/>    
 On Friday five companies of Cavalry, the <hi rend="underline">heroes</hi>   
 of   
 <name type="place">Sumpter</name>  
  (except<lb/> <name type="person"><abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr>   
 Anderson</name>), four <abbr expan="Regiments">Regs.</abbr> of troops,   
 accompanied by their bands and<lb/>  
 followed by their baggage wagons,   
 which make a peculiar <orig reg="rumbling">rum-<lb/>  
 bling</orig> noise, this Brigade was six miles long   
 (<name type="person"><abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr>  
 McMullens</name><lb/>  
 <name type="Company">Philadelphia Rangers</name> were in the crowd.)   
 You may and can only<lb/>   
 imagine what the effect of such <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">a</add>   
 scene would be, the sight<lb/>   
 was the most sublime that I  
 ever witnessed, the bands of<lb/>   
 music with numerous fifes and drums,-- the  
 heavy tread

 of about forty wagons, all conspired to bewilder the  
 <orig reg="understanding">undrestanding</orig><lb/>   
 and render vague all our preconceived ideas of war.<lb/>  
 The movements of Saturday were not quite so imposing, but<lb/>   
 for the cavalry <del hand="h1">it</del> they would have been equally grand.  
 Sabbath<lb/>   
 approached finding our citizens in a state of uproar &amp;<lb/>   
 confusion, cars were running <orig reg="and">an</orig>  
 screaming - men were working<lb/>   
 wagons were moving through our streets  
 from morning till night<lb/>   
 and citizens <add hand="h1" place="inline">were</add> on a continual parade.  
 <orig reg="Truly">truly</orig> such scenes, such<lb/>   
 sabbaths, and such times, were never before  
 ours to behold.<lb/>    
 <name type="person">Uncle Stumbaugh</name> will in my opinion leave very  
 soon, but when<lb/>   
 I do not know, but think, <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig> or tomorrow,   
 if you should happen<lb/>   
 to see any of our folks and it is not to much trouble, you  
 would<lb/>   
 oblige me by telling them, that if they want to see him that<lb/>  
 now is the <orig reg="time.">time,</orig>   
 <name type="person">Isadore</name>  
 has been confined to bed sick for several<lb/>   
 days and doesn't seem to improve much, and I fear that he will<lb/>   
 not be able to go along with his fellow soldiers.  
        
 </p><p>  
 There were fifty wagons brought up on Saturday night, and by<lb/>  
 seven O'Clock <orig reg="Sunday">sunday</orig> morning they were all  
 unloaded.<lb/>   
 I received a letter from <name type="person">D.R.P. Shoemaker</name>   
 on Saturday. I must<lb/>   
 answer it <orig reg="today">to day</orig> or   
 <orig reg="tomorrow">to-morrow</orig>,   
 he is yet at <name type="place">Pleasant Hill</name> and<lb/>   
 says that if anything would  
 induce him to <orig reg="shoulder">sholder</orig> a musket it would<lb/>   
 be an invasion of old <name type="place">Franklin</name>.    
 <orig reg="Good">good</orig> for him he seems<lb/>   
 to be a Union man: even to the  
 point of his nose, and <add hand="h1" place="inline">so</add> he<lb/>   
 should be.

 You seemed to think that some other Nation  
 might join with the South<lb/>   
 but I believe our cause is a just one, and  
 if, all the other nations<lb/>   
 of the earth should join with their teeming  
 millions and come<lb/>   
 to our shores in battle array against us, that by  
 trusting in the<lb/>   
 god of battles, who I believe is superintending our  
 movements, that<lb/>   
 triumph must be ours, but we must do our share of the  
 work and<lb/>   
 stand right up to the mark, whether death be our lot   
 <orig reg="or">a</orig> not<lb/>   
 <name type="person">Henry</name>, I have no fear of the result,   
 we may lose many good<lb/> men, but if  
 we go to the work right I feel confident of   
 <orig reg="success">succes</orig>.<lb/>   
 I am sorry that I have not time to answer your letter fully<lb/>   
 but if you knew how often I have been called away from<lb/>   
 my writing I know <add hand="h1" place="inline">you</add> would excuse me,  
 there has been about<lb/>   
 eight <orig reg="persons">person</orig> in here bothering me all the  
 time, and no person in<lb/>   
 the office to be bothered but myself   
 as <name type="person">  
 <abbr expan="Messieurs">Messrs.</abbr>   
 Carlisle</name> &amp;<lb/>   
 <name type="person">Stewart</name> have not reached yet.   
 <orig reg="If">if</orig> I have time I <add hand="h1" place="inline">will</add>try and<lb/>
