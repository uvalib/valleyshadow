<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I have got back here from my trip to Dry River -- very tired -- and as Imboden is going
     tomorrow through Briery Branch Gap and I can save 50 miles ride by staying here and going that
     way, and get rest for a half day &amp; night, I think it best to stay and rest myself fully
     before starting, though I should like very much to come home. They buried Frank Emmitt and
     young Harman at Mossy Creek today -- Mr. Brown is complaining some. I want Mose to get my horse
     &amp; bring him back -- I write a note to Nelson about him [tho' EXPAND TO though] Aunt
     Margaret is well. I will write to you very soon. See if I left my white handkerchief at home, I thought I dropped it there. Send me the gloves if
     you have fixed them. If there is any authentic news from Jackson &amp; army write to me by
     Mose. If Nelson is not at home see that my Leather halter is on my horse &amp; have my
     saddle, blanket, &amp; bridle all on my horse. If Cy paid for putting on a shoe give it
     him. I suppose I shall soon be home again -- Good bye &amp; God bless you </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
