<p class="p10">This is a very desolate looking country. no fences of any account some of the
                    houses are torn down and others are not disturbed. there are two very fine
                    residences one on each side of our camp we get water at either. the one is a
                    union family and they have a fine orchard &amp; flowers garden, and yards.
                    it is a grand old residence and nothing is disturbed. the inmates of the other
                    have left. part of the house has been used for a stable part for head quarters.
                    the windows are broken and the <i>[unclear: fluid]</i> is the common property
                    of the men. the fields all<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>over the part of the country we are in are
                    all open and look as if they had never been fenced here and there you may see a
                    small patch of corn but I have seen but two fenced fields you seldom see any one
                    but soldiers. we are passing over the same ground which M<sup>c</sup>Clellans grand army passed over last winter. Camp life is very pleasant
                    so far there is so much variety and so much company that a person can not help
                    being cheerful. I wish you were here to eat with us we can cook as good a dinner
                    as any man need want we take pride in having everything nice. Tell the girls there is no<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> use in trying to scare
                    us with the idea of bachelors hall for we have tried it and get along very well
                    the worst part is washing dishes we often sleep in the middle of the day for one
                    half hour or an hour. we only drill in the morning and evening. Maj. Hershbarger
                    is here drilling the officers. I expect you can't read
                    this writing, but I am writing with my paper in one hand and pen in the other
                    and the boys are talking all the time so you will have to make some allowance. Cook sends his best respects to you and
                    says you must write all the news the rest of our family Liz Boyd Bruce<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Parkers boys M<sup>c</sup>Cune (cake bakers son) are all well and
                    hearty I think I will stop till I see whether I get any news from home tonight. Aug 26 I have not got a letter yet. <i>[deleted: there is]</i>I got a Valley Star from
                    <i>[unclear: Neuville]</i>. Capt has not received his trunk yet but I think he
                    will get it soon. Jacob is well and doing well he is drilling a squad sometimes
                    cooking &amp; so on <i>[deleted: Dr]</i>Lieutenant Trout is the kindest
                    officer we have. the mail man is coming I must stop.</p>
