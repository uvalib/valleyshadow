<p class="p10">Greenville Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">In all probability you think that I am dead or forgotten you as I have kept
                    silent for so long. I received your letter on the
                    eve before the battle of the fifth while we were cooking
                    rations I was truly glad to hear from you. I was wounded on last Thursday the 12th a flesh wound in the right arm near
                    the shoulder I have no doubt but you will expect me
                    to give you a full account of the casualties of our company on that day but I am
                        sorry I can not I was wounded about nine oclock
                    &amp; went <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>back to the field hospital &amp; got my wound
                    dressed &amp; stayed there
                    until twelve oclock; when all that was able to walk
                        were ordered back to some other hospital &amp;
                        there was none nearer than Louisa C.H. I begged them to let me stay
                        until the fight was over but they said I could be
                    of no use &amp; would just be in the way Capt Dempster advised me to go on
                    to some hospital Sam A Lightner Mays &amp; Hight, were wounded &amp; came home with me all slight wounds; Lightner
                    wounded in the right hand Mays in the left side &amp; Hight on the right
                        shoulder Jake was safe when I left him he was
                    with me after we fell back from our breastworks &amp; I don't think our Brigade went in any more
                    that day I have not the least doubt but many of our <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>boys ware taken
                    prisoners; The enemy
                    amassed
                    their troops in front of the second Brigade &amp;
                    at daylight charged the second &amp; drove them from their breastworks &amp; following them closely captured many. By having that gap open thay soon attacked our
                    Brigade in front flank &amp; in the rear. The front line was dispersed &amp; a great
                    many of our boys jumped over the breastworks &amp; took after the Yanks
                    capturing one of their
                    colors Colonel Funk then told us if we did not get
                    out of there we would be all captured. Then we
                    commenced retreating to our second line of works &amp; while I was crossing
                    the field I was wounded I am very thankful to the
                    great &amp; good God that I came out so well the air seemed filled with the
                        leaden
                    messengers of death I do not know whether
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Brother John came out safe or not he was on the skirmish line
                    &amp; when the enemy advanced he fell back on the
                    left of the Regt. Abe came out safe I heard from him friday I hope to get the
                    all particulars of the battle tomorrow. Jim
                    Vines, Kelley &amp; Sayton was take prisoners
                    last thursday week the 9th. I was very sorry for him but hope he may be well
                    treated Cicero Bare was mortally wounded since died
                    John Pilson has lost a leg <i>[added: amputated]</i> above
                    the knee. Jim Trusler was killed dead Willie Gardner was killed a great many wounded from different parts of Augusta The Yanks have fought with more desperation than they ever fought before Sometimes
                    I can but cry. oh Lord, what demon has taken possession of the people that they are so thirsty for blood. Lord ease
                        their
                    appetites
                    <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>I suppose you have heard
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> who all were wounded in our Company the first days fight, all my mess have been
                    wounded but Crist, Rubush Abny was wounded in the ear Shot a round hole the size
                    of a Minie ball in the left ear he will always be known as cross eared Abny Trotter received a flesh wound in the left thigh &amp; Grieaver was
                    wounded in the foot I suppose his wound is very painful. Since the commencement of the fighting our Company has had fifteen wounded &amp; one has died
                    Tom Shannon Campell he was mortally wounded last Tuesday
                    morning &amp; died that evening poor fellow I went and talked to him &amp; tried to cheer him, He said oh Bill I can not be <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>cheeful my wound is too
                    painful he was soon moved off
                    &amp; I couldn't get to say much to him. Our
                    division has lost heavily in prisoners &amp; wounded. When we commenced
                    fighting we had four Brigadeer Generals &amp; one Maj Gen. now we have none
                    able to command. Johnson &amp; Stuart captured; Stafford &amp; Jones
                        were killed. Walker badly wounded in the arm. All
                    our Regimental field officers came out safe Cousin William Koiner was badly
                    wounded last thursday. The night before we started from our old camp Capt
                    Lampster Jim Vines &amp; George Valentine came out to enquire the way of
                    salvation oh how I wish our army would become an army of Christians then I am sure <br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br>we would be invincible our God
                    would smile upon us &amp; we would seen be a free &amp; happy people I
                    saw your Father today. he was well &amp; said all were well at home Rachel C came up to see me to inquire after her
                    brother he was well the day before the great Battle I was glad to hear you were well pleased in Rockbridge &amp; was happy try
                    &amp; make your older sister cheerful &amp;
                    happy in her new home with a kind husband by her side to console her every want dear Kate you asked me whether I had any
                    objections to you sending your friend your picture What objections could I have
                    I am sure I am not your master or lawgiver I would advise you <br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br>to do
                    as you think best I hope you have not delayed sending it to him on account of my
                    delaying writing so long Abney had all my paper &amp; envelopes in his portfolio &amp; took it with him when he was
                    wounded &amp; we were almost constantly in the
                    ditches waiting for the enemy to advance. You asked me
                    my reasons for telling your cousin about our estrangement. She guessed as much by my not going down to see you
                    She asked me wasn't she right &amp; I could not
                    deny it; She seemed sorry &amp; hoped it would all be made up &amp; for
                        <i>[added: my]</i> saying you mistreated me I deny it.
                    dear Kate I feel sad this evening I often think I would be happier if I was taken out of this
                    world &amp; could be with a kind Mother in heaven My prospect for worldly
                        happiness is dark forgive my weakness in thus writing. My heart seems filled to over
                    flooding this evening. <br><br>[<i>page 9</i>]<br>We recieved news
