<p class="p10">June 21<sup>st</sup> 18/60</p>
<p class="p10">Hagerstown</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I imagine you are wondering what - has become of me. I have been silent so long.
                    I can plead no excuse but my old and bad habit of Procrastination, I can get
                    very few letters written, I seem to be always busy through the day and in the
                    evening am out or have company, and I determined as it is a rainy evening I
                    would devote it to letter writing. We are still in confusion with our building
                    but- hope soon to be over the worst. We have had a very uncomfortable time and
                    also very incon <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>venient but I think we will be repaid when it is done
                    it will add so much to our comfort and convenience. I see by the papers Congress
                    will soon adjourn, you will then be at leisure and must come to see us. I see
                    you are moving about a little making speeches already <u>if it
                        were</u> only for <u>the Union Party</u> it <u>would</u> be <u>all right</u>. I cannot
                    be a Republican. Mary Emma was here yesterday looking remarkably well, as she
                    grows older she grows handsomer, <i>[deleted: There ever]</i> a fine thing
                    isnt it. she had a charming trip both to Philadelphia and Pittsburg. They expect the bride and
                    groom next week I must try and get to see them. I wish you could see them in
                    Washington. Jinnie will not be home until they come from the Virginia Springs,
                    Nannie <i>[added: Findley]</i> is going to make her a visit
                    next week-- They have poor Mary <i>[unclear: Shunk's]</i> baby at January <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> and are all perfectly devoted to it and would like to keep it but
                    Mrs <i>[unclear: Shunk]</i> claims it and will take it home on Saturday. I am
                    told it is like its Mother -- Poor Mary, her end was a sad one. Mary Alvey came
                    home two weeks ago, very much broken in health, she was very sick at her
                    Father's and Dr thinks if she had remained another week she would have died. she
                    looks dreadfully and was too unwell to travel but- would come home, he thinks
                    her symptoms are more favorable now. I wrote to Lizzie before she left Baltimore but have not heard from her. I am afraid she
                    did not get the letter. I will write her a few lines tonight-- she promised to write me when she heard from Lizzie but she
                    has not done it--. I begged her to come to see us this summer but I don't- know what her plans are. Write soon and let me know
                    when you will come to see us. Dr has <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> been complaining very much with
                    a pain in his back but is better today I hope it- is
                    nothing serious. The children are well and grow very fast. Lillie is devoted to
                    school and learns very fast she reads quite well-- I must close and write a few
                    lines to Lizzie, write soon</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Kate --</i></p>
<p class="p10">Dr says if you have a copy of Sumner's speech please send
                        it to him he would like to see it, Mr Heandy is very
                        anxious to see it also.</p>
