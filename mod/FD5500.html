              in while we were there. They had a skirmish with them at Greencastle. They are coming for sure. Andy and James took the horses to the

              followed Milroy's wagon trains which went through town yesterday. About 500 wagons and
              2,000 horses-a very valuable train. The rebels are mannerly
              yet and do not disturb private property. They have their pickets all around us. Our
              news is cut off and we are under rebel rule.</p></p>

              for horses. Their pickets are stationed all around us. 2 O'clock A.M. The Rebels are just leaving town. Before they left they made the
              citizens give up their guns, which they broke up. One of the Rebs set Oak's and Limm's
              warehouse on fire, but it outened.</p></p>

              Men &amp; women running away from town. A great excitement. The Rebels hold Hagerstown in strong force. Self on picket all night

<p class="p11"><b>June, Friday, 19, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine day. Still a great deal of excitement about the Rebels, who are scouring the country in every direction about Waynesboro,
              Greencastle, Mercersburg [and] Finkstown for horses and cattle and Negroes. The
              excitement is very great down the road towards Harrisburg. Worse than here. No troops
              have come as yet.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Saturday, 20, 1863</b></p>

              to 80,000-across the Potomac, by Harpers ferry. Self to Shippensburg yesterday
              carrying letters down. May &amp; Ben are down the county and can not come home. We
              have no mail from him as the Rebels burnt Scotland
            bridge.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>June, Sunday, 21, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine summer day. A shower in the afternoon. The
              Excitement about the rebels is very high yet. The 8th New York State Militia came to town today. The 71st is to be here in a short time. The Rebels
              stole Tailor's drove of cattle up in the mountain and got them across the river. 8
              O'clock P.M. The rebels are at Hughes Rolling mill this
              evening. About 1,000 of them went through Greencastle
              last evening. They take horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, &amp;c. Our pickets are
              stationed at the Gate house. We have scarcely 1,000 men in all with our home
            guard.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>June, Tuesday, 23, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine day. The rebels are coming again. J. Landis got me
              to take his horses down the valley this morning. Went to Landis's, and from there I
              went on a scout to hunt up Ben &amp; James Warner. Could not find them. About 2
              o'clock I got back to Shippensburg. The excitement was very great, so I went to
              Landis's and took my horses to the mountain below Newburg and stayed there over night. The Rebels came to
              Chambersburg about 10 o'clock.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Wednesday, 24, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine day. The Rebels came to Shippensburg today. They are in strong force-Cavalry, Infantry &amp;
              Artillery-the whole under the command of Lee, Commander in Chief of the Rebel Army.
              This is no mere raid. It is a formidable invasion. Self at the mountain with a farmer
              by the name of Pie. Our forces at Harrisburg are under McClellan.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Thursday, 25, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine, warm, cloudy day. The rebels are scouring Franklin,
              Cumberland, York &amp; Adams counties for horses and cattle. They have come no
              lower down than Shippensburg yet; think their object is to attack Baltimore. Self with
              my stock of six horses in the mountains, yet went out on a scout in the morning. Found
              the rebels near Newburg, but made my escape.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Friday, 26, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A wet, rainy day. The rebels are in Newburg. Took about 100
              head of cattle. They are every place you hear of in this part
              of the State, taking [a] great many horses &amp; cattle. Lee's whole army is in
              our valley-about 90,000 men. We do not know where Hooker is with our army. Some say on
              the Potomac by Williamsport, others at Baltimore. Self at the mountains with the
              horses. Do not know where Ben &amp; Andy are. Think at Miller's or at
            Harrisburg.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Saturday, 27, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A cloudy, rainy day. The rebels are still in my vicinity
              about Newburg, Strausburg, Orrstown, and Roxbury. About home the Rebels are thick as may be. Some 20,000 marched past here towards Baltimore.
              A. P. Hill's Division and several others. Their wagon trains were a couple [of] miles
              in length. They had 18 pieces of Artillery. They encamped out by Luckyfoot. Our army
              at Harrisburg under McClellan is reported 60,000 strong. Mostly militia. Some of our
              drafted men are there.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Sunday, 28, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine warm day. The Rebels are marching down the valley. I can hear their drums and
              wagon trains quite plain from my camp as they are going down the pike towards
              Carlisle. It is Ewell's (formerly Jackson's) and Longstreet's divisions-about 25,000
              men. This evening they are reported to be in Carlisle. Ewell has his headquarters in
              the Barracks.</p><p class="p10">To day the rebels robbed the mill of several hundred bushels of corn &amp; oats. About 15,000 rebels marched past towards Baltimore.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Monday, 29, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Things look a little better about Newburg. The rebels have all left this morning. I started on a scout. Went to Newburg. No
              rebels there. Went at [to] Orrstown, where they gave me a chase. From there I went at
              [to] Strausburg, as my retreat to Newburg was cut off. There they chased me again from
              them. I went to Roxbury. No rebels there, but in half an
              hour they came in and I had to cross the mountain. Went to Madin's and got my dinner
              and then went to Joseph Ryder's up [the] valley about Fannettsburg and stay over
              night. At home the rebels are robbing the mill, and they
              pressed it into their service and made us grind for them.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June, Tuesday, 30, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A warm cloudy day yesterday. I came home. Had my horse captured at Loudon's and
              walked home. I got a pass in town to get out today. The
                rebels are marching past all day. Immense baggage trains
              trudging along all day with a great many captured cattle and horses from Hooker's
              army. We hear nothing, but know that he is close at hand. The rebels have gave up all hope of going to Harrisburg. There were 42 pieces of
              artillery taken past here today. Mary is yet at Lasicus.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A cloudy wet day. Self and J. Bowman planting tobacco. No large bodies of troops went
              past today, but almost every man, horse, and wagon you see
              going along is rebel Stuart's cavalry men. Along yesterday Stoneman threshed them up
              towards the Potomac and drove them this way. Today the rebels are encamped towards Fayetteville. General Lee has moved his quarters from Shelter's wood to near Fayetteville.
              The rebels are tearing down the railroad building in town and tearing up the track for miles and burn the sills
              and bend the rails. They also threaten to tear down the Courthouse. General Ewell has moved from Carlisle
              towards Baltimore with about 25,000 men.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>July, Thursday, 2, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine growing summer day. The rebels are yet thick about
              us. About 2 O'clock this afternoon there were not many here and nine of our cavalry
              made a dash on the rebels' pickets at J. Metzer's and
              captured 20 of them. There was sharp firing and great excitement for a while. The
                rebels were taken by surprise. It was one of the boldest
              dashes yet made. There were also some 40 rebels taken at
              Fayetteville. This evening about 1,000 cavalry and artillery men came here and
              encamped in our grass field at Bowman's, and in the lot at Baker's, and in D.
              Stouffers' field at the dam. They stole all the bees. They took chickens &amp;c.
              in the neighborhood, 150 bushels of corn from us, for which
              they paid in Confederate script. They left about 1 o'clock
              at night. In the morning early I went up to the courthouse
              and got an old horse they left [loose?] in the woods. They left a dead horse in the
              field and a good many kettles &amp;c.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A fine cloudy day. The rebel[s] all left last night about
              midnight. They were uneasy about the Yankees. They stole all the bees &amp;
              chickens in the neighborhood. We have heard rumors of a great battle going on about
              Gettysburg. The rebels are in a tight place and I think will
              leave thousands in this state to be buried. General Meade has
              superceded Hooker, he being unwell. The troops are offered so fast that transportation
              cannot be afforded fast enough.</p></p>

              the Rebels from crossing the Potomac. They are still fighting over the mountain. They
              acknowledge they are getting whipped. A very sad affair occurred at Shelter's this
              morning. Absalom Shelter hung himself. He has been in trouble for a good while. The
              rebels took all his horses and told him when they came back they would take all the
              crops along. It made him very uneasy. His wife found him. He was not quite dead yet,
              but soon died. I went up directly. He was quite warm yet and looked quite natural.</p></p>

              will be impossible for the rebels to cross the Potomac for a
              while now. Last night and this morning we heard their trains going along the
              Waynesboro road to get back to Virginia. The Rebels have
              been terribly cut up. Over the mountains a force of our men captured about a dozen
                wagonloads of their wounded and had them to town.
              Some had their legs and some their arms shot entirely off. It is reported that they
              are retreating this way. Absalom Shelter was buried in the graveyard this forenoon. His friends took it very hard. He looked very natural and
              held his color. There is every now and then a few rebels going along the pike, but
              they are all prisoners.</p></p>

              a great many rebels and some few Union soldiers that were not buried. They are swelled
              up very much and as black as any Negro. Horses are lying in all directions. It is one
              of the most terrible sights one can look upon. Arms and equipment strew the ground.
              Our men had decidedly the best position. Our artillery was posted on high ground and
              commanded the field for miles around. Our infantry was posted behind stone walls
              &amp;c. Long lines of rifle pits and entrenchments were thrown up by the men. It
              was the greatest battle of modern times. The rebel army was routed completely.</p></p>

              more miles around. It is covered with men, Horses, arms, equipments, &amp;c. Wagonloads of muskets and cartridge boxes. The fences are
              all thrown down and grain and corn fields so trodden down that one can hardly tell
              what was in them. The smell on the field is terrible. I saw thousands of shells that
              had not exploded. In one place about 15 feet squared I counted 26 shells. I saw trees
              2 feet in diameter pierced through with shot and shell. Small trees were entirely cut
              off. We slept in a barn. The large houses were usually hospitals.</p></p>
