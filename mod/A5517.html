<h4>Augusta County: [Covington ?] to John H. McCue,

<p class="p10">April 12th 1859</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mc</p>
<p class="p10">You handed me Braxton Davis' letter retaining you as Counsel to represent him in
                    my application to him for $2000 for [illegible] but of [illegible] trust
                    property &amp; c. &amp; requested me to write explaining the matter to
                    him &amp; c.</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to him &amp; have recd. no response; I wish you would write him that
                    he had better pay the money--as I do not wish to harrass him by any more against
                    him in Court, but I will certainly do so if he doesn't pay me. The decree
                    directs my client to be paid out of the first money in hand &amp; before any
                    investment of funds, but Mr. Davis has not carried out his "trust" in as much as
                    he has recd. more than enough money to pay me, but has otherwise invested the
                    funds.</p>
<p class="p10">Poor Virginia!!!!!!! it makes me feel bad to call her "the mother" of
                    anything--except such miscreants as Bolts Carlisle Stuart--Coleman--fit sons of
                    the now degenerate "Mother"--</p>
