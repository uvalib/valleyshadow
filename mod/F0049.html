                        <u>Dear John</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">We are on the South side of the James at a place called "Coggins Point" doing <i>[unclear: 
                        picket
                    ]</i> duty. It was from this place that the rebels shelled our camps over a
                    week ago. It is now in our possession well fortified and protected on both sides
                    by Gunboats. The movements now being made puzzle us
                    all. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>d</sup> Brigades which
                    we left on the <u>other side</u> have shippped for we don't
                    know where. Our knapsacks and baggage are on board barges. Preparations seem to
                    be making for a <u>big</u> move. If such is the intention I hope we will not be left as rear guard.
                    Our Brigade could hold this place against ten thousand men, but the getting off
                    might <i>[unclear: 
                        farther
                    ]</i> us. </p>
<p class="p10">Received your letter containing By Laws and
                        <i>[unclear: Seem's]</i> Photograph. The former well gotten up the latter a
                    perfect picture. The mail carrier returns immediately and it is the only chance
                    I will have to answer. I write this in "Old Ruffin's" barn. He fired the first
                    gun on Sumter, in return for which our boys are now <u>subsisting on his</u> place, and have appropriated<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to
                    themselves his large library, and every article of house and kitchen furniture.
                    He was a man of note here. Editor, Agriculturist, Senator, Doctor, etc. etc. His
                    plantation is large and supplies our Brigade right handsomely with corn
                    potatoes, apples, peaches and such like. Holland left a recruiting service
                    yesterday. The mail is waiting. My love to all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Bob </i></p>
<p class="p10">I am still acting
                        Adjutant Have not yet gone to the 
                            Camp
                        . The appointments are made for the Regiment and confirmed by General McClellan
                        seem perfectly satisfactory. Corporal Morrison,
                            Company A -- brother of Lawyer Harrison -- is
                        appointed Sergeant Major. He is an intelligent
                        and <i>[illeg.]</i> very exemplary man. He and I have just been enjoying a
                        tin of good black tea sweetened with <u>white</u>
                        <u>
                            sugar
                        </u> from Pittsburgh. It was delicious. The Gunboats have opened fire on
                        something ahead of us. Understand it is on a rebel battery which 
                            opened
                         on one of the transports in the river. Bob </p>
