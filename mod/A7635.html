<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, August 10, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife Hester who is despondent over being left alone and
                    without domestic help. He cannot come home and stay because he refuses to take
                    an oath of loyalty to the Federal government and fears arrest. Instead, he has
                    hired an Irish servant girl for Hester, and will send his slave Louise if that
                    does not work out. He discusses moving Hester and the family to Staunton as a
                    third option, even if it means loss of property to the Federals. He cannot get
                    out of Staunton to visit home because of the shifting battle lines. Nadenbousch
                    also discusses financial matters.</p>

<p class="p10">August 10/64</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter by M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> H- also the money you sent me. I notice all you say and am sorry to see
                    you in such a desponding
                    mood, though don't see how you
                    can be otherwise being left alone &amp; have no help &amp;c, but we must
                    hope for better times soon. I think the tables are about being turned and we may
                    be able to be constantly together.</p>
<p class="p10">I have set several times to start down since I came back but it seems that about
                    the time I have all arranged to leave our forces fall back from Martinsburg and
                    when they advance again we don't get the reliable word
                    until about the time they start back I had set tomorrow again to start<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> down but can't get a buggy until friday &amp;
                    again we learn that our Army have fallen back to Millcreek so I will have again
                    to put off starting until I can learn that the way is open, for if I can't get home I care nothing about being in that neighborhood but
                    from what we learn here I think the way will soon be open and kept clear for
                    sometime and <i>[deleted: get]</i> give me a fair chance it is a hard tramp
                    to make &amp; to be foiled when most there it is too hard</p>
<p class="p10">I have found a little Irish girl who wants a home. she
                    was a chamber maid in this Hotel before we got it and bore a very good name the
                    proprietor kept her in his family she agrees to go and live with you and make
                    that her home. I pay<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> her fair down and pay her $5 per month. I have told her what the work will be (house work) you
                    take her and put her to work at this bargain. you put her in a room to herself
                    to lodge on the porch or at the head of the stairs and not to room with you all.
                    I think she is honest &amp; trusty &amp; will suit you well don't hesitate to put her at anything you have to do, and
                        don't make too free with her as it might spoil her
                        <i>[added: she sews well]</i> get some one to cut your
                    wood get M<sup>r</sup> Staub to get you some one don't think of getting <i>[added: along]</i> the
                    way you have been doing try this girl &amp; if you can't make her suit, I will send you Louise &amp; run the chances of
                    loosing her as you shall not be put to so much for
                    assistance</p>
<p class="p10">Or if upon reflection you would <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> prefer coming out here just write me
                    at once &amp; I will have you brought out at once and let the property take
                    chances, as I would much prefer having you all here comfortable and loose the
                    property to having you grabbing your way along as you write me We are still
                    doing considerable business here I have been offering my interest here for sale
                    and rent we could sell now for about $175,000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> in Confederate funds but then the query is what to do with the money now
                    &amp; this is not the worth of the property we are now asking $300,000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> and think we can get 2 at most anytime but we must make this pay as much
                    as possible. I want at least to be even when this war is over &amp; wish to
                    be something ahead</p>
<p class="p10">If I were to stay at home as you intimate I think that I would be arrested and
                    required to take the <u>Oath</u> or be sent off and
                    imprisoned during the war. the <u>oath</u> I won't take and and of course to be imprisoned would
                    seperate me from you and yet I would not have my liberties or any chance to make
                    something for you in future so of the two it is [section cut off]<br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> me
                    to be here and make something for us. My inclination
                    of course it to be with you constantly as my course up to the beginning of the
                    war will show <i>[added: scarcely]</i> ever staying from
                    home over night &amp;c &amp;c-</p>
<p class="p10">If you prefer coming out here don't hesitate to say so
                    &amp; you shall come &amp; I will make you as comfortable as I possibly
                    can in Dixie</p>
<p class="p10">I have got hold of $20 more green backs which I send you. apply it as you chose.
                    it is quite scarce here &amp; hard to get hold of, but I will still try
                    &amp; get some &amp; will send you and as you have the chance get us
                    such things as <i>[deleted: we]</i> we may need</p>
<p class="p10">I will come down as soon as I can learn positively the way is clear to
                    Martinsburg. I learn that Jacob Thomas has gone to the Yankees that is heavy
                    work I would rather cut my throat that to be so treacherous<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> and heap
                    up such a stigma on my family but these are strange times, hard to fathom depths</p>
<p class="p10">Tell moses I will try &amp; do the very best I can <i>[deleted: for]</i>
                    with his &amp; Wilsons fund<sup>s</sup> but have not as yet
                    determine what is best to do with it.</p>
<p class="p10">You try &amp; keep this girl &amp; if you come out &amp; she wishes
                    to come along bring her out also. I have no directions to give about our
                    business there as all seems to be conducted as well as I could direct it from
                    here</p>
<p class="p10">Take good care of yourselves keep plenty of every thing on hand If smallpox there
                    is too dangerous there move from the house out to the mill with Henry</p>
<p class="p10">I will be down as soon as can Write soon God bless you all</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
