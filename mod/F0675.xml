 <note><p>The last page of the letter is written on a paper printed with the engraving of a face with a star-spangled cap, and the song "Hail, Columbia! Happy Land! The printing was done by Mumford &amp; Co., Cincinnati.  
  
 The words of the song are:  
 <q> 
 Hail, Columbia! happy land! hail, ye heroes! heaven-born band! 
 <lb/> Who fought and bled in Freedom's Cause, 
 <lb/> Who fought and bled in Freedom's Cause, 
 <lb/> And when the storm of war was gone enjoyed the peace your valor won, 
 <lb/> Let independence be our boast, ever mindful what it cost; 
 <lb/> Ever grateful for the prize, let its altar reach the skies. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> CHORUS. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Firm united let us be, rallying round our liberty! 
 <lb/> As a band of brothers joined, peace and safety we shall find. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Immortal patriots, rise once more; defend your rights, defend your shore 
 <lb/> Let no rude foe, with impious hand, 
 <lb/> Let no rude foe, with impious hand, 
 <lb/> Invade the shrine where sacred lies, of toil and blood the well-earned prize 
 <lb/> While offering peace sincere and just, in heaven we place a manly trust, 
 <lb/> That truth and justice will prevail and every scheme of bondage fail. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Firm united let us be, &amp;c. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Sound, sound the trump of fame! let WASHINGTON'S great name 
 <lb/> Ring through the world with loud applause, 
 <lb/> Ring through the world with loud applause; 
 <lb/> Let every clime to Freedom dear listen with a joyful ear; 
 <lb/> With equal skill and god-like power be govern'd in the fearful hour 
 <lb/> Of horrid war! or guides, with ease, the happier times of honest peace. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Firm united let us be, &amp;c. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Behold the chief who now commands, again to serve his country, stand 
 <lb/> The rock on which the storm will beat, 
 <lb/> The rock on which the storm will beat; 
 <lb/> But, armed in virtue firm and true, his hopes are fix'd on heaven and you 
 <lb/> When hope was sinking in dismay, and glooms obscured Columbia's day 
 <lb/> His steady mind, from changes free, resolved on death or liberty. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Firm united let us be, &amp;c. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> MUMFORD &amp; CO., CINCINNATI

     we got Picketing about 2 miles from Camp. Every three Days where we can have a Chat with the
     Rebels whenever we feel like it. I had a talk with a fellow that was Born and Raised <del
      hand="h1">with</del> in Columbia he was Raised by a man by the name of Mullisson (Jim
     Mullisson's Father) <orig reg="he's">hes</orig> a Tinker by trade - learned his trade in

     /> said he had too much Property in Texas for that. I asked him his name but he <orig
      reg="wouldn't">would<hi rend="super">nt</hi></orig> tell it he was <orig reg="Pretty"
     >Purty</orig> well acquainted in Lancaster Also he Asked me all about John Hoo ver Hen

     nor Morney Rodgers I guess you must have been in Philadel phia at the Time he was in with <orig
      reg="those">them</orig> fellows We Talked for About 1 hour and a half when they was Relieved.
     after he was Relieved he told me to take care of myself and hoped that we might have a drink
     together and he left We are in a <orig reg="Pretty">Purty</orig> tight Place here just now but
     we are Throwing up Entrenchments and I think we can stand them. there was a couple of Deserters

     half tending to his <orig reg="business">Buisness</orig> and I went into him the other day and
