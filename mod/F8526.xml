                <p>Lizzie <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> this morning her mother's letter of
                    Friday, &amp; expects her own letter of the same date to reach Gettysburg
                    tomorrow <abbr expan="evening">Eve-g.</abbr> -- I would have written yesterday,
                    but waited for last <orig reg="night's">nights</orig> mail. We are relieved to
                    hear that you are moderately comfortable, &amp; hope that Mr. Carson has
                    returned &amp; will take his place as usual tomorrow.-- We have been leading
                    a very quiet life here -- drinking the water before breakfast, and pursuing a
                        <unclear>monotonous</unclear>
                    <unclear>round</unclear>. This week, there have been a great many arrivals (one
                    day over 60).-- There are over 300 now at the Spring. All the ladies' rooms are
                    occupied or engaged, but there is still space for some gentlemen. The good
                    living &amp;c. continues, &amp; will, to the end of the season.-- I have
                    been <pb n="2"/> much improved, and so has Lizzie. <orig reg="Today">To
                    day</orig> is warm, but I have not felt oppressed.-- I fear this will tax your
                    strength, &amp; endurance.--</p>

                <p>We began to think of returning -- but have made no definite plans.-- If it were
                    not for Mary <unclear>Runell's</unclear> anxiety to have Lizzie spend a few days
                    with her, we <abbr expan="would">w<hi rend="super">d</hi></abbr> leave on Friday
                    &amp; get home on <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat.</abbr> of this week. But this
                    may detain us. Should you especially need us, please write at once, &amp;
                    Lizzie can spend a day with Mary, making that suit, under the circumstances.--
                    It looks now as though we would not leave this until Monday or Tuesday of next
                    week. But Lizzie will likely go into town the last of this week-- Mr. Sprigg's
                    people are still here, <pb n="3"/> &amp; will remain for ten or more days.--
                    We often meet all of them, as they now near us, &amp; are much in the same
                    parts of the establishment.--</p>

                <p>Give my love to all.-- Have much for concentration -- as I write hurriedly.--</p>
