<p class="p10">Camp Remound Chapel Point</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father </p>
<p class="p10">I take the present pleasure to let you know that I am well at present hoping you
                    all the rest are the same Further I let you know that we are still at this place
                    There are rumours every day that we would leave I am
                    very much disappointed about staying out here so long if there was any fighting fights I wouldn't
                    think of going home but now battles are fought and they <i>[illeg.]</i> but
                        victories are won and now they keep us still
                    out here
                    just for nothing and make us drill every day We are now out here nearly three years and since we are out
                        here there was nothing but fighting almost all <i>[deleted: ]</i> the time<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and we have always done our duty and every fight we was in we done our share and never was at
                    home once but now the battles are fought and the rebels are driven away now they
                        don't care for the poor soldier when he gets home or
                    if he gets home at all last summer when the rebels were at the gates of
                    washington there <i>[unclear: was]</i> fighting were glad for us then they had
                    a great cheer about Sheridan's cavalry then they were almost scared to death
                    when they heard a few shots fired but now they are out
                    of danger Now they hate us when they see us I don't know when they will do us
                    that favor to muster us out and pay us off but I heard
                    last night that we would be discharged until October I
                    don't think we<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> will get home before our time is out The paper says
                    all those that their time is out till the first of
                    October will be discharged now, but the rest has to stay till their time is out and then our regiment will
                    be discharged from the time when it was organized
                    and it was organized
                    sometime in October I also let you know that the
                    soldiers are getting very rough they charged on a <i>[deleted: ]</i> last night and took everything he
                    had I don't know any more news at the present time write
                    soon and direct Company 17th Pa Cav Chapel Point MD in care of Major
                        <i>[unclear: Spira Eckahart]</i> get no letters since I am here the go all
                    into the Regiment and I don't know where we will to the
                    regiment So nothing more for this time </p>
<p class="p10">from your son </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Peter Boyer </i></p>
<p class="p10">Excuse my bad writing my pen is so bad<br> write soon
                        and don't forget it To my
                            father<br>Peter Boyer
