                    the public property, at this place, which was "Totally unprotected." We were
                    regularly mustered into the Service of the State, on the 29th of June (last) by

                <p>When mustered into Service we numbered 110 men, but So many of them have been
                    detailed to work on armory work, our number has been reduced to about 50, which

                    will have to make the necessary arrangements to have them relieved from their
