<p class="p10">Wednesday night, December15th 1864</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I hear that I can send my Letter in the morning and I will add a few lines. You
                    must direct one at Swope's Depot Augusta County, Virginia as we have orders to move tomorrow to that
                    neighborhood. I suppose we remain there for some time. Could you see any chance
                    to send out a Letter direct as follows: D. C. Snyder, Quartermaster
                    Department 11th Regiment
                    Virginia
                    Cavalry, Rosser's Brigade, near Swope's Depot, Augusta
                        County, Virginia I wish
                    our move was in the direction of home rather than another direction. I fear I
                    shall not hear often from home. You must write me on all occasions. Do all you
                    can to find opportunities to forward.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been made very sick tonight. I am not sick or dangerously so - will
                    explain when I see you. Jimmy can give you an idea of the cause if you see him
                    for he frequently is called upon to undergo such a dose as I have had tonight. I
                    only wish he had been here tonight to enjoy the sickness and swallow the dose I
                    had to take tonight. I shall put in for a Furlough as soon as I see a chance to
                    get it. Has Mrs. <i>[unclear: Nunn]</i> been to see you? I shall call and see
                    her as I go through Harrisonburg. It will take us 3 days to go to camp. We will
                    camp 12 miles west of Staunton at Swope's Depot.</p>
<p class="p10">Hastily your affectionate
                        husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        D. C. Snyder
                    </i></p>
