<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: M. G. Harman to Thomas P.
                    Jackson, January 24, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Harman relates the details of a case in which a young man who was hired out by a
                    man named Swink, did not complete his contract. The issue appears to be one of
                    how much money, if any, Swink owes the man.</p>

                    Captain Jackson in charge of Freedmans Bureau
                </b></p>

<p class="p10">January 24 1868.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I made the arrangement with Wash Swink Jr. to take <i>[unclear: Dinna's]</i>
                    Baby Boy John for one year at $4 Dollars per month he commenced about 17th
                    January 1867 and left Mr. Swink about 5 April 1867, <i>[unclear: remaining]</i>
                    2 months &amp; 20 days. he states he bought him a
                    pair of shoes for which he paid $3.50 and gave him a shirt &amp; pair pants
                    worth $2.50 as he would <i>[added: have]</i> received if he
                    had complied with his contract $10.47 for the time. In my opinion taking into
                    consideration the time of the year, he kept him, when he was of but little
                    Service to him. I think he has paid him enough unless the Boy is made to comply
                    with his contract &amp; serve the Balance of the Year in which event Mr. S.
                    ought to pay Balance &amp; not otherwise.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
