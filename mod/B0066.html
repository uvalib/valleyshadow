                    M<sup>r</sup>
                        Thomas P. Jackson
                </b></p>

<p class="p10">May 10th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Craigsville Augusta County V<sup>a</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">In answer to your note of the 8<sup>th</sup> in regard to Henry
                    Alexander <i>[added: claim]</i> against Estate of John P. M.
                    McCutchen deceased. Said
                    Alexander did apply to Captain Tukey, Agent Bureau at
                    Staunton for the recovery of money from said McCutchen, and the facts being
                    stated to Captain Tukey by said McCutchen in his lifetime the case
                    was dismissed.</p>
<p class="p10">Should the claim you refer to be for service rendered by said Alexanders children
                    it can be proven that McCutchen agreed with the <i>[added: wife]</i> of said Alexander that her and her children might go, or remain
                    with him, till they could do better and he would furnish them supplies as he had
                    done before and house &amp;c till they could find a place to move to, and
                    after remaining some <i>[added: time]</i> in that way they
                    concluded to leave.</p>
<p class="p10">McCutchen's books show no indebtedness to Alexander.</p>
<p class="p10">I have learned the above facts from Mr. Judson O. McCutchen, who I believe was
                    living at his uncle's at the time on the place.</p>
<p class="p10">Should you wish to make any further inquiry about the matter write <i>[added: me]</i> on the subject and I will be glad to give you all
                    the information I can.</p>
<p class="p10">Your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>G. W. McCutchen</i></p>
