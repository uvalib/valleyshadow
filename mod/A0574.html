                    Cousin
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sunday night, Dec. 30, 1860 </p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Cousin </p>
<p class="p10">It is now nearly three years since I last wrote to you, so without any excuse
                        here goes. </p>
<p class="p10">I have no news that will interest you so I will write some thing about crops and
                        politics and anything that I may chance to think of, <i>[illeg.]</i> corn &amp;
                    cotton crops have been very short all over the State this year. corn at this
                    time is worth $1.25 per bushel and cotton is worth nothing. my crop of cotton
                    will fall 20 bags short of last years. my corn crop was very good. I will have
                    some to sell. You have heard long before this that
                        South Carolina has <u>seceded</u>, every person in the State shouts glory to God &amp; I say,
                    Amen. People all over the United States believed and said that South Carolina was afraid to
                    quit the Union. they can now think what they please of
                    us. S. Carolina has fifty thousand ready at this time
                    to march any where they may
                        be
                    needed. if it were even to
                    Washington, you know enough of the history of our people to tell of what kind of
                    material they are composed of, the worst black Republican at the North will<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> admit that the people of South    Carolina
                    will fight and history has yet to record the time and place where an enemy has seen the back of a South Carolinian. South Carolina would be glad if all of the Slave States
                    would secede as our interest is the same. but if they won't we are prepared to take care of our selves.</p>
<p class="p10">The State Convention has sent R.W. Barnwell, J. H. Adams &amp; J.L. Ovr____
                    Commissioners to Washington to demand the Forts at
                    Charleston of the President if the President will give
                    them up. it will be well for man kind, for it will be a revolution without a blood shed. but if he doesn't give them up South Carolina
                    will take them let it cost what it may.</p>
<p class="p10">I will mail three papers to you with this letter, one of the papers has the South Carolina
                    <u>Ordinance</u> in it. I want Franklin to commit it to
                    memory. </p>
<p class="p10">Enough of politics, let me write some thing about
                    Fannie and <u>the</u> baby. Fannie's health is very good and
                    she looks better than you ever saw her. I will say but little about our <i>[deleted: lit]</i> child for without doubt he is the finest looking child
                    of his age that you ever saw<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I would be glad
                    for you to see him for you would then confirm what I have said. Fannie is
                    anxious to visit you and Mary but I fear it will be a
                    long time first as I have not the money to spare. We both would be more than glad if you and Mr. Mcchesney would come and spend the
                    winter and spring with us. If Mr. Mcchesney can't come
                    you and Franklin might and if you can'twhy then send
                    Franklin or Johny. If you will come and spend two or three months with us I will
                    try and let Fannie go back with you. You can come if you want to and you must
                    come as me and Fannie are more than anxious to see you and little Adam. I will
                    bet you any amount that I can show the finest looking boy of the two so come
                    along and no excuse, as we are very anxious to see you. Our little boy has cut
                    two teeth, he has never been sick a day, neither has he ever been washed in warm
                    water, save the first time. Do come and come quickly, as I have more to tell you
                    than you ever heard of.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. John Cothran died about two months ago.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Me and Fannie send our best love to you all, hoping
                    that this will find you all well and the baby in particular. Permit me to
                    request you to answer this as soon as it comes to hand. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours affectionately </p>
