<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Thaddeus
                    Stevens, January 12, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Once again, Alexander McClure updates Thaddeus Stevens as to the status of
                    President Lincoln's appointments. Wilmot, Stevens, and Cameron are all
                    discussed.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 12</p>
<p class="p10">Harrisburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir -- </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 10<sup>th</sup> came this morning. I will see to the
                    matter at once, without being too conspicuous to do you <u>harm</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Will Cameron join? or will he not resist? What is his temper? His friends here
                    seem ferocious, and without a policy marked out for them. If he is utterly
                    thrown by Lincoln, a Pennsylvanian will be appointed to mark his contempt for
                        Cameron's trick upon him; if he means to
                    conciliate Cameron, he will appoint none in the State, or what would be worse,
                    will take Cameron's choice, which would be Pollack
                    or Reeder. Until better advised all around, I cant see exactly <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> where
                    we are to come out. I think that if Lincoln were left to himself entirely, he
                    would take Wilmot; but when I left him his mind seemed not to look beyond Wilmot
                    &amp; yourself. I take it that if the Delegation in Congress make anything
                    like a united move it would settle the matter, unless the causes mentioned on
                    the first page should control the decision <i>[unclear: otherwise]</i>. Until
                    we at once see how the land lies, so that I can act advisedly. As things now
                    are, if I were to take an open stand for any one who could be possibly suspected
                    by Cameron's friends, they would strike at him.</p>
<p class="p10">I am hoping to hear from Lincoln every day. In his letter <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> received on
                    Wednesday, he said he would write me again on the subject very soon. When I hear
                    from him, I will write a telegraph you, as may be best.</p>
<p class="p10">Curtin will be here tonight. He was involved in Wilmot's selection to the Senate, &amp; failed.
                    There is some danger of him wanting to strike for Wilmot for the cabinet. But I
                    can hold him at least to neutrality, if Congress has moved with any unanimity.
                    There must not be a contest between Wilmot &amp; yourself.</p>
<p class="p10">We are without a head here and all at loose ends. The state administration
                    seeming to be but sight of in all their
                    differences, and every man is in his own book.
                    Will write as soon as I can communicate anything of interest.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AKMcClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable
                            Thaddeus Stevens
                    </p>
