<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">As I have an opportunity I concluded to write you
                    I am well and still in this place. we are now operating the Hotel and doing a
                    good business receipts daily amounting to $1000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> to $2500<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> I have offered my resignation again &amp; expect it will be accepted
                    &amp; I then will run the Hotel myself. I now am superintending it myself
                    besides my other duties all of my old acquaintances who pass by this way stop
                    here. we are full up every night</p>
<p class="p10">I learn a note I sent you by M<sup>
                        <u>rs</u>
                    </sup> Dr Colston has been taken possession of by the Federals It won't do them much good as there is nothing but private
                    matters in it and nothing of importance</p>
<p class="p10">I only wish you were up here with me. it would be so much pleasanter for me. We
                    have the house fit up fair we still need some articles such as sheets pillow slips &amp; plaid
                    cotton bed spread<sup>s</sup> if we had some of these we would be
                    quite well equipped I hope we can at least in the
                    spring make some arrangement to be together I am sorely tired of this life
                    attend to our matters as well as you can. do try &amp; write to me tell me now the particulars as to how you are getting along
                    remember me kindly to all</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
