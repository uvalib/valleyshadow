<p class="p10">June 10th 1861.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">  
 Dear Henry:--  
 </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 22nd   
 ultimate was received in due time, but<br>   
 not answered as soon as its demands required, but "better late than<br>   
 never." <i>[added: "]</i>So here goes."    
 In my last I spoke of the sight presented in our<br>   
 streets, but since that time things have changed considerably, and<br>   
 the scenes presented in our streets on Friday and Saturday of last week<br>   
 were quite a different aspect reality be stamped on every move.<br>    
 On Friday five companies of Cavalry, the <u>heroes</u>   
 of   
 Sumpter  
  (except<br> Major   
 Anderson), four Regiments of troops,   
 accompanied by their bands and<br>  
 followed by their baggage wagons,   
 which make a peculiar rumbling noise, this Brigade was six miles long   
 (Captain  
 McMullens<br>  
 Philadelphia Rangers were in the crowd.)   
 You may and can only<br>   
 imagine what the effect of such <i>[added: a]</i>   
 scene would be, the sight<br>   
 was the most sublime that I  
 ever witnessed, the bands of<br>   
 music with numerous fifes and drums,-- the  
 heavy tread   
   
       
   
 
 <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitCre3b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitCre3b.gif"></center></a><br><br>  

   
 of about forty wagons, all conspired to bewilder the  
 understanding<br>   
 and render vague all our preconceived ideas of war.<br>  
 The movements of Saturday were not quite so imposing, but<br>   
 for the cavalry <i>[deleted: it]</i> they would have been equally grand.  
 Sabbath<br>   
 approached finding our citizens in a state of uproar &amp;<br>   
 confusion, cars were running and  
 screaming - men were working<br>   
 wagons were moving through our streets  
 from morning till night<br>   
 and citizens <i>[added: were]</i> on a continual parade.  
 Truly such scenes, such<br>   
 sabbaths, and such times, were never before  
 ours to behold.<br>    
 Uncle Stumbaugh will in my opinion leave very  
 soon, but when<br>   
 I do not know, but think, tonight or tomorrow,   
 if you should happen<br>   
 to see any of our folks and it is not to much trouble, you  
 would<br>   
 oblige me by telling them, that if they want to see him that<br>  
 now is the time.   
 Isadore  
 has been confined to bed sick for several<br>   
 days and doesn't seem to improve much, and I fear that he will<br>   
 not be able to go along with his fellow soldiers.  
        
 </p>
<p class="p10">  
 There were fifty wagons brought up on Saturday night, and by<br>  
 seven O'Clock Sunday morning they were all  
 unloaded.<br>   
 I received a letter from D.R.P. Shoemaker   
 on Saturday. I must<br>   
 answer it today or   
 tomorrow,   
 he is yet at Pleasant Hill and<br>   
 says that if anything would  
 induce him to shoulder a musket it would<br>   
 be an invasion of old Franklin.    
 Good for him he seems<br>   
 to be a Union man: even to the  
 point of his nose, and <i>[added: so]</i> he<br>   
 should be.

 You seemed to think that some other Nation  
 might join with the South<br>   
 but I believe our cause is a just one, and  
 if, all the other nations<br>   
 of the earth should join with their teeming  
 millions and come<br>   
 to our shores in battle array against us, that by  
 trusting in the<br>   
 god of battles, who I believe is superintending our  
 movements, that<br>   
 triumph must be ours, but we must do our share of the  
 work and<br>   
 stand right up to the mark, whether death be our lot   
 or not<br>   
 Henry, I have no fear of the result,   
 we may lose many good<br> men, but if  
 we go to the work right I feel confident of   
 success.<br>   
 I am sorry that I have not time to answer your letter fully<br>   
 but if you knew how often I have been called away from<br>   
 my writing I know <i>[added: you]</i> would excuse me,  
 there has been about<br>   
 eight persons in here bothering me all the  
 time, and no person in<br>   
 the office to be bothered but myself   
 as   
 Messieurs   
 Carlisle &amp;<br>   
 Stewart have not reached yet.   
 If I have time I <i>[added: will]</i>try and<br>  
 do better the next time. <i>[added: Give]</i> my respects to all  
 inquiring<br>  
 friends if any there be.  
 </p>
<p class="p10">  
 Yours very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alex. CresslerEllic.</i></p>
