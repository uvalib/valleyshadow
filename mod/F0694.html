<p class="p10">Wednesday December 17th
                                <u>1862</u></p>
<p class="p10">Camp on the Rappahannock Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I received Your letter of the 23<sup>rd</sup> of November. I was glad to hear from You, and that You were
                    all well. But Father Since I received Your letter
                    there has been another great battle over the river I was in it and came out
                    unhurt indeed I have escaped Wonderfully. Although
                    there was but one Officer in our regiment Wounded our
                    Brigade was in the fight all day until 3 o'clock. I
                    think it was the greatest Battle of the war, there was two hundred thousand
                        troops on each Side, our loss is heavy, about
                    twelve thousand in Killed wounded and missing. Our line of Battle was 7 miles in
                        length. "Just to think of it."</p>
<p class="p10">Father, I never want to get into another battle it is
                    terrible Persons falling all around me. if I ever trusted in God I did that time
                    the fight was on last Saturday the 13<sup>rd</sup>" instant. We went over the river the 12<sup>th</sup>. The rebels have too Strong a point there to rout them as they have
                    all the hills and have breastworks thrown up, so it is impossible to whip them
                    behind their works consequently we have fell back on this side of the river. The
                        107<sup>th</sup>" done its duty like men it has great praise for
                    its gallantry.</p>
<p class="p10">Father, I Saw the Safe Harbor boys Pickel &amp;
                    Cline Young's son Just a few days before the Battle. it is Said the reserves
                    lost greatly in the fight I have not seen them since. The Weather is now getting
                    very cold the army is Suffering on account of the cold We laid out in the open fields and woods without tents or eny other
                    Shelter for nearly one week before the Battle on frost and snow Whilst the <u>Stay</u> at home party were enjoying their good<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>warm beds. I wish we had them down here
                    with us for one week they would be Satisfied.</p>
<p class="p10">Father if my resignation would be accepted I would resign right away but there has been some half dozen
                    Sent in from our regiment but they were all sent back but one. therefore it is
                    no use for me to try it. My hopes we will go into winter quarters about the
                    first of the Year. our Paymaster has never Shown his face Yet. it is too bad on the first of January there will be six months
                    pay due me ($600.63.) I think the next muster we will get it which is on the
                        1<sup>st</sup> of January.</p>
<p class="p10">I am enjoying good health but I would Sooner be at home I feel now that I have
                    done my duty and would like to See Some others do theirs.</p>
<p class="p10">I received a letter from Margaret with her likeness a week or two ago. also one
                    from William &amp; Sarah. I have not received none from Francis Since You
                    wrote I will write to him again perhaps he does not
                    get my letters. I direct them as I did always.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to Susan Cornelius &amp; all the rest and if I can get home I
                    assure You I will come. Hoping You all are well</p>
<p class="p10">I remain ever<br>your son</p>
