<p class="p10">Hon A H H Stuart</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend. You mentioned to me while I was at Staunton, that there was an
                    appendix published in connection with your report about the raid of John Brown,
                    containing extracts from the personal liberty bills passed by several of the
                    Northern States. You said that it could be procured in Richmond. If you could
                    lay your hands upon and send it to me at this place you would greatly oblige me.
                    I have some curiousity to see those extracts, although I place implicit
                    confidence in the consistency of your report. When I
                    last saw you, I expected to have been in Richmond before
                    this, but were if I were there, I would not know very well how I could hunt up
                    that same appendix.</p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse the liberty that I have taken in making this request. I
                    congratulate you on the prospect of your being speedily released from your
                    labors as a member of the convention[.] the post of honor I believe to be now a
                    private station, otherwise I could wish to see your talents &amp; your
                    fidelity employed in the service of your country. I hope you will enjoy yourself
                    in the Society of your family &amp; I will always to myself the honor of
                    calling on you, when I am in Staunton. I take a lively interest in the welfare
                    of your children. Remember me to them when you see them. With sentiments of
                    respect &amp; affection.</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
