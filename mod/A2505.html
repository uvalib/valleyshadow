<p class="p10">Dear Sara.</p>
<p class="p10">Came over here yesterday with the Regiment -- we left late in the
     day I had a long letter nearly written -- but it is out of the way in the baggage of the camp
     &amp; the rain is pouring down so I can only write a word or so. Maj. Reger goes to
     Staunton &amp; will take this We have come back here to recruit -- I shall be able to come
     home in a few days -- as soon as Maj. Reger gets back -- and I will then see that all things
     are properly fixed. I was a little sick last night, for the first time since I left home. I
     went up to Felix Hull's and begged a cup of tea &amp; was much relieved by it &amp;
      then slept <u>well</u>, on the ground floor of my
     tent. We would be very comfortable if the sun would only come out for a
     few hours -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> It will not be more than a week before I shall come home -- &amp;
     then I should know what I shall do all the time. I cannot come now If have not yet got any of
     the things you say you have so kindly sent me -- They can now be left here -- we are encamped
     by the side of the road where they cross the bridge. I wish you could come out here -- I do
     wonder if Harvey Bear would not hitch up his carriage &amp; bring you &amp; his wife
     out for a day &amp; see us -- it is only one day's ride. God bless
     you -- good by my love Love to all --</p>
<p class="p10">Truly your Affectionate husband</p>
