                <p>Pastor writes in the aftermath of a battle defeat, describing deaths and men lost

                </opener>

                <p> Once more in the providence of God it is my happy privilege to seat myself (on
                    the ground) for the purpose of holding sweet Converse with <hi rend="underline"
                        >one</hi> who is <hi rend="underline">dearer</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">to</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">me</hi> than all others in this wide world. All written
                    words are weak &amp; powerless to express the throbbings of a heart where
                    love has made it home. But all this is useless. I wrote to you from Martinsburg
                    on my way down, <unclear>but</unclear> so I was not posted in regard to the
                    Casualties of our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> &amp; more
                    particularly of our Company. I will again endeaver to give you a more full
                    account. Our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> lost 5 killed 58 wounded
                    &amp; some 8 or 10<pb n="2"/> missing. In our Company we had one killed,
                    namely, Benson Buchanan. Also 10 wounded, only 3 of them are considered bad,
                    namely James Furn, John A. Wilson, &amp; Charley <unclear>McGuppin</unclear>
                    Furn, &amp; Wilson are in the hands of the enemy, with John Clemmer who was
                    slightly wounded &amp; left to wait on them. The rest of them have gone home
                    excepting 2 who were so slightly wounded that they would not leave. 4 of the
                    company are missing &amp; doubtless taken prisoners, namely, D.A. Black,
                    L.V. Nupanan, D. A. Spitter, &amp; Franklin <unclear>Carson</unclear>. I
                    left the same day that I wrote you before &amp; met with the boys in
                    Nagerstown the night following. They seemed to be very glad indeed, and I assure
                    you I was equally as much so to see them. The first thing that they<pb n="3"/>
                    said after asking me for a chew of tobacco (for which they were almost starved)
                    was, if I got married while at home, of course I told them no, but some of them
                    believe yet that I was. I tell you our boys have had a hard time sure, since
                    they left Fredricksburg. They have been on the march for more than a month,
                    during which time they have not had a change of clothes, they are now both dirty
                    &amp; ragged, &amp; a great many of them barefooted, yet notwithstanding
                    all these things they seem to be very cheerful indeed. We drew up in line of
                    battle this side of Nagerstown &amp; fortified where <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">we</add> remained two days waiting for the enemy to attack us
                    but this they did not do, excepting to skirmish a little, &amp; on Tuesday
                    morning about<pb n="4"/> day eight we crossed the river at Williamsport. <orig
                        reg="wading">waiding</orig> it up to our shoulders.</p>
                <p>We are now about six miles this side of Martinsburg in camp, how long we will
                    remain at this place I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> say. It is thought by some
                    the yankees are making for Fredricksburg again, if so we will be on the march
                    for that place in a few days.</p>
                <p>There is some canonading in the direction of Harpers ferry this evening It may be
