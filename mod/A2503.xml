    <p>I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> your two letters by Mr. Frazier &amp; one from
     Nelson by Mr. Hunger &amp; was indeed glad to hear from you, though deeply moved by your
     anxieties and distress concerning me - - I wrote to you the very day after the flight from Camp
     Garnett &amp; hoped you would get my letter before you heard of the fight, &amp; I
     wrote the next day too that you might surely hear from me &amp; told you the main events of
     the fight &amp; wrote fully to <abbr expan="Nelson">N.</abbr> yesterday. I am sure you have
     heard from me before now and are relieved from apprehensions -- I am faring finely now -- mess
     with Capt. Lilley's men &amp; have a good suit of clothes given me by them when they chose
     me an honorary member of the company. We have provisions that were sent us from Augusta
     &amp; then our mess has a good cook in it. I am sorry you have so much concern for me,
     because it wearies you out - <orig reg="though">tho'</orig> I am as much concerned for you
     &amp; my darling children -- but but have not as much time to brood over it being in the
     whirl &amp; excitement of camp life &amp; in the midst <pb n="2"/> of stirring events
     that <hi rend="underline">attract &amp;</hi> at the same time <hi rend="underline"
     >distract</hi> the attention The men are gathering in slowly -- some 6 or 700 were taken
     prisoners but they have been released on their parole of honor we are informed and will be here
     today all except Col. Pegram who was a U. S. Army officer &amp; him they have taken to Ohio
     as a prisoner. Gen. Garnett was killed &amp; his army is now on the way here by the way of
     Hardy <abbr expan="County">Co</abbr> -- having had a desperate fight, lost most of their
     baggage and had a few hundred killed, inflicting a considerable loss on the enemy -- The men
     that came through on parole yesterday say the enemy buried 137 of their men &amp; 27 of
     ours after the Rich Mt. fight -- they say the enemy had 20000 men there while we had but 1800.
     I do not want anything now except another flannel shirt &amp; you need not send that unless
     I send for it. You may send me 3 collars &amp; my <orig reg="woolen">wollen</orig> vest if
     you have a chance. I saved a plenty of socks &amp; drawers &amp; got a new pair of
     shoes &amp; shall get an overcoat from the <abbr expan="public">pub.</abbr> stores I shall
     write to you often &amp; when I know what I shall do myself I will tell you what to do. I
     am acting as the Adjutant of our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> now -- The stage goes in a
     few minutes -- I am getting used to sleeping on the floor &amp;c write often I get all the
     news by Nat. Tyler <abbr expan="Editor">Ed.</abbr> of the Enquirer Love to all my sweet wife
     &amp; kiss the babies for me. </p>
