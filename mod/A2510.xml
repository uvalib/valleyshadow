    <p>Mr. Bear &amp; Mr. Sieg came along Friday P.M. and stopped to see me a short time, left
     me the box of things you sent, the good calico shirt, the splendid "needle &amp; book"
     &amp; contents for which I am especially thankful -- and the nice quilt which added to my
     stock of bed clothes makes me a very nice bed, for I found the woolen blankets rather rough to
     sleep in, especially when it was warm at night, as it has been for a few nights -- but now I
     double the quilt &amp; get between the folds and feel quite as though <add hand="h1"
      place="inline">keep my coat</add> I was in bed -- <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the being as good as alone
     -- though the ground is covered all around -- I am now in my own tent -- drew one some four
     days ago -- a good wall tent -- &amp; took Dr. Opie -- a son of Col. Opie &amp; a good
     fine fellow, in as tent mate &amp; we two have a tent to ourselves and therefore are quite
     comfortable -- I have a chair &amp; stand that I borrowed from Mr. Stephenson -- and with
     trunks &amp; boxes as seats we got along very well -- the only drawback is the frequent
     calls on the Dr &amp; the numerous cases that he has to treat -- it is quite amusing to
     hear the complaints of the men -- especially of the militia of Highland who are encamped near
     us -- I have been surprised at the seeming want of any power of endurance in these mountain men
     -- they wear down very soon and seem unable to endure any fatigue &amp; more of them are
     sick than any other class of soldiers here. Mr. Emerson preached for us today from Ps. 118-6 --
     a very good brief <pb n="2"/> sermon -- the parson is about as good looking as ever -- is very
     sound on the question of State rights &amp;c. I took a ride after dinner, on one of Mr.
     Sieg's horses, with Mr. Bear &amp; enjoyed it much -- though only a mile, as I have been
     staying very closely in camp for the past week -- It is raining now -- it rains here every day
     &amp; every night -- but I get along &amp; stand it first rate -- I have had some cold,
     but am almost over it, and am very careful not to expose myself &amp; try and keep every
     thing dry -- airing everything whenever the sun comes out, which happens at least once a day --
     I do not know what day I can come home, but I do not want to come until I can get some money
     that I may rent some good place for you &amp; see you removed there &amp; properly
     fixed up before I come away -- I have fully made up my mind that I will not leave you where you
     will be subjected to petty annoyances and are constantly unhappy -- &amp; I hope I can find
     some good place where you can be well cared for &amp; will enjoy yourself as well as you
     can with me away -- I know that your fond heart will always find the hours weary &amp; home
     desolate when I am not there, but Providence wills it that I must be away, it seems, for the
     path of duty is to me the path to be trodden &amp; I can only despise those that in this
     hour of their country's danger keep back any assistance they can render -- I have urged
     resistance &amp; I cannot but use my feeble efforts to resist, trusting to a kind
     overruling God to bring all things to a happy conclusion and to reward all those that do their
     duty <pb n="3"/> I send you back a small box that I have, in which I have put my summer vest,
     which I do not need &amp; my worn out woolen drawers -- they may be of use to me yet -- but
     I have 3 <abbr expan="pairs">prs</abbr> of osnaburg drawers that I saved from the stores at
     Beverly &amp; they are just the kind &amp; all I want -- I have also sent you 4 lbs. of
     sugar, 3 lbs of rice &amp; 1 pound of coffee -- and am sorry that I cannot send you more --
     but I can only get these things by certifying that they are for "my own use" -- and as such I
     send them to you -- and you can use them and say nothing about it to any one -- not even
     telling the children where they came from -- though I prefer that you should have them as part
     &amp; parcel of myself. I am glad you did not worry yourself to send me something to eat,
     (though the crackers are very nice you sent -- but I fear you robbed yourself on my account --)
     for we fare very well, have good bread &amp; butter &amp; sometimes eggs &amp; Mr.
     Bear gave me a half bushel of potatoes &amp; two splendid tomatoes &amp; we have been
     living off the top of the heap. Mr. B. &amp; Mr. S. came back here last night &amp;
     have spent the day here -- they wish to get their teams -- and will stay until tomorrow -- I
     have had a very good visit with Mr. B -- he tells me of the breaking up of his carriage --
     Rebecca gone to teach &amp;c. Young McCoy who taught in Staunton <abbr expan="Academy"
      >Acad.</abbr> last year is here in Capt. Lilley's Co. as Sergeant -- he and Miss Eddie Bell
     are constant correspondents and it is rumored that they are engaged -- <pb n="4"/> I have
     agreed to do an extra job for a Lieut. Humphrey's of Miss -- and make him a map of the Retreat
     of Gen. Garnett, in which he participated -- he wants it to send home &amp; I shall get pay
     for that, eight or ten dollars &amp; if I can only get the rest that I due me I shall be
     able to get along very well -- and think I can get up <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of necessity for
     procuring some mapping &amp;c articles and get home for a few days -- though, as I wrote
     before, they refuse furloughs to any but those chronically sick -- I went to see about the
     spool thread -- they have none of the kind you want -- I send you a spool of another no. that I
     bought some time ago at McDowell -- I will buy the calico you want as soon as I get some funds
     I am about ashore now -- as I did not have much &amp; had to buy some saddle bags
     &amp;c &amp;c now &amp; then. The troops here will probably be moved from here in a
     day or two -- which way is uncertain - - some think towards Hardy <abbr expan="County"
     >Co</abbr> -- I do not know -- but will write -- I can hardly say what I shall do -- for I know
     not myself -- of one thing be sure -- you &amp; my loved children are ever in remembrance
     -- and I pray God may again safely unite us at home in peace -- It is late and I must go to my
     pallet -- may you have sweet slumbers and be blessed with all the blessings a gracious God can
     bestow -- </p>
