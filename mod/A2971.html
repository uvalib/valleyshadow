<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter on the 21st was truly glad to
                    hear from you I had almost given up all hope of ever hearing from you again, but
                    it seemed that I was blessed at the eleventh hour by
                    receiving a long &amp; affectionate letter, Peace seemed a stranger to my
                    mind I went to preaching regular &amp; often found my mind wandering on
                    things that didn't interest my soul. Salvation tonight
                    I am on guard and as I can not sleep I have concluded to
                    spend my lonely hours in writing to my best of friends.
                    My health is very good, I have no reason to complain of any thing. I am only <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>in all things to say Lord thy will be done not mine. Thare is no news
                    astir in camp that would interest. Every thing is quiet along the Rapidan. Our Brigade has to
                    go on Picket Monday morning I hope we may have a pleasant time We had quite a heavy snow storm here last Tuesday &amp; Tuesday night It was from ten to twelve inches deep
                    the boys had a gay time snow balling; our Brigade bantered Rhodes'
                    division
                    they come out and drove us back to our quarters we had
                    no General to command us in the first Battle they had two. Walker seeing us
                    drove back came out &amp; rallied the old brigade and drove our opponents to their quarters
                    capturing one of their Gen I suppose there was two thousand engaged on either side. There was none killed on either side but <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>a great many
                    bloodly n<i>[deleted: o]</i>oses. Dear Kate wish I was by your side tonight I am sure I could talk much easier than write
                    I do not feel my self capable of answering your letter but look over my many
                    short comings &amp; I will try Dear Kate you spoke of kneeling at my feet to
                    implore mercy I pray thee never kneel to no man, but rather to thy creator in
                        whom is our only help, he can change the hearts of
                    those that hate us; to love &amp; respect us; Dear
                    Kate can you imagine my happiness when I came to the
                    words "Willie I love thee; &amp; my love has been tried; ah methinks I can hear those words coming up from thy noble but storm tossed heart; and they make me feel
                    like a strong man. Then again Oh God is it not sinful, you entreat me to forget, who, my first, my only, and I hope my
                    last lover. Dear Kate is this not cruel; one that loves
                    me one that I love, to advise me to forsake her, what have I done to bring this
                        judgment upon me have I com<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>mitted
                    some foul deed that will leave a stain up on my character or am I not good enough for thee I can not bring my self for a moment to
                    think that you would advise me thus on account of my need of worldly goods; oh I
                    know you know to well on this last, that God is the giver of all such gifts you
                    said you cared not for your own happiness but that
                    you would be happy in seeing your friends happy Dear Kate let me pray thee
                    never speak thus again I for one of thy loving hands
                    will never cease striving until it may please the almighty to place me
                    in a condition to make you happy Then &amp; not till
                    then shall I be perfectly
                    happy, then if you refuse me I can live my days as I am;
                    when I learn to quit using tobacco I will do it for your sake you asked me
                    whether I went to see your cous, Lizzie I did not I wanted to see her but could
                    not I was in trouble I had left a face that I loved with out seeing it &amp;
                    no other face seemed familiar. Dear Kate let us forget the past &amp; try
                    &amp; live as two loving friends for awhile; then if it may please our
                    master may I hope we may be drawn closer friends</p>
