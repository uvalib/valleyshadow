<p class="p10">Charlottesville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Uncle</p>
<p class="p10">I promised to write to you evry chance that I had. We landed here yesterday about sundown.
     The roads is very dusty down here Jackson and his army is still on the march no one knows
     exactly where he is. We had a good mess of cherries to day, we never have them this early in
     Highland; but we have something that I like better, and that is the water. We may have worse
     water than this is to drink, but I do not like it. I expect that we will leave here in the
     morning for Gordonsville. Our company is in good spirits and just as many as they were at the
     warmsprings. You must write to father the first chance and inform him where I am I expect that
     we will stay down here for some time, may be untill<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> the war is over. You must give
     my best love to Aunt Liza, and and all the family. <i>[deleted: and all of cousin]</i> Give
     my best respects to cousin Martha and all her sisters.</p>
<p class="p10">I will write in a few days and let you know where I am.</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse bad writing and mistakes for they are very
     common in camp.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Wise</i></p>
<p class="p10">
      Mr. A.D. Trotter, Staunton, Va.
