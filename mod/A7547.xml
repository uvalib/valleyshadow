                    so slippery or I should have been miserable about you, &amp; pa he reached
                    home in good time without any accident. Pa &amp; Ma took Ada to Bridgewater
                    this morning. Ada will remain with Rennie some time. Pa, &amp; Ma will if
                    they live return tomorrow Evening. I am left as housekeeper. Hattie &amp;
                    myself are the only inmates of home this Evening Lola, &amp; Lula have gone
                    skating. Hamie is at school so you see I am left almost desolate how I wish you
                    were with me now then I should not feel so lonely, &amp; deserted I missed
                    you so much all day Monday I felt restless like I wanted something to add to my
                    happiness which I could not find or get in my home. it was you I wanted but
                    alas! I could not have you whom I love so truly &amp; tenderly that pleasure
                    is not often mine to have you near me only<pb n="2"/>Every <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>

                    loves you just as dearly &amp; devotedly as if I were your wife it would be
                    just as bitter for me to give you up for months as it would be for Ella,

                    your future prosperity &amp; that of my dear papa I would ask God's

                    hope of seeing you some day far in the future. there would not be much joy in
                    waiting ever hopefully. Pa will talk to you on the subject. I am truly delighted
                    to hear you are coming down to stay several days. wish you could stay a month or
                    a year with me well I wish you could be with me always &amp; that we did not
                    have to part from each other. I hope that bright &amp; sweet time of our
                    lives is not far off when we can be with Each other always. How much I would
