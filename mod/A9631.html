<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Kate Armentrout, May
                    25, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Brand writes to Kate of picket duty, arriving troops from other states, and her
                    friends and family in camp. He also shares some rumors of the Union occupation
                    of Alexandria, and says that every member of the Augusta Grays who voted in the
                    recent elections voted in favor of secession.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure to <u>me</u>, that I am permitted to write
                    you a few lines I received
                    your much welcomed letter a few days since and have
                    taken this highly favored opportunity of writing. My health is very good as well
                    as your Brothers and I hope when these
                    few lines comes to hand that you may be enjoying the
                    same blessing with all other earthly enjoyments. There
                    are from fifteen to twenty thousand Soldiers here at
                    present there was <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> some rumors
                    here last night that the federal troops had taken possession of Alexandria there was a secession flag there &amp; one
                    secessionist stood by it &amp; said the first man that attempted to take it
                    down he would kill &amp; one of the officers of the federal troops walked up
                    to it and took hold of it and was shot down in his tracks but the secessionist suffered the same fate he was shot down &amp;
                    cut to pieces he well knew what would be his fate,
                        but his love to the <u>new
                        confederacy</u> was <u>sweeter</u> than death.</p>
<p class="p10">There is eleven Hundred
                    Alabamians &amp; with them two of my Uncles, John
                    &amp; William <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Mosley. I see them almost every day they are both very lively. Uncle William
                    &amp; my self was on duty night before last we were
                    speaking of our post I told him I had the best post on
                    the round &amp; he said he had the best for a lady
                    sent his supper out to him &amp; that he would be back there for his breakfast. I told him
                    that I would relieve him but
                    neither one got our meals there.</p>
<p class="p10">There is two thousand Mississippians
                    here
                    they are keen for a fight they
                    are in favor of going to Washington &amp; give the republicans a round or
                    so. The north must keep their feet off
                    of Virginia soil or there will
                    be blood shed. All of the Augusta Grays voted <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> for secession but two &amp; they did not vote fifteen or twenty of us
                    was not old enough, but our Captain told us to vote if we could &amp; every one of us voted one of
                    our low life men talked like he would oppose our votes
                    and the gentle man was about to get him self into business he got so bad scared
                    that he went and voted for secession. John is not so lively as he was when at
                    home. My friend James is well you will hear from him before long. Mr Apple told
                    me to send his love to who ever I was writing to I intend to come up to see you
                    before long. I ask an interest in your prayers that
                    I may hold out faithful to the end.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>William F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">Write soon as I am always anxious to hear from you all</p>
