                <p>McDonnell submits yet another quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District. His
                    assessment of the situation in Augusta County is largely positive, although on a
                    more general note, he comments that the news of the Bureau's impending cessation
                    of operation has been met with much regret among the black population. McDonnell
                    expressed doubts about the ability of the law alone to protect recently bestowed
                    rights from the influence of local prejudices with means of enforcement.</p>

                <p>In compliance with Circular No. 5 Series of 1867 from your Head Quarters, I have
                    the honor to submit the following report of a tour of Inspection through this
                    Sub District viz:</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">First Division</hi>, comprising <hi rend="underline"
                        >Frederick <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr></hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The <hi rend="underline"
                        >General Condition</hi> of the Freedpeople in this Division has steadily
                    advanced, since last report. They have been generally employed at fair wages,
                    are industrious and prosperous and beside being self-sustaining very many have
                    purchased small lots of land and built dwellings in which they reside. The
                    example of the latter class has stimulated others, who are <pb n="2"/>making
                    every effort to secure homes for their families. The moral condition of the
                    race, though improved, is not as satisfactory as could be desired. Many
                    desertions of husband from wives are reported, and bastardy is still too common.
                    The indifference with which the public looks upon the latter crime, in white and
                    colored persons, renders it if not respectable, as no obstacle to future
                    preferment. Until public opinion undergoes a radical change on this subject, but
                    little improvement can be looked for. Except in cases of old age or sickness,
                    but few applications for relief were made <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the public. As the
                    winter approaches, herewith and labor becomes scarce, many heads of families,
                    with the most tireless industry find that the product of the years labors
                    insufficient to clothe and feed the many helpless children. The
                        <unclear>compromising</unclear> appearance of the corn crop in this county
                    adds to their fears for the coming winter.</p>

                <p>The religious divisions of the people has also made divisions on the school
                    question. This is very <pb n="3"/>much to be regretted, and although each
                    denomination is making arrangements to sustain sectarian schools, still by an
                    unanimous cooperation a good site for a schoolhouse can be obtained, free of
                    cost, the title to be vested in a board of trustees, to be used for school
                    purposes forever, and a school established on such site without sectarian
                    prejudice could not fail to be much more efficient than the others. The house in
                    course of erection by the Bethelites, and one contemplated by the Freewill
                    Baptists will not be in condition to use for School purposes the coming winter
                    if ever.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The <hi rend="underline"
                        >disposition</hi> of local <hi rend="underline">Magistrates</hi> to <hi
                        rend="underline">administer</hi> impartial <hi rend="underline">justice</hi>
                    is good. Local class prejudices are too strong, however to expect it in jury
                    trials. In almost all cases wealth, influence and race will influence justice
                    against poverty stricken freedmen.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">The Register of Marriages</hi> is completed, and each of
                    the four paragraphs of <abbr expan="Circular">Cir.</abbr> 11 Series 1866, have
                    been fully and repeatedly read and explained at the several churches, and none
                    can plead ignorance of the Law. The state <pb n="4"/>authorities take no action
                    to prevent lewdness and adultery, and <orig reg="although">altho</orig>
                    cognizant of the existence of both; do not attempt to remedy.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The <hi rend="underline"
                        >County Authorities</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">provide</hi> for <hi rend="underline">indigent
                    freedpeople</hi>, as they do for the same class of whites and the means at their
                    disposal are adequate for the purpose. Few freedpeople, however, can be induced
                    to avail themselves of the privilege owing to a superstitious belief that "all
                    who enter the Poorhouse will soon die there."</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">The Supply of Labor</hi> was less than the demand during
                    the quarter, while for the coming months it will be largely in excess.</p>

                <p>Wages range from $8 to $15 per month, according to quality of help, few however
                    receive money for labor but are compelled to take Corn, Bacon, Clothing and such
                    other necessaries as they may require, and are frequently astonished to find
                    themselves in debt, at the expiration of contracts where they expected to find a
                    balance in their favor. The total inability of the Freedmen to keep accounts of
                    time or articles received operates <pb n="5"/>greatly to their disadvantage in
                    the settlements of claims for services rendered.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> No <hi rend="underline"
                        >Schools</hi> were in session during the quarter. This month closes the
                    vacation and teachers are shortly expected to return.</p>

                <p>Efforts are being made to organize schools at Newtown and Middletown, the only
                    places now destitute where a sufficient number of pupils could be found to
                    attend.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Second Division</hi> comprising <hi rend="underline"
                    >Clarke</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Warren</hi> and <hi rend="underline"
                    >Page</hi> Counties.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> In this division the general
                    condition of the freedpeople appears to be prosperous No considerable numbers
                    are congregated at any one place and consequently labor is in acute demand at
                    fair prices; and all are employed. In consequence of their isolated condition,
                    and the consequent difficulty in organizing for mutual consent of action, their
                    advancement socially is slow. The Schools <pb n="6"/>were presided over by
                    teachers altogether incompetent for the work, and although the moral effect was
                    advantageous to the people, the actual progress was exceedingly slow. As at
                    other sections, the complaints of bastardy are numerous and white men are not
                    infrequently accused by colored women of being the fathers of their children.
                    Owing to the constant demand for labor, by very little of any actual suffering
                    exists at any season in this division. The freedpeople are generally reported as
                    peaceable industrious and willing to abide the terms of Contracts.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> Local <hi rend="underline"
                        >Magistrates</hi> seem <hi rend="underline">disposed to render</hi> fair and
                        <hi rend="underline">impartial justice</hi> in cases in which freedmen are
                    parties. It cannot be denied however, that the prejudices of juries are against
                    the freedmen and that wealth, influence &amp; the pride of race oppose a
                    powerful bar to the claims of justice.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The <hi rend="underline"
                        >Register of Marriages</hi> is believed to be complete as far as
                    practicable, in each of the Counties in the division, and each of the four
                    paragraphs of <pb n="7"/>The Records, Books and papers at Captain Ripley's
                    office are in a satisfactory condition, and everywhere throughout the Division,
                    progression in freedmen's affairs is evident.</p>

                    work, are employed at prices varying from $8 to $12 per month. At Harrisonburg
                    they appear to be in a very prosperous condition, they have erected a good
                    schoolhouse at an expense of about $600, and during the last term of the school
                    paid by contribution about $40 per month toward the supply of teachers.
                    Extraordinary efforts will be made in this Division during the coming winter to
                    increase the number of schools and it is hoped with success. The very bitter

                <p>Such outrages have the effect to <unclear>infuriate</unclear> the colored

                    evidence against a party of men accused of cutting down and burning a flagpole
                    in front of the Bureau office at Woodstock and being unable to obtain redress or
                    protection, was compelled to <unclear>leave</unclear> the County to escape
                    further violence. Since the arrival of Mr. James Agent of the Bureau at
                    Woodstock, no <pb n="9"/>reports of abuse have been made, and it is sincerely
                    hoped such <unclear>censurable</unclear> practices will soon cease altogether.</p>

                    fail to be disastrous to Magistrates engaged in business. It is very doubtful if

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The <hi rend="underline"
                        >General condition</hi> of affairs indicate that advancement in intelligence
                    is gradually being made by the Freedmen. They are generally employed at
                    reasonable wages, are industrious and show by their deportment that they are
                    disposed to make themselves <add hand="h1" place="inline">a</add>thrifty,
                    self-supporting and law abiding population. But little idleness and much less
                    drunkenness prevails - improvement in that respect being observed. They are
                    disposed to abide by the conditions of contracts, and the obligations and duties
                    they sustain to each other in assuming a more substantial aspect. Taking
                    everything into consideration the condition of Freedmen's affairs, especially in
                    reference to those matters for which they are responsible, is marked by steady
                    advancement. They have a lively appreciation of the importance of education and
                    are generally interested in the question of Schools. Extreme suffering is not
                    reported nor observed and with <pb n="12"/>the exception of the Aged, and
                    decrepid, all appear to be contentedly employed.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> In cases where a colored
                    person is opposed to a white man the influence of wealth and race are strongly
                    felt by juries and not seldom overpower evidence &amp; facts. The higher
                    courts, I am satisfied do not to any observable extent refuse justice on account
                    of race &amp; color, but the statement of a colored man, as compared with
                    that of a white man does not appear to have the same weight with Judge or Jury.</p>

                <p>It is the cause of much regret among the Freedpeople that the operations of the
                    Bureau are to cease on the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> January next. The
                    prosperity and social advancement which has attended their progress each year is
                    attributable to that protection with which the government has shielded them in
                    their efforts to realize the blessings of freedom.</p>

                <p>Without the continuance of that protection they will be as heretofore, defrauded
                    by men who have been accustomed and still do look upon them as their property.
                    The law it is true protects them; but without the means to employ the law with
                    efficacy and too ignorant &amp; unsophisticated to take the proper
                    initiatory steps for their protection they becoming
                    <unclear>disheartened</unclear> and hopeless of success abandon their just
                    claims.</p>

                <p>When told that the local civil officers are loyal and good men, they reply that
                    those same local officers were slaveholders before the war, and that <orig
                        reg="although">altho'</orig> loyal to the government <pb n="15"/>the same
                    local prejudices and interests in business will influence them to as great an
                    extent as if over <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> they <orig reg="naturally"
                    >naturaly</orig>feel that their only dependence is on the officers who are
                    entirely independent of local influence, and who they know are their friends,
                    and they say as they feel, that if with officers who are appointed at
                    Washington, with no local prejudices whatever they can barely get justice how
                    can we hope when they are <unclear>rendered</unclear> to obtain the slightest
                    recognition of our rights from those who if no influence was felt would claim us
                    as their chattels."</p>

                <p>That the view they have thus taken is well founded there can be no doubt. The
                    evident desire to defraud the freedmen of their hard earned due in very many
                    cases, cannot be disputed. The amounts <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr>
                    generally small are nevertheless of great consequence 15 destitute families, and
                    without some officers whose special duty it will be to attend to this class of
                        <pb n="16"/>complaints, a large sum in the aggregate will be annually lost
                    to the freedmen.</p>

                <p>It is a matter of congratulations to record the marked improvement in the
                    condition of the colored people throughout the whole Sub-district</p>

                <p>With industry and economy applications for relief of food and clothing have
                    almost ceased.</p>

                <p>The Churches have been filled with well-clad, and orderly congregations, and very
                    many <unclear>p---t</unclear> with pleasure and <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to the little
                    house and lot, which <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> not all paid for, they
                    call with honest pride their own.</p>

                <p>It has been found impracticable to organize temperance societies, still amongst
                    the freedmen drunkenness is rarely to be seen and only in cases of confined <del
                        hand="h1"/> in the larger towns.</p>

                <p>The great necessity of the race (as of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> any) is education (and
                    cultivation, and tho' unwilling to contribute much material aid to the support
                    of schools, owing to the fact that little if any assistance has been required of
                    them heretofore, they fully realize <pb n="17"/>and appreciate the advantages
                    which instruction in the elements of education confers upon the fortunate
                    possessor, and gradually perceive the worth of knowledge for its own sake
                    independent of the pecuniary advantages its possession confers. The proficiency
                    of the pupils and the marked attention noticed in many cases on the part of both
                    parents &amp; teachers is the signal of success, and there can be no doubt
                    that the feelings of pride in their children and love for them will as in the
                    case of white people be found a sufficient stimulus for them to exact themselves
                    as much as possible to send their children (&amp; go themselves to school),
                    and it is confidently expected that a wide attendance and still more liberal
                    support on the part of parents will be had by all the schools which may be
                        <unclear>started</unclear> in this sub District this winter.</p>
