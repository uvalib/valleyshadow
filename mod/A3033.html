<p class="p10">Dear Annie -</p>
<p class="p10"> I have just this morning finished reading your kind note sent by brother
                         John, &amp; as I am some distance ahead of the regiment I will drop you
                         a few lines in return. I wrote you a day or two ago, but for fear that you
                         did not get it I will send you a few more. I have been enjoying myself for
                         two days very much. I met with Cousin <i>[unclear: Pit]</i> at the Augusta
                         Springs &amp; she requested me to bring her to this place to see Jim -
                         which I did &amp; by the way I am now in closer with the galls - <u>all</u>
                         <u>on</u>
                         <u>her</u>
                         <u>account</u>
                         <u>however</u>. We are on our way down the valley again,
                         if the Yankees don't make us take the back track. I have not time to write
                         much, as our regiment will soon be up. your friends are all well so far as
                         I know. I have been unwell<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> for two or three days, but since I
                         have gotten into the valley. I feel perfectly well. I suppose it is from
                         the past that I have been associated with the fair sex (at least) to some
                         extent. I hope it may continue to exert that influence. I must close for
                         the present. Will be glad to hear from you often.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste as ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Tony Pastor</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> Our Army will just about get across the
                              river today. The bridge has been burnt at
                              this place so that it is difficult to get across the river being very
                              high. Cousin Mollie &amp; Pit are both here Many came with John. I
                              suppose they will leave for home this evening. I told pit I would send
                              this by her, but I could give it to John as he may see you first. my
                              love to all the girls &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> the same.</p>
