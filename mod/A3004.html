<h4>Augusta County: Samuel Franklin Carson to Annie
                    Harris, Aug 4 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>The letter notes that Carson has written quite frequently to Annie, in contrast
                    to her recent protests. The letter also describes a recent clash with Union
                    cavalry at Culpepper and goes on to describe camp life near Montpelier, the old
                    home of James Madison.</p>

<p class="p10">Aug 4 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Orange Court</p>
<p class="p10">Dearest Annie</p>
<p class="p10">Your thrice welcome letter is to hand, &amp;; believe me, it was read with an
                    unusual degree of interest, it being the first I have received since my
                    departure. You have no idea how anxiously &amp;; how attentively I listened
                    to each mail as it was called over from day to day, to see if any letter had
                    come for me, but until today was doomed to
                    disappointment.<br>You said in your letter you "had well nigh come to the
                    conclusion that I had forogtten any promise. Now I don't think you ought to
                    entertain such a thought for one moment. I have always endeavored to fulfill <u>all</u> my promises as far as possible, particularly in
                        <u>your</u>
                    <u>case</u>. I wrote you immediately after my "skedadling"
                    from Yankeedom. I wrote you aldo from Banksville after our army fell back to
                    Martinsburg &amp; also on the march from the valley to this place, making in
                    all three letters <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>since I left, &amp; yet you think I have
                    forgotten my promise? But enough of that for the present.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no news of importance to write you at present - everything is quiet at
                    this time. Longstreet &amp; Hill are camped near Culpepper. it was reported
                    in camp yesterday that they were falling back in the direction of this place.
                    there was a big cavalry fight at Culpepper last saturday between three brigades
                    of the yankees &amp; one of ours. The yankees also had some infantry. Our
                    men fell back slowly about four miles until some of
                    our infantry went up to their assistance our men then drove <i>[added: them]</i> back. Our loss was about one hundred, that of the
                    enemy much greater. Our camp for the present is about 2 miles from Orange <i>[deleted: ]</i> &amp; within one mile of Montpelier the birth place <i>[deleted: ]</i> of James Madison. I have not paid the place a visit as yet,
                        owing to the fact that I have been quite unwell
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>since our arrival at this camp, however I am happy to say that I
                    feel much better this evening. Frank <i>[unclear: McCutchan]</i> has been in
                    guard there for several days, keeping the soldiers from destroying things around
                    the house. There is an old fellow by the name of <i>[unclear: Carson]</i>
                    living there I think probably I can "ring in on that ticket." Our "fancy
                    officers" had quite a nice time the other night there; had a big Ball, plenty of
                    women &amp; other luxuries to numerous to mention. Was very sorry my rank
                    would not <i>[unclear: provence]</i> for me a bid, but guess it was best for me
                    as it was.</p>
<p class="p10">You requested me to give you all the information I could in regard to John Meck
                    All I can learn is that he was left at our hospital in Gettysburg under the care
                    of Dr Sayers of our Brigade. Gade Plunket was left as a nurse - his company say
                    he was doing well when they left him - I deepy sympathize with the family.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Well I presume you are getting tired of this uninteresting letter, so
                    I will close for the present, trusting that you will look over all mistakes, and
                    especially bad writing, as I am very much out of fit.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours as ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Give my love to Chris. Tell her I would like to see
                        her so much, have something very funny to tell her "about something" I heard
                        from your quarter. Please remember me affectionately to friend <i>[deleted: ]</i> &amp; Lady. Also to all the rest of the fair ones. Tell
                        Demaris I trust the Captain will soon be released
                        so that she may again have the pleasure of beholding his sweet face.<br>
                        NB. I trust you will do with this sheet as you requested me to do with
                        yours. Tony</p>
