                    <p> I have just this morning finished reading your kind note sent by brother
                         John, &amp; as I am some distance ahead of the regiment I will drop you
                         a few lines in return. I wrote you a day or two ago, but for fear that you
                         did not get it I will send you a few more. I have been enjoying myself for
                         two days very much. I met with Cousin <unclear>Pit</unclear> at the Augusta
                         Springs &amp; she requested me to bring her to this place to see Jim -
                         which I did &amp; by the way I am now in closer with the galls - <hi
                              rend="underline">all</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">on</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">her</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">account</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">however</hi>. We are on our way down the valley again,
                         if the Yankees don't make us take the back track. I have not time to write
                         much, as our regiment will soon be up. your friends are all well so far as
                         I know. I have been unwell<pb n="2"/> for two or three days, but since I
                         have gotten into the valley. I feel perfectly well. I suppose it is from
                         the past that I have been associated with the fair sex (at least) to some
                         extent. I hope it may continue to exert that influence. I must close for
                         the present. Will be glad to hear from you often.</p>

                              this place so that it is difficult to get across the river being very

                              suppose they will leave for home this evening. I told pit I would send
                              this by her, but I could give it to John as he may see you first. my
