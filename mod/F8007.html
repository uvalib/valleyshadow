<p class="p10"><u>Dr</u> Sir-</p>
<p class="p10">We take the freedom of sending to your address two copies of the <u>Valley Spirit</u>, the leading Democratic papers in this
                    Senatorial District, and of which we have now the control, the regular Editor
                    being absent at Washington, filling a clerkship in the Attorney General's
                    Office. Our object in sending the papers is for the purpose of Directing your
                    attention to a couple of articles relating to Alexander
                    K. McClure. This fellow is now rising all the Knavery of which he is capable to
                    secure the nomination of Senator for this District. There is, we are most happy
                    to Say, a tremendously hostile feeling existing against him, at this time, <u>in his own party</u>, and a determined effort will be made
                    to oust him for the nomination--should that fail--<u>beat him
                        at the election</u>. We are in with the movement <i>[unclear: from]</i>
                    his party to crush him out, and have been solicited by prominent men in the
                    party, to write you, and beg your aid and counsel in the effort, in any way
                    that, you may think, will <u>tell</u> to the best advantage
                    to the effect the object so much desired. Should this meet your approval you can
                    write to us unreservedly on the subject.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
