<p class="p10">Dear Henry:- </p>
<p class="p10">Once more amid the scenes of confusion<br> and surrounded by the walls of Franklin Hall is Ellic,<br> your old friend. this morning I got in the carriage &amp;<br> was hurried away from the
     loved scenes of home, by<br> the gentle pace of faithful "<u>Lade</u>" and
     after two<br> hours ride was again at the place of study, and surrounded by the hum and bustle of a county town. </p>
<p class="p10"> I enjoyed my trip home very much, and consider that<br> I would have loosed a great
     privilege, if not permitted to give my assistance in
     reaping the harvest; none<br> but the experienced know the value and comfort<br> of county
     labor until deprived of its blessings.<br> I think a life in the county, surrounded by
     nature's robes<br> of green, basking in the sun shine of heavenly purity, freed<br> from the
     clamour and confusion of a county town,<br> breathing in the health and vigor of a county
     home, and<br> reclining under family protection and affection,<br> one of heaven's richest
     blessings. 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitCre5b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitCre5b.gif"></center></a><br><br> It is reported today that General McClellan has<br> routed the
     Secessionist entirely, and taken about<br> sixteen hundred prisoners, "good for him", may<br>
     he ever be successful in his efforts to protect<br> the rights of American citizens. And may
     his right<br> arm be strengthened by every battle strife, and may<br> God unnerve every arm
     that would raise<br> to aid in the destruction of this the home<br> of the <i>[added: free]</i> and the assylum of <i>[added: the]</i>
     oppressed. </p>
<p class="p10"> Henry I did not get to Uncle Michael's,<br>
     Wallace's, or Kyner's, but I know you
     will get<br>
     Kyner's name to your petition without my intercession in your behalf. However I know I<br>
     would have enjoyed a visit with you to<br> the <i>[added: two]</i>
     latter named places, and will hope better<br> the next time I come home, which I hope
     will<br> be when the huckleberries are ripe. As this<br> is
     my second letter today, I will close by<br> asking you to remember
     me to the people<br> of the pines who are solicitous enough to enquire<br> of me. </p>
<p class="p10">
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitCre5c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitCre5c.gif"></center></a><br><br>

    </p>
<p class="p10">Since this was written Aunt received a<br> letter from Uncle
     Stumbaugh, he says that<br>
     General Patterson assures him that if
      Johnson<br> did not attack him that he (Patterson)<br> would attack Johnson before the term
     of<br> the three months men would have<br> expired, so lookout for a fight the<br> last of
     this week, or a retreat on<br> the part of the rebels.
    </p>
