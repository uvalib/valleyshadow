<p class="p10">Staunton, Va</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">Having seen an order in which you were instructed to visit this Sub-District, and investigate certain charges
                    against me, and in which you were referred to call
                    upon the Teachers of Freedmen, Trustees of the Church, and <i>[added: Oscar Morris]</i> the Assistant
                    Assessor at this place for proof of these charges, and you having kindly shown
                    me the statements of the parties to whom you were referred, I beg leave therefore to respectfully invite your attention to
                    the following explanation and rebutting statements.</p>
<p class="p10">Sometime in the latter part of the winter or the early part of the spring of 1866
                    the African Methodist Association of New York sent
                    four boxes of clothing here through the Quartermaster
                    Department three boxes of which were sent to Mr. John
                    Scott, (Teacher of Freedmen) in my care, and the other one to myself for
                    gratuitous distributions. At that time the colored people had just purchased an
                    old building which <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>was formrly used for a Market House, for which
                    they were to pay two thousand ($2000) dollars, to be converted into a Church,
                    one third to be hand payment, and the balance in installments of 1.283 years,
                    but were unable to meet the first payment. I suggested to the Teachers (who were
                    at that time boarding with me) that perhaps they might get some assistance for them by writing to their friends
                    North, which they did and received as contributions about one hundred and twenty
                    five ($125) dollars, which was turned over to the Trustees of the Church. I also
                    suggested to Mr. Scott that he had better write to the African Methodist Association and get permission from
                    them for us to sell the clothing to those who were able to buy, at a nominal
                    price, and turn the money into the Freedmen, toward paying their first payment
                    on the Church, which he did and received for a reply as near as I can remember
                    in substance as follows - "It is our practice whenever we sent clothing to the
                    Freedmen to have it gratuitously distributed but if under the circumstances you
                    and Mr Tukey think it advisable to sell the clothing to such as are able to buy
                    it, you can do so and turn the money over toward the payment of the colored
                    peoples <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>church and we will send you other clothing to supply the
                    place of that you sell."</p>
<p class="p10">In accordance with above instructions, and as Mr Scott had three large boxes, I
                    gave him permission to occupy one of my rooms, for the purpose of unpacking and
                    selling the clothing, and I retained my box (which was quite small) in my
                    Office, for the purpose of supplying such cases as might come in when M Scott
                    was absent. As near as I can remember Mr Scott received about seventy ($70)
                    dollars for his three large boxes, and I received for mine eleven ($11) and some
                    cents. About the time the last of the clothing was sold I was relieved from duty
                    and about the same time Mr Scott turned the proceeds of his sales over to the
                    Treasurer of the Church. The next day after Mr Scott turned over his funds I met
                    the Treasurer and told him that I had something over eleven ($11) dollars in my
                    possession, received from the same source of Mr Scott, but had not got it with
                    me at the time, but would give it to him the first opportunity. That same night
                    I received a letter from a friend in Boston which led me to make up my mind to
                    start for the North the next <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>morning. I had previously however, made
                    arrangements with Lieutenant Cook to return at the
                    expiration of two weeks and enter upon the duties of Clerk in his Office. While
                    on my way through Baltimore, on board the cars in the night, while standing upon
                    the platform of the car, in a crowd, I had my pocket picked, and lost fourteen
                    hundred ($1400) dollars, among which was the eleven ($11) dollars which belonged
                    to the colored people, and which I did not have an opportunity to turn over
                    before leaving home and thought it could make no difference as I was to return
                    so soon. The money which I lost was not only all of my hard three years earnings
                    in the Bureau, but three hundred ($300) dollars of it was money which I brought
                    from the North in 1863, and was nearly every dollar I had in the world.</p>
<p class="p10">In a few days after my return to Staunton I met Thomas Carnell, (colored), Superintendent colored Sabbath School, to whom I
                    mentioned my misfortune, telling him that the eleven ($11) dollars belonging to
                    the colored people was among the money which I lost, and asked him if he thought
                    it my duty, under the circumstances <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>to make it up, to which he
                    promptly replied "No, by no means." My only regrets in the matter are, that I
                    did not at the time get a release in writing from the Trustees from paying said
                    claim, and that Mr Carnell is now absent from Town and unable to give his
                    testimony upon these points.</p>
<p class="p10">As to the statement made by Oscar Morris with reference to his pay, I beg leave
                    to say, that at the time he was employed as messenger in this Office, I had
                    never been furnished with a letter book for the purpose of recording Official
                    Business. Consequently there are no records by which to get at the facts, but
                    think however, reference to the pay rolls will set the matter all right. Be that
                    as it may, this is the first time that Oscar has ever mentioned the subject, to
                    my knowledge, and he never at any time, asked me for what he claims for the
                    balance of his pay, or said one single word that he thought he had been wronged
                    or unjustly dealth with and I never was more surprised in my life than when I
                    saw his statement made to you upon the subject and can only explain the matter
                    in the following manner.</p>
<p class="p10">He either was offended on account of his being discharged from the Office on
                    account of my increased salary <i>[added: as clerk]</i> or
                    else he thought that when I told him that I had received orders to reduce his
                    pay that it was false, but I beg leave to call your <i>[added: close]</i> attention to his statement, and memoranda Book
                    forwarded herewith - Also the order dated March 26<sup>th</sup> 1866
                    from Captain How for the reduction of his pay. You
                    will observe that on the first page of his statement, he says that he received
                    only ten ($10) dollars for the first three months and on the opposite <i>[added: page]</i> of the same statement, he says he got
                    twenty ($20) dollars the first month and $10 for each of the second and third
                    months and that he was paid $20 by Captain How for
                    the fourth month. Again you will find by reference to his own memoranda book,
                    (kept in his own handwriting) that he says he commenced work January 15<sup>th</sup> 1866 and that for
                        January &amp; February
                    he was paid $30, and April 15<sup>th</sup> he received $20 more, and
                    May 15<sup>th</sup> $15 and $15 more on June 15<sup>th</sup> making a total of eighty ($80) dollars.</p>
<p class="p10">Now it will be seen by reference to the accompanying order, that Oscars pay was
                    reduced on the 26<sup>th</sup> of March to $10 per month, and again
                    it will be seen, by reference to the order for his discharge that he was
                    discharged on the 10<sup>th</sup> of the following July, a copy of
                    said order which of course, can be found by reference to records in the Office
                    of Assistant Commissioner, and which I find
                    recorded in the letter book in this Office, the whole showing that Oscar was
                    employed altogether six months lacking five days, and for the first two months
                    and a half, he received $20 per month and for the balance of the time, $10 per
                    month, which would have amounted to about $83,85/100, showing a discrepancy of
                    $3.85/100. and Oscar admits to me, that he is not sure that he credited all that
                    he received in his book. You will observe, therefore that his statements are
                    contradictory from beginning to end, but justice to him compels me to say that I
                    do not think it has been intentional for I have always regarded him as one of
                    the most honorable and upright colored men that I have ever met, and think he
                    would not have done it, had he not been influenced by others. <br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br>As to
                    his statement about my employing a Son of a Rebel in my Office, permit me to
                    say, that the boy was not employed by me in the Office, but by Lieutenant Cook, and I found him here when I entered
                    upon the duties of the Office on the 26 of December
                    1866, and the boy cannot be called the Son of a Rebel, as his Father died some
                    years before the war. His Mother is a poor Widow woman, with two small children
                    to support, and ekes out a scanty subsistence made by her needle.</p>
<p class="p10">As to his statements concerning the lumber taken from the Barracks, they are in
                    the main correct and to be explained in following manner. I received orders from
                        Brevet Major W. S. How, late Superintendent of the District to have the Barracks torn down, and after satisfying the claim of
                    Mr Thomas Wholey, who owned the lot upon which they were built, to turn the rest
                    over to the Freedmen for repairs to their Church</p>
<p class="p10">At the same time Mr Shaver (Proprietor of the Virginia
                    Hotel) had shown me an order given him by Brevet Colonel C. C. Clay, late Commander at this post, for nine hundred feet of
                    lumber, in payment for lumber taken from him by said Clays command to be paid
                    from lumber taken from said Barracks which order I at first refused to fill <i>[added: but afterwards did so by advice from Captain How]</i>. I had no means to pay expenses of
                    taking down the Barracks, but as there was an immediate demand for some of the
                    lumber, I employed as near as I can recollect - three or four colored men,
                    several days, and paid them out of my own pocket, for their labor, and charged
                    the same to the Trustees of the Church. After having torn down a sufficient
                    amount to satisfy the immediate demand, I came to the conclusion that it was
                    going to be too expensive a job to pay for out of my own pocket, and take my
                    chances of having the money refunded I therefore suspended operations and in a
                    few days after so doing Major How visited this Sub-District, and I told him that I had no means for taking down the
                    Barracks, and asked him what I should do. he replied by asking me if there were
                    more than would be needed on the Church, and I told him I thought there were.
                        <br><br>[<i>page 10</i>]<br>To which he said (I think) in these precise words. "Employ some
                    colored men to take them down, and sell enough of the lumber to pay the expense,
                    and make no explanations to any body." And in accordance with his orders
                    (although given verbally) I sold to Robert G. Bickle sixteen sills, or rather
                    sleepers, at sixty cents each, and to Edward Johnson three hundred and fifty
                    feet at $1.50 per hundred, and to James Patterson I sold a small lot for which I
                    think I received one dollar and seventy cents am
                    positive that it did not amount to two dollars.</p>
<p class="p10">It is impossible for me to tell how much I paid out to the men I employed as the
                    memoranda of it has long since been destroyed, but of this fact I am willing to
                    make oath, - (as I am of all the rest), that I never received full payment of
                    all that I paid out.</p>
<p class="p10">As there were no means of hauling this lumber, and I often wanted a wagon for
                    such jobs, and had been informed by Major How that he had made application for
                    one which was refused, I went and bought out of my own private funds, a two
                    Horse spring wagon for which I paid <br><br>[<i>page 11</i>]<br>thirty ($30) dollars and a
                        <i>[unclear: set]</i>of double Harness for which I paid about eleven ($11)
                    dollars and then had to expend twelve ($12) dollars more on the wagon, and two
                    ($2) dollars on the Harness, before they could be used. This wagon was used in
                    hauling all the lumber to the Church, and was so badly broken to pieces in the
                    operation that I had to expend according to the best of my recollections about
                    nine ($9) dollars to have it repaired again, making a total of about sixty-four
                    ($64) dollars that I had paid out of my own private funds.</p>
<p class="p10">With reference to repairs on Church, I beg leave to say, that about the time they
                    got ready to commence work on it, I found that they had partially contracted
                    with a man to do <i>[added: the work for]</i> them, for, I
                    think, one hundred and twenty ($120) dollars, which seemed to me to be an
                    exorbitant price, and I advised them not to pay it, and told them I thought I
                    could have the work done so it should not cost them over seventy-five ($75)
                    dollars, and they requested me to go ahead and do it, which I did, paying out of
                    my own pocket eighty-eight ($88) dollars, without any security whatever, but
                    simply their verbal <br><br>[<i>page 12</i>]<br>promise to pay me when the work was done, at the
                    same time I agreed with them to do whatever Mason work there was to be done, and
                    make them a present of it, as my portion of a subscription which they were
                    taking up among their friends, for the benefit of the Church, which cost me
                    about eleven ($11) dollars, and of which I did make them a present according to
                    promise. In fitting up the Church I paid out as I said before eighty-eight ($88)
                    dollars, but in collecting the receipts, all of which were taken in the name of
                    the parties who did the work, and were given for work done on colored Church,
                    and turned over to Treasurer of said Church, there were minor articles to the
                    amount of eight ($8) dollars of which I made no account and turned over Receipts
                    to the amount of about eighty ($80) dollars, which they promised to pay. In
                    about two months time they paid me fifteen ($15) dollars, the balance remained
                    unpaid for a long time. When I sent word to them to one of their official
                    mettings if they would pay me twenty five ($25) dollars, I would make them a
                    present of the other forty, which they did. in proof of this your attention is
                        <br><br>[<i>page 13</i>]<br>especially called to they statement of Aaron
                    <i>[unclear: Shouler]</i>, Treasurer.</p>
<p class="p10">It will be seen by the foregoing statement that I paid out of my own pocket for
                    repairs on the Church, fifty-one ($51) dollars, for which I never received one
                    cent, forty dollars of the amount being proven by the statement of their own
                    Treasurer, Aaron Shouler.</p>
<p class="p10">The lumber referred to by Oscar Morris as being used in my own House, was used
                    for the special purpose of dividing the basement in to rooms for the purpose of
                    giving temporary quarters and shelter to freed people who often came into Town,
                    enroute for some other place, and were without friends or money to provide their
                    shelter, and at no time during that winter was there less than three, and
                    sometimes as high as eight and ten quartered in the rooms of my own House.</p>
<p class="p10">With reference to the pork and mackerel that Morris says was consumed in my own
                    family, I beg leave to say that he is simply mistaken. The dividing of my rooms
                    in the basement, forced me to keep my own family provisions in the <br><br>[<i>page 14</i>]<br>same room with the Government rations, and the mackerel and Pork <i>[added: referred to by him]</i>
                    were bought by me from the U.S. Commissary at Charlottesville Va. on the day
                    that the last U.S. Soldiers left here. In proof of this your attention is
                    especially invited to the accompanying Affidavit - of Catherine Cox (colored)
                    who was House Servant for me at the time.</p>
<p class="p10">With reference to Teachers, to whom you were referred,
                    permit me to say that it is an exceedingly painful duty for me to say one word
                    that can possibly be construed as derogatory to their characters, and especially
                    is this so when I consider the official relation which I sustain with them, and
                    shall only say what I feel compelled to in self defense, and to show their
                    connection with the charges that have been brought against me, and no earthly
                    consideration will ever induce me to so far forget the responsibility of my
                    position as to allow myself to enter into any personal quarrel with them, or
                    treat them in any other than a courteous, and Gentlemanly manner, and will only
                    say that while they were in my house there was a greater degree of intimacy <br><br>[<i>page 15</i>]<br>between Lieutenant Cook, and one George Graham, who has figured conspicuously in this
                    whole affair and two of the female Teachers, than what a proper sense of
                    propriety would justify. to these improprieties my Wife and myself were much
                    opposed. hence their zeal and willingness to testify against me and from facts
                    which are in my possession, I am satisfied that these charges have either been
                    made or instigated by Lieutenant Cook in a spirit of
                    malice and have been thus far skillfully carried
                    out by a combination of these four persons. The said George Graham came to this place about the middle of November last, and is
                    a perfect stranger to me. Notwithstanding this he has made himself very
                    officious in this whole affair, and has had no earthly cause for it, except his
                    intimacy with Lieutenant Cook, and the Teachers
                    alluded to above. You will observe in his statement that he says that a petition
                    was drawn and placed in his hands to be signed by the colored people praying for
                        Lieutenant Cook to be returned here now I have
                    been reliably informed that he drew said petition himself and I know that he has
                    been very busy in circulating it among the colored people for signers <br><br>[<i>page 16</i>]<br>making all sorts of representations, and playing upon their credulity in all
                    manner of ways.</p>
<p class="p10">With reference to the statement that I have been too intimate with Rebels, and am
                    not a good Union man, I am inclined to the opinion that it is too absurd to call
                    for any notice by me, yet it is perhaps due to myself to say, that I am a Union
                    man through and through from navel to Backbone and back again but I have never
                    deemed it wise or prudent for me as a Bureau Officer to discuss political
                    subjects with any body, and it has always been my aim, to conduct myself in such
                    a manner toward the Whites as to compel them to respect me. I have always
                    regarded this as important for when we consider that <u>civil</u>
                    <u>law</u> is supreme it has seemed to me that such a course
                    with a fixed and firm purpose to do justice would best subserve the interest of
                    the Freedmen and maintain the dignity of the Government <br><br>[<i>page 17</i>]<br>With
                    reference to the statement made by Reverend Ephraim
                    Lawson, (colored) in which he said that I told him that I had been released, by
                        General Brown, from payment of the eleven ($11)
                    dollars received for sale of clothing, I simply wish to say, that he does not
                    quote me quite correctly, what I did tell him was this, "that after my return
                    from <i>[added: the North]</i> I had mentioned the subject
                    of the loss of my money, and that of the colored peoples, to General Brown and asked him if he thought it was my
                    duty, under the circumstances, to make it good and he told me that he thought I
                    ought to either make it up, or get a release in writing from the Trustees of the
                    Church from so doing.</p>
<p class="p10">In conclusion, permit me to say that I have the best of reason for believing that
                    these charges have been either made, or investigated, by Lieutenant Cook in a spirit of malice and revenge, and
                    in proof of this you are respectfully referred to the
                    accompanying statements of various parties who with two or three <br><br>[<i>page 18</i>]<br>exceptions were here during the whole of my former period of service in the
                    Bureau, and I think are much better qualified to judge of my conduct than
                    several who have so willingly testified against me. And in further evidence of
                    this I beg leave to submit for your consideration the following fact. I was
                    employed in Lieutenant Cooks Office three months
                    after these offences were said to have been committed and have been here two
                    months since and submit it to you, whether it was not Lieutenant Cooks duty to have made these charges known long ago, and at
                    once to have discharged me from his Office instead of waiting five months until
                    he was ordered away from here and then doing it, the whole of which is submitted
                    for your and your superior Officers candid consideration.</p>
