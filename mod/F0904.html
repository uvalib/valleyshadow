<p class="p10">March the 1st, 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Camp in Front of Petersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure that I take the opportunity to let you know
                    that I am well at present and hope these
                    few    lines
                    will find you all
                    well but I am beginning to
                    think that you don't
                    care
                    anything About me for if you did you would
                    attend to writing a little better than you do. if you would
                    write
                    every
                    week I would
                    too but I think if you don't think
                        worthwhile
                    writing I won't
                    either. I haven't
                    had A letter from you for three
                    weeks
                    or more. I sent A letter with <i>[unclear: Bill Sibert]</i> and I sent three
                    shirts and a revolver and a pair of gloves and a
                        <i>[unclear: testamont]</i> and a ring and my watch to get it
                    fixed. I told him to fetch the watch<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> back
                    along and I want to know if he
                        gave you them things
                    or
                    not. Our
                    furlough is sent    off and
                    if it comes
                    back
                    all right we will get home. we got
                    paid off on Saturday and if
                    we don't get going home I will
                    send it home to you and I want you if <i>[unclear: Kirk]</i>
                    hasn't paid that money to write to him that you want it as soon as he
                        can
                    pay it for I think it is time. I am going to send you
                    and Annie a ring apiece. I
                        made them out the Rebels shells that they
                    throwed over and that didn't
                    bust and I took the screws out and made them rings. Tell miney that I will
                    make her one as soon as I can get a screw. So nothing more
                    at present but remain yours. Write A little sooner than you <i>[unclear: generally]</i>
                    do.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sylvester McElheney</i></p>
<p class="p10">If I don't get going home I will get some photographs and send them to you I would like to have yours.</p>
