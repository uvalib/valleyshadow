<p class="p10">Aug. 3rd, 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Valley Mt.</p>
<p class="p10">My Ever Dear One</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you have been uneasy about me, because I have not written, but I have been very
     sick for 4 or 5 days &amp; only feel today as though I could write a little, it was a
     typhoid attack -- very bad head ache, pains in my limbs &amp; I have not slept any of
     consequence, but hope to tonight -- My head has been too hot, but I had a blister on the back
     of my neck, the hair cut off &amp; applications to the head -- I have been very kindly
     cared for, though not like home, not like being in a house -- every one here almost the same
     sickness &amp; many have it since the change from the wet to the dry season, for it rained
     here daily, hourly &amp; nightly all through the Dog days -- never stopped - - the mud was
     deep everywhere -- in (that pen won't write) the tents &amp; out, on the hills, in the
     valleys, roads impassable &amp;c &amp;c it would weary me to tell you, but the 31st of
     Aug. the Dog days ended, the rain ceased -- has not rained since
     &amp; the sun shines all the time, hot, (cold before) &amp; the change is so great that
     many are affected by it, but we shall soon get used to it -- my tent mates have been sick too
     the same woe, The woods here have put on the Autumn dress. The army is now slowly coming up as
     the roads permit &amp; I suppose a week will pass at least before any move is made towards
     the enemy, for Gens. Lee &amp; Loring are determined not to go until ready &amp; the
     enemy occupies a <u>strong</u> position 14 miles from here. The Generals are
     both perfect gentlemen. I am employed making maps of the country &amp; putting down the
     information in reference to the enemy's position, that we obtain from scouts prisoners
     &amp;c. I get 100 dollars a month. I am very desirous to come home for a time, but my
     services cannot be spared now -- as soon as we move I can get off for a time, but I cannot
     afford to lose my place in such hard times as these, when a few month's service will enable me
     to get money enough to keep us comfortable for some time, and I shall certainly spend the
     winter at home teaching a short 3 months or so session -- leaving the army as <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> soon
     as it goes into winter quarters</p>
<p class="p10">Aug 4<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10"> I did not finish yesterday, but I am glad now for I can tell you that I am much better
     &amp; have even worked some at my duties -- the Corps of Engineers goes out on a reconnaissance today &amp; I think I
     shall go along -- get off the Mt. for a couple of days &amp; away from the dull monotony of
     my tent -- the change will fully recuperate me -- It rained all night last night &amp; has
     been raining all day so far -- thunder &amp; lightning, about the 1<sup>st</sup>
     I have heard.</p>
<p class="p10"> I have not time to write more now &amp; I hope you will take the will for the deed.
     &amp; excuse such a looking letter as this. Kiss my children -- I think every day that I
     will write to Nelly &amp; tell her a good many things I hope they are both good girls
     &amp; that they are all the time good natured -- and that they mind their mother -- You do
     not say anything about Tug. I have not heard a word from you since I left Monterey -- do write
     often -- I wrote from Huntersville. Direct to Care of Gen. Loring, Army of the North    West via Huntersville &amp; have it sent via Staunton</p>
<p class="p10"> May a merciful god keep &amp; bless you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate Husband</p>
