<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. T. H. Hall to Thomas
                    P. Jackson, July 20, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Hall writes to Jackson regarding the case of the Methodist Episcopal Church in
                    Staunton, which was under Hall's jurisdiction as Military Commissioner. He also
                    refers to such duties as "arduous".</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Mr. Jackson
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 20th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Woodstock, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I am truly sorry that I did not see you during my short stay in Staunton, that I
                    might confer with you in regard to Military Commissioner affairs, and especially the church matter. I found that William Clark the pastor understood me that you took his
                    papers without authority, but I distinctly said that you were acting under
                    orders that I knew nothing of, but as you had taken charge of them, it was not
                    necessary for me to hear the case. Again he asked why I came into your district,
                    I replied that as you were a civil agent, you could not act as a Military
                    Commissioner.</p>
<p class="p10">I should be only too happy if you would assist me in the arduous duties of Military Commissioner.</p>
<p class="p10">With respect I remain<br>yours &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. T. H. Hall<br>Lieutenant, Veterans' Reserve Corps</i></p>
