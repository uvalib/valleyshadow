<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I have only time to write you a few words -- We had a battle yesterday at Fisher's Hill,
     which resulted quite disastrously from the fact that our men broke &amp; ran &amp; we
     lost some 15 pieces of artillery &amp; a good many small arms &amp; some prisoners --
     but we brought off all our wagons &amp; nearly all of our troops and are now making a stand
     here, the enemy's coming slowly after us -- I hope we may not have to fall back any further,
     but should not be surprised if we came up to Harrisonburg or even to
     Staunton, but movements are on foot too aid us &amp; I think all will soon be well -- Our
     troops behaved badly -- &amp; got into a panic -- Col. Pendleton was mortally wounded, just
     at dark &amp; we had to leave him in <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Woodstock -- I am truly sorry for his young
     wife -- he was one of the best officers in the army &amp; it will be difficult to fill his
     place -- William got scared in the stampede &amp; I have not seen him yet, but hear that he
     went up the road badly "demoralized" Thanks to a Kind Providence I escaped -- my horse was hit
     by the fragments of a shell &amp; one piece struck my hand but did
     no damage -- If William comes home I want him to come back -- I do not want Mr. Geedings to
     sell my horse for less than 15 or $1600 -- Love to all write soon Don't get the "blues" all
     will yet be well -- Don't know of any one you know hurt -- Good bye &amp; God bless you </p>
