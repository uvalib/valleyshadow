<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have a Son who wishes a situation as School Teacher and I thought perhaps you
                    might know of a situation in your region of country that would suit him
                    &amp; that he would suit. He has had some little experience in teaching
                    previous to his going to College. He has just returned from Emory &amp;
                    Henry College &amp; has testimonials as to his standing while at College
                    &amp; also his qualifications.</p>
<p class="p10">He is prepared to teach the usual English branches, Natural Philosophy, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Surveying, Plane
                    &amp; Spherical Trigonometry &amp; Latin.</p>
<p class="p10">If you know of a situation &amp; will let him know of it at your earliest
                    convenience you will confer a favor which will be
                    gladly reciprocated should an opportunity occur.</p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse the liberty I have taken in troubling you with this</p>
<p class="p10">Most Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F. Burns</i></p>
<p class="p10">P. S. Anyone wishing to know
                        the moral character &amp; standing of my son are referred to Captain B. M. Ellis, William Withrow James Irvine, Mr. Fishburn &amp; Mr King. You can
                        address W. H. Burns or myself at Waynesboro<br>Yours ---<br>F. B.</p>
