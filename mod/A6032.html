<p class="p10">April 20<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Camp Randolph</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I will endeavor to write you a few lines once more to let you know how I am getting along. I
     am well at present and hope that this may find you in the enjoyment of good health. We are
     still in our winter <i>[unclear: quarters with no immediate prospect]</i> of a move, except on
     picket which will be next week. Our time at present is pretty well taken up with drills and
     police duty. We have two drills each day and dress parade in the evening<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley5b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley5b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      There is preaching nearly every day or night as it suits. The
     preaching is pretty well attended and pretty good attendance is had during the services. The
     weather for the past week has been very fine but it has gotten colder the last day or two and
      today looks as if we <i>[deleted: we]</i> would have snow I do
     not think there will be much fruit this year especially in the
     part of the country as it has been so cool that I think it would all be killed. Our sharp
     Shooters are now out practicing firing at a target which reminds
     us very much of the commencement of a battle but it is to<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley5c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley5c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     be hoped that we are not to have many more battles to fight as from
     late northern news they are more unsettled now than they have been for some time past. General
     Grant seems to be making great preparation for an active campaign but some persons think it is
     only done for a show; while the real plan is to <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> the first <i>[illeg.]</i> here, and I suppose it true that a good many troops
     are being sent here to <i>[unclear: strengthen]</i> Lee's army. if it is true I think it is
     the policy of our leaders to assume an offensive attitude.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley5d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley5d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      But as we are to have a brigade drill this evening, and the hour is
     about come. I will close by asking you to excuse all mistakes, bad writing, etc.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to aunt Ann, Uncle Jame's family and any one else who may think worthwhile to
     ask for me, </p>
<p class="p10">&amp; also receive a due share yourself from your affectionate nephew</p>
