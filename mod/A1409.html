<p class="p10">January 21<sup>st</sup>1863</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin Ellen</p>
<p class="p10">I spent the last week at the <i>[unclear: farm]</i>, &amp; did not return
                    until Monday evening. This will explain why I did not write to you sooner. </p>
<p class="p10">I have always thought it was your pecuniary interest to have the whole land of
                        M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Cue sold, &amp; I
                    believe that it was the <i>[unclear: course]</i> but calculated to ensure
                    harmony &amp; kind feeling among all parties interested. Nothing but your
                    strong desire to return the <i>[unclear: manni-]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: house]</i> caused me to abandon my position. My opinions however
                    remain unchanged, &amp; were I in your position, I would prefer a sale of
                    the whole. I fear, if you return the home place, you will be harrassed during
                    life, &amp; have a struggle to get on &amp; educate your children. I
                    never thought the home a durable one for you, &amp; were I in your place I
                    would still let it be sold. If it went for a moderate price, you might buy it.
                    if not, let it go, &amp; look elsewhere. Property must fall, &amp; you
                    can do better with this money six months hence. You will find it a troublesome.
                    and in ordinary times, an unprofi <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> table thing to carry on such a
                    farm. It would be better to have a less costly home, &amp; the surplus money
                    in production stocks. You would then be certain of a revenue even in case of a
                    failure of crops. A small farm sufficient to furnish your own supplies, with the
                    balance of your money at interest, would be better in all respects.</p>
<p class="p10">You had better come up on Monday, &amp; qualify as guardian for your
                    children. Come to my office &amp; I will have everything arranged so that you will be detained but a few minutes. you
                    can then go to our home to dinner &amp; return, if necessary, in the
                    evening.</p>
<p class="p10">When you come up, we can talk matters over, more in detail</p>
<p class="p10">I think Colonel Bell had better file a bill &amp;
                    let Judge Thompson settle the matters of the estate both real &amp; personal</p>
<p class="p10">Affectionately yours &amp; c</p>
