<p class="p10">January 13<sup>th</sup> 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your communication of the 22nd inst only reached me today. The O'Toole case
                    occured in the Corporation of Staunton and has I believe been taken up by the
                    town authorities with whom I have no official connection. In the spencer case I
                    had the witnesses summoned and they appeared before the Grand Jury who after
                    hearing the case declined to make a presentment. In the Ford case I saw the
                    complainant and after examining him closely was satisfied that an indictment
                    could not be sustained in the case. I however informed him of the time of the
                    sittings of the Grand Jury and directed him to appear and make his complaint.
                    This he did not do. It is always my course when informed from any respectable
                    source of a violation of law to send the parties and witnesses to the first
                    Grand Jury. If an indictment does <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>not result of course I have no
                    further power in the matter.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully<br>Your Obedient
                        Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>(sgd) James Bumgardner<br>Attorney for the
                        Court</i></p>
