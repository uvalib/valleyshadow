<h4>Augusta: John D. Imboden to John Marshall McCue,
                    February 1, 1881<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Imboden responds with scorn to McCue's suggestion that he put money into a
                    venture to claim $50 million that the Confederacy supposedly stored in Europe.
                    He reminds McCue that the Confederate Government had no money in 1864, and notes
                    that the U.S. Government would no doubt claim the money for itself if such a sum
                    existed. Finally, he suggests that rational businessmen see plenty of economic
                    opportunities in the natural resources of the southern states but would not be
                    interested in searching the "vaults of a defunct, starved out, naked &amp;
                    ragged psuedo nationality."</p>

<p class="p11"><b>State of North Carolina,<br>Senate Chamber
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">February 1<sup>st</sup> 1881.</p>
<p class="p10">Raleigh, North Carolina</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Major,</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 20<sup>th</sup> from New
                    York is to hand, and I reply from here. We are getting some very important
                    legislation here to reach the sea with our coals. Hope to have it all right in a
                    few days.</p>
<p class="p10">Touching your request to join the searching party after supposed Confederate <i>[added: metaphorically]</i> "buried" treasure in Europe, I
                    have simply this to say why I can't <u>possibly</u> even
                    think of it.</p>
<p class="p10">1<sup>
                        <u>st</u>
                    </sup> My entire time, and all my energies and capacity for labor are the
                    property of my Company, by Contract. I have agreed to engage in nothing else of
                    a business nature whatever. This one reason is enough so far as I am concerned.
                    But as you desire me to enlist friends in the scheme to the extent of putting up
                    $10,000, I ought to state further why I can't undertake
                    to do so. My reasons are, First: That I <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> have no faith in the alleged
                    fact that the Confederate
                    government had $50,000,000 - or even $5,000,000 or
                    one million in Europe in money or property when it collapsed. I know of my
                    personal knowledge that Mr. Seddon Secretary of War
                    late in 1864 had neither credit nor money to buy two ship loads of supplies at
                    Liverpool when we were starving &amp; freezing, &amp; in the dead of
                    winter <i>[added: he]</i> shipped 2 cargoes of cotton from
                    Wilmington to buy supplies, &amp; Ben Ficklin got the proceeds, &amp;
                    the Government got nothing. It is all m<i>[added: o]</i>onshine about this $50,000,000. But <u>suppose</u> it <u>possible</u>, do you
                    think that a man who had spent $150,000 of his private fortune to unearth it,
                    has not the credit amongst his <u>own</u> friends to raise a
                    paltry $10,000 more to <u>insure</u> his success? Why John
                    Sherman would put it up. Any gambler in New York would
                    put it up on half a show of winning. But suppose good reasons to exist for
                    applying to <u>you</u> to help in the last moment, do they
                    offer <u>you</u> enough interest in it? I understand Nicholas
                    is to have $500,000. This is only 1 per cent on the $50,000,000. And if you can
                    raise $10,000 <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> you are to have $250,000, which is only 1/2 a per
                    cent, or 50 cents on the $100 <i>[deleted: dollars]</i>. To get the $10,000
                    you would have to give away the larger part of the $250,000.</p>
<p class="p10">Major! Mr Nicholas may be honestly duped in this matter, but the whole thing is
                    so preposterously ridiculous as I view it, that if
                    I had $100,000 idle cash lying in bank to day, I would not give $100 for a half
                    interest <u>in all</u> that will <u>ever</u> be recovered. The war has been over 16 years. The United States
                    Government has pursued the defunct Confederacy like a beadle for the last
                    dime to be found anywhere, at home or abroad, &amp; has taken even private
                    property in some cases, and is grudgingly making restitution. If a stray fund
                    should now be found, it would take years of litigation to establish the Government's claim to it, and then years of diplomacy
                    to get it into the United States treasury, and then
                    more <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> years to get Congress to pass an act to divide the "swag" with
                    the <u>detective</u> who now only wants $10,000. See the
                    course of Congress on the Geneva Award and the Alabama Claims. The Government recovered $15,000,000 from England ostensibly as a guardian
                    &amp; trustee of her <u>loyal</u> Citizens whom Semme's,
                    the hero of the seas despoiled. England paid it over 8 years ago. And the larger
                    part of it remains in the Treasury to day, undisposed of. If there was the
                    possibility of any truth in the story of the $50,000,000 life is too short for
                        <u>you</u> &amp; <u>me</u> to take
                    a hand in its recovery. We might <u>begin</u> it, but the
                    next Centennial will be celebrated before we or our heirs would <u>realize</u> from the venture. With these views, it is
                    unnecessary for me to write to Mr. Nicholas, for under no circumstances could I
                    go into it, nor would I be willing to commend the scheme to any of my matter of
                    fact <u>business</u> men in Pittsburgh, who see <u>money</u> in <u>Coal</u> &amp; <u>Iron</u> in the late Confederate States, but none in the
                        misty vaults of a defunct, starved out, naked
                    &amp; ragged psuedo nationality.</p>
