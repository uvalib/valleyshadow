<p class="p10">March 1, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I sent with pen in hand to inform you that I am well. Hoping that
                    these few lines may find you enjoying good health.</p>
<p class="p10">I was sorry to read in Rachel's letter that you were beginning to think that I
                    was forgetting you. No, No, father, I will never forget you...by the way of
                    writing or in any other way so long as I live.</p>
<p class="p10">I think that you have had too much trouble in raising me to forget you and and in
                    caring for my family while I am engaged in my country's call.</p>
<p class="p10">Since the 14th I have written 4 letters with a letter in 2 of them. I enclose 5
                    dollars in each or rather the 2 letters containing 10 dollars. Yesterday we were
                    mustered again for pay. I look for 26 dollars again in a few days. Then, I will
                        send some more to you.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father, when I do not think of home it appears not time since I am in the
                    Service. We were paid from the 28th of August so, if I
                    think, the time will be recorded from that time and if so, the year will be up
                    at August and the 9 months will be up the 28th of May. These few months will
                    soon roll around so keep in good heart and I further think that till that time
                    this rebellion will be crushed; No doubt it will
                    cost a great many lives.</p>
<p class="p10">We all have our risk to run but thanks to God He is able to provide and protect
                    all those that place their trust in Him.</p>
<p class="p10">We have been under marching orders since Sunday Morning at 1 o'clock. General
                        Kilpatrick is out on a raid feeling the strength of the enemy.</p>
<p class="p10">The 6th Corps is advancing to Gordonsville while we are kept in readiness. We
                        cannot tell how soon we must march.</p>
<p class="p10">A few days ago one of the General Lee's orderly came through the picket lines. He
                    informed our General of the numbers of Lee's Army. He said their number was
                    about 25,000 and further stated that there was a great number went home to reenlist. If this is so, Now is the time for us. If
                    the weather was only favorable we might knock out some of his props for I think
                    that the rebellion is like some old house propped up and I think we will soon knock out some of
                    the main props</p>
<p class="p10">May God speed the day that peace may again be declared and we can all return
                    home.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I must close for the present.</p>
<p class="p10">If you have not sent my watch yet, you need not send it and if you have sent it,
                    it is alright.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I must close for the present and if I have the chance I will write soon
                    again.</p>
<p class="p10">From your son. So farewell, for the present.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
