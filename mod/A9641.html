<h4>Augusta: William Brand to Kate Armentrout, March 4,
                    1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William tells Kate that he believes the Confederates will evacuate Winchester in
                    the near future. He also says that he, along with 35 members of his company, has
                    re-enlisted for the duration of the war, and expresses disappointment that
                    Kate's brother did not do so. He suggests that there will be "excitement in old
                    Augusta" with the approaching Confederate draft.</p>

<p class="p10">March 4th 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camped Near Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I received your much welcomed letter a few days ago and now seat my self to drop you a few lines. My health is very good &amp; hope this may
                    find you enjoying the same blessing. The health of the Company is very good at present. We have
                    evacuated Camp <i>[unclear: Zollicoffer]</i> &amp; camped in a half mile of Winchester. I believe that we are going <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to evacuate Winchester, as they are moving all the Government
                    property back to Strasburg
                    &amp; all the sick are hurried back. It is
                    reported that the Yankees have posession of Martinsburg, Charles town &amp;
                    Berryville but I do not believe it and still hope that we may be ordered back to
                    our cabins before long. The question was asked our
                        Company yesterday, whether we would enlist for the
                    war or not. Thirty five enlisted for the war the remainder <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> say they will stand the draft. I am no longer a volunteer but a regular for the War be it long or
                    short &amp; my prayer is that the God of Nations may keep me as the apple of
                    his eye. I will look to him at all times for he is able to save in the darkest
                    hours of peril. It is an assurance most dear to know that he will not forsake
                    those that put their trust in him. I was very sorry
                    that your Brother did not re-enlist as I would like
                    to have his company as a guide
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> through this tempestuous world of war. I suppose there is a great deal of excitement in old
                    Augusta at this time on account of the draft that is to be made this month. I
                    hope that it may hit some of the speculators &amp; hope I may have the
                    pleasure of getting home on furlough before long. I would like very much to see
                    you. Remember me in your prayers, that I may hold out faithful to the end. Write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your devoted friend</p>
