<p class="p10">Sunday Sept. 22nd, 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Fairfax C.H.</p>
<p class="p10">My Very dear Rate</p>
<p class="p10">I promised to write to you when I came back to camp + I will endeavor to do it
                    this evening, as I havent any thing else to do. I havent felt a bit like writing
                    letters since I came back. I havent written but 4 since I saw you - I got back
                    safe, though I had a heap of trouble with the things I
                    brought down. I had 1500 <i>[unclear: lb]</i> for different ones in the company + it is no little trouble to take care of <u>so many things</u>. I found the boys generaly well at
                    their encampment near Centreville. We left there last Monday + we are <u>now 3/4 mile</u> from Fairfax Court House. Our encampment here is a very pretty as well as convenient
                    one, but I can't like it myself, but there is no place on this side of the Blue
                    Ridge that I do like. It is a beautiful country here, but somehow or other it
                    hasn't the charms for one that the mountains + hills of Western Virginia has.</p>
<p class="p10">
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> There is a fight going on down at Alexandria this evening. The
                    canons have been firing ever since I commenced this letter. Boom after boom of
                    the heavy old guns strikes upon my ear - it stirs up my soul + makes me feel
                    like going to the aid of my fellow soldiers. There is canonading going on most
                    half the time across the line between the two armies, though there is not much
                    mischief done by it. I am looking for one of these skirmishes to bring on a
                    general engagement + I hope how soon it may. It will never be ended except by
                    fighting + the sooner we do it the better. I despise inaction, I want to be
                    doing something, something that my mind or hands can be employed at. Some people
                    accuse me of laziness but I'll venture the assertion that there is not one in
                    Beauregards army that despises this thing of doing nothing worse than I do. I
                    love something that employs my mind + energies. This dismal routine of drilling
                    at little going on guard occasionally + <u>cooking</u> day after day + week after week just kills
                    one. </p>
<p class="p10">
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>The army is still increasing here. I have no idea how many are
                    between the Junction Alexandria now now. Not many less than 200,000 I suppose.
                    Nothing is to be seen but soldiers, wagons;
                    encampments &amp; military bustle and confusion, nothing to change the
                    monotony of the same; from morning till night + from day to day is all the same.
                    How long will it continue so God only knows. Here I am now cut off from my
                    friends and from all that is dear to one from society + enjoyment of every kind.
                    How often I think of the past when I was free as the little birds that sing
                    their songs among the branches. I didn't know how to appreciate home,
                    friendship, society, pleasure or any thing else then but now when I am cut off
                    from all these blessings I can see + feel the need of them. Here I never see the
                    face of a woman.</p>
<p class="p10"> "Ah woman - those whose form + whose soul <br> Are the light + the life of each
                    path we pursue; <br> Whether warmed at the tropic, or chilled at the pole,
                    <br> If woman is there, there is happiness too." <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I have often heard
                    it said that man when taken away from female society will become like a brute, +
                    I am forced by experience to acknowledge it to be true. I believe, too, to take
                    a woman away from the society of men that in a short time she would be no
                    better.</p>
<p class="p10">Well it is night now. I quit writing + eat my supper, + just as I got done eating
                    orders came for us to prepare a days rations + be ready to march by six o'clock
                    tomorrow morning. We are going on picket down in this side of Alexandria. I
                    expect we will have a hot time down there. We have to stay 5 days in sight of
                    the enemy's picket + they are continually firing across at one another. I didn't intend to finish
                    this letter till morning but I wont have time then. John Wade is sick + he asked
                    me this evening to stay here with him. I will stay if the Captain will let one I want to go along with the boys down there but I
                    will do anything for John that I can. Mr Craig is still living, but no better,
                    he is just living + no more. I don't think he can possibly get well if I don't
                    go tomorrow I will write some more if I go I wont
                    have time to write any more for 5 days. Give my love to all. Kiss the children +
                    write to me soon. Direct to Fairfax Station in care of Captain H.J. Williams Company D. 5 regiment Va vol.</p>
<p class="p10">Don't let any body see my letters, if that want to know what is in them read it
                    to them, the part you want them to hear.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours as ever</p>
