<p class="p10">My dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I am at a loss to know why I have not heard from you - since nothing has occurred
                    to disturb our good relations - if there has let me know what it is that I may
                    set myself right in your esteem. I do not know that I should have made the
                    suggestion in disturbance had I not had a dream a few nights ago. (It is an <i>[deleted: ]</i> occupation <i>[unclear: to such reason]</i> + I do not credit
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> that they have any thing in them.) in which I imagine that you
                    charged me with having wronged you_ I pray that it is nothing but a dream.</p>
<p class="p10">I am annoyed by a certain woman concerning her pension claim - have you ever
                    arrived at a point when it will be necessary for her to communicate with you -
                    Let me know - I sent you the matter to make the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> most you could for
                    yourself in compensation - intending the whole pay for you.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you have had a merry Christmas. + that the New Year has opened on you full
                    of good prospect_ I am pressed with business having <i>[illeg.]</i>, I
                        <i>[unclear: fear]</i>. <i>[illeg.]</i> did my office I absented myself at
                    Norfolk. <i>[illeg.]</i>

                    spring - Remember me <i>[unclear: fondly]</i> to all</p>
