<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 16th with the stamps which I'm under many
     obligations to for I will have to bother you again but I want you to
     keep an account of all such things for I will not &amp; as for the box I did not expect on
     account <i>[unclear: themes]</i> on the <i>[illeg.]</i>. Hen we have had a large time here
     lately about rotten beef the Old General has two men appointed to inspect every piece of beef
     that is <i>[unclear: spared]</i> to us now The Cost we got was very good the health of the
     Company is very Good not &amp; I believe the Small Pox has vanished away not to return
     again at least I hope so<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/wilson7.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/wilson7.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     Well Hen I have no news to communicate &amp; know of nothing that would interest there My motto is to write
     short scribbles &amp; receive long ones from my correspondants
     <i>[illeg.]</i> I like to forgot Bell you can tell her that she is
     very afraid of insulting me when she only writes every quarter one
     about as long as her finger I think it is time for to begin to reconsider &amp; to reform
     &amp; do a little better in that way why if I have a quiet place
     &amp; comfortable place as she has I would always a scribble as
      long as my finger &amp; thumbs at least &amp; not to judge me
     by herself but just keep on writing every quarter &amp; I will be happy to read all with
     pleasure. Give Mr. White &amp; Mr. Grady my respects &amp; Bill my requests &amp;c
