<h4>Augusta: William Brand to Kate Armentrout, October
                    4, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William responds to Kate's charge that he is trifling with her by also professing

                    of Washington.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 4th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camped Near Fairfax Court House</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I have taken the present opportunity of <i>[deleted: writing]</i> time, to write you a few lines for
                    the purpose of answering your last letter which I received a few days since. You wrote as if I was
                    trifling with your good nature. I would rather fall in the cause of our country
                    than to blindfold you in any way. You were mistaken in
                    seeing a letter of mine to Miss Hiss as you stated. I recollect well at the last of my letter to her I had.- <u>from your</u> devoted friend and if you don't believe me I only ask you to look at it again none <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    but Sam Fitch knew my motive in writing her that letter
                    it was for his benefit she had lost confidence in
                    him, on account of some lies that had been told on him about her. She wrote to me stating that I was in Sam's
                    presence when he talked about her. She said that if
                    the things were true she was done with Sam for ever. It
                    was all a lie that some of his enemies had
                        <i>[unclear: made]</i> on him, through Sam's
                    persuasion I tried to write a forcible letter for I knew
                    that Sam still loved her. &amp; I am certain that
                    she once loved him. I suppose if she was my devoted lover I would have written
                    to her since which I have never done. Very probably this will <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> be hard to believe
                        but it is even so; your
                    advice is good but in no way. I don't think that I have
                    tried to fool any one &amp; God forbid that I should. I have had <i>[deleted: ]</i> blues ever since I received
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> letter. I used to think that <i>[illeg.]</i> nature was too strong to <i>[illeg.]</i> be subject unto grief but
                    alas it is far from it.</p>
<p class="p10">There are no news of importance to write. Our regiment was on picket last
                    week. I could see the dome of the Capitol in
                    Washington City on masons hill I could see vessels going up and down the Potomac
                    at Alexandria. I could see the Yankee fortifications to the right of Alexandria.
                    I couldn't get to look through <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> the spy
                    glass. Captain said he could see the Yankees working
                    on the breastworks. Captain counted eighteen pieces of
                        cannon on one of their
                    earth work entrenchments. I was the first one to discover after <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    were put on post a large balloon up in the direction of
                    Washington that had climbed a large white oak tree for
                    the purpose of getting a good view of the country there
                    was some shooting every day that we were
                    there; we could hear the Yankee drums beating every night the last two or
                    three days it was very rainy weather. We had plenty of
                        roasting ears while we were at Pagets tavern there was a large field
                    of Yankee corn close. We had to fall back about three miles before our time was
                    out as the Yankees were advancing but I believe it was
                    done to draw them on. Nothing more but remain your affectionately. Write soon</p>
<p class="p10">yours &amp;c,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F.B.</i></p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br>My health is very good &amp; hope this
                        will find you enjoying the same blessing. It is my desire that this letter
                        should be kept secret as it might make enemies
                        someday. Write soon nothing more from your humble
                        friend W.F.B.</p>
