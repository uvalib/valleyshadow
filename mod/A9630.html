<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Kate Armentrout, May 4,
                    1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William tells Kate about friends and family he has seen in camp at Harpers Ferry,
                    and that he and his friends have enlisted "for as long as Virginia has need for
                    us." He estimates that the war will last three or four years.</p>

<p class="p10">May 4th '61</p>
<p class="p10">Harpers Ferry</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">In confusion not as you expect for time is so very
                        precious that I have to hurry about every thing. Yesterday we were all
                    on Maryland heights &amp; had nothing to eat
                    &amp; raining and no shelter but when we came home those that we left had dinner ready for us.
                    Brother arrived safely yesterday with Thomas Supple but
                    James Supple never will get here for he <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> took
                    sick at Winchester &amp; I expect he will go
                    home, very likely it is good policy in him for I know that he would be scorned
                    almost to death. I would not be in his place for a
                    fortune or any thing that seems dearer. We all enlisted our services to day as long as Virginia had need for us. I don't think that we will be released before Three or Four
                    years &amp; if that may be the case we all never can come home. John is
                    well, I think he wrote to you all. I am not certain.
                    Abraham sends you his love to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I will have to bring this uninteresting letter to a
                    close, my health is very good &amp; hope that these few lines come to hand you may be enjoying the same blessing. I ask an
                    Interest in your prayers give my love to all the family.</p>
<p class="p10">yours in love purity &amp; fidelity</p>
<p class="p10"><i>William F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS Please excuse all bad writing spelling &amp; composition. Yours &amp;c W.F.B.<br><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>God bless you when the sunset tints Warm the high battlements of
                        heaven As day a fond warm kiss imprints Upon the gentle brow of even Yours
                        &amp;c WFB<br>Mr George W Fitch requested me to send you his love
                        &amp; at the same time not knowing who I was
                        writing to &amp; says he will write before
                        long. Good bye.</p>
