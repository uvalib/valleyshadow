                <p>Stuart laments the current political situation where "it is almost impossible for

                <p>I remained today, in hopes of witnessing the end of the disgraceful &amp;
                    alarming scenes which have occurred here for the last fornight--I have been
                    disappointed however, &amp; every thing is as much at sea as ever. Indeed I
                    do not see how any organization is to be effected--In addition to the feelings
                    of party which are always so potential, we have now the new element of sectional
                    division, &amp; it is almost impossible for either of the parties now to
                    unite on any man. Thus, Mr. Winthrop can no longer command the entire Whig
                    strength, nor can Mr. Cobb unite the democratic party--The issue cannot be
                    foreseen, &amp; as I am not a prophet, I cannot undertake to predict it. I
                    will be satisfied if they will spare the union.</p>
                <p>I shall leave here in the morning for Richmond, &amp; hope to be at home <hi
                        rend="underline">thursday</hi>, friday or saturday, as circumstances may
                    render convenient--I am quite <hi rend="underline">satisfied</hi> with this
                    place &amp; shall be glad to get off tomorrow. The only regret I have
                    connected with my trip is, that I have not seen <abbr expan="General"
                    >Genl</abbr> Wrightman's family--I made several attempts to find them, &amp;
                    this morning spent half an hour in an ineffectual effort to do so--I had a long
                    chase before I could find <abbr expan="Commodore">Com:</abbr> Skinner's family,
                    but at last did so--They were very glad to see me, &amp; I sat with them an
                    hour, during which Wm S. &amp; Fanny &amp; Miss Whitehead made a
                    thousand <orig reg="inquiries">enquiries</orig> about the Staunton folks
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The commodore lives in very handsome style, near a mile from the capital, on the
                    corner of H &amp; 11th street.</p>
                <p>I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> your letter last night, &amp; felt under
                    great obligations for the news you gave me about all our little matters--I have
                    thought repeatedly of your troubles with your pork &amp;c--I presume at the
                    very moment I write this, you are preparing some sausages for supper, &amp;
                    are congratulating yourself that the lard has been set away to cool.</p>
                <p>I anticipate a great deal of pleasure in spending tomorrow evening in your
                    mothers little parlour talking<pb n="3"/> over matters interesting to us both--I
                    wish you could be with us provided we had a rail-road to Staunton to save you
                    the horrible journey which I anticipate home--Be sure &amp; write to me at
                    Richmond, &amp; if there is any thing you want let me know it, &amp; I
                    will take pleasure in getting it for you.</p>
                <p>I feel very curious to know what you are all about. Is Baldwin trying to improve
                    himself? Do you think he has any honorable ambition to be distinguished above
                    the ordinary herd of men? or will he be content to be a mere cypher?</p>
                <p>Have Augusta &amp; Fanny given up their wicked &amp; unbecoming snarling
                    at each other? Frequently when I awake in the night I think of them, &amp;
                    their want of that mutual kindness &amp; affection in deportment, it
                    distresses me greatly--It would delight you to see how affectionate cousin
                    Elvira's children are to each other, &amp; how respectful to their mother.</p>
                <p>Is Mary learning her lessons well now? Cousin Elly's boy who is but little older
                    reads very well. She must spur up or she will be considered very dull<pb n="4"/>
                    if not a dunce--This would distress me exceedingly--If she <hi rend="underline"
                        >could</hi> not learn I would not think much of it--But as I know she <hi
                        rend="underline">can</hi> if she <hi rend="underline">will</hi>, I will take
                    it very hard if she <hi rend="underline">does not</hi>.</p>
                <p>When I get away from home, &amp; have time for reflection, I think a great
                    deal about the children, &amp; am exceedingly anxious that they should try
                    and qualify themselves to take a respectable position in the world--They have
                    great advantages &amp; opportunities for improvement, &amp; if they
                    neglect them, they will repent it when they get old enough to realize the
                    importance of them--I fear for example that Baldwin cares a great deal more
                    about a becoming coat than becoming deportment--And I know he feels a great deal
                    more anxiety to do what Tom Kinney &amp; some of idle boys think right, than
                    what his father and mother know to be proper--May God bless them all! &amp;
                    you too my dearest wife in the constant prayer of your affectionate husband.</p>
