<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, September 9, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson asks how Collins may be separated from his wife, Hannah. [In this letter,
                    Collins' name is given as Daniel, while in a previous letter, he is referred to
                    as David]. McDonnell's endorsement states that the only way to be legally
                    separated is for Collins to file for divorce.</p>

<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to ask instructions on behalf of Daniel Collins (colored) as to what will be his proper course in
                    relation to his wife Hannah Collins (colored) reported by
                    your endorsement August 31 on my communication of August 28/67 as living with George W. Grey at Winchester
                    as his wife.</p>
<p class="p10">Daniel Collins and Hannah Reed (Collins) are Registered in Augusta County as husband and wife (No 632) and Daniel states
                    Hannah has certificate.</p>
<p class="p10">Daniel wants of course to be clear from Hannah and I respectfully ask if erasure
                    from Register with statement of facts will be sufficient or if he must apply to
                    the Court for relief &amp; divorce. His means are limited for the latter.</p>
