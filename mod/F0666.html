<p class="p10">Camp Near Falmouth Va. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father </p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter but had neither time nor of opportunity to answer it sooner. As you have no doubt heard the Army
                    of the Potomac has fought another great battle. We left our camp on Monday the
                        27<sup>th</sup>
                    <i>[unclear: ult]</i> &amp; marched up the river about 25 miles where we
                    crossed &amp; then marched on to the rapidan river which We reached Wednesday evening the pontoon train passed <i>[deleted: on before our corps]</i> on did not lay a bridge for us
                    consequently we had to wade it, the water up to our middles &amp; so swift
                    we could hardly keep our feet moved down to Chancellorsville I took up position our corps commenced the battle the
                    first fighting began on the 1<sup>st</sup> but our division was not engaged until Sunday morning when
                    the battle opened most <i>[unclear: furious]</i> our brigade was ordered to
                    support another then ahead &amp; advancing into the woods when it<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    came near the enemies lines. They fired a few shots &amp; then fell back
                    &amp; left us to stand it our selves we were engaged about
                    <i>[unclear: 2]</i> hours the ammunition began to
                    run out &amp; there was neither support nor relief coming so we had to fall
                    back &amp; they followed us yelling like indians. I fired 30 rounds some
                    fired more but my gun was so hot I was afraid to load any faster</p>
<p class="p10">We lost one killed, Nick Trout, Bro of lieut Wounded William Starliper dangerously in the leg. Luther Zimmerman in the arm. James McConnell in the leg. William McDowell in the head, severely. Thomas C.
                    Metcalf in the back of the head. Bryson Bruce in leg &amp; amp;hand. J. O.
                    Parker finger shot off George Cole in the hand &amp; <i>[unclear: Doug]</i>
                    Coyle from a spent ball in the shoulder. he is still with us were all slightly
                    wounded Starlipers is the only one very dangerous. Although McConnell, McDowell
                    &amp; Zimmerman are very severe wounds. We got home late on the evening of
                    the tenth day, yesterday, tired and worn out. it rained a great deal &amp;
                    the roads were in an awful condition. The result is a
                    failure so<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> far as I can hear though we had the fight behind Fredericksburg &amp; did not take measures to
                    hold them. I don't know who commanded the force which
                    crossed there. We may be home before this reaches you. We hope to leave this
                    tomorrow but are not sure but they will try to keep us a few days longer. it is
                    uncertain about leaving tomorrow. Co. C<sup>s</sup> time is up on the
                    evening of the 8<sup>th</sup> Jacob &amp; I are in our usual
                    health, only a little stiff &amp; sore from the fatigue &amp; exposure
                    it rained most every other day I lost my knapsack in the fight &amp; had
                    nothing to sleep in but the clothes I had on &amp; a piece of tent excuse
                    this poor letter as I lost my writing material. as I have just come from the
                    battle field you need not fear that I will enlist again. there was five days
                    fighting. We were all disappointed in Seigles dutch 11<sup>th</sup>
                    Corps they did not stand up to the work well<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Our Brigade was
                    complimented by General Meade, for our Bravery. the
                    battle will probably be called the Battle of Chancellorsville. there was a battle going on at Fredericksburg at the same time our men drove
                    them from the heights but they returned with
                    overwhelming force &amp; retook them.</p>
<p class="p10">You have no doubt heard from the papers more correctly than I can tell you as
