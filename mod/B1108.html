<p class="p10">July 15 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Rock Spring</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">At a meeting of the citizens of the county on the last court day they passed a
                    resolution that no one should hire the servant of another without the written
                    permission of his master and as I had done so on the verbal statement of your
                    servant that such permission had been granted but without having any written
                        <i>[added: permission]</i> from you I at the request of
                    the Boy write that he may get your consent to hire to me <u>if
                        you dont want him</u> yourself. I have a great deal of work to be done and
                    am in very great need of a hand being myself very weak handed. The neighbors are
                    very much down on me for hiring him under the circumstances but I assure you I
                    did it in good faith not intending anything wrong towards anyone.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully Your Friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>L. P. Dangerfield</i></p>
