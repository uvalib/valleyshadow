<p class="p10">Oct. 29<sup>th</sup> 1863<br>To Miss
                        Eveline Hamer </p>
<p class="p10">RomneyVirginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">I take the present opportunity to drop a few lines to you in answer to your much
                    esteemed letter of the 21<sup>st</sup> inst. which came to hand a few
                    days ago, - The very day of the date of my last to Mary Ann. Your letter was a
                        very pleasing one for it was well <i>[deleted: began]</i> begun, timely, and well finished, and better written than this
                    by a long shot! You complain of bad pen, but if you can find a worse one than
                    this I'll then give up.</p>
<p class="p10">I am much pleased to hear that your ring pleases you so well and suits the right
                    finger, - I hope mother's will please her the same, and till this letter reach
                    you, she maybe at home and enjoying it.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to know that you are getting tombstones
                    for Samuel <i>[unclear: to mark]</i> the hero's resting place and think it
                    sacred. Plant roses and sweet scenting flowers on his
                        tomb
                    <i>[deleted: as]</i> for mementoes of him, Although he is with us no    more, we will still retain his remembrance.</p>
<p class="p10">You wondered how I'll <i>[deleted: got]</i> get my socks. I don't know. Better
                    keep them till you get a good chance to send them. I don't <i>[deleted: kneed]</i> need <i>[unclear: 
                        mittens
                    ]</i> I have my old ones yet.</p>
<p class="p10">You wonder why I don't write to M. E. Allison. <i>[unclear: 
                        Don't
                    ]</i> write to girls anymore. </p>
<p class="p10">I don't expect to get <i>[added: home]</i> till I am mustered
                    out of service and you know that is a very long time. Then, if God spares my
                    life and health I will come home and stay awhile with you. If the war is not
                    over, <i>[deleted: then]</i> till that time I will go again. I will then go
                    in the vet<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>eran corps. In fact I would have
                    enlisted long- ago in the veteran corps but I knew if I would mother would
                        <i>[unclear: scold]</i>. Well as long as the war lasts I think that I
                    cannot get better employment than to fight the minions wickedness under the
                    command of Jeff Davis.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not been very well these last few days. I have a diarrhea with slight headache but nevertheless I have done my share
                    of picketing. hope to better tomorrow.</p>
<p class="p10">I must now thank Thomas for his little <u>memento</u> and then
                    close for this time and get supper.</p>
<p class="p10">I forgot to tell you that I only got one letter from any girl since <i>[deleted: ]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: west]</i> (Clara) and Mary E. Allison did not answer my last.</p>
<p class="p10">Hope this letter may find you all well. Remember me to father, mother, brothers
                    and sisters.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your affectionate brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Hamer </i></p>
<p class="p10">Answer soon. I'll try and have a better pen the next time
                        I write Eveline Hamer 
                    </p>
