<p class="p10">Dear WifeDear brother and sister</p>
<p class="p10">I have <i>[illeg.]</i> your most affectionate letter. I will send you a few more lines to
     let you know that I got it. I had wrote a letter and sealed it up and I tore it open again.
     Dear wife I was glad to hear from you. You don't know how much good it done me when I got it. I
     received it with....</p>
<p class="p10">I have an opportunity to send you a few lines to let you know that I am well at present, and
     I hope these few lines may find you all enjoying the same state of health. As I have an
     opportunity to send you a few lines in with H. H. Dedrick letter I thought I would do so, as I
     have sent two or three to my wife and I have got no answer yet I thought I would try it in his
     and see what is the matter. Give my love to aunt Rebecca and Amanda and all of my inquiring
     friends. We have good preaching here and prayer meeting regular. As it is getting dark I have
     to close my few lines and so nothing more at present but remember your affectionate brother
     until death</p>
<p class="p10">Hiram Coyner to brother and sister. I want you to write to me</p>
