<p class="p10">February 20<sup>th</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Ewell</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">I hasten to answer yours which came to hand this evening I was glad to hear from you as I always am
     glad to hear that you were
     enjoying health for that <i>[illeg.]</i> the greatest blessing
      we can enjoy
     here for which
     we are often too forgetful to thank him from
     home we
     receive
     every blessing, I thank God that I am as well as I am my health is
     about like it has been for some time the most I suffer is from weakness my appetite is good enough I have been working a little today we are building breastworks
     we do not work very hard particularly myself I know how to play off on them pretty well. So I do not do much, well I
     have just finished eating dinner had beans and bacon for dinner today, beans are<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Something that are very useful in camp it takes less
     bread when we have them, wee had some today like those white beens you
     have, George Cook got them in his box they are the best been I ever <i>[unclear: 
      ate
     ]</i> if you have any then <i>[illeg.]</i> you send me any thing send some of them if you wish you can send any time if you can get it to staunton there is a regular Agent to tend to it he comes
     through every week though I do   not want you
     to have to go to Staunton a purpose for one box if you have a chance
     to send it with somebody that is going send it to Bell's office or if you choose send with Baylor
     if he comes but do   not do it if it does not
      suit you the reason I say so is because I
      know what a trouble it is, the best things
     you can send is flour Potatoes beans and a little meat<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Well Giney this is a beautiful day here
     the sun shines so pleasant
     It makes me feel like plowing but there is no use talking, it looks like
     as if that sort of business must be given up
     for something else. Well I must tell you that I had the pleasure of hearing the Rev. Mr Junkins preach yesterday he is here on a visit he is the preacher at New Providence Church preached a good
      sermon
     here yesterday he is a smart man, I would like to see Mr Shirey here and hear him preach I think he mightvisit this camp and preach a few times for us
     there is more people here to preach to than there is at home but I am
     sorry to say many of them are very careless about such things it seems
     as if God is not in all their thoughts<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Giney you wished me
     to have a testament that is something that I have wished for ever
     since I have been in the army and I must tell you that since I commenced
      writing I have gotten a brand new one <i>[illeg.]</i> have been
     writing the Chaplin of our Regiment sent me one for which I thank him kindly. I shall read the chapter you recommend before I close my eyes if nothing happens, well Giney I must
     soon stop for the present hoping this may find you all well praying
     the lord to take care of us all, write soon the next time you write enclose ten Dollars in the letter if you have it to spare as I have
      loaned some of the boys some money and may need some before they are
     payed off</p>
<p class="p10">so nothing more but remain your affectionate</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.P.Dull</i></p>
