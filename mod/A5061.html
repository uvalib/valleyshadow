<h4>Augusta County: Martha L. Roadcap to a Friend, April
                    11, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>The friend to whom Martha Roadcap writes is probably Mary Baylor, who will later
                    marry her son, Charles McGuffin. In the letter Martha speaks of her
                    disappointment with the defeat and dreads being "overrun by the vandal foe." She
                    writes that she will save all the information from the Heists about her son
                    John's death, for Charles to read when he returns.</p>

<p class="p10">April 11th/65</p>
<p class="p10">At Home</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">It is with a troubled mind I now seat myself to pen you few lines horrible
                    thought that we are likely to be overrun by the vandal foe what a sad trial to
                    our brave men who have fought so vigorously for nearly four years now to think
                    that all is to be lost but yet I can hardly give up to it nothing but distress
                    prevails now throughout our land hearts are breaking to know the fate of loved
                    friends what has been the fate of your neighborhood boys who are safe &amp;
                    who are lost where is your dear brother I hope he is safe I have not heard a
                    word from my Charlie since you wrote until a few days ago I heard through a
                    letter from one of our neighborhood boys who saw him before the fight he was
                    well at that time but should he happen to get home as you will be sure to see
                    him before I will you must press him to come to see me immediately be <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> sure and find him - I received a letter this week from Mr. Heist it was
                    written from Staunton concerning Johnnies death he has not been home since the
                    sad occurrence but saw a lady who succeeded in obtaining a passport from General
                    Sheridan to pass his lines he was mortally wounded a short distance from the
                    town the ball penetrating his head just back of his ear he requested his friends
                    to have him removed to the Heists house which was accordingly done but before
                    they <i>[illeg.]</i> his house with him he expired &amp; was interred in
                    his lot in the Winchester cemetery he thinks the death of Johnnie's death has
                    been productive of a change of heart in his son in whom he couseled a reform which his death has caused him to remember
                    &amp; also to practice for which he seems to be very thoughtful indeed - he
                    says his daughter will write to me the full particulars as soon as the way <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>is open I will keep the letters for Charlies perusal you will have to
                    excuse this short letter this time as I feel so unfit for writing but will try
                    and write again when I become more composed give my love to all the family
                    &amp; write to me soon Allie sends love to you</p>
<p class="p10">as ever your devoted Friend</p>
