<p class="p10">Your communication concerning Robert Napper (colored)
                    &amp; Richard Vaughn (colored) was received late
                    last evening. On last Thursday I met the above mentioned freedmen on the Valley
                    Pike &amp; they told me they wanted work. I told them I had about two dozen
                    stumps I wanted dug up &amp; would give the customary price (ten cents a
                    stump) or fifty cents a day when they finished the job. They agreed to take the
                    job at fifty cents a day to be paid when the job <u>was</u>
                    <u>finished</u>. They commenced work &amp; continued to
                    work for one day &amp; a half getting all of the stumps <i>[added: up]</i> but about eight which would have taken a little over
                    a half day. They then came over &amp; told me they would work no longer
                    &amp; demanded their pay. I told them if they would return &amp; finish
                    as agreed upon I would willingly settle with them. <u>That</u> they refused to do. Richard Vaughn said he was sick &amp; could
                    not work whereupon I paid him a part of his wages (65 cents) &amp; told him
                    when the rest of the work <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>was done the remainder would be paid. As to
                    Robert Napper, he gave no reason whatever for not fulfilling his part of the
                    contract consequently I paid him nothing. Now sir I think you will agree with me
                    that the said men are not entitled to their pay until they perform the labor
                    agreed upon. In regards to digging the <u>stumps</u>, which
                    are old locust &amp; consequently not particularly difficult to get up I
                    helped myself a great part of the time they were at work &amp; assisted in
                    getting up at least half of those that were gotten up. I suppose you know
                    nothing of me. I will refer you to any &amp; every gentleman in Staunton in
                    regards to my character &amp;c &amp;c. Hoping that you will sustain me
                    in what I have done </p>
<p class="p10">I remain Sir <br>yours &amp;c</p>
