<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to Elemina
                    Rosenbery, February 21, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery thanks home for a package of food and happily describes his sausage
                    dinner; he also notes that it made him homesick. He discusses the weather and
                    mentions that he still awaits his repaired watch. To close, Rosenbery vows to
                    meet his family in heaven if he does not survive the war.</p>

<p class="p10">February 21, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Kind Mother-</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself to inform you that I received the express box yesterday for which I was very thankful.</p>
<p class="p10">Only the pickle of the kraut has run out fo the crock
                    and made the cakes taste of the pickle.</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday evening when the box came. I took it in hand to have a mess of sausage
                    for supper. Well, when I got ready for cooking them I felt as though I had
                    forgotten how to cook them or else never knew how.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I made up my mind if I could not cook them I would eat them raw-So I took
                    my pan-put some water in and put my sausages in the pan. Set it on the fire. I
                    boiled the water up. Then took to frying the chops.
                    Well, I fried them awhile-Then I made up my mind that
                    they were done-not having any dinner you better think that Frank had a good
                    appetite for supper. Well, my sausages and apple butter and cakes made me think of home.</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 17th came to hand containing the receipt. But I had my supper
                    out of the box before the letter came.</p>
<p class="p10">The shoe pegs them I can do without. If I only get my watch.</p>
<p class="p10">The other day I sent father five dollars and in this letter I will send him five
                    more. When the money gets home, Let me know. If you please.</p>
<p class="p10">I sent my likeness to Rachel. I have another one taken that cost me nothing I
                    made the artist 2 small benches. I will tell Rachel if she gets both. She can
                    give one to you. Then the family or rather parents, brothers and sisters can see
                    me once more.</p>
<p class="p10">I am not quite as dark as the picture makes me. Well, I was very glad to hear
                    that you were all well.</p>
<p class="p10">And about the cold weather I thought it awful cold for the last week back. But
                    today it is very pleasant again.</p>
<p class="p10">I am well at this time-hoping that these few lines may
                    find you all enjoying good health.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Father when he sends my watch to send me a good
                    watch key along.</p>
<p class="p10">I have nothing particular to write at this time. We expect to be paid by the 10th of March again. Then I will send father 20
                    dollars. I can't spare many more at this time.</p>
<p class="p10">You will write as soon as you get this. Give my respects to all inquiring friends. So farewell for this time.</p>
<p class="p10">If I never more see any of you on earth, By the Grace of God I will meet you in
                    heaven-when I die.</p>
<p class="p10">No more at this time but I remain your son.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
<p class="p10">There is yet hopes of us getting home in 9 months.</p>
