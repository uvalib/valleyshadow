<h4>Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris, April
                    9, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Pastor writes that the Governor has replaced many of the higher officers with
                    appointments, hurting troop morale. Tony himself is sick, but only with a cold,
                    and he is on the mend. He writes that he hopes a home guard has been organized
                    to protect the women of Augusta.</p>

<p class="p10">April 9 / 61</p>
<p class="p10">Head Quarters, Harpers Ferry Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10"> I have written to you twice &amp; as yet have received no answer. I have not
                    heard one word direct from home yet. I imagine some have been sent, but owing to the deranged state
                    of mail affairs I have received none There is more confusion here at this time
                    than has been heretofore. owing to the fact, that our
                    commanders have all been superceded by an appointment from the
                        <i>[unclear: convention]</i> - or rather the Governor which has caused considerable dissatisfaction among the soldiers
                    generally. I wish they would settle matters some way or other, &amp; let us
                    get back home for I can't see any good that we are doing
                    here now. It is thought that all our officers ranking from captains will be
                    superceded by this order of the Governor. General
                    Harman Harper &amp; Colonel Baylor are all in
                    powerful stew about it &amp; I wouldn't be surprised if we all
                        c<i>[unclear: eceede ]</i> &amp; go home<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">I will not trouble you with a long letter from the fact that I have not got time
                    to write a long one, we are in fine spirits. I am unwell myself having caught a
                    cold. but I am considerably better this morning, &amp; hope that with care I
                    will be all right in <i>[added: a]</i> few days. Give my
                    love to all my friends &amp; tell them, I hope it will not be long before I
                    will have the pleasure of seeing them again. If however the fates have decried
                    otherwise I hope to be able to meet them in that better land "where the wicked
                    cease from trouble, &amp; the weary will be forever at rest"</p>
<p class="p10">I see you are all forming home guards for the purpose of protecting our lady
                    friends that are behind. I hope that you all may find protection from the good
                    old citizens of Augusta - write me on the reception of this &amp; <i>[deleted: ]</i> me all the <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; how you are all getting
                    along. the boys bother me so that I can't write so I'll
                    git for the present<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> you <i>[deleted: must]</i> keep all the boys
                    in good spirits. I suppose some of my friends are glad that I am gone, &amp;
                    hope that I may never return - as there are some who have not much love for me.
                    To them I hope you will give my best love.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> Do not let any one see this as you know what
                        will be said. when I have more time I will write you a long letter. till
                        then adieu Tony Pastor<br><br> Direct your letter<br> To the care Captain N. J. Williams<br> Harpers Ferry Virginia</p>
