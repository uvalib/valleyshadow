<p class="p10">Camp Randolphs</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear friend</p>
<p class="p10">I take the present opportunity of answering your letter of the tenth. I was truly
                    glad to hear from you But alas it bore tidings that went like poisoned
                    missiles to my heart I have set down before for the
                    purpose of writing to you; but my heart failed me, And now with a sad heart, I
                    attempt to drop you a few lines, My health is very good, this I sincerely hope
                    may find you enjoying both health and happiness, I
                    have no news of moment; worth your attention so
                    you must look for an uninteresting letter You
                    may well imagine my heart is full <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to over flowing; you ask me if my K
                    -- would prove faithless towards me could I forgive her. Dear Kate you know that
                    I have a forgiving heart If you should learn to love another man better than me;
                    or that you could enjoy your future happiness better
                    with your first lover than with poor
                    Willie I would be heartless not to free you &amp;
                    forgive you; though I could never forget or cease to
                    love you. To harbor such thoughts as I have alluded to
                    above make me feel miserable: To think that my first love should be wrecked or thrown away on one far
                    too good for me, one that is good pure &amp; virtuous who made vows unto me while her first love
                    seemed to be dying away, Then after a long time she
                    again meets him: &amp; her old love is rekindled for him, &amp; she to
                    good and kind to hide it from me has opened her whole
                    heart to me <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>And asks me what she ought to do under such circumstances
                    Dear Kate what kind of an answer can I give but pray Almighty God to help you to
                    prove true to who ever you love; best; I am resigned
                    to the will of providence Dear Kate if you should ever learn to forget me I pray
                    thee to never boast of having fooled me; thereby
                    adding pain to a true but wounded heart, if you should
                        cease to love I would have nothing to live for in
                    this world; I don't see that I should desire to live out
                    this war But would be willing to throw my self in
                    danger of the missiles of death that I might quit this
                    frail world &amp; be at rest I will change this; to
                    me; painful subject. I hope that you are happy and
                    are trying to interest your kind &amp; docile
                    Brother that is now with you. I hope he may enjoy every
                    hour <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> of his short stay at home. I was on picket when he started for
                    home; Brother John is at home on furlough poor fellow was very sick when he left
                    camp I went as far as Orange with him. I have had to haul him there in a ambulance I have never heard from
                    him but hope he arrived safely at home, No doubt he
                    will pay you all a visit before returning to camp, oh yes you said that in
                    fifteen days that Lizzie was going to leave home you left me to guess for what
                    purpose I supposed that she is going to get married if so I would like very much
                    to be at home &amp; see her name changed my kindest regards to L --
                    &amp; tell her that I wish her much happiness
                    through all the changes of this life My respects to
                    all enquiring friends if there be any I had a very
                    strange dream the other night I dreamt that me
                    &amp; you had fallen out &amp; Rachel Crobarger was interceding for me, I must close you must write
                    soon &amp; a long letter give me all the particulars
                    concerning L nothing more</p>
<p class="p10">But remain yours truly as ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.</i></p>
<p class="p10">You will please never show this to any one</p>
