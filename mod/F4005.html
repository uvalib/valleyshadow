<p class="p10">July 25</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have of course many applications for interference with appointments. Some are
                        <i>[unclear: meritous]</i> and I shall lay such before you.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>J. J. Creigh</u> of West Chester who was
                    <i>[unclear: used]</i> at one time for rotary has been in the Reserves Company A 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Regiment. Colonel Roberts and
                    would be a first class man to be commissioned as a Lieutenant or Captain. He is a son of Reverend
                    Dr Creigh of this County and Educated and excellent <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>man. I have
                        <i>[unclear: matters]</i> him that his Colonel or
                    Captain must ask his appointment. If so, let it be done.</p>
<p class="p10">In the formation of the new levy I will under no circumstances,
                    <i>[unclear: fair]</i> the appointment of any man except upon the ground of
                    fitness &amp; merit.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Surgeon A W Green</u>. 7th Regiment
                    Pennsylvania Reserves, is broken down and is
                        <i>[unclear: deserving]</i> of being relieved for a while to examine
                    recruits at Harrisburg until he recovers his <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>health a little. He is
                    one of the first young physicians of Germantown and if it can be done. He is a
                    very valuable man.</p>
<p class="p10">I see that they have at last come to their senses at Washington and concluded
                    after three weeks of hesitation, to take 9 &amp; 12 <i>[illeg.]</i> men
                    &amp; fill up the army. Let us be thankful that they did not wait a month
                    longer and defeat recruiting as they did before.</p>
<p class="p10">The General has struck the right chord. His proc <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>lamation will be promptly <i>[unclear: ]</i>
                    too. He is the only executive who has <i>[illeg.]</i> to
                    them himself upon the people for men &amp; money. It will be a proud chapter
                    in his history.</p>
<p class="p10">I take the <i>[unclear: stump]</i> to <i>[unclear: ]</i> enemy &amp; will not sit
                    down to rest until our quota is full to the last man. I do hope that you will
                    tender Captain McKibbin the Command of a Regiment
                    here. It would be very acceptable, and there is no better man <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: large]</i>. I am satisfied he could be <i>[unclear: svt]</i>. He
                    is at the Merchants Hotel, Philadelphia</p>
<p class="p10">Truly Thine</p>
