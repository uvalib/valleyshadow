<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, November 1, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How asks that the black community in Staunton be allowed to continue using a room
                    in the Court House for their school. How cites the previous usage of the space,
                    and declares that the School is a much more important enterprise "fraught with
                    untold benefits to loyal freedmen."</p>

                    Headquarters, Sixth District, Virginia
                    Colonel O. Brown<br>Assistant Commissioner<br>Richmond, Virginia
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">November 1st 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to forward herewith a communication just received from the Assistant Superintendent at Staunton, Virginia. I have instructed him to request of Colonel Clay the continued occupation of the rooms in
                    the Court House until the decision at Headquarters of the Department could be made known, and I have respectfully to request that the
                    upper (third) story of the Court House at Staunton may be reserved for the use
                    of the Freedmens School, if it shall be found necessary to restore the other
                    portions of the buildings to the Civil Authorities for their exclusive use.</p>
<p class="p10">When I used the same rooms as offices in August and September last, I was
                    personally cognizant of the fact that there was no desire for their use by the
                    Civil Authorities, and that Colonel Clay gave
                    unrestricted use of the portions occupied by him whenever desired for the
                    purposes of the Civil Authorities.</p>
<p class="p10">The <i>[unclear: wings]</i> of the building were at that time solely used by
                    such authorities and the Central portion in question, if vacated by the Military
                    Authorities would under ordinary circumstances seldom be occupied by the Civil
                    Authorities oftener than once in the week, and for a part of that day.</p>
<p class="p10">I am also aware that there is not another building in Staunton which can be used
                    for that School <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and I respectfully protest against the destruction of
                    an enterprise fraught with untold benefits to loyal freedmen, as distinguished
                    from the <i>[unclear: converts]</i> to amnesty who now want possession of these
                    rooms because they are used for that School.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, Colonel &amp;c</p>
