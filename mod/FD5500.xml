            <p>A fine day. The <abbr expan="rebels">rebs</abbr> are coming again. J. Landis got me
              to take his horses down the valley this morning. Went to Landis's, and from there I
              went on a scout to hunt up Ben &amp; James Warner. Could not find them. About 2
              o'clock I got back to Shippensburg. The excitement was very great, so I went to
              Landis's and took my horses to the mountain below Newburg and <orig reg="stayed"
