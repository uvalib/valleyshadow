                <p>I reached here at noon today, and was sent for as soon as I entered the Senate to
                    have an interview with Judge <unclear>Snett</unclear>. He informed me that he
                    has heard the friends of Cameron here, &amp; he now wished to hear his
                    opponents. I told him that I had but a single sentence to add to what I had
                    already given to Mr Lincoln himself: and that was, that Mr Lincoln has now
                    ceased to have the right to appoint Mr Cameron; that it could be excused on no
                    pretext whatever, inasmuch as the whole leading political combination of the
                    State had recommended you, while but a faction had recommended Cameron,
                    &amp; even they had aban- <pb n="2"/>doned him, &amp; joined in pressing
                    you. He expressed great <hi rend="underline">amazement</hi> at the information,
                        <orig reg="although">altho</orig> he admitted that he had seen Cameron just
                    before leaving Washington. He said that Cameron was <hi rend="underline"
                        >positively averse to the appointment of any one but himself from <abbr
                            expan="Pennsylvania">Penna</abbr>,</hi> &amp;
                    <unclear>Snett</unclear> added that if we did not accede to Cameron we would be
                    without a representative &amp; that Chase, would have the Treasury. He is
                    thoroughly in the Cameron interest, and exhausted himself while here to frighten
                    us by the danger of an unsound Tariff man in the Treasury. The Chester and
                        <unclear>Delepeare</unclear> members were present at the time; and we all
                    told him that come what may, the appointment <pb n="3"/> of Cameron would not be
                    assented to.</p>

                <p>Curtin had an interview with him also, and demeaned himself nobly. He told him
                    that there was but one way to escape the threatened danger to the <abbr
                        expan="National">Nat</abbr> Administration, &amp; that was to appoint
                    you. It is very clear, however, that <unclear>Snett</unclear> goes home <hi
                        rend="underline">averse</hi> to you.</p>

                <p><unclear>Heistand</unclear> showed me your letter <orig reg="today"
                    >to-day</orig>. He is very much exercised about it: but <orig reg="won't"
                    >wont</orig> lead, &amp; I fear <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> join, He must
                    either join or refuse tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Moorhead has gone to Springfield, &amp; you may notice that Weed started at
                    the same time from Albany. There is mani- <pb n="4"/>festly a death-struggle on
                    the part of the Seward men to save Cameron.</p>

                <p>Curtin has gone home to bury his mother-in-law. Slifer will write <orig
                        reg="tomorrow">to. morrow</orig>, but in <orig reg="Curtin's">Curtins</orig>
                    absence the <abbr expan="Attorney">Atty</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> cannot be managed. He had an interview with
                    Curtin <orig reg="today">to-day</orig> to convince him that he should <hi
                        rend="underline">now join in recommending Cameron!</hi>
                    <orig reg="General">Gen</orig> Poner brought word from Washington that <orig
                        reg="Curtin's">Curtins</orig> assent only was wanted now to put Cameron in.
                    May he live till gets it!</p>

                <p>We will now throw all the force we can on to Lincoln: but the legislature is
                    fearfully for Cameron. Write me daily the aspect of matters</p>
