<p class="p10">I received your letter last thursday was glad to hear
                    that you were well, but was sorry that your papers were
                    lost maybe they may come up yet. I expect M<sup>r</sup> Black and James will go down
                    tomorrow or next day maybe Henry will <i>[added: go]</i> too he is at home yet dont know how long he may
                    stay. we have had company for several days Eleck went down to Staunton last
                    monday went out to Aunt Sallies the same night for Hattie and some potatoes some Peach blow and some

                    there except Jinnie and Charlotte. Jinnie went home yesterday will stay some time maybe until Spring. I forgot to say we

                    or Tuesday I wish you may be home to go there the same time. I have been
                    thinking about sending you that barrel or box the first
                        opportunity I thought boxes to soldiers would go free of charge but from what you say
                    they dont. Elec took down apples that Henry got from M<sup>r</sup>
                        M<sup>c</sup>Cormacks he is talking about sending some more down
                    this week. Frank M<sup>c</sup>Nutt <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>will go down to the
                        army
                    some time this week if he dont go
                    down tomorrow I will send you some thing with him Miss Ann R M<sup>c</sup>Nutt was married
                    last thursday to William Steel I forgot to say Elec got
                    those things you sent to Staunton Jinnie had her cloak
                    most made when she left she expected to finish it
                    yesterday evening she expected to stitch it on the sewing machine and wear it to church today I will make mine next week as this is my day to
                    stay at home I wouldn't make this week I didn't have time as we had company Henry hasn't
                    baled
                    much hay the weather has been so
                    could he can hardly bale at all he has about 5 acres of corn together yet the weather has been so that
                    they couldn't work at the corn as it is snowed up
                    the snow is so hard it will take some time for it to melt
                    as it has a crust on it the snow would bare up wagon and Horses yesterday it
                    thawed <i>[deleted: it thawed]</i> a little but is couldy today. it has been good sleighing Henry
                    took the girls to Mrs Strains in the sleigh well I must close this is enough for
                    to be written on sunday I wanted it to go down tomorrow.
