<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I can report a larger school this month than ever before and although twenty have been taken out within a few days for the purpose of making the schools more equal, still new ones have been added every day so that my number continues large with an average of fifty or more.  They are most of them between the ages of six and twelve and have been in school but a few weeks.  They have been making very good progress for the short time they have been under instruction + I hope to get them well started before I leave--if have I must.   The night school continues full notwithstanding the short evenings and all seem as much interested as during the winter months.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly</p>
