                <p>Today the sheriff showed me a writ of "Fi.Fa." directing him to cause to be made
                    from me the <abbr expan="amount">amt.</abbr> of the note for which J. T. Brodt
                    sued me-- I was a good deal surprised -- for I thought we had the matter safely
                    taken care of, and that we could <orig reg="offset">offsett</orig> my note with
                    his. How is it? How came they to get judgement &amp; what is the state of
                    our proceedings <abbr expan="against">agst.</abbr> Brodt. I wish you would,
                    immediately, write to me, <hi rend="underline">fully</hi>, in reference to this,
                    that I may know what to depend on -- &amp; if you will not be over in time
                        <pb n="2"/>to urge the matter to a close I wish you would send over the
                    papers and instruct me in reference to them, directing what to do. If it's
                    "Common law', it's not common sense, that I <abbr expan="should">shd.</abbr> pay
                    him when he is largely my <abbr expan="servant">Ser</abbr>. Harman has never
                    sent any queries to me, and so I have not answered them -- I should suppose that
                    he could be compelled to try the case now -- after waiting so long. I shall
                    apply to Harman for his interrogatories &amp; I wish you would put all the
                    legal machinery to work to bring him up -- I tell you he is hard to head off on
                    anything -- as poor Skinner is finding out to his cost -- worse off the <pb
                        n="3"/>track than on. I shall wait anxiously for a reply.</p>

                <p>We are having glorious weather now -- joyous May. The candidates for M. C. are in
                    motion too -- so life is stirring on all sides -- The contest though is getting
                    too much one sided -- Harris is decidedly gaining ground -- the Dutch blood is
                    getting up for the favorite son of the "Tenth Legion", I should like to see
                    Skinner elected, myself, but I see no chance for him. My school closes, in 4
                    weeks <del hand="h1">here</del>, then, I shall go to <abbr expan="Churchville"
                        >Chur-ville</abbr> and open there, perfectly independent, on the 1<hi
                        rend="underline">st</hi> of next <abbr expan="September">Sept</abbr>.</p>

                <p>If you can do anything for me, from your region, I will be obliged to you. If you
                    come over <pb n="4"/>at any time, we should be glad to see you at Lock Willow
                    Farm.</p>

                <p>I suppose you saw the notice of Bartlett's Marriage, in the Spectator. He is
                    making a decided stir among the Brooklynites as a preacher. They are improving
                    this place in a way that will render it very attractive -- making walks,
                    renovating cabins &amp;c &amp;c -- It will soon be one of the
                    pleasantest places in the <abbr expan="mountains">Mts.</abbr> I had the pleasure
                    of hearing Everett, in Staunton, His address was just what I expected -- from
                    the man &amp; the subject. Of course "Old Augusta" came in for her share of
                    the <unclear>honors</unclear>. My wife joins me in kind regards to you &amp;
                    yours--</p>
