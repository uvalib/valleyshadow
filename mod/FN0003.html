<h4>Franklin County: William Tell Barnitz to the
                    Pennsylvania Daily Telegraph, April 8, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Barnitz tells about a naval expedition that failed when the steamer Thomas
                    Collier ran aground in the Pamlico Sound. The expedition was intended to move
                    troops to reinforce General Foster at Washington, North Carolina.</p>

<p class="p10">April 8, 1863.</p>
<p class="p10">NEWBERN, N.C.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Our Brigade -- Spinola's Keystone -- seems doomed to labors and trials that fall
                    to the lot of but few in this army corps, but a few days intervening between
                    expeditions by sea or land, that are either perilous or most fatiguing, and this
                    is owing to the fact, I am informed, that our term of service expires soon;
                    hence the next three months we will be a brigade <i>mobile</i>
                    indeed. Well, we had returned from our second expedition to Pollocksville, as
                    detailed in my last; had enjoyed the mellow warblings of the spring birds and
                    the soft, balmy sunshine several fine spring mornings; had <i>innocently</i> entertained a notion that several days, perhaps weeks of
                    uninterrupted repose, a delicious season to expend in communing with our loved
                    ones at home, and the newspapers, the two chief sources of pleasure the soldier
                        wants of - when a "solitary horseman" came dashing
                    over the bridge with an envelope half as long as his arm sticking out of his
                    bosom. I say to my Lieutenant, "Sammy, the jig's
                    up!" My neighbor, the Captain, scratches his head, and takes a mouthful of --
                    beard! I command by dark, "Attention, Fry mush and fish immediately!" Things fry
                    through the camp generally. Marching orders! Ten day's rations! Start off at
                    four o'clock, Sunday of <i>course</i>. The sky is filled with
                    dark and lowering clouds. Rain is always accompanied with high winds here. It
                    begins to rain; the storm king begins to bellow furiously, as if maddened by our
                    desecration of the Sabbath. In the rain, in the storm, with gloomy feelings or
                    savage desires to see these betinselled Generals in -- well, an unreasonably
                    uncomfortable quarter for a short time, we slide through the mud to the WHARF.
                    Ah! that will do! A splendid steamer, the Thos. Collier, receives us on her
                    capacious decks; and off she steams, spurning the desceding torrents, the heavy
                    wafts of Notus blowing defiance in her very eyes, and the lowering heavens,
                    thick with portends dire. All went well till we reached the mouth of the Neuse,
                    Where AEolus seems free to involve all his rebellious prisoners at once; and now
                    they seemed to be on a perfect swell. Our good ship heading northward, received
                    the dashing waves tumbling inward from the sea, star-board, which set her to
                    rolling violently. I must here mention, as the <i>proper
                    place</i>, that the Colonel unsealed his orders, and
                    announced that we were to sail for Washington N.C., to re-enforce Gen. Foster.
                    Well, the fury of the storm increased with the approach of night, and the rain
                    poured down with redoubled fury; the rolling of the boat began to affect the men
                    -- Jonah was cast up on every side; sighs and groans and bitter complaining were
                    heard from many a poor fellow. Oh! horrid the feeling! Every roll of the boat is
                    like a fresh pill to a sick man. Utterly reckless you care not whether you live
                    or die, for there is no relief. The sufferers lay stretched on the decks,
                    heedless of orders or duties, knowing only their misery and deploring their sad
                    fate. Little did they reck of the terrors, leaping like sea-waifs just then on
                    the bow of the boat! for in the darkness, in the rain, in the general distress,
                    the ship had unaccountably gotten out of the channel, having drifted several
                    miles seaward, and now behold! the cry is heard the boat's aground! In vain the
                    engineer applies more steam, reverses motion, changes the position of the men,
                    H.H.; hard and fast she sticks <i>amidship</i>, bow and stern
                    rocking! It was nine o'clock, night -- storm increasing and hurling wave after
                    wave upon the doomed vessel. Finding it impossible to dislodge the ship, the
                    Captain commanded our rations to be thrown overboard; barrels of pork, beef,
                    coffee, sugar, vinegar, whisky, their heads driven in, were given to the waves,
                    and thousands of pounds of "Hard Tack," candles, etc., were scattered on the
                    waters, which, day having dawned, we saw ravenously snatched up by the immense
                    flocks of seagulls, gathering in from all quarters, warbling in mockery of our
                    terrible situation. Thirty tons of coal were now cast overboard; the boiler
                    pipes, the last hope, were opened, and all the water, about forty tons, drawn
                    off; and still no relief!</p>
<p class="p10">With every blow of the rapidly striking waves the timbers of the vessel creaked,
                    and gave way, and the flooring of the cabin would raise four inches! Signal guns
                    were fired from the deck; schooners would come in sight, but fearing to approach
                    the treacherous shoals, would sail away again. At noon the Captain declared that
                    if not relieved in eight hours the ship would fall to pieces. The colonel asked
                    for volunteers to attempt a return to Newbern for succor; Lieutenants Stover and Beaver offered themselves. At
                    two o'clock, with the pilot they gave themselves to the waves. With an
                    extemporised sail, the little boat fairly flew before the storm. With what
                    anxiety we watched her as she danced from crest to crest, by times -- scarcely
                    visible through the mist. We had great confidence in the cool bravery of the
                    Lieutenants; and our only hope of escape from the perils environing us being in
                    their success, we never doubted their safe arrival at Newbern. By 9 o'clock,
                    evening, they presented their dispatch at headquarters, having traveled sixty
                    miles in six hours. Meanwhile we lay sick and suffering on the Collier, still
                    rolling and receiving the stoutest blows of Neptune infuriate. Another night of
                    terrors and due apprehensions is passed. Here a few are praying earnestly for
                    deliverance, thinking of Paul's troubles when shipwrecked; there a little band
                    are singing hymns, while others stand and look with unblushed brows, determined
                    to meet their fate like heroes. Amid the howlings of the storm signal guns were
                    still fired and signal lights displayed; all was vain! Toward morning all was
                    still, save the raving elements; each communed with his own thoughts; there was
                    no jollity. Every wave dashing against the ship stirred the very heart's blood,
                    for the ship was expected to break asunder and bestow her living freight to the
                    naiads of the Sound! Morning broke once more; thank God, exclaimed everyone. Oh!
                    how anxiously we looked toward Neuse river for the expected succor! How wearily
                    the hours passed. Night was again approaching. Are they not coming? was asked,
                    oh, how often! Now the storm begins to abate. A sail! is shouted. They are
                    coming at last. She comes on, but oh, she passed by, loaded with soldiers. But
                        <i>there</i>! another comes in view; she stops and receives
                    us! Oh, what a weight of suspense is removed. Now we sail toward our
                    destination. We reach Pamlico river next morning. Arriving within six miles of
                    Washington, we are suddenly brought to by the announcement that the rebs had
                    planted batteries along the shore that would destroy us. We cast anchor. The
                    gunboats are sent for; they arrive next day; attack the batteries without being
                    able to make the least impression. They fear to run the gauntlet; for while
                    floundering about, the rebs erect more batteries in such positions as to
                    thoroughly command the channels. We came home to-day. To-night at one o'clock we
                    start back by land. General Foster is in imminent danger of being taken. If we
                    are not re- enforced at this place soon, farewell to North Carolina.</p>
