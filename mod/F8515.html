<h4>Franklin County: P. Bergstressen to Edward
                    McPherson, December 24, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>P. Bergstressen's letter discusses the rising tensions in Washington over the
                    secession issue but states that he is not as worried about the fate of the
                    Union. </p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Honorable
                        Edward McPherson
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 24th, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Orangeville, Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend,--</p>
<p class="p10"> I have just received &amp; read the Speech of the Honorable Thomas A. R. Nelson which you had the kindness of sending me.
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> much obliged for the favor, &amp; should be happy to
                    receive nine of your documents during the winter. We all hope the House will
                    soon be organized as we are anxious to read the President's Message &amp; the Subsequent acts of Congress. If
                    the Sentiments contained in Mr. Nelson's Speech were adopted &amp; acted
                    upon, the House, no doubt, would soon be enabled to elect a Speaker; but it can
                    be <i>[unclear: easily]</i> Seen where the present difficulty lies. Democracy
                    is now in its last death-Struggle and will soon receive Such a blow from the
                    common <i>[illeg.]</i> of the entire American people as Shall <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    it. So mote it be.</p>
<p class="p10">In regard to the circular you sent me some time ago, I would reply that at
                    present I am unable to pledge any more than what was pledged by me <i>[deleted: ]</i> the Alumni dinner. Hope, however, to be better able in the
                    future to do more for our Alma Mater.</p>
<p class="p10">We are all well at present except Edwin who is somewhat indisposed, but nothing
                    Serious. We are passing along in the Even tenor of our way, and enjoying life as
                    our circumstances allow, and experience little of the agitation which is now
                    felt at Washington. We are not at all alarmed about the Union <u>going down</u>. Having read the Speeches in Congress about
                        <u>
                        dissolution
                    </u> &amp;c., we can sleep very calmly. -- Mrs. B. enjoys good health, but
                    does not feel quite at home in <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <u>Willie</u> has become a great boy--now a year old. All
                    write in Sending our love.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very truly &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>P. Bergstressen</i></p>
