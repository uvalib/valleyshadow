     <salute>Dear Miss Mary,</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I have been absent from camp for nearly two weeks on business for the company and on my
     return yesterday morning found one of your long, interesting letters awaiting me. I do not know
     how you can ever doubt that they are <orig reg="acceptable">acceptible</orig> to me. I may
     sometimes fail to answer in a manner which will show the appreciation of them which I really
     feel but the fault would be in myself did I not appreciate them most highly. I had heard of
     your intelligence and many merits before I ever saw you and though my expectations were high
     they were not at all disappointed when I knew you. I hate flattery above all things and rarely
     compliment any one no matter how much they may deserve it for fear that they may misunderstand
     me, but I think you know me too well to think that I would stoop to flattery and therefore I
     have ventured to express my thoughts so candidly. Please dont misunderstand me. I felt quite
     complimented at your missing a ride on the Lake to write to me and can assure you that your
     letters always prove as acceptable as you could possibly wish them to be.</p>

    <p>I am glad to hear that you think of me and I can assure you that it will often cheer me
     amidst <pb n="2"/> the hardships of the camp. I can never be happy without some <hi
      rend="underline">one</hi> to <orig reg="sympathize">sympathise</orig> with me and care for me,
     some congenial spirit that I can love with an ardor of which less impulsive temperments can
     never conceive. You are very much mistaken about my enjoying myself better here than I would in
     Augusta, that would be impossible; many of the fairest castles which I had built in the air and
     there are few, indeed none over which I mourn so much as I do that my visit to Mount Solon must
     be indefinitely postponed. I really envy Chum the pleasure he enjoys of seeing you even
     occasionally. It must necessarily be so long before I can see you again that perhpas before
     that time some more fortunate one may before that, have secured your heart and what is worse
     because more hopeless have secured your hand. But you are tired and may be even disgusted with
     this <unclear>strain</unclear>. I was at Warrenton among other places last
     <unclear>week</unclear> and as that brought me nearer you I could hardly resist the temptation
     to neglect the business on which I had come and go on to Augusta.</p>

    <p>Do not think from the tone of my letters that I am low spirited, far from it. I made up my
     mind when I joined the army that the only way for me to survive the <unclear>campaine</unclear>
     was to be always lively. I keep busy all the time and do not suffer myself ever to get the
     blues.</p>

    <p>The camp laws are unusually strict now, we cannot pass the sentinals at all without a <pb
      n="3"/> written permit from the Col. One of our men was arrested yesterday within a mile of
     camp by the cavalry and taken to head quarters, so you see we are confined very strictly. Then
     we can't get any thing to read here. You can't imagine how much it delights me to get a long
     sweet letter from some valued friend.</p>

    <p>I hope we will march into Maryland soon. I want to be doing something besides living on stale
     bread and tough meat and drilling all the time; besides we will need winter quarters before
     long and I had rather winter in Washington than in any other place under the sun. I want too to
     get a shot at several renegade southerners I know there; one of them an old class-mate of mine.</p>

    <p>We have plenty of peaches here now but unfortunately can't get any cream. I ate nearly enough
     peaches &amp; cream to kill <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> yesterday moring before leaving home. By the
     way one of the Mississippians died at our house last Sunday from the effects of eating too much
     dinner. I have no fear of being killed in that way. I ate twenty one peaches day before
     yesterday while I was driving three miles. N. B. I hooked them.</p>

    <p>I do not think it selfish to desire the undivided love of one, we are exactly alike in that
     respect; few persons are capable of bestowing such affection as I would <orig reg="prize"
     >prise</orig> and if I could only gain the love on <hi rend="underline">one</hi> I would bestow
     on her such affection as few have ever even imagined. But in these days of dissimulation <pb
      n="4"/> and patience falling in love or rather loving (which is something more substantial) is
     a dangerous step. Such affection bestowed upon a flirt will render the bestower miserable for
     his whole future life.</p>

    <p>How much would I have rejoiced to have been your companion in that boat ride, for though
     inexperienced in nautical affairs, I could have aided perhaps with the strength of my arm and
     then I know with such company I could not but enjoy a boat ride <hi rend="underline">even</hi>
     of <hi rend="underline">infinite</hi> length. I cannot but hope that when this war is past we
     may yet sail on the lake together and freely confide in each other our thougts on the past and
     our plans for the future. But I fear I have already said too much and would try to change the
     subject to some one which might suit your taste more but that the tapping of the drum for
     Battlion drill <unclear>admonishes</unclear> me to close.</p>

    <p>I know you will excuse all the <unclear>many</unclear> imperfections of this hasty epistle
     and write me a long letter very soon; a frank kind letter which will cheer my weary hours with
     many thanks for past kindnesses and as many hopes for like favours in the future. I remain as
     ever, most devotedly and unchangingly,</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>Your <hi rend="underline">truest</hi> friend,</salute>
