                <p>John Coleman asks McCue for advice about Old York, a slave who ran away to
                    Coleman asking for intercession. Coleman's letter indicates that the slave once

                <p>Old York has come to me this morning as a runaway and asks for my intercession in
                    some way in his behalf. He complains of having <abbr expan="received"
                    >recd</abbr> much <orig reg="ill-treatment">illtreatment</orig> at the hands of
                    Mr. Sneed, and appears greatly distressed and <orig reg="dissatisfied"
                        >dissatisfyed</orig>. Among other things he says, he is not regarded at your
                    house as one of your negroes but as belonging to my Fathers estate. Whether
                    there is any truth in what he says I am entirely unable to tell. Permit me to
                    say however as a matter of feeling, that he is an old man, that he was a
                    favorite negro of his old Master, on which account I think as much
                        <unclear>--nity</unclear> ought to be extended to him as the nature of the
                    case will admit barring the question entirely as to whom he may belong, if it is
                    agreeable to you, I am willing that he may stay here upon any terms that may
                    hereafter be considered right and equitable. If you do not approve of this, the
                    negro is here and you can take such steps as you think fit in the matter. <pb
                        n="2"/>I have advised York to return home, He <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> refuses to do
                    so. I have written the above very reluctantly because it was a case in which I
                    was really at a loss what to do. I hope you will not think it an offensive
                    interference in your affairs as nothing is farther from my intention. Let me
                    assure you that all I have said in this matter is in a spirit of friendship and
                        <add hand="h1" place="inline">in</add> accordance with what I believe would
                    be the wishes of our Father on this subject. And who, if he could be permitted
                    to witness the present state of things between us, and the means by which it has
                    been brought about, would deplore it with grief and anguish which would be
                    inconsolable.</p>
