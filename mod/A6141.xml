    <p>i seat my to inform you that I am on the land amongst the live whilst many of my fellow <orig
      reg="soldier">soaldier</orig> has <orig reg="fallen">falen</orig> and <orig reg="gone"
     >gon</orig> never to return. my health is good and I thank my god for it and <orig reg="hoping"
      >hoaping</orig> that this may find you and all of our family, <orig reg="enjoying"
     >injoying</orig> the same blessing and all of our friends and relations. I <orig reg="haven't"
      >havent</orig> heard from any of our relations since the <orig reg="battle">battel</orig>.
     from what i can learn this <orig reg="battle">battel</orig> has been one amongst of the hardest
      <orig reg="battles">battels</orig> that has <orig reg="been">bin</orig> fought yet. we moved
     back to our <orig reg="old">oald</orig> camp last night and we <orig reg="feel">feal</orig>
     like we was at <orig reg="home">hoame</orig> since we <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
     <orig reg="hear">heare</orig> and see the <orig reg="bombshells">bomshells</orig> falling in
     our ranks, <orig reg="although">altho</orig> if i could be in <orig reg="old">oald</orig>
     Augusta o how much better <orig reg="satisfied">satisfyed</orig> I would <orig reg="be">bee</orig>
     <orig reg="where">whare</orig> i could be with you and the children and <orig reg="hear">heare
     </orig>them pratel and i <orig reg="feel">feal</orig> now like if i was at <orig reg="home"
      >hoame</orig> a with you i could talk. well, i <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
     <orig reg="know">no</orig> how much more <orig reg="though">tho</orig> than i can <orig
      reg="write">rite</orig> now. i do pray that we all may soon get <orig reg="home">hoame</orig>.
     i do think that this ought to do for all men to quit <orig reg="fighting">fiting</orig>
     <orig reg="both">boath </orig> north and south east or west and <orig reg="settle">setel</orig>
     it up some other way. <orig reg="fighting">fiting</orig> never will <orig reg="settle"
     >setel</orig> it. we have <orig reg="been">bin</orig> in line of <orig reg="battle"
     >battel</orig> for the last nine days and <orig reg="nights">nites</orig> with orders to be
     ready at a moments warning for we did not <orig reg="know">no</orig> how soon the enemy would
     advance on our lines. we have or had <orig reg="been">bin</orig> exposed to the <orig
      reg="enemies">enemys</orig> cannon all the time but <orig reg="there">their</orig> was <orig
      reg="only">oanly</orig> four killed and seven wounded out of our regiment and i thank god for
     his mercy and i pray that it may be his will not to cut any more down by balls and <orig
      reg="hope">hoap</orig> that he may see fit to stop this <orig reg="terrible">terabel</orig>
     war but o god thine will be <orig reg="done">don</orig>. our <orig reg="division"
     >devision</orig> was left <orig reg="here">heare</orig> to <orig reg="hold">hoald</orig> the
     yanks at Fredericksburg which we did. 20 thousand <orig reg="crossed">crost</orig> over along
     the banks the river but they didn't venture to our fortifications. we was too well fixed for
     them <orig reg="there">their</orig>. we had<pb n="2"/> some 4 or 5 thousand in all. the balance
     of the army marched some 12 miles above <orig reg="here">heare</orig>
     <orig reg="where">wheare</orig> the main body of the <orig reg="yankees">yankeys</orig> army
     was acrossing the river and <orig reg="there's">theirs</orig>
     <orig reg="where">whare</orig> the <orig reg="greatest">gratest</orig>
     <orig reg="slaughter">slauter</orig> was. <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Jackson lost his
     left arm in that <orig reg="fight">fite</orig>. we regret the loss of our general very much but
     pray that god may be with him and protect in time of <orig reg="need">nead</orig> but if god
     spares General Lee <orig reg="i think">ithink</orig> he will lead them yanks <orig reg="where"
      >whare</orig> they <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> like to go. we have taken many prisoners from
     them and killed wounded many. their great General Hooker was wounded with the rest. i <orig
      reg="don't">dont</orig>
     <orig reg="know">no</orig> what the loss is on either side but it is very heavy. that i <orig
      reg="know">no</orig>. i will <orig reg="write">rite</orig> as soon as i can find out the <orig
      reg="particulars">perticlers</orig>. it is thought that the <orig reg="yankees">yankeys</orig>
     is a leaving from their <orig reg="old">oald</orig> position on the other side of the river but
     they <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
     <orig reg="know">no</orig>
     <orig reg="where">whare</orig> they are a going. i dont think they will try this place again
     soon. it <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> pay. i talked with some of the wounded and they are 40
     thousand of them that their time is out may and they <orig reg="won't">wont</orig>
     <orig reg="volunteer">volentear</orig> for no <orig reg="price">prise</orig> nor they <orig
      reg="won't">wont</orig>
     <orig reg="fight">fite</orig> no more. <orig reg="home">hoame</orig> is their place. if all men
     would do that what a joyful time it would be. i <orig reg="hope">hoap</orig> it may come to
     pass soon as i <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> have a chance to send for a day or 2.</p>
