                    I have had quite a few adventures with the fair sex since I have become a

                <p>My very dear friend.-- I know you think my friendship is false, when I neglect
                    you so long; but indeed I had good reasons for my conduct. We soldiers have hard
                    times. To us the luxuries of life are so often denied. To us places as well as
                    life are very uncertain. <unclear>At</unclear> one time there is a feast
                    &amp; at another there is a famine. Never before have I been in such
                    straits. Sometimes without paper and writing material and then without money to
                    pay the postage on my letters you may know that the soldier who has thrown away
                    his all, and staked his all, even to his life, for his country, has nothing now
                    but his sword and his reputation, and that sometimes he must forgo the pleasure
                    of writing to his dearest friends.-- But my ink is out; and there is none on the
                    premises. I must wait till morning &amp;<pb n="2"/>you must excuse my short
                    imperfect letter this time, and I will try and do better next time I have no
                    news from this desolate region. <unclear>Make.</unclear> &amp; Hubert
                        <unclear>Jordan</unclear> &amp; <unclear>O.G. Lianberger</unclear> are
                    all absent I suppose you have heard of the death of
                    <unclear>Lianbr.ger's</unclear> youngest sister of Diphtheria. Give my love to
                    all the family &amp; believe me your everlasting friend &amp; lover,--</p>
