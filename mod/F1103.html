<h4>Augusta County: H. W. Freedley to Maria Hiester,
                    June 11, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Freedley writes about applying for leave and about Union efforts to block
                    Confederate movement into Maryland. He also writes about the cautious army and
                    government policies regarding mail delivery and the granting of leave to
                    officers, all part of the goal of winning the war.</p>

                                <u>th</u>
                        </sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp 3<sup>d</sup>

<p class="p10">Dear Maria</p>
<p class="p10">You cannot imagine how sorry and disappointed I was when I found I could not join
                    you all in Philadelphia I had been refused any leave of absence but had
                    persevered and had been more fortunate in a second application and had a leave
                    of absence for five days. I received this "leave" the <i>[illeg.]</i> evening
                    before leaving Falmouth and should have left<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> for Philadelphia the next morning had the regiment not
                    received an order twelve o'clock that night to leave for the upper Rappahannock
                    at three o'clock. We have been here ever since guarding the Ford to prevent the
                        "rebels" making a raid into my Maryland-and
                    frightening the politicians in Washington. We are under orders again to move and
                    may leave tonight where to or when is not yet
                    divulged.</p>
<p class="p10">Your kind letter of the 6<sup>th</sup>
                    instant was received yesterday. My letters do not
                    reach Washington until the evening of the second day. I fear that many of them
                    are delayed as the mail<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> is frequently detained for prudential
                    reasons. The authorities here are exceedingly cautious, in some particulars,
                    regarding contraband information. Politicians have so much information and
                    influence in this army that many of our best Generals are leaving for other
                    fields and none but the favored few enjoy indulgences or privileges. Old
                    officers in subaltern positions with difficulty procure leave of absence for
                    fear that they will not return preferring lighter service not in the field</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me kindly to your Father &amp; Mother and with the kindest wishes
                    for your health &amp; happiness I<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> am as ever</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H. W. Freedley</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Our position here will not be maintained long and we
                        will either advance or return to the vicinity of Washington.<br> Yours<br>
                            H.W.Freedley<br> Excuse this paper and
                        penmanship<br> I'm in camp.</p>
