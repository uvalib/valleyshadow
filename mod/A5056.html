<p class="p10">Fayette County Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother:</p>
<p class="p10">As I have an opportunity to send you a few lines I embrace the present to let you know how we are getting a long. We
                    are now alone more but our too
                    <i>[unclear: selors]</i> and as regards our health it is not very good neither has it been for some length of time yet we are
                    doing the best we can, and as well as could be expected considering the times
                    and conditions of our country. We have experienced a great many hardships and
                    deprivations here, as you are aware it has been our lot to be placed between the two Armies. Goods are high and getting more so every day and cannot be had at all times. Taking every thing into consideration we have gotten along as well as could be expected and may be better than many
                    other places and do not feel disposed to murmur.</p>
<p class="p10">Rebecca was married in November 1862 to Charles Kincaid and is now living in
                    Greenbrier near Lewis-burg. <i>[unclear: Taplin]</i> Michel (the boy I raised) is now <i>[deleted: is now]</i> in the Southern Army.</p>
<p class="p10">We have not heard from Henderson since the spring the War
                    commenced he was then in Erie County Pennsylvania.
                        whether he is dead or alive we know not We have almost lost hope of ever seeing him again <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I received a letter from John last February and they were all well it is not necessary to
                    give the particulars of his letter as I suppose you have correspondence.</p>
<p class="p10">William and Family and James and Family are all well and sends their best wishes
                    to you all.</p>
<p class="p10">We have had a good deal of dry weather this Summer, in consequence of which corn
                    will be cut short however since it has become more seasonable corn seems to be
                    coming out considerably and if frost will keep off until
                    it makes it self there will be considerable corn raised
                    more I think than were last year, grain was very
                    scarce here last year. Wheat crops this year were not
                        very good hardly an average Crop.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard from any of you since <i>[unclear: Leair]</i> was out I am
                        very anxious to hear from
                    you all to know whether or not you are all alive or not and how you are getting along. I want you to write and give me a general account of my friends
                    and acquaintances who are dead and who are alive direct your letter to Charley Kincaid <i>[deleted: ]</i> I would have been in to see you all long before this time but circumstances forbid it but so soon as I can I am
                    coming if I <i>[unclear: live]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I will now bring my letter to a close Give my love and Polley's to
                    Mother sister Polley and all inquiring friends and accept a due portion for your self and Family.</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more bur remain your Brother until Death</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thomas McGuffin</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Be sure and write soon and tell Mother I want to see
                        her <i>[illeg.]</i> and in <i>[illeg.]</i> go in as soon as circumstances
                        will admit.</p>
