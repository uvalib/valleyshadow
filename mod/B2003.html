<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Samuel Hunt to R. M.
                    Manly, October 12, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Hunt informs Manly that the American Missionary Association will be sending the
                    two teachers requested by Frederick Tukey to Staunton, via Richmond. He also
                    alludes to difficulties the organization is facing, but does not elaborate.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    All money letters, and letters concerning packages of clothing &amp;c should
                    be addressed to W. E. Whiting, 61 John Street, New York<br>American Missionary

<p class="p10">No. 61 John Street,<br>New York</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 4th inst. was duly received, and should perhaps have been answered
                    earlier. But the great uncertainties which have hitherto enveloped our work -
                    rapidly however assuming the form of <u>uncertainties</u>
                    most adverse to the successful prosecution of our work, at least under former
                    auspices, have detained us from advancing, lest out progress should be suddenly
                    arrested by some new "order" or more, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>of the Government.</p>
<p class="p10">In regard however to the call from Staunton, we have concluded to respond, and
                    send the ladies requested by Mr Tukey. Accordingly I shall send for them at the
                    same time I drop this note to you, and another to Mr Tukey. If then I do not
                    receive any orders countermanding your request, I shall dispatch Mrs. Dunn and
                    her sister to Richmond to your care, supposing that, that is the most direct
                    route to Staunton.</p>
<p class="p10">If there are any reasons why we should not forward them to you, please apprise us
                    of the fact by <u>return mail</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sam'l Hunt, for the Secretary</i></p>
