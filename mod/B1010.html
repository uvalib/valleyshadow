<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Frederick S. Tukey to
                    Garrick Mallery, April 1, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Tukey reports that he did not have enough rations to distribute to the poor, and
                    again calls for the Bureau to hire a Physician to care for the sick who are
                    unable to afford medical care.</p>

<p class="p10">
                        Colonel
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit in compliance with Circular Number 6 C.S. 1866 the following report of Bureau Affairs for the month of
                    March 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">The freedpeople are generally getting along very well notwithstanding the unusual
                    severe winter through which they have just passed. The
                    Overseers of the poor have assisted, to my knowledge, 21 cases of suffering
                    among them, and about fifty ($50) Dollars worth of clothing has been distributed
                    by the Bureau. I have had many applications for Rations that I could not supply,
                    simply because I had none. And I would most earnestly recommend that Rations in
                    small amounts be furnished for this Sub-District
                    for the temporary relief of the Aged, Sick, and infirm. Also I would again call
                    your attention to the necessity of providing Medical attendance for extreme cases. Am of the opinion that an allowance of
                    twenty five ($25) Dollars per month to some one of the local Physicians would
                    cover all such cases.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Colonel with much Respect<br>Your
                        Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Frederick S. <u>Tukey</u><br>Assistant
                        Superintendent</i></p>
