<p class="p10">May 24<sup>th</sup>
                            1873</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Cousin Ellen</p>
<p class="p10">I have been requested to write a brief memoir of the Stuart family for
                    publication, but unfortunately I have mislaid the memoranda which I once had,
                    &amp; cannot therefore do it in a satisfactory manner. Can you supply me
                    with the facts from your family record?</p>
<p class="p10">Archibald Stuart, the original ancestor, lived near Londonderry in Ireland,
                    &amp; married Janet Brown, an aunt of James Brown. He became involved in
                    some rebellion, probably that of 1725, &amp; was obliged to fly to America,
                    where he remained for seven years, until some act of amnesty was proclaimed,
                    &amp; he then sent for his family, &amp; about 1738, removed to Augusta,
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> He left three sons Thomas, Benjamin &amp; Alexander
                    &amp; one daughter Eleanor who was your great grandmother</p>
<p class="p10">Give me all the details, &amp; dates &amp; names
                    of descendents, that you can collect</p>
<p class="p10">We are all well except Gussie, who has been in bed, for several days - Susie is
                    with us. She came last Monday, with M<sup>r</sup> Gibson, who went, on Tuesday to
                    Winchester, to attend Council. He will return here on Monday evening - She looks well, &amp; seems very happy -</p>
<p class="p10">We were expecting to see you here this month - Have you determined on your plans
                    for the future?</p>
<p class="p10">All my folk, would join in love, if they knew I was writing =</p>
<p class="p10">Yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart</i></p>
