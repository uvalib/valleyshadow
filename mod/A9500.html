<h4>Augusta County: James M. Schreckhise to G. T. Tifer,

</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Schreckhise letter describes the jubilation over the attack on Fort Sumter, and

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Prof. G. T. Tifer
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 20<sup>th</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Mt. Sidney, Augusta County
                            Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I hereby acknowledge the reception of your letter. I was glad to hear from you
                    &amp; to get the news from South Carolina. There was
                    great excitement here when it was known Fort Sumter was attacked. You say you
                    have excitement in your town but I suppose it is not to be compared with what we
                    have here. There never has been such a time in Virginia. I thought that whilst
                    in Richmond I saw men excited but since then it has reached the acme. The
                    committee sent by the Convention to find out the policy of old Lincoln received
                    no satisfactory answer. Virginia has seceded &amp; I understand it is not to
                    go back to the people &amp; I am glad of it. I do not believe one thousand
                    votes could be obtained in this state to remain in the Union. The military have
                    been called out. My brother left yesterday with his company for Harpers Ferry.
                    For 10 volunteer companies have already left our county &amp; a number are
                    expecting to go in a day or two. The Old Dominion has at length arisen from her
                    slumber to shake off the chains <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>of the abominable abolition tyrant.
                    Old father Abraham has learned that Southern blood doesn't course through cowards' veins &amp;
                    I hope he that the day is not far distant when he will <u>sensibly</u> feel <u>"that somebody is hurt."</u> There
                    seems to be but one determination here and that is to defend even unto death
                    Southern rights &amp; principles. I found my mother still alive but have
                    been looking for her death almost every hour since. She cannot live long so far
                    as we can judge. When I will get back to Newberry I know not. I thought of
                    re-turning immediately but affairs here are in such a condition that I do not
                    like to leave. My brother has gone to the seat of war &amp; my brothers in
                    law expect to leave in a day or two &amp; my father desires me to remain a
                    few days longer if possible. Excuse this badly written letter as I am in a very
                    sad condition to write. I will be glad to hear from you at any time. I will try
                    to get back as soon as I can. Give my kindest regards to the Faculty. I will
                    send you a few newspapers in a day or two. I would like to get a copy of the
                    Columbia or Charleston papers.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
