<p class="p10">July 20/1859</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Honorable<br>Simon
                        Cameron</p>
<p class="p10">I send you the Valley Spirit in which a reply to a communication in the
                    Repository &amp; Transcript of last week eulogistic of Alexander K. McClure supposed to be written or dictated by
                    himself. If this reply doesn't put a quieter in blowing
                    his own trumpet then I will come to the understanding he is lost to all feeling
                    and shame. We propose to make an effort at our coming County convention to elect
                    conferees favourable to another man either M<u>r</u>
                    <i>[unclear: McNeght]</i> near Greencastle formerly a member of Indiana County
                    Pennsylvania (now a resident
                    of our County) or F.S. Stumbaug of Chambersburg, the former probably is the
                    strongest man. We have but a faint hope of success, as it has only been within
                    the past week to get his consent and the <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>scoundrel
                        Alexander K McClure has been <i>[deleted: working]</i> quietly working for the Senatorship for the past Five Months
                    &amp; holding out the idea publicly that he would not think of accepting a
                    nomination if tendered, I wrote to a friend in Adams County if they intended
                    proping their claims, (hoping they would), (being entitled to the nominee) the
                    reply I received was, that they would adhere to these claims &amp; the right
                    to the nominee for that office had they an available man who desired the
                    nomination or who would be induced to accept but as yet all such have declined,
                    and the <i>[deleted: probability]</i> fear was that Alexander K. McClure had been working with some of the leading men for some
                    months to keep every person off the track &amp; give the conferees to him,
                    our primary meetings for electing delegates to the County convention will take
                    place on the 30<u>th</u> inst. the County convention Tuesday following I shall try &amp; be a delegate
                    &amp; with some other delegates get up a feeling which will go a great way
                    in <i>[illeg.]</i> his defeat in October.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>D. O. Gehr</u>
