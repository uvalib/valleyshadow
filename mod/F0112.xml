    <p>I let you know that I am well at present hoping these few lines may find you enjoying similar
     blessings</p>

    <p>Further I let you know that I thought I would write to you once more and see if I could get
     an answer this time I wrote a letter to Cyrus also and got an answer I would very much like to
     know where<pb n="2"/> brother Daniel is I request that you give me directions to him as I will
     write to him Now <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> forget to answer soon and give me the directions
     to Dan in Particular </p>

    <p>Further I let you know that our Colonel arrived to our Regiment on Sunday He is a nice young
     man only 25 years old we <orig reg="are not">aint</orig> kept as hard anymore as we had when we
     were under the command of the Colonel of the 16<hi rend="super">th</hi> Regiment I also let you
     know that moved out of Camp Simmons and into Camp M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Clellan a new camp
     about 2 miles from Harrisburg I also let you know that news is very scarce so I must let you
     know that our captain made a nice speech to the company and he was saluted by three cheers of
     every one of the company we <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> hardly hear anything of the war all
     that we hear goes in our favor and it is expected that the war <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
     last long any more so I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> think that I or any of us will get into
     battle which gives<pb n="4"/> me great courage and all of our company I have not <orig
      reg="seen">see</orig> my brother Jonathan since I left that camp which was on last Monday a
     week, but I heard <orig reg="there">their</orig> that they have their uniforms so no more at
     present, hoping to get an answer I also let you know that all of the boys as much as I know Ike
     Beutz and Cyrus Engle are well so much of your</p>
