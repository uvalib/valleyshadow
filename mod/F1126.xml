                <p>This morning I seat myself to inform you that I <abbr expan="received"
                    >rec'd</abbr> the express box yesterday for which I was very thankful.</p>
                <p>Only the pickle of the <orig reg="kraut">crout</orig> has run out fo the crock
                    and made the cakes taste of the pickle.</p>
                <p>Yesterday evening when the box came. I took it in hand to have a mess of sausage
                    for supper. Well, when I got ready for cooking them I felt as though I had
                    forgotten how to cook them or else never knew how.</p>
                <p>Well, I made up my mind if I could not cook them I would eat them raw-So I took
                    my pan-put some water in and put my sausages in the pan. Set it on the fire. I
                    boiled the water up. Then took to frying the <orig reg="chops">chaps</orig>.
                    Well, I fried them awhile-Then I made up my <orig reg="mind">minde</orig> that
                    they were done-not having any dinner you better think that Frank had a good
                    appetite for supper. Well, my sausages and <orig reg="apple butter"
                    >applebutter</orig> and cakes made me think of home.</p>
                <p>Your letter of the 17th came to hand containing the receipt. But I had my supper
                    out of the box before the letter came.</p>
                <p>The shoe pegs them I can do without. If I only get my watch.</p>
                <p>The other day I sent father five dollars and in this letter I will send him five
                    more. When the money gets home, Let me know. If you please.</p>
                <p>I sent my likeness to Rachel. I have another one taken that cost me nothing I
                    made the artist 2 small benches. I will tell Rachel if she gets both. She can
                    give one to you. Then the family or rather parents, brothers and sisters can see
                    me once more.</p>
                <p>I am not quite as dark as the picture makes me. Well, I was very glad to hear
                    that you were all well.</p>
                <p>And about the cold weather I thought it awful cold for the last week back. But
                    today it is very pleasant again.</p>
                <p>I am well at this time-<orig reg="hoping">happing</orig> that these few lines may
                    find you all enjoying good health.</p>
                <p>Tell Father when he sends my watch to <orig reg="send">sende</orig> me a good
                    watch key along.</p>
                <p>I have nothing particular to write at this time. We expect to be <orig reg="paid"
                        >paide</orig> by the 10th of March again. Then I will send father 20
                    dollars. I can't spare many more at this time.</p>
                <p>You <orig reg="will">wil</orig> write as soon as you get this. Give my <abbr
                        expan="respects">respts.</abbr> to all <orig reg="inquiring"
                    >enquiring</orig> friends. So farewell for this time.</p>
                <p>If I never more see any of you on earth, By the Grace of God I will meet you in
                    heaven-when I die.</p>
