<p class="p10">My Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter the 22nd and was glad to hear
                    that you were in Middlebrook and well you had said to me you had written me two
                    I did not get but the one and that very strange you did not <i>[illeg.]</i> our
                        <i>[unclear: note]</i>. your Dog is getting better but he will never be of
                    any Account only about the House though he Barks Pretty
                    fierce and catches the Hogs by the tail when ever they
                    come in the <i>[unclear: Lot]</i> one of his legs came off nearly at the knee
                    and the other one is very weak. Charley I never was as sorry for A dog in my
                    life and he never would have gotten well if I had not attended to him like I
                    would have done with a Child. I gave your Pistol to Dr. Bashaw yesterday and he
                    will give it to John <i>[unclear: Berry]</i> next Monday in Staunton. I wish
                    you would come out and see me if you cannot stay longer than one night and do
                    something with your dog if you want him. we do not care anything about keeping
                    him as he is so lame. I am well and I hope this will find you enjoying the same
                    Blessing. the Children and all send their love to you. Please write soon and a
                    longer letter than you wrote before and something more satisfactory about your
                    self. Remember me to my friends in <i>[unclear: your]</i> town.</p>
