<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to John

<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">Your communication of 1st inst. enclosing Bills and Vouchers for Services
                    rendered and Materials furnished for repair of Schoolhouse at Laurel Hill, was
                    this day received. The appropriation was for forty dollars. The account rendered
                    for material amounting to about that sum (thirty nine 48/100) it is useless to
                    forward for payment this account for services, which is accordingly herewith
                    returned. I presume it is a matter of indifference to Washington which account
                    is paid.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Jackson was only authorized to expend forty dollars, and if Washington on his
                    own responsibility expected more, he <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>must expect to lose it.</p>
<p class="p10">The purchase vouchers will be immediately transmitted to Richmond for payment.</p>
<p class="p10">This appropriation was granted in answer to an application made by Mr. Jackson
                        March 9th ult. and was subject to the conditions
                    mentioned in the application, namely that the Trustees should guarantee the use
                    of this building for a schoolhouse for colored children forever. Before
                    advancing the money you will please see that this condition is complied with.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, Colonel<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient
                        Servant</p>
