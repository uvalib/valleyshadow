<p class="p10">July 9, 1851</p>
<p class="p10">Mifflintown</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel-</p>
<p class="p10">You have doubtless been informed of the recommendation of General Bell for Senator by our Whig <i>[unclear: leg]</i> Convention. It
                    was rather unexpected here, but as there was a triagular fight for it, he
                    succeeded I am a <i>[unclear: conferee]</i> &amp; I shall vote for him of
                    course, but from the indifference that is manifested in reference to his
                    nomination both here &amp; in Mifflin Co. I am induced to think that the
                    district conference will turn to Union County for the
                    candidate. General Bell is a most estimable man &amp;
                    a fine Whig, but he is justly liable to the charge of a want of efficiency. He
                    is a quiet, honest man, but is a stranger to political tactics, and would be of
                    little use as a partisan Senator. On this ground I find that he will be
                        <i>[unclear: strenuously]</i> opposed, and I am inclined to think that he
                    will be defeated.</p>
<p class="p10">After <i>[unclear: mature]</i> reflection, I have concluded that in the even of
                    the nomination of a Union County man for Senator, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I will run for
                        <i>[unclear: A]</i>, Bell will not want it, and our side of the view is
                    entitled to it, so that there will be no difficulty with the Whigs of the
                    County. As I am a Conferee, selected to sustain General
                    Bell, I am morally bound to support him honestly, and I shall not enter a
                    contest with him to throw the Senatory from your County, as I would deem such a
                    course dishonorable; but considering the great probability of his defeat, I have
                    taken the liberty to address you on the subject, I would like to meet you as a
                    Conferee.</p>
<p class="p10">Please write to me, and post me up in reference to your County, State how the
                    contest for Senator is likely to terminate in your County, and what the chances
                    seem to be for Mifflin County concerning on your selection. Also state whether
                    there has been any manifestation of popular sentiment in reference to
                    <i>[unclear: A]</i>. State whether in any event you will be a candidate for
                    Senator, Let me hear from you soon.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me to friend Hickock</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. If you think it prudent, I would be glad if you will
                        have my name brought before the public through the "Chronicle" for
                            A It has been done in the "Star" but I would like to
                        have it done in both. If you will attend to it, I will coridally reciprocate
                        the favor at any time.</p>
