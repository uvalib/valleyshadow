    <p> I last night <orig reg="received">recived</orig> your fine letter of the 10<hi rend="super"
      >th</hi> (Monday). I have written to you since then, from New Market, &amp; hope my letter
     has come to hand before now &amp; cheered you up some - I am truly sorry you feel so
     despondent &amp; take so much "<unclear>though</unclear> for the morrow" - I am sure I
     could cheer you up if at home, but you must "fear not but trust in Providence &amp;
     remember that the Lord has always provided for us &amp; promises that the seed of the
     righteous shall never be forsaken" We have been here now three days - found the Yankee pickets
     at Strasburg, our cavalry, drove <hi rend="underline">them</hi> off &amp; we moved some
     infantry &amp; Artillery to the top of a hill &amp; shelled a brigade the Yanks had on
     picket &amp; made it scatter every way, then opened on one of their camps &amp; they
     ran from <hi rend="underline">it</hi> pell mell, leaving everything, they then advanced some
     troops across to the hill we were on, not knowing that we had infantry there &amp; our men
     met them &amp; drove them back with considerable loss - we captured <hi rend="underline">65
      prisoners &amp; killed</hi> &amp; wounded a good many - among the killed was Col.
     Wells who commanded the Yankee force that came up the Valley last winter - we had 22 killed
     &amp; about 120 wounded - since then no action has taken place, each party looking at the
     other &amp; wondering what it was doing. The prospect seems bright in every quarter -
     things get along well at Richmond &amp; <pb n="2"/>Hood has surely made one of the boldest
     movements of the war &amp; must be successful if the half that is said of his army is true
     -- in fact we have always gained by taking bold measures &amp; if Sherman is compelled to
     leave Georgia there will be a great revulsion of feeling in the North -- &amp; peace
     sentiments will be in fashion again. Connecticut appears to have gone for McClellan -- we are
     desirous of hearing from the Pa. election -- a lady from the West, who has lately come to New
     Market, says the West will go for McClellan, &amp; Price is doing much in his favor by
     occupying the larger portion of Missouri -- I hope you may be able to get some wood for present
     use -- I intend to get home before long &amp; attend to the hauling &amp; cutting up of
     a winter supply -- I shall be able to get fodder enough &amp; I will put one horse into my
     pocket if I can do no better. I am sorry Mr. Geeding got offended, for I thought the government
     would impress his hay &amp; he would be just as willing to let me have some of it but no
     matter -- he has done much for us &amp; I have no right or reason to complain of him -- I
     asked you about Capt Sterrett in my last did he have time to go to Richmond? I do not need my
     clothes &amp; prefer that you keep them at home -- I am sorry you were <orig
      reg="disappointed">disppointed</orig> about coming over to camp, but I knew our movements were
     very uncertain as I wrote you -- I do not know what we will do here -- I will write often --
     Write soon -- Love to the children -- &amp; may Heaven bless you all </p>
