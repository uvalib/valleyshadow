     bread and while they are cooking it I thought I would write a few lines home we have been on
     picket ever since Tuesday and just got off this morning. On Monday the
     whole Brigade were drawn up in line of battle I was sure we were going
     to have a fight but the "Yanks" commenced to shell out and we left the field in double quick

     than we did I counted six Regiments of them all mounted. You asked me what company I had
     joined, I have joined Capt C J O'Ferral's from Warren County V<sup>a</sup> he has
     some very nice men in his company. I am carrying the colors for the
     Regiment it is not as much trouble as I thought it was at first they only trouble is I have is
     I cannot manage my horse very well. by the way tell Pa to see Col Frank about them spurs tell
     him I am very much in need of a pair I have but one and that is a very mean one. Col. Frank
     promised to have me a pair made at <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/garb6c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/garb6c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      the state shops. I have seen Ash &amp; Mike several times but
     have not seen Ned but once and then I passed while he was marching and I was caring a dispatch
     to Gen. Jackson so I could not have much talk with him he was looking very well, how is Sister
     Seal I hope she is not very sick give my love to her and tell her I will write to her soon give
     my love to Pa, Ma Kate &amp; Nelly and all others who ask for me you must excuse me for not
