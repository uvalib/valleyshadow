<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">I know you did not expect a letter from me by the train yesterday as you know I
                    could not send it to the Depot in time to be mailed. Your dear &amp; welcome
                    letter of Tuesday came safely. I was so glad to hear from you my love that you
                    were well. You can imagine how delightful was our surprise last evening when the
                    passenger train stopped just above the house &amp;
                    papa stepped from the car I was looking out the window
                    when the cars stopped &amp; wondered <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    who was coming here but I knew pa as soon as I saw him leave the car. Mr. John
                    Ferror was here when pa arrived &amp; eat supper with us. papa was so
                    anxious to see us all at home that he did not stop in Staunton. I am so glad he
                    is with us again. has many interesting things to tell us of his long stay in New
                    York City. he says Mountain Palace looks strange to him. Ma &amp; Hamie had
