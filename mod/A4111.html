<p class="p10">My Dear Ones at Home</p>
<p class="p10">I know you are all looking for a letter from me and I avail myself of 
 the first "spell" of letter writing to chat with you a few minutes -- 	I 
 got here at 7 P.M. Monday -- had a very comfortable night, considering the fact that it was coming to 
 Lexington -- Fred Effinger was my fellow traveller <u>all</u> the way &amp; he made himself very agreeable - 
 - we joined "snacks" at Middlebrook &amp; I thereby kept the most of mine 
 &amp; am "lunching" off it yet -- You can't imagine how good it tastes -- 
 it has such a "home" flavor -- so different from the "hotel" flavor I am 
 now <u>"enjoying"</u> -- (as Ma would say) -- though the hotel here is very well kept &amp; things 
 are in very good order -- I got to work today -- Gen. Lee was very kind 
 &amp; had my office fixed up just as I said -- got a "Morning Glory" stove 
 &amp; anthracite cover split bottomed chairs, a good large table <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> pro. tem. and he sent to Richmond for stuff for a new drawing board 
 -- had a new window put in for more light, -- wash stand &amp; fixings 
 &amp;c. and I have all "my traps" there and am very comfortable -- I go to 
 work after breakfast -- normally 8 A.M. -- really 8 1/2 &amp; work until 3 
 P.M. when I come to dinner -- then stroll about until dark &amp; then come 
 to my room at the hotel to read &amp; write until bed time -- 11 or 12 
 P.M. or sooner -- as the spirit moves -- I am availing myself of the 
 college library to read some rare and valuable books that I have long 
 desired to read -- I see the Richmond and N.Y. papers at Allen's but wish 
 you would send me the Valley Virginian &amp; Spectator after you have read 
 them, both in one wrapper for 2 cts. If the Co. Fair Spectator comes to 
 the house please put them in my drawer so they will be together.  I have a 
 fine large room at the hotel, fire place, carpet, bed on castors, lounge, 
 bureau, wardrobe, table, <u>rocking chair</u>, 
 <u>arm chair</u>, split bottom chair &amp; Windsor 
 chair, wash stand &amp;c -- (room for me sometimes) I am almost over my 
 cold -- hope you are too -- I sent a boy up the day I left -- not knowing 
 but you might want him - did you?  I gave some of my oranges to Mrs. Lee 
 &amp; some to Mrs. Campbell -- kept 3 &amp; gave Allen one. -- I have not 
 been to see anyone -- Altmanns called to see me -- Write often &amp; tell 
 me how you get along -- I shall write again soon.  -- 10 P.M. Good night 
 &amp; God bless &amp; keep you -- 
 </p>
<p class="p10">Affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">All write soon -- Allen gets the "Register" --
