</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Peyton, of the Virginia Hotel in Staunton, writes Jackson that he has no
                    intention of settling accounts with Sarah Skinner, a former employee until he

<p class="p10">September 18th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Virginia Hotel[Staunton]</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I am due Sarah Skinner $7.10/100 balance on wages. She notified me yesterday of
                    her intention to quit &amp; did so <u>immediately</u>
                    upon said notification, leaving me <i>[deleted: without]</i> in an awkward
                    position with no one to take her place. She applied at the office this morning
                    for her money. I informed her that I could not settle with her until my sister
                    returned as she was Chamber Maid &amp; I did not know what charges she might
                    have against her for lost towels, sheets &amp; &amp;--&amp; this is
                    our <i>[illeg.]</i> not to settle with floor servants until we know how their <i>[unclear: 
                        accounts
                    ]</i>
                    <i>[added: stand]</i> in this particular &amp; in her
                    absence I cannot get at it. Sarah is a <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>unreliable servant, I can assure But I am justly due her $7.10
                    provided we have no counter charges, and I will pay her as soon as I ascertain
                    that fact. I cannot do so before.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Captain Very Respectfully Yours</p>
