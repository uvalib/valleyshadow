<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando
                    Brown, August 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jordan reports that he tries to have all disputes involving freedmen settled
                    outside of the civil court system because of the prejudice and indifference of
                    the local Magistrates.</p>

                    Sub-District, Virginia.
                    Brevet Brigadier General O Brown<br>Assistant Commissioner &amp;c<br>Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands<br>Richmond Virginia

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 31st 1868</p>
<p class="p10">STAUNTON, VA.</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with instructions contained in Par VI Circular No 10, from Head Quarters Assistant Commissioner &amp;c Virginia dated Richmond
                        Virginia March 12 1866 in the matter of the result
                    of the operation of the "Order" restoring to the "Civil Courts" jurisdiction
                    over colored persons &amp;c. I have the honor to submit the following Report
                    viz.</p>
<p class="p10">By reason of the fact that an impression prevails among the Magistrates in this
                    Division that their term of Service has expired and that consequently they are
                    not authorized to act officially <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>in connection with the masked
                    reluctance betrayed by them toward adjudicating or trying cases in which colored
                    persons offers as parties, I have sent but few cases to them during the last
                    month. The <i>[unclear: careless]</i> manner in which such cases have been
                    disposed of - their marked indifference to the interests of the freedpeople -
                    their <i>[unclear: unconquerable]</i> prejudice against the colored race
                    &amp;c &amp;c all tend to deepen the conviction in my mind that the <u>necessity</u> for the establishment of Provost Courts in
                    each county of Virginia is more evident than ever and
                    especially is this the case in this portion of the state. I have at the same
                    time no cases of injustice to report by reason of the aforementioned fact viz.
                    most of the difficulties in which Freedmen are concerned are not sent to the
                    Civil Courts but settled in this office.</p>
