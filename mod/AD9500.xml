      <p>It rained all last night &amp; this morning till 10 O'clock, then cleared off cool. God
       in his abundant energy has spared the lives of myself &amp; family to see the Beginning
       of another year, in circumstances of great mercy. My own health now may be said to be good.
       It has been very imperfect for several months, &amp; that distressing eruption on my back
       &amp; especially on my <hi rend="underline">legs</hi> has harassed me. But Providentially
       I was led to use Allum Water &amp; rain water &amp; small doses of Salts &amp; it
       has entirely disappeared. In other respects I am as well as a man of my age can expect to be.
       Preaching fatigues me but little.</p>

      <p>M<hi rend="super">rs</hi> M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Farland enjoys remarkably good health
       &amp; is a great blessing to me. Mary Lewis's health is also good. Frank very well
       &amp; Mary Louise improving -- seems to be in <hi rend="underline">good health</hi>, very
       cheerful &amp; can walk briskly on her crutches. The <hi rend="underline">"curve"</hi> in
       her spine seems to be diminishing &amp; the abscess to be discharging less.</p>

      <p>Robert &amp; James are at home &amp; have undertaken to carry on the farm without
       my hiring a man by the year. They behave well &amp; are a great comfort to me. Francis is
       in Washington City -- says he is reporting the proceedings of the Senate of the U.S.<abbr
        expan="United States"/> I know not what for. I feel more anxious about him than any of my
       Children, for he is in no regular employment that will last.</p>

      <pb n="2"/>
      <p>New Year's day continued.<lb/>Betsey &amp; D<hi rend="super">r</hi>
       <abbr expan="Humphreys">H.</abbr> have been perplexed about a change of Residence. They have
       concluded to remove from Marion, in Lonyth Co.<abbr expan="County"/> &amp; board at a
        M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Shannon's on the Turnpike from Wythevile to [blank space] But they
       &amp; their children are well.</p>

      <p>Thus we have numerous mercies for which to be grateful. But the subject of my greatest
       anxiety is about the Spiritual interests of my Sons. None of them are Professors of Religion;
       &amp; although two years ago Francis professed conversion in Harrisonburg, I have great
       fears about him.</p>

      <p>May God, for Christ's sake grant me the joy of seeing them, before I die the devoted
       Disciples of Jesus Christ. And O, may He pour out his Spirit on my Charge. This I desire
       above every thing earthly.</p>

      <p>Roxa Bent is now with us.</p>

      <p>Today we are all at home and I am in my quiet pleasant study preparing to preach a New Year
       Sermon.</p>

      <p>M<hi rend="super">r</hi> R. Tate Wallace &amp; M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Pilson came
       &amp; spent several hours with us. They informed me that several friends of mine had
       agreed to raise a sum of money for me to enable me to buy a pair of horses &amp; they
       paid me in cash <hi rend="underline">Three Hundred Dollars</hi> $300.00 of which M<hi
        rend="super">r</hi> James Bumgarner gave his Check for <hi rend="underline">$100</hi>.</p>

      <p>This is by far the largest present I ever received, &amp; it was entirely unexpected.
       And it seems that M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bumgarner proposed that he would give $100. if the
        <abbr expan="Congregation">Cong<hi rend="super">n</hi>.</abbr> would give another hundred,
       but they thought it was too little for the purpose &amp; resolved to raise $200. more.</p>

      <p>I regard this as a wonderful event. I need good horses indeed, but I could have managed
       with economy to have bought them. But God has directed this, I trust, to increase the
       affection between me &amp; my people. It encourages me to hope that there is a feeling
       towards me, that by God's blessing may greatly increase my usefulness. I pray that fruit may
       abound to their account. God knows I have coveted no man's silver or gold, &amp; yet I do
       esteem this gift more than I would double the sum from any other source.</p>

      <p>(continued.) I marvel particularly that M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bumgarner -- not a pious

       instrument in his Salvation.</p>

      <p>Then perhaps two months after -- on the 12 of <abbr expan="September">Sept.</abbr> I think
       I went to see her, to satisfy her if possible that she had just cause of complaint &amp;
       to induce her to return to Church. She introduced the subject when she &amp; I were alone

       this subject; why on this principle you would not be willing to go to heaven unless you got a
       high seat there. Meaning that if she would not agree to go &amp; worship God in his house
       unless she got a choice seat there, the same principle would lead to the result I named. For
       she told me in so many words "we are not going to sit <hi rend="underline">any where</hi>."
       With very much more to the same purpose.</p>

      <p>She was greatly offended at my plainness, and now insists that she said nothing to provoke

      <p>Mild &amp; pleasant. Engaged as yesterday. During a debate I rose to speak &amp;
       had the floor clearly-but <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Peyton Harrison rose after me
       &amp; went on in his loud manner, regardless of me-I stood till he was done &amp;
       then said My brother Harrison goes on without noticing any one. This produced a smile. But
       after the <abbr expan="Assembly">Ass<hi rend="super">y</hi>.</abbr> adjourned he came by
       where I was, &amp; said I had <orig reg="publicly">publickly</orig> insulted him,
       &amp; he was not going to suffer it; &amp; that he was aware of my course towards him
       heretofore. I said, why what does this mean <abbr expan="Brother">Br.</abbr> H. I intended no
       insult, but this is your habit in the Judicatories to begin &amp; go on, no matter who
       has the floor. He denied it. (D<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Ramsey &amp; D<hi rend="super"
       >r</hi>. <abbr expan="William">Wm.</abbr> Brown sustain me in this.) I said I never in all my
       life intentionally wounded the feelings of any brother. Well, he said you have wounded mine.
       I said I must have an explanation of this. <pb n="170"/> He said I will give it some time. We
       then parted. I related the matter to D<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Ramsey, who expressed wonder
       that <orig reg="offense">offence</orig> should have been taken.</p>
      <p>In the evening I went to consult D<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Brown. When I had finished my
       statement of the affair to him, M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Harrison came into his room on an
       errand. I insisted that he should sit down, &amp; he did so after some hesitation. I then
       with much feeling, protested that I had no intention of wounding his feelings, &amp; then
       asked him what he referred to in my former conduct toward him. He said it was a letter I had
       written to the Board of Education, when he was talked of to succeed D<hi rend="super">r</hi>.
       Van Rensselaer, that it had been industriously circulated, &amp; that although he did not
       want the office, the letter had defeated his election. That I had represented him as old=66
       when he was only 59 &amp; that he was feeble. He had not seen the letter, but understood
       that I had spoken of him kindly which he regarded as so much the worse. I said I had very
       much forgotten the contents of my letter, but it was written conscientiously. I thought he
       was then unable to preach which I <pb n="171"/> regarded as a serious disqualification for
       the office. He said he was able to preach at that time. I said, if he wished it, I would
       incidentally bring the matter up in the Assembly &amp; explain. He said, No, he did not
       wish it-that he was satisfied; &amp; so the matter ended.</p>
      <p>It is painful to me to think that he has been entertaining those feelings towards me in
       regard to that letter, altogether undeserved &amp; yet meeting me everywhere just as
       formerly. He is a man to whom I have never had an unkind feeling, but the sincerest
       friendship. Whom can I confide in?</p>

       But it has also been a year of great affliction. My sons all in the army &amp; all have

      <p>Robert has been ill for a month with Typhoid Fever-is somewhat better but not yet able to
       sit up even in bed. But I trust, by the blessings of God, he will recover. It was a great
       mercy he got home, &amp; that Francis got home to help nurse him.</p>
      <p>Francis is at home on sick <orig reg="furlough">furough</orig>. Is better however &amp;
       will return to the army shortly. My blessed wife enjoys fine health. Mary &amp; her

      <p>A simple kind of man, who said his name was Hamilton, came to my study-said he felt a
       considerable interest in Religion &amp; approved of the Presbyterian doctrine &amp;
       had been immersed &amp; believed he was converted &amp; his sins pardoned last
       August. He seemed very much to desire to have Bible although he said they had one at home. He
       wanted the one on my study table which I told him I could not spare. I gave him a Testament
       &amp; told him, I thought Bibles could soon be obtained. I had to leave the room a
       moment, &amp; directly he came out with his coat wrapped close around him &amp; went
       away. Shortly after I missed my Bible-he undoubtedly stole it.</p>

       agonizing-they were less so at the last. What a tide of reflection rush through my mind
       embracing the whole history of the deceased. What numerous anxieties about him from his
       birth, what care, what watchfulness, what <orig reg="labor">labour</orig> &amp; expense
       &amp; how many anxious prayers. And now the whole is closed up for the Judgment.</p>
      <p>I deeply regret that he was so influenced as to join the Campbell Church in Richmond,
