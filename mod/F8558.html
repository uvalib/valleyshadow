<p class="p10">My Dear Brother,</p>
<p class="p10">It seems an age since I have heard from you. I miss your regular letters very
                    much, and am anxious to hear from you oftener, but, I suppose you are so much
                    engaged you have not much time for letter writing. I think you must be very
                    tired going on in this way from day to day and no prospect- of a Speaker-- Dr.
                    thinks matters are wearing a very serious aspect--. I had a letter from Andrew
                    this eve he says Lizzie is improving, able to sit up about- half the time and
                    exercises the length of the room at suitable intervals as soon as she is able
                    they go to Old Point- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> perhaps week after next. I feel so relieved
                    she is better. I felt -- so uneasy about her even after the Dr thought her
                    better. it is such a dangerous disease and often takes persons of very suddenly.
                    I have not received my interest - yet - from Andrew.
                    I thought he would be more prompt -- and I do not like to remind him of it. he
                    has only paid me the $80 I bought -- my watch with, I would like to have it as I
                    calculated upon receiving it about -- the first of
                    this month--. How do you get along in money matters? I know you draw no pay
                    until you have a Speaker. I heard of your being in Gettysburg. Miss Ginnie Smith paid Mr Gesey a visit. I called to see her and
                    she told me she had seen you and she thought -- Washington agreed with you, you
                    were looking better than she had ever seen you. Can't
                    you find time to write to us. I wish you could get -- a Speaker and get to
                    business. I may go to Rose Hill this or next week for a
                    few days Mary Emma is alone, her Mother is with <i>[unclear: Jimmy]</i> Mary
                        <i>[unclear: Shunk]</i> is very ill. Her life has
                    been despaired of, her friends were telegraphed for a week ago. The children are
                    very well and growing very fast. Dr. wishes to be remembered. <i>[deleted: and]</i> do write soon. </p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Yours truly</u>
                    </p>
