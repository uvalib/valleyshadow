<h4>Augusta County: Samuel Franklin Carson to his
                         Brother, October 7, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carson writes his brother, discussing increasing desertion rates and the
                         generally improving health of his fellow soldiers. In the postscript, he
                         asks that his brother send him a pair of boots and some rations, explaining
                         that food is running low, it now costs cash, and officers haven't been
                         payed in some time. He also mentions a trip to Richmond.</p>

<p class="p10">Oct 7<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother,</p>
<p class="p10">After waiting some three weeks for an answer to my last, I have again seated
                         myself for the purpose of writing you a short Epistle, however interesting
                         it may prove to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I have but little news to write you from this quarter. Things remain pretty
                         much as they were when I last wrote you _ with the exception, that the
                         Yankees have moved more to our left,- from some cause or other not laid
                         down to us on this program. It is reported by our scouts, that they have
                         sent one Corps to the west or some other point; this may or may not be
                         true, but of one thing all seem to be satisfied, and that is that General Mead is satisfied to <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>remain in
                         his present position and not to advance on us in ours. Some little
                         skirmishing occasionally occurs between our cavalry and that of the enemy,
                         which in the end amounts to nothing. So it is with the infantry pickets
                         along the Rapidan.</p>
<p class="p10">Since we have been at this place, there have been some 4 men out of our Regiment who have deserted and gone to the enemy,
                         last night a Lieutenant out of Co "G" deserted
                         whilst on picket. A great deal of desertion is going on all through the
                         army, and as many are being shot for the same offence. It seems the more
                         shooting, the more desertion.</p>
<p class="p10">The health of our men has not been so good since we came to this camp. There
                         are now 6 men in our company unfit for duty: most of whom have had light
                         attacks of fever, but are now <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>on the mend &amp; I hope will
                         be fit for duty in a few days. I believe this is all I have to say for the
                         present, so I will close hoping to hear from you soon. My love to Sister,
                         little Jimmie &amp; <u>his</u>
                         sis/sister</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sam Frank</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> I wrote to Bob &amp; also to you about
                              having me a pair of <u>boots</u>
                              <u>made</u>, I trust one of you will attend to it
                              for me, as my old ones are nearly past wearing. don't want the <i>[deleted: ]</i> to be too heavy. If you have an opportunity that you
                              think safe I would be glad you would get Liza to fix me up a box of
                              provisions and send them down. They are scarce &amp; hard for the
                              officers to get without paying the <u>cash</u>,
                              &amp; this a great many can't do at
                              present as they have <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>failed to pay us <i>[illeg.]</i> for
                              some time. <u>I</u> still have a little.
                                   Jack Hanger says to tell Bob to send him
                                   4 gallons of brandy &amp; if it is good he
                              will recommend it to the Surgeons
                              &amp; nothing more.<br> -C<br><br> Dear Adela<br> For fear
                              that you did not get my letter from Richmond I will write you a few
                              lines this morning I had a great old time going <i>[illeg.]</i> on
                              the Boat.</p>
