<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 9th, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg, Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel,</p>
<p class="p10">I called together half a dozen of our leading &amp; most prudent men, and
                    submitted your letter. They have sent out for one of the County
                    <i>[unclear: Commissioners]</i> a very prudent man (brother of Jim Scotts) and
                    will have him and several of the <i>[unclear: Town]</i> Council in a
                    confidential consultation tonight.</p>
<p class="p10">I am perplexed as to what course to adopt. If the Rebels come they will come much
                    stronger than <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>before, and I doubt not with a much more <u>destructive</u>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>. Our raiders south have been wantonly destructive with private
                    property and the <u>lex talionis</u> may come back upon us.</p>
<p class="p10">We will at first arrange for communication with a telegraphic instrument at
                    Greencastle. <i>[unclear: London]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and a few good scouts on the view, we may avoid surprise, and
                    thus save much valuable property. In connection
                    with the Hagerstown, Greencastle, Mercersburg, Williamsport and Hancock people,
                    we can I think arrange a perfect police system, and <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>be able at this
                    point to have timely notice of any movement.</p>
<p class="p10">The <i>[unclear: Governor]</i> will fail at Washington I fear,
                    <i>[unclear: Staunton]</i> is so bitterly against him that he will interfere
                    against any movement the <i>[unclear: Governor]</i> may desire. He seems to be
                        <i>[unclear: actuated]</i> all the time by the impression that Governor
                    <i>[unclear: Curtin]</i> is only seeking popularity in all these efforts: and
                    he does not particularly deserve to be popular.</p>
<p class="p10">Write me daily how things look. You need not fear any sensations from any facts
                    or opinions you may give for we shall be careful of all that.</p>
<p class="p10">I fear Curtin is assenting an <i>[unclear: in-tarily]</i> to the use of his name
                    for renomination. If <i>[unclear: Franklin]</i> is nominated on the 17th every
                    consideration of prudence will dictate his <i>[unclear: peremtory]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: withdrawal]</i> and under any circumstances it is of much more
                    than doubtful wisdom.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly thine</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AKMcClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable Eli Slifer
                    </p>
