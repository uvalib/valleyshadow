<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to Thomas P.
                    Jackson, October 4, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Manly, the Bureau's Superintendent of Education, informs Jackson of his options
                    for acquiring a teacher in Staunton. He writes that the only option at the time
                    appears to be to send a young woman to teach.</p>

<p class="p10">October 4 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 2d is received I have been depending altogether upon Mr. Brackett to supply
                    Staunton with teachers. Have not had communication with him, but took it for
                    granted that he would supply. If he does not, the best I can do, so far as I can
                    see, at present, is to send a young lady there. I could do that at once, if you
                    thought best, then if none other could be provided you, would have her and she
                    is an experienced teacher and a very good lady. This lady will be at my house
                    probably tomorrow, and must <i>[added: be]</i> sent to some
                    of the many applicants within a few days. The charitable societies are "hard
                    up." I dont think you will get a man. If Mr. Brackett should supply at all, I
                    suppose he would be glad to be relieved of the support of one teacher. Please
                    reply at once, and I will be governed by your judgement.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>R. M. Manly</i></p>
