<p class="p10">Sherando, VA</p>
<p class="p10">Dear cousin- </p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to write you a few lines to let you know that we are all well but
     Lizzy and she is as well as can be expected. She gave birth to a fine son this morning at 4
     oclock. He weighs 10 lbs and a half and looks very much like Willy only light hair. Lizzy got
     along very well and we have great reason to thank God for his care and protection over her.
     Yes, he will ever answer those who call earnestly upon him for help. Lizzie did not need a
     Doctor.</p>
<p class="p10">Lizzie wants you to write her word what she must call your little son. She says she was
     thinking about calling him for both of his grandfathers and if you do not prefer the name send
     her a name for him when you write to her. She says I must tell you she has wrote you 6 letters
     and has not received the seraph of a pen from you since the 11th of June. Your brother J.
     received one from you yesterday. They are all well. Your father was here last Wednesday and cut
     the rye. David sowed part of your lot in buckwheat. She wants you to write soon as she wishes
     to hear from you very much. She says I must give her love, Willy and the baby also. Willy is at
     your fathers. They are well. Lizzie says she knows you write but she don't get the letters. The
     mail is so uncetain.</p>
<p class="p10">Well I must close by saying I trust you are trying to prepare for a land where
     <i>[unclear: care]</i> and parting is not known. Our regards to you. Write soon</p>
<p class="p10">Your cousin Hester A.E. Hyden.</p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">
      H.H. Dedrick
