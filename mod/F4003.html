<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    October 15, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure briefly describes his plan to increase local enlistment by allowing
                    volunteer to train near home under the command of a familiar leader.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>Colonel A. K. McClure                
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 15</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Col</p>
<p class="p10">I am fully persuaded that a regiment could be raised
                    here very promptly by General McAllen if allowed to
                        rendezvous here. The men
                    <i>[unclear: would]</i> be supported at the same cost as in Harrisburg
                    &amp; you could equip them. It is meant as an <u>honest</u> effort to raise a regiment &amp; not
                    to swindle as was the case under Steinbaugh, who is <i>[unclear: now]</i>
                    fortunately out of the way. Schell writes me that if McAllen should be allowed
                    to take charge of this, Bedford would give at least <u>four</u> Companies &amp; I know that our company
                    would give just as many. Our better military mean could not have any <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>thing to do with Steinbaugh and he did not take two hundred men out of our
                    county.</p>
<p class="p10">McAllen does not want contracts of any kind, nor does any one about him.</p>
<p class="p10">You may remember him as the man who was <i>[unclear: authorized]</i> by the
                        General to raise a Brigade here last spring, and
                    finally you had to reject his men when the Patterson registration was reduced.
                    He paid <i>[unclear: all]</i> $400 as I know to get the men off quietly and,
                    besides being well qualified to command a regiment he
                    has the character to justify the promotion.</p>
<p class="p10">I am satisfied that double the men if not five times the members could be had
                    here by knowing their Colonel and <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>getting ready at home, that could
                    be enlisted otherwise.</p>
<p class="p10">It would not cost the State a cent, as there is a camp and all necessary
                    preparations.</p>
<p class="p10">I write you with the request that you will take a favorable opportunity to bring
                    it before the Govenor, and get a definite asnwer sent me. I have no personal or
                    political interest in General McAllen, but
                        <i>[unclear: case]</i> this matter soley because I feel persuaded it would
                    be wise to adopt it.</p>
<p class="p10">Please give me an early reply, and if acceptable, let Commissary <i>[unclear: ]</i>
                    contract to supply at your regular rate paid at Camp <i>[unclear: Cutiers]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </p>
<p class="p10"><i>AKMcClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable Eli Slifer
                    </p>
