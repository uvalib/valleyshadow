                <p>Your last was received two or three days ago I am happy to inform you that we are
                    all well on Monday night when I got home from town I found Willie complaining
                    seemed to have right smart fever he sleeps in a bed in the dining room and the
                    door into our room stands open about midnight I heard him complaining and went
                    out to see him he was complaining with a pain in his right leg I rubbed it for
                    him he seemed to suffer about half an hour not very severely I laid down on the
                    bed with him and he pretty soon fell asleep I slept there til morning he seemed
                    pretty well in the morning but came down from his school room during the morning
                    complaining of pain in his breast which he said he frequently has had at home it
                    pretty soon wore off and he went back to his school has been quite well ever
                    since. Emma is quite well they both seem to enjoy themselves very well seem to
                    be fond of their studies and are improving Sallie says study a good-deal better
                    than they did at first Emma is very fond of her <orig reg="arithmatic"
                        >arithmetick</orig> sallie says <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> want to stop
                    sometimes when school is out Emma sets very much stooped we are trying to break
                    her of it try to get them all to set straight it is right hard to get Emma broke
                    but I hope we will before long Emma is very much attached to her aunt Mary and
                    me and also to Sallie. We are getting her<del hand="h1">e</del> broke of her
                    pouty spells she <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> have them as often as she had at
                    first I am in hopes she will make a fine singer she is fond of it they sing
                    every evening before<pb n="2"/> school is out, I wish very much we could get a
                    piano and give them all music lessons I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> afford to
