<p class="p10">...them thunder. There the Yankees broke for Winchester before we got there. It was nine
     miles from where we was to Middletown. We went 3 miles below town that night and we stayed
     there about 3 hours and then we started for WInchester. Some of our forces was on ahead and
     they came in on the Yankees about daylight and in a few minutes after we got there. Our men
     made a charge on them and they broke and run and we run them 5 miles and we got a great many
     prisoners. The cavalry men has been bringing them back in big squads all day today.</p>
<p class="p10">They brought a yankee past and his wife was with him and she was a <i>[unclear: back]</i>
     one at that. Dr. Lewis asked him if that was his wife. he said yessir and
     <i>[unclear: the]</i> had took a good many negroes and we got a good many of them back. We
     have taken a great many horses and wagons and other things. We got 3 trains of cars at Front
     Royal and 500 sacks of coffee and a great deal of salt and other things. They burnt up nearly
     one square of Winchester. We expect to follow them on.</p>

     well. I seen Uncle Jacob Dedrick in Bridgewater. He said he seen Jake that morning driving a
     wagon and I heard of him being at FrontRoyal but I have not seen him yet.</p>

     affectionate husband until death. May god bless you all. Write soon. H. H. Dedrick to wife. I
     sent you a letter some time ago and I have got no answer from it.</p>

     dinner by ourselves as all the rest of our mess has run off but four. J and James Lewis and
     Joseph Liggett has gone out to get their dinner. I received your kind letter while I was at
