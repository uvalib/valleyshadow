<p class="p10">January the 21<sup>th</sup>, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Salem, Roanoke Co</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister,</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 17<sup>th</sup> just a few minutes ago I was just in the
     act of writing to you anyway I perused it with unbounded pleasure &amp; love. But I have
     not heard a word from home since I left nor feel any ways uneasy
     about it, for I know Maggie will write when she has an opportunity nor I have never since I
     have been in the army for I have always considered it my duty to write to her 2 or 3 times to
     her once. But to acknowledge I do want to hear from her &amp;
      <i>[unclear: Warler Elmer ]</i>all that I have on earth to care for Bell you seemed <i>[deleted: ]</i> what inclined to think I ought not become dissatisfied in the Army &amp; he
     contended I know that I just as much to care for as any other man
     &amp; I know that I have the same privilege to hire a
     subscribe as they that has done so &amp; more over I love my Wife &amp; child as much &amp; will do as much for them as any
     other man &amp; would love to remain at home with Them as well as as well as any other man,
     &amp; I don't know how soon I may be with them &amp; again I
     may not see them till the war is over. for this reason I have been appointed Assisting Quarter
     Master of this regiment 14th till it is organized &amp; then I have the best of nine
     chances out of ten for the appointment of Capt. Q.M. and if I am pleased with it &amp; get
     the appointment I will <i>[added: remain in servise]</i></p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/sister2.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/sister2.gif"></center></a><br><br>Bell you want me to write to Pete I would
     do so with pleasure but know it to <i>[added: be]</i> useless to do so for
     I have written to Jacksons several times &amp; none ever reached their destination. Well I must give you the <i>[unclear: points]</i> of the Brigadier
     General <i>[unclear: A.G. Jenkens]</i>
     Brigade in the first place we were ordered
     here encamped a Camp of <i>[unclear: instruction]</i>
     everything disarranged everybody
     dissatisfied &amp; no nothing you may <i>[added: say]</i> but all I
     have to say about it is in the place of it being a Camp of
     instructions it a Camp of <i>[unclear: diserfaction]</i> at the best no rules nor nothing as I have said. The Company that have <i>[unclear: going
     short]</i> at all times in the <i>[added: day]</i> &amp; night
     they even spent by volleys &amp; do just as they please &amp;
     one hundred Yankees could come &amp; rout the whole Camp.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather is very rough &amp; bad we had a very pretty snow last night it fell about
     five or six inches deep but there was enough for a foot of snow it rained all day yesterday
     &amp; consequently it melted. Bob Love is improving very fast I think will be able in the
      course of a <i>[unclear: 
      couple
     ]</i> of weeks to join his Company &amp; several others are sick, but I still remain
     the same old seven &amp; six. I have no news of importance of war
     to communicate. So I will have to close for the <i>[deleted: pleasant]</i> present.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="/papers/images/sister3.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/sister3.gif"></center></a><br><br>Give Miss <i>[unclear: Clemmins]</i>
     <i>[unclear: my]</i> respects &amp; Mr. <i>[unclear: Brarey]</i>
     <i>[added: my]</i> regards &amp; ask him how his arm is get, &amp;
      whether he is ready to take another fish
     or not, tell him to hold himself in reaching at all times that I may be there any day to fish
     &amp; till then the hook I thought I had lost I found in my Coat afterwards &amp; write
     often &amp; direct as follows</p>
