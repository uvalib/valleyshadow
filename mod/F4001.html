<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    July 23, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Alexander McClure refers to the Union loss at Manassas as a "sad chapter in our
                    National History," and he bemoans the difficulties in allowing the most
                    promising soldiers to rise to the top of their ranks.</p>

                        Dear Sir
                    </p>
<p class="p10">What a sad chapter in our National History is that of Sunday last. If not <u>speedily</u> redeemed our Nationality will
                        <i>[unclear: tremble]</i> in the scale with a more than
                    <i>[unclear: combatful]</i> issue.</p>
<p class="p10">The 200,000 <u>respected</u> men, who were turned home sad
                    &amp; disappointed three months ago might <i>[unclear: now]</i> have their
                    camps at Richmond. What a commentary upon our apology for a government.</p>
<p class="p10">Pennsylvania seems to be crippled at every step. Her
                    troops <i>[unclear: ]</i> badly affected &amp; leave a record which <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    justifiable when slowly scrutinized, will we <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>be a blot upon our fame.</p>
<p class="p10">We have good men in all our regiments, Cant they be <u>forced</u> to the surface. The 2<sup>d</sup> (Colonel Steinbaugh) has a Lieutenant (Stitzel) is one of our
                    Chambersburg <i>[unclear: Cornfarmers]</i> who is a first class military man,
                    but he has the modesty of <i>[unclear: went]</i> &amp; is not a politician.
                    It must be so in all of the regiments. <u>Do</u> give the
                    point special attention, and as regiments are re-organized, let all the efforts
                    of the Departments be directed to facing the men well affected. <u>Dont hesitate to refuse Commission where
                            combinations but incompetent men at the head of out
                        troops.</u></p>
