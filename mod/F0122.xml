     our camp up at brooks station all the dismounted men were sent to <unclear>safeguard</unclear>
     court house there we got horses again and from there we marched by <orig reg="Alexandria"
      >Alexantria</orig> There we stayed a short time then we got again marching order when we
     started <orig reg="off">of</orig> and crossed the <orig reg="potomac">Petomac</orig> river into
      <orig reg="Maryland">maraland</orig> then we went up on the other side the river about forty
     miles to <orig reg="guard">gard</orig> a bridge we marched one day and one night before we
     stopped and in the morning we came to the bridge there was a party of rebel there they were
     found in line of battle we were also formed to charge but before<pb n="2"/> we came in sight of
     the rebs they retreated across the river we then stayed there two days and two nights then we
     started again for <orig reg="Alexandria">alexantria</orig> when we came to that place we stayed
     there two days then we started for our regiment I let you know that I <orig reg="couldn't"
      >couldent</orig> get any <orig reg="letters">leters</orig> while we were from the regiment and
     had <unclear>hardly</unclear> to send one of the regiment lies three miles from <orig
      reg="Alexandria">alexantria</orig> I also tell that I was sick while we were at
      <unclear>Stofards</unclear> I had headache and <orig reg="diarrhea">direar</orig> I got <orig
      reg="medicine">meadacine</orig> from the doctor and I got well again I also tell you that our
     regiment was in two fights during our <orig reg="absence">absens</orig> but there is only one
     man wounded in our company</p>

    <p>I also did see in your <orig reg="letter">leter</orig> about I don't think that I go to the
      girls<pb n="3"/> until I came home I also let you know that my money is all gone the time when
