                    Hon: Alex. H. H. Stuart, Staunton
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feb: 14, 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Rowney, Hamphire County, West Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">A letter was recently received by my kinsman at Winchester from Mrs. Robert Hull
                    of Baltimore (late Miss Thompson of Staunton) in regard to our family geneaology
                    -- that of the family of Governor Wood, whose great grand newphew I am. I
                    understand that Mrs. Hull is induced to believe us interested in the great
                    English Estate of a decayed Baules and Alderman of London, and further that you
                    have looked into the claim and given some opinion on the subject; it is said to
                    go to the extent of an opinion favorable to a Maryland family's claim, from
                    which family the Baliers and Tapscotts sprang, with the supposition that they
                    were relations of our Winchester family.</p>
<p class="p10">Of this I have doubts, though I beleive some sort of
                    claim of kin used to be set up by the descendents of Judith Wood -- Baliers
                    &amp; Tapscotts in old times.</p>
<p class="p10">But I should be greatly obliged to you for any information you may have on this
                    subject. If you have a copy of the Will you can advise me of the <u>discipliones personarum</u>, the devices in America which
                    would render it very easy to to settle the question of our family rights.</p>
<p class="p10">Our ancestor James Wood was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, came to Virginia Secretary to a colonial
                    Governor -- when Frederick was formed (with Augusta) in 1732, was appointed by
                    patent Clerk of that County. His son James was a general in the Revolution,
                    subsequently Governor of the State, and gave its name to the County in which
                    Parkersburg is situated.</p>
<p class="p10">General Wood's only sister
                    married Matthew Harrison, Clerk of Prince William Co., who was my great
                    grandfather. He was great grandfather of Powell Harrison, of Staunton. One of
                    his daughters by Miss Wood married Obed Waite, of Winchester, the other Colonel Andrew Woodrow, Clerk:
                    of Hampshire, who was my grandfather.</p>
<p class="p10">I should be pleased to learn any particulars on this subject that you may know,
                    meanwhile I obtain the professional advice and assistance of Honorable: <i>[unclear: Reocrady]</i> Johnson, to obtain
                    through the British Legation at <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Washington Correspondence with the
                    Secretary's office in London.</p>
<p class="p10">Obliged as I shall be rendered by any communication of intelligence on this
                    Subject that you can enable me, I write under the supposition, of course, that
                    your retainer by other clients is not in an interest that conflicts with ours.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, With great respect, &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Andrew W. Kercheral</i></p>
