                    Col C. Q. Tompkins
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 5<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Col</p>
<p class="p10">My hope of seeing Dr Brown has been frustrated , &amp; I have been obliged to
                    abandon the trip to Lewisburg. </p>
<p class="p10">The imprudence of my coming to Richmond is more evident than ever. In this part
                    of the country there is no safety for travelers,
                    even along the neighborhood roads. Men travel about, &amp; arrest any
                    citizen they meet without regard to law, and carry the prisoner to the army You
                    of course would be subject to no such danger, but a quiet
                    <i>[unclear: retiracy]</i> is my only safety. Until a few days since, the
                    country from Staunton to Lewisburg offers every facility for the test of M<sup>c</sup>Causland's idea. It is not <u>much</u>
                    changed now. Could you run up to Staunton and consult on the subject of your
                    letters to me? Apprise me by say two or three days notice (getting my <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>letters from town is so uncertain) &amp; I can meet or send for you. Under
                    the apprehensions, &amp; with the view I expressed in my last from the
                    Southwest, I could not venture to visit you with safety. You have no such
                    apprehensions. </p>
<p class="p10">It seems to me that the Governor of my state (whose authority I acknowledge as
                    supreme power of government) might &amp; should protect me from the dangers
                    by which I am beset. I have frequently thought of applying to him for it. I
                    ought not be placed in a position which requires me to do that which is utterly
                    revolting to the purest sentiments of nature or to seek refuge in a prison. Poor
                    old V<sup>a</sup>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> is utterly ignored - she is powerless</p>
<p class="p10">My uncle Mr E S Arnold now in Richmond contemplates a movement similar to that
                    suggested. In accordance with an arrangement made some time ago, he has written
                    to consult with my present intentions. I received his
                    letter by some mail with yours, &amp; will feel it incumbent upon me to
                    apprise <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> him of any arguments I may make. If it should be
                    inconvenient to you, it is not all improbable he would confer with you,
                    &amp; then come up to see me, &amp; report your plans. Like yourself he
                    has something to apprehend from the causes which prevent my coming to Richmond. </p>
<p class="p10">My kind remembrances to the family. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Isaac N. Smith</i></p>
<p class="p10">I have incidentally received information that event which
                        was looked for in the early part of March, has resulted in giving me a son.
                        I have no direct &amp; no other intelligence. My letters have not been
                        sent to me. I have had some suspicion that they had been detained by
                        military authority, but I hope this is a mistake. The condition of my wife
                        &amp; child I know nothing of &amp; am in great anxiety. Don't
                        mention my suspicion. it may be &amp; I earnestly hope is
                    erroneous.</p>
