<p class="p10">December 20<sup>th</sup> 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Greenville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you some time ago, asking you to have David A Parrack subpoenaed in
                    the suit between Joshua Allen and myself, and as you did not do it I did not go
                    as I knew the case could not be tried without my main witness. I want you to
                    have David Parrack subpoenaed and send it me and he will accept it; I would
                    rather the case could be put off until warm weather, but I will go at anytime. I
                    was mistaken about Mr A Beard knowing anything <i>[added: write to me]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>about that horse it was another one that I had sold that Beard knew
                    of, and you need not have him summoned again.</p>
<p class="p10">Beard talked with Allen since he was summoned. Allen said he did not expect to
                    get rid of paying for the horse he only did it to get time out. Beard asked him
                    if he would take 60$ <u>now</u>, he said he did not know
                    whether he would or not. If you can see Mr Beard and get him to talk with Allen,
                    he can get enough out of him to show that he is just trying to cheat me out of
                    the horse, Allen himself is not good for the debt but his security is good and
                    if you will help me to get the debt I will pay you a good fee</p>
<p class="p10">you &amp;c</p>
