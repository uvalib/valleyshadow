<p class="p10">March the 21 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta County Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this beautiful evening to answer your kind letter
     which finds me in good health &amp; hoping the same may be your Condition of life the
     health of the family is as usual &amp; Uncle Peters folks are well John has gotten <sup>home</sup> at last but he will have to start back before long fifteen days soon
     pass off with a soldier Brother William is at home now he gets thirty days by taking a
      <i>[unclear: report]</i> but the time appears short with me I want them to get home to stay
     but the prospect is not much brighter than it was at first for peace although it may take us on
     a surprise like the war did when it first broke out but I'm afraid it
     will not surprise us soon well Jimmy I saw more men the other day than
     I ever saw before at one place in my life &amp; I only seen a handful to what you all have
     seen I always thought I was intended to be an old Maid but I don't
     know the other girls is always quarreling with me about the boys
     &amp; I tell them that I was intended to be an old maid but I think I will wait until some of them that is older than me gets married first as I'm<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>never in a hurry well the army talks of going over into
     Pennsylvania in the spring &amp; then I think I will get a chance to steal over through the lines then to see my connections you spoke of going
     to Canada If it was me I would be right in for that making raids
     &amp; plundering like the yankees have been doing here tell
     Cousin Monroe not to be sending any of his mischievous sauce
     here to me about not writing to him he never thinks worthwhile
     to write a line to me &amp; I'm always
     sending him some word &amp; he knows
     I'm too bashful to write first to a young gentleman If he don't mind he might get an April fool or a valentine or something like that as I'm a glorious hand at mischief Tell him I don't think
     he Claims to be a Connection of mine or he would write as I get letters from all my Cousins but
     Dave &amp; he don't think worthwhile
     to write to me or me to him Jim if you want a wife I have been corresponding with a young lady
     for some time &amp; she wants to marry if it is your request I will Court her for you
     &amp; you Can Marry as soon as the war is over give my love to Monroe &amp; receive a
     due portion for yourself</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your affectionate Cousin</p>
<p class="p10"><i>M M Houser</i></p>
<p class="p10">write soon &amp; all the news don't think
      hard of my nonsense about that lady but tell Cousin A M I will Court her for him or if he
      would rather he had better Come &amp; court her himself as</p>
