<h4>Franklin County: Samuel G. Lane to Edward McPherson,
                    December 14, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In his letter to McPherson, Lane expresses his strong views about the secession
                    crisis and asks McPherson if he might persuade some of his fellow Congressmen to
                    speak to Lane's unnamed group.</p>

<p class="p10">Dec. 14th, 1860</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Chambersburg
                        </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I am requested by A. N. McCulloh to ask you whether you could not get some of
                    Your congressional brethren to lecture before us sometime this season.</p>
<p class="p10">He suggests Mr Pryor, <i>[unclear: Mister]</i> Learis, &amp; Hickman as
                    three.</p>
<p class="p10">Would you sound these gentlemen, &amp;, if you can genteely, find out what
                    they "will do it for?" I thank you for the Smithsonian Report. </p>
<p class="p10">Are you worried about the P. O. applicants? As all your constituents will be
                    suggesting somebody, let me say to you that you
                    must not believe we approve any chap who may have <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> our
                    recommendations. I wish we could get a good man here. My choice, for fitness'
                    sake, is Henry S. Stoner. <i>[unclear: We]</i> feel a good deal of interest in
                    the Union Question, as habit of association if not good citizenship requires,
                    but will be satisfied either to part company peaceably with the South, or to Keep the Stars and Stripes floating over
                    her rebellious soil, by violence. If there were any strength in the government,
                    the insurrectionists would be subdued at any expense of bloodshed; but if it be
                    as weak as its rulers we should 'let them slide' quietly. In a few years, the
                    Manifest Destiny policy will bring them all back as
                    subjugated &amp; repentent states.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. G. Lane</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable
                            Edward McPherson
                    </p>
