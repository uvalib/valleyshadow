                <p>I am now seated on a bench in our Barracks (for the <abbr expan="present"
                    >pres.</abbr> at least) writing on a box of ammunition, surrounded by at least 2
                    hundred soldiers, all talking &amp; laughing so much that I hardly know
                    whether I can write or not. But I will endeavor to do the best I can under the
                    circumstances as I have just finished reading yours &amp; <orig
                        reg="Jimmi's">Jimmis</orig> letter which believe me was a source of much
                    pleasure &amp; I shall proceed immediately to answer it for fear that an
                    opportunity will not present itself soon again. The 5th Regiment (of which we
                    constitute a part) arrived here last night about dark <pb n="2"/>after <orig
                        reg="traveling">travelling</orig> about 22 miles from Charlestown. The day
                    before we marched from Shepardstown a distance of 12 miles starting from <orig
                        reg="there">their</orig> at about five oclock in the evening &amp;
                    arrived at our camp at 12 in the night. lay out in the woods on the ground like
                    "Hogs" without anything to eat. This is the way soldiering goes.</p>
                <p>about one half of our men were so much fatigued. &amp; their feet so sore
                    that they could scarcely walk. my feet have blisters on now, as big as
                        <unclear>ten</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. You have no idea how much we have to endure &amp; yet I
                    fear its nothing to what it will be. But if I have my health I care not what
                    comes I can stand it as long as the <pb n="3"/>most of them. I have no idea when
                    we will leave this place. The Bridge together with all the <orig reg="public"
                        >publick</orig> buildings at the Ferry have been burnt by our troops
                    &amp; the place is now vacated entirely. Also the bridge at shepardstown was
                    burnt the evening we left by <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Doyle such a
                    destruction of Property. not less than <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of <unclear>it</unclear>
                    destroyed &amp; what <unclear>will</unclear> it be by the time the wars are
                    ended? I had a little excursion over into Maryland the night before we left
                    Shepardstown, some 20 of our men went out on a scout to see if we could find any
                    of the <orig reg="Yankees">Yankey's</orig> I tell you we ran a considerable risk
                    nevertheless we went. We <pb n="4"/>were at a place where a sentinal had been
                    posted the night before but did not see anything of him. Then was a company of
                    35 camp<unclear>ers</unclear> about 3 miles from the bridge &amp; if the
                        <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    <orig reg="would have">had'v</orig> let us we would <unclear>tried</unclear>
                    them any how one <unclear>round</unclear>. But we had orders not <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">to</add> go farther than a mile &amp; half - consequently
                    we got no fight. I must stop for the present, it is so warm &amp; I am so
                    crowded that I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> write more. if we <orig reg="don't"
                        >dont</orig> leave directly I will write you again &amp; give all the
                    news I can. As for the note enclosed - I hope <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                    >you</add> will not think any thing more about it. I'll say nothing more myself.
                    &amp; believe me to be as ever <hi rend="underline">yours</hi>. My love to
                    all,</p>
