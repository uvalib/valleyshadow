                </opener>

                <p>I would like to know if my tools are at home and further as I have not written to
                    John Markey since I am out whether it would <orig reg="suit">suite</orig> you to
                    pay him some money as he may be getting uneasy but if you cannot handy do
                    it-why, it is right. I promised that as soon as I got my bounty I would send him
                    some money but I have not got my bounty yet nor can not tell whether ever I will
                    get any bounty or not.</p>
                <p>I expect that I will soon be <orig reg="paid">paide</orig> off again then I will
                    send you what I can spare.</p>
                <p>I would like to have that watch as soon as <orig reg="possible">possivle</orig>
                    and a key for it.</p>
                <p>If you know where Abraham and Ashway is you can tell them that our Regiment lays
                    about 4 miles south of the camp where they came to see me, as soon as I can find
                    them I will go and see them.-That is if I get the chance for we have a great
                    deal of picket duty to do and for me to get home is impossible. Our old men will
                    hardly get home. The new men is not entitled to a furlough till next winter.</p>
                <p>But I trust that we will all get home before that time--not my will but thine, O
                    Lord, be done.</p>
                <p>I would <orig reg="think">thik</orig> it would be better if there would be a
                        <orig reg="housekeeper">house keeper</orig> at home. It does not <orig
                        reg="suit">suite</orig> me to be at home but I think it would <orig
                        reg="suit">suite</orig> the family-to be at home to keep house and take care
                    of things. It does not look well to see a house and nobody in it.</p>
                <p>I have a great deal to talk about but I have a poor way to tell it so I will not
                    say much.</p>
                <p>Now, I will say that if Brother John is going to school tell him that when he can
                    use a desk to write on like mine then he can play soldier. I lay my knapsack on
                    the ground and then I set on it. Take my in plate-lay it on my knee with the
                    bottom side up and then I write on it.</p>
                <p>No wonder if my letter is dirty and greasy and <orig reg="written">witten</orig>
                    miserable poor but this is a soldier style.</p>
                <p>I must close for the present. It rained all last night. It is now clearing
                    off-only our camp is very windy.</p>
                <p>I wrote John A. Horn 2 letters. I am anxious to know if he got them.</p>
                <p>No more but give my <abbr expan="respect">resp..</abbr> to all <orig
                        reg="inquiring">enquiring</orig> friends. You will soon hear from me again.</p>
