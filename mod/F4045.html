<h4>Franklin County: Thomas Gordon Pollock to his
                    Father, June 30, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Thomas G. Pollock describes the beautiful and plentiful surroundings in Franklin
                    county, the high morale of the Confederate troops and their reverence for Robert
                    E. Lee. He also notes that he himself has seen no cases of looting or plundering
                    in violation of Lee's orders.</p>

<p class="p10">June 30th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Headquarters Kempers Brigade, Chambersburg PA</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Father --</p>
<p class="p10">A mail carrier will leave for the Confederate States tonight and I hasten to write this to accompany him on his doubtful journey
                    and then to encounter still more doubtful fate of letters from Culpepper Court House to Fauquier. We passed the Potomac at
                    Williamsport on the 26th and entered this town on the suburbs of which we are
                    now encamped on the 28th--nearly in the rear of the army. You can form some idea
                    of the discipline now when after a long days march when the rolls are called on
                    entering bivouac but one single absentee is reported from a whole Brigade. The
                    constrast between the condition of the army now and last year when we entered
                    Maryland is most encouraging--Every one noticed it &amp; spoke of it in
                    Hagerstown. It is almost amusing to witness the anxious stare with which we are
                    regarded as our sunburnt motley dressed regiments but moving in closed ranks
                    with the cadenced step to the tune of Dixie and with enfield muskets glistening
                    and the red battle flag inscribed all over with the names of our victories pass
                    through the thoroughfare of one of the numerous towns. Sadness is on the
                    countenance of all but some try to look fierce and angry and tell us confidently
                    we will never get back. It is a beautiful country overflowing with wealth
                    &amp; fatness. Every inch of ground seems to be producing something. The
                    army is revelling in good eating such as the poor fellows have not so much heard
                    of since the beginning of the war. But all this regularly and in good order. I
                    have heard of no case of outrage to person or property. Such is General Lees order. I enclose you the last, and what
                        General Lee says the army does down to the lowest
                    private because they say "I reckon he knows." The perfect reverence the soldiers
                        <i>[unclear: feel]</i> for his orders is only equalled by their faith in
                    him. It strikes me as a perfect picture of faith. Here they are penetrating the
                    heart of a hostile country leaving their homes beyond broad rivers and the
                    largest of the enemy's armies while in front of them
                    is gathering all of resistance that can be obtained by a power fruitful of every
                    element of military power. Yet they are as happy and as secure in their feeling
                    as if they were already won--simply because they have an almost fanatical
                    confidence in their cause &amp; their leader. Important movements are on
                    foot but it would be imprudent to trust them to the doubtful fortunes of this
                    letter.</p>
