<h4>Augusta County: Samuel Franklin Carson to
                         Unknown, [undated]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carson writes about his love of music.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p class="p10"> Music<br> Music has charms to soothe the savage breast,<br> To soften
                         rocks, and bend the knotted oak <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">It is difficult for me to do adequate justice to a theme so extensive, or to
                         advance any thing new upon it, since (it is that) all the great poets from
                              Shakespeare down have combined their
                         masterly inte<i>[added: l]</i>lects in extolling its
                         glory, and sung their sweetest <i>[unclear: buys]</i> when animated by its
                              <u>genius</u>; so let us be confined to a few
                         points - a very few, and be careful that our muses do<i>[deleted: se]</i> not likewise incite us to take up our harps to sing of its
                         enhancing spells. For a man never feels more sublime and poet-like than
                         when intoxicated by the voluptuous strains of music; and we who do not wish
                         to deal in <i>[deleted: rhymetrical]</i><i>[added: rythmical]</i> composition had better be on our guard when under its
                         influence, lest from the impulse of the moment some sweet little verses
                         come spontaneously forth.</p>
<p class="p10"> Oh; music, sphere descending maid,<br> Friend of pleasure, wisdom's aid.<br> how <i>[unclear: just]</i>
                         look there, from singing I can <i>[added: refrain]</i>
                         scarce <br> Hush, my <i>[unclear: lyne]</i> I shall not sing again.<br>
                         Who can properly estimate the effect of music upon the <u>human</u> heart, or the magnitude of the great end for which it was
                         created. In it there is nothing to incite us <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>deeds; but on the
                         other hand it animates those more exalted passions of the heart, creates
                         glorious sensations, and inspires us</p>
<p class="p10">"_____ to noble God like deeds."<br> Music lulls the fretting babe to sleep
                         - wakens youthful aspirations - destroys the plethora of the sorrowing
                         heart - reanimates the christian's zeal - creates mental inspiration -
                         electrifies the poet's fancy - makes the statesman
                         more eloquent - the patriot more devoted and arms the warrior with twofold courage to face the battle storm, to
                         rush undaunted upon his foe shouting "liberty or death," and does a
                         thousand other things too numerous to mention. To me there is music in
                         almost everything I admire, to me there is
                         music in a pretty woman's eye, in her sweet voice, and in her smile,
                         especially if she is one that I Love. <br> "Ther's music on the sighing of
                         a reed,<br> Ther's music in the gushing of a <i>[unclear: hill]</i>,<br>
                         Ther's music in <u>all</u> things, if man had ears<br>
                         There earth is but an echo of the spheres."<br> Then to what shall we
                         compare a man who has neither taste nor ear for music? I cannot better
                         express myself upon him, than in the following lines from Shakespeare;-</p>
<p class="p10">The man that hath no music in his soul<br> Is fit for treason, stratagem
                         &amp; spoils,<br> The motions of his spirit are as dull as night,<br>
                         Let no such man be trusted.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>If these lines be true, and those on the other hand who are lovers
                         of music and are <i>[unclear: rotaries]</i> at her alter are the reverse,
                         a circumspective observer might think that there were never an <u>honester</u> set of boys on earth than these Erskine
                         boys; not only honest in their dealings with mankind, but as honest and
                         industrious fiddlers as you'll find any where. The poet might imagine, that
                         Old Orpheus, or a shade rather in wandering from Phitoes regions had
                         accidentally shed a musical spell over these classic hills which our young
                         "music asters" have caught, or then some vagrant disciple of spells in
                         wondering over the earth had here seated the mortally contagious mania
                         musica. It is a wonder that these <i>[unclear: 
                              oaks
                         ]</i> around here have not long since been so charmed as to bow their
                         majestic heads to congratulate the youthful musicians.</p>
