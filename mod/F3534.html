<p class="p10">Assistant Surgeon D. D. Swift of the 126 Reg. Pa. Vol. detailed to act in 91st
                    Reg. Pa. Vol having applied to me for a medical
                    certificate on which to ground an application for an extension of his leave of
                    absence given near Falmouth Va., Jan. 14th 1863 by command of Maj. Gen. Hooker
                    and signed by Joseph Dielnson assistant adjutant
                    general.</p>
<p class="p10">I do hereby certify, that I have carefully examined this officer and find him
                    affected with chronic Diarrhea which has impaired his
                    strength to such an extent that he is unable to walk without assistance and that
                    in consequence thereof he is unfit for duty. I further declare my belief that he
                    will not be able to resume his duties in a less period than one month and that
                    to travel to a distant military post in his present condition would greatly
                    endanger his life. </p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>B. F. Lides</i></p>
<p class="p10">I hereby certify that B. F. Lides whose name is signed to the above certificate is a physician in good
                        standing. he has been in the united States service as assistant surgeon and
                        was on account of bad health honorably discharged a few months
