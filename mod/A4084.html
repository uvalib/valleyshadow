<p class="p10">Staunton Va --</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We are about to start for Mt. Crawford -- I did not come home yesterday, my horse being too
     weary &amp; it was thought we could start at daylight today -- I hope you will not feel
     much disappointment, though it would have given me the greatest pleasure to have been able to
     be home once more -- I hope though it will not be long until I get home again -- I do not need
     the clothes I left at home as I put on others in their place. Get along as well as you can --
     get Snyder to cut up your wood &amp; Capt Sterrett to haul it &amp; leave it for me to
     settle -- If you want any more money call on Dr. Hamilton for it -- but only get it if you need
     it. I could not send William out as we did not stay as I expected -- I
     made arrangements for Bishop Glossbrenner to bring you in to see the troops, but it will be too
     late, events hurry us off sooner than it was anticipated<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I leave most of my baggage
     with Maj. Bell as do all of us -- &amp; he is to take care of it -- I shall not give you
     more to trouble for then you already have -- Mrs. Gen Rodes has gone out to William Nelson's to stay --. Go up to the Bishops &amp; get some
     cherries -- he said he would send &amp; bring you up -- You will get all the Richmond news
     in the Papers -- Mr. Col. William Bell is to be buried today --</p>
<p class="p10"> Be of good cheer &amp; I hope this campaign will end the war &amp; in God'sgood providence bring me to remain in my quiet home &amp; bear my
     portion of its cares -- &amp; free from the double load of duty imposed by these cruel
     times Write to me to the Care of Lt. Gen. Early Head Quarters
     Valley District, through Maj. Bell -- Good bye my loved ones &amp; may the Great Protector
     be with &amp; defend you -- I shall write as often as I can &amp; you do the same </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
