                <p>I was taken down with fever at New Market about the middle of August and sent to
                    Staunton for treatment. Two weeks ago I was sufficiently recovered to come to
                    this place. I am now well and will return to duty in a few days. Mary is with
                    me. Her health is still very delicate. She <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr>

                    my ability to accomplish anything. I have written to <abbr expan="Governor"
                    >Gov.</abbr> Wise invoking his aid &amp; hope it will be more potent than my
                    efforts. Some of your friends have been killed since your capture, though I
                    believe none with whom you were very intimate. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    Lang &amp; Thornhill were killed below Winchester week before last. Poor

                    from the Division Commander a few days ago for gallantry. I would say more if it
                    were not contraband. Ma was to see me in Staunton. All were well at home. I
                    expect to see them next week. I have laid aside a Salem letter for you which I
                    suppose will "keep" till you get back.</p>

                    his regards to you. His brother Rodes is a prisoner. If at Johnson's Island make
