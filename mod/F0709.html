 Dear Friend  
 </p>
<p class="p10">  
 It is with pleasure <br>  
 that I take up my pencil to write <br>  
 you a few line to let you know <br>  
 that I am well and I get along fine but today is very cold.  <br>  
 I was out on picket night <br>  
 before last and was rather astonished when I   
 came in to get   
 <br>  
 a letter and such a fine lot of papers <br>  
 it came very handy   
 <br>  
 and I am very much obliged <br>  
 to you.  There is not any thing <br>  
 that would have suited me   
 <br>  
 better   
 at this time.  Your letter   
 <br>  
 gave me great satisfaction   
 <br>  
 and I am glad that the singing <br>  
  is getting   
 along so well.  There  
 <br>  
 has been no snow here since   
   
       
   
   
 <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitDon3b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitDon3b.gif"></center></a><br><br>  

   
 I came out but it has been hit by <i>[unclear: time]</i> and   
   
 <br>  
 cold but with the shelter we   
  have we get along right    
 <br>  
 well. A  
   
  few days ago we had   
   
 inspection of the whole   
 <br>  
 Corp it was a fine sight.  Today   
 there was Division   
 <br>  
 Drill which was fine.  There  
   
  is a move at   
 the present  
 <br>  
 and at this time they are moving by thousands towards   
 <br>  
 the Rappahannock  
 River and we are at this   
 time furnished <br>  
 with 3 Day Rations and 60 rounds of  
 cartridge to move   
 <br>  
 at an early hour   
 tomorrow morning and before 48 hours <br>  
 more there may be a very   
 heavy Battle fought. The Men are  
 <br>  
 somewhat  
 Depressed in spirits owing to the last defeat at   
 <br>  
 the River but yet they will go.  I think   
 I shall be <i>[unclear: along]</i><br>  
 nothing happening   
 more than I know.  It may be the last   
 <br>  
 letter I shall write to  
 you but we   
 hope for   
 <br>  
 the best if there   
 is a fight and I shall do my duty   
 <br>  
 if I know   
 how.  There is   
 much that I could   
 write  
 at present<br>  
 But I have not the time as the orders for to march just   
 <br>  
 came in a few minutes ago and I shall  
 write home yet today   
 <br>  
 and I shall close hoping that you will excuse me for <br>  
 this time and my mistake hoping that you will write soon   
 <br>  
 to me and  
 remember me to your Parent and all   
 <br>  
 inquiring friends and I ever Remain  
 </p>
<p class="p10">Your Humble Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thad Donely</i></p>
<p class="p10">  
 My kindest regards to all the young   
 <br>  
 folk at singing and if any of them  
 feel   
 <br>  
 Disposed to drop me a few lines I will   
 <br>  
 be happy to answer and tell all I   
 know of   
 <br>  
 old Virginia   
 and of war.  The vast amount   
 <br>  
 of men and gun on the move today looks   
 <br>  
 as though we could get   
 across although  
 <br>  
  they are well fortified.  
   
 Yours Truly <br>   
 Thad D  
   
 Please accept   
 my   
 <br>  
 thanks for the paper   
 <br>  
 you sent me and all that I can   
 <br>  
 wish is that I will be able to write more  
 <br>  
 to you in the future.    
   
 Address as usually<br>  
 My Dinner  
 is  
 ready and I must eat.    
   
 I will inclose you a card <br>  
 that was got   
 in Fredericksburg at the last fight<a href="#n1">[1]</a>  
   
 I inclose some tobacco   
 seed<a href="#n2">[2]</a>
