                    <p>I will vary the general rule by writing to you instead of Mother &amp;
                         thereby give you the pleasure of <del hand="h1">w-----</del> opening the
                         letter before you get home.</p>
                    <p>First I know you want to know how we are. I am very well only a little too
                         cold. Georgie is out here with me &amp; as well as ever. Mr Smith has
                         taken a great fancy to him &amp; says he likes him better than any
                         Cochran he ever saw. Willie is in Staunton I believe he is very well
                         &amp; intended going to Mr Swopes <orig reg="today">to day</orig>- Howe
                         Peyton I saw yesterday<pb n="2"/> he had been a little sick but was getting
                         very well He had not been in bed at all.</p>
                    <p>The 4<hi rend="super">th</hi> was celebrated here in a grand style. The
                         Winchester company were here &amp; their uniform was that worn in 1776.
                         Buckskin pants &amp; large boots &amp; ruffle shirts. I admired it
                         more than any I saw at all. The Charlottesville company was very pretty
                         &amp; the best drilled by far. They were so much pleased that the <abbr
                              expan="Captain">Cap<hi rend="super">t</hi>.</abbr> went off &amp;
                         left them all in Staunton. The dinner was in the bottom of Mr <orig
                              reg="Grey's">Greys</orig> yard &amp; he invited us up to his house
                         where we took our dinner &amp; saw <orig reg="everything"
                         >every-thing</orig> without being in the crowd at all<pb n="3"/> Of course
                         there were a few fights All the Mickies, Harmans, &amp; Garbers got in
                         a fuss with the "West <orig reg="Augusta">Agusta</orig> Guards", because a
                              <del hand="h1">Garber</del>
                         <add hand="h1" place="inline">Harman</add> got drunk &amp; tried to
                         force through the guard &amp; the officer pointed his musket &amp;
                         threatened to fire. <abbr expan="Brother">Bo</abbr> Jimmie said out loud
                         that "he thought Mr <del hand="h1">Garber</del>
                         <add hand="h1" place="inline">Harman</add> ought to be put in jail
                         &amp; his father heard it &amp; told Jimmie that he <del hand="h1"
                              >inter</del>
                         <add hand="h1" place="inline">took</add> that as a personal insult
                         &amp; would see him, but Jim in his way laughed it off &amp; said
                         it was nothing but the truth.</p>

                         Cousin Sue Baldwin invited them to her house last night. I don't know how
                         long they will stay in Town The Peytons are quite delighted with cousin
                         Campbell &amp; cousin John Preston; so much so that they have invited
                         them up every day &amp; evening since they have been here.</p>
                    <p>Aunt Sarah &amp; Lizzie are fixing to go to Bath. They will go some time

                         Last night we had to have a large fire &amp; this morning it is still
