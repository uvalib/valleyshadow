<h4>Augusta: William Brand to Kate Armentrout, September
                    15, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William describes some of the recent troop movements and engagements in northern
                    Virginia; he mentions some Union prisoners who seemed uninterested in continuing
                    the war. He also suggests that Kate does not take his affections for her
                    seriously.</p>

<p class="p10">My dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">As I have not heard from you for a long time, I have
                    seated my self this beautiful Sabbath morning for
                    the purpose of dropping you a few lines. I have been
                    looking for a letter from you for some time past. Indeed, I have not received a from Augusta for the last three weeks. I
                    begin to think that I am <i>[unclear: uttrably]</i> forsaken no one can tell
                    the pleasure that it affords, a poor soldier on receiving a letter from his friends &amp; acquaintances. It
                    enlivens his mind &amp; makes him energetic in
                    performing his duties there is no<i>[deleted: t]</i>
                    news of interest to write our advance pickets are
                    in two miles of the Arlington heights night before
                    last Stuart's
                    Cavalry seen their advance
                    guard across the river. Colonel Stuart said he was in
                    two miles of Washington <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    they took fifteen or twenty Prisoners. John Plunket went
                    down to fairfax Court house he said he had an interview with some of the
                    Prisoners two Lieutenants &amp; some privates they
                    said they
                    were glad that they had been taken prisoners for they did not care which way the victory went that they had been forced to come on the soil of Virginia
                    they said that old Abe promised to keep them in the city for to protect it and after he got them
                        there he made them go wherever he pleased.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no doubt that there will
                    be a forward movement on our side before long.
                        Artillery is going down almost every day it is said that we can burn Alexandria Georgetown &amp;
                    part of Washington from halls hill, that was taken the other night it is said
                    that we can knock the Washington Aqueduct all to
                    pieces. The red flag waves in full view of the white house every day I reckon that it is very provoking to old Abe, when he
                    takes his spy glass &amp; looks over into Virginia and there see what he calls
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the rebel flag waving right under his nose.</p>
<p class="p10">We just heard that we would have to move down the road
                    about four miles. I am glad of it though we will be leaving a very nice camp and a healthy one. We will be
                        nearer the enemy.</p>
<p class="p10">There are three men walking up and down our regiment
                    carrying
                    their
                    knapsacks as a punishment for their misconduct. I <i>[added: would]</i> as
                        lief be shot I believe there is great injustice done to our Company
                    since the battle of the 21th of June, enough to break
                    our Company up but hope it will not have that effect for I hope yet to see the Augusta Grays march
                    back to Greenville after peace is made. I would like very much to see <u>you</u> and open my whole
                    <u>heart</u> to you but some times I
                        <u>think</u> you care nothing for <u>me</u> what <u>ever</u>, then it cannot be that <u>lover</u> so <u>pure</u> can be treated
                    with <u>coldness</u>
                    there seems yet a happy <u>future</u> spread out before me. And I shall enjoy the Camp prize of freedom. I must soon bring my letter to a close. My health
                    is very good &amp; hope this short <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> letter will find you enjoying
                    good health. Your Brother is well and hearty my
                    Brothers are both well your friend James V. is well &amp; hearty.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all inquiring friends. I ask an
                        interest in your prayers that I may hold out
                        faithful
                    until the end. Write soon as I am ever anxious to hear from you.</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more but remain your true and sincere <u>lover</u>,</p>
