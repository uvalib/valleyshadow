<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Circular Letter of O. O.
                    Howard, May 15, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Howard urges that steps be taken to stop intemperance among blacks in Virginia
                    and South Carolina. In the view that certain temperance societies refuse to
                    organize in black communities, he proposes the formation of new temperance
                    societies, named for Lincoln. McDonnell forwarded a copy of the circular to
                    Jackson.</p>

<p class="p10">May 15th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Washington</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Circular Letter</p>
<p class="p10">I have information from Virginia and South Carolina that intemperance among the
                    freedmen is on the increase, already a movement is on foot in this City, having
                    in view a thorough organization so as to enable the colored people to exert all
                    the power possible to prevent the evil in question.</p>
<p class="p10">I find that the "Sons of Temperance" in their Grand Divisions, retain the old
                    bigotry, and decline to extend their order to save men of dark skins from
                    drunkenness, except it be done upon condition of complete and enforced
                    separation.</p>
<p class="p10">I therefore hope that the officers and agents of this Bureau, and the agents of
                    the different benevolent associations working for the elevation of the colored
                    people, will take immediate measures for the organization of associations of
                    colored people, never excluding the white, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>under the name of "The
                    Lincoln Temperance Society". There is a great appropriateness in the name, from
                    the well known character of Mr. Lincoln, and from the love the colored pople
                    bear him.</p>
<p class="p10">Please see to it, that officers or Agents of this Bureau, who may be intemperate
                    men, be immediately reported to this office.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient
                        Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>(signed) O. O. Howard<br>Major General
                        &amp; Commissioner</i></p>
<p class="p10">Official copy furnished for the guidance and action of
                        Mr. Thomas P. Jackson, Agent<br>John A.
