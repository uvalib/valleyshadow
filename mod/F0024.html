<p class="p10">January 2<sup>nd</sup> 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Bealton Station Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">As you see by the heading I have arrived at the regiment safe and sound. My
                    health is still improving. I wish Bell was improving as well. Write as soon as
                    you get this &amp; let me know how she is getting. I felt more uneasiness
                    about her since leaving home than I did when there &amp; am sorry that I did
                    not do more for her, but still I hope she will get well to welcome me home again
                    if my life is spared to get there. The Infantry here had built very nice
                    quarters &amp; were moved away, so when I got here I found the boys snugly
                    fixed. The Doctor has a good stone fireplace &amp; a slab or puncheon floor
                    in his tent making it very comfortable. He has a bunk built up &amp; covered
                    with hay. I will tell you in the morning how good a bed it is.</p>
<p class="p10">I left the next morning after I got to fathers. Got in Washington City yesterday
                    evening about six o'clock. Got on the cars again this
                    morning at nine &amp; got here about two &amp; a half. I gave William Potter his boots. He has not called for his
                    bundle yet. I will see George McDavid &amp; him in the morning.</p>
<p class="p10">January 3<sup>d</sup> Well I must tell you
                    about the bed &amp; I must tell you I had a good night'srest, warm &amp; comfortable. Still it is not a feather bed. George
                    McDavid is looking well this morning. His brother Dan was here while I was at
                    home. Will Potter has his boots on &amp; is very much pleased with them.
                    Will Carrol is still stout with the exception of a slight diarrhea. As a general thing the health is good here.</p>
<p class="p10">I got a letter from David that Elisa wrote before I arrived home. She says that
                    David would be helped if he would be caught out in the draft all alone. The
                    regiment is out at this time on a raid, the Doctor &amp; sick &amp;
                    those who have not good horses remaining in camp. I wish you to write soon
                    &amp; let me know how Bell is getting. I would like so much to hear of her
                    getting well.</p>
<p class="p10">Josey has not learned to play Yankee Doodle on his drum. Lucy &amp; Bell will
                    soon learn to read on their cards &amp; they must take good care of them so
                    that Jimmy can have the use of them. I must write to Dave soon. I have nothing
                    more at present but remain </p>
<p class="p10">your most affectionate husband </p>
