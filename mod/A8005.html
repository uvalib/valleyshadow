<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">30th: Nov. 1852</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Stuart.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been wishing and intending to write you for some time past, but Courts Banks &amp;
     c. have interposed to prevent my carrying it out. our Superior Court is just about to adjourn
     the Judge being compelled to leave in the morning: to attend the
     District or intermediate Court of appeals, which meets tomorrow at Charlottesville. the whole
     of our Term has been occupied with criminals, four have been convicted, one a hung jury in, and
     one acquited, one of the four convicted has a motion <i>[unclear: depending]</i> for a new
     trial, which the judge is to decide this morning: not a civil common
     law case was tried, some few chancery cases were disposed of. The court will adjourn to the
     31st January: when an extra term will be held extending if necessary to
     the 1st March.</p>
<p class="p10">We have been beset with troubles and difficulties about our Cashier on the day we were to
     elect one the friend of Mr. Jns. Wayt of Waynesboro: placed him in nomination though a very worthy man, I could not think him for many reasons suited to
     the place, but his friends Colonel Crawford, William A Bell, &amp; J B. Breckinridge pressed his claims most earnestly. Misters Price, Eskridge &amp; myself those of Handsen,
      <i>[unclear: Clerk]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>&amp; <i>[unclear: Court]</i> chose of Mr. Toms. after
     serious ballotings, finding we could make no choice between them, Eskridge placed the name of
     N. K. Trout in nomination, which after two ballots resulted in his election by a vote of 7 to
     1. I voting against him for Handsen, he not having been consulted he asked he might be allowed
     a few days to make up his mind, which was allowed, and he finally declined his relatives old
     Mr. Stribling, Doctor L. S. Nichols, Jeff &amp; myself all being
     opposed to his accepting. So contest came on again, between the three first named candidates,
     and resulted as before, being divided as at first &amp; we adjourned over to Thursday last
     in order that we might learn Sheffeys views, which we did. Toms was his first &amp; Handsen
     his second choices. we met again and after two ballots, it resulted in the unanimous election
     of Toms. Handsen I preferred to any other on various accounts, some of which you &amp; me
     spoke of when in Washington, but it seemed as though some Gentleman who
     he had expected to have voted for him, would not go for him, finding this to be the case I
     finally voted for Tom's, who I have every reason to believe will make us an excellent Cashier,
     he has been with us for several days &amp; all seem to be much pleased with him, we set out
     tomorrow for Washington, Alexandria &amp; York &amp; will probably see you I have
     requested him to see <i>[unclear: Chall ]</i>Brothers &amp; <i>[unclear: Selden]</i>
     &amp; Co. we have to elect<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> a clerk on Saturday, thus far we have poor materials
     out of which to choose.</p>
<p class="p10">There was some little dissatisfaction expressed by some few individuals on the first
     announcement of the appointment of Marshall for the Western District of Virginia, but it
     appeared in a measure to have died away, but the effort is now being made to get up excitement
     about it, and to put in a thorough bred Loco. It is represented that Ambler was not a resident
     of the Western District, that you could find no man in it fit for the office, &amp; had to
     go to the Eastern District &amp; to a County that have wished a Marshall for the East District. they say he was living in Fauq &amp; carrying on a cheese
     factory. that all Mr. Mason influence cannot and shall not save him. Letcher &amp; Judge
     Kenney were here yesterday quite <i>[unclear: wrathy]</i> on the occasion. I said to Letcher I
     had heard that Dr Graham would be a prominent candidate for the office he replied he did not
     know, said General D B Layne was the most so he thought, you may rest
     assured powerful efforts will be make to defeat Ambler. The office is a good one &amp; many
     want it.</p>
<p class="p10">Taylor got home last night &amp; improved a good deal on his trip. he tells me you are
     talking of purchasing a farm near Washington, I hope with no view to a residence. old Mr <i>[deleted: ]</i> yesterday said you was going to Baltimore: to <i>[deleted: ]</i>, as that. I hope she is mistaken &amp; that we shall have you back among us in
     March.</p>
<p class="p10">The health of Staunton is now pretty good. we have had some right severe weather, but today is pleasant.</p>
<p class="p10">The Judge has refused the new trial.</p>
<p class="p10">With my best respects to Mrs. Stuart &amp; the family of Harper</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully &amp; truly<br>Yrs</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Wm Kinney</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Rich Jos Wood administrator to whom the money for the sale of the Ballards negro is coming is <u>very pressing</u> for it. I have mentioned it to Young several times. I
      told Robert I expected it would certainly be paid during this Court. Let me hear from you
      about it.</p>
