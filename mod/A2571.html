<p class="p10">Sunday Morning, Dec. 21<sup>st</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Moss Neck --</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I have a chance to send you a line this morning, and so will gladly avail myself of it, for I
     know your thoughts are running hither, in spite of anything else that may be transpiring
     &amp; mine are morning and evening going to my pleasant home by the pond side &amp;
     wishing I were there to bask in the sunshine of those I love -- but it is otherwise ordered,
     and so I will not complain, but only for the thousandth time wish the evil days were over and
     our land was enjoying its days of rest: come they must, come they will, before long, the hand
     of a merciful Providence is guiding us, by ways we know not of, to the long-wished-for day of
     freedom -- all things cheer us -- the Vandal host that came with pollution &amp; desolation
     has been driven back with a loss four fold greater than our own &amp; now skulks between
     the deep inlets of the Potomac &amp; Rapahannock in constant alarm lest deep rivers may not
     keep back the "vast Rebel Army" We thank God for this fourth deliverance, "by a stretched out
     arm" from, from the swarm that would settle down upon our vitals &amp; consume them if they
     could -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> The enemy is still opposite to us, but removed from the river, and nothing
     of interest is transpiring -- I am very busy making a map of this county, which I hope to
     finish in two or three days, and then I want to ask the General to let me come home for a week
     to attend the fixing of your comfort for the coming year -- I think he will grant it, but
     cannot tell -- Boswell has applied for leave of absence to go to Alabama for a month -- and he
     has gone to Gen. Lee now to have it approved -- I hope he may get it. I reckon my letter about
     my box did not get home in time to have it get back to Staunton -- I have not heard anything
     from you about it, and so take it for granted that it did not reach in time. I am doing very
     well though, on bread &amp; coffee -- now &amp; then a little potato soup -- think my
     health is as good as ever it was -- though I am working very closely, hoping to get a respite
     for a few days that I may come to my own sweet nest for a few days of this rapidly passing
     winter. If you have not sent my eatables &amp;c, let them rest until I write again. I have
     not been able to get any washing done since I left home -- </p>
<p class="p10"> Yesterday 14 persons, in good circumstances, but refugees from destruction, from
     Fredericksburg &amp; Port Royal, staying in an old house near here, sent to be a morsel of
     food -- they had not a single thing to eat -- <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10"> Harris goes this moment -- so good bye and God bless you </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">Do write</p>
