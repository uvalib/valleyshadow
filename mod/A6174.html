<h4>Augusta County: Achilles J. Tynes to Hattie Tynes, August 9,
     1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter Achilles Tynes describes McCausland's raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, and
     the attack made upon the raiding party by Averill's troops.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 9th, 1864.</p>
<p class="p10">Headquarters McCausland's Brigade<br>Mount Jackson, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear little Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">Having heard that I was wounded, killed or captured or all three at Moorfield, in the recent
     inexcusable surprise at that place, and well knowing that Madam Rumor would lose nothing by
     distance, I hastened on my arrival here yesterday to telegraph you which I hope you have received.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, we were to march at daylight on the 7th but ere it was yet light the Yankees under
     Averill were pouring into our camp, cavalry and infantry, and Johnson's men, rushing across the
     river in a regular stampede through this brigade produced the
     wildest scene of confusion I ever saw; and the result was one of the wildest stampedes I think
     of this or any other war. It is disgraceful beyond endurance and perfectly inexcusable. The
     enemy came in through Johnson's camp and his side of the River. He, I think, ought to be
     dismissed from service, ignominously, at once. I shall not in these confused and badly written
     notes give you any particulars but will do so tomorrow. Our loss will be pretty heavy; some two
     or three hundrend men, 800 or 900 horses, 4 pieces of artillery and several wagons and ambulances. I can't say yet who is captured, but many valuable
     officers and men are missing, among them all of Johnson's staff, including Captain Clark. Colonel Graham is also missing.
     We hope many of them may come in as they were scattered all over the mountains of Hardy, 40
     miles from here. Major Noonan is slightly wounded. We, McCausland's
     Brigade, attempted to form and hold the Ford but the enemy were
     firing upon us and Johnson's Brigade stampeding through us and there
     was no chance, and the fact is what fighting we did do had better not be done for we might have
     saved more men and horses by attempting no rally. A part of each command took the Winchester Road and the balance the Harrisonburg Road. I took the former
     with the artillery of our Brigade. Johnson's was in the enemy hands
     already and been moved by them across the river. Most of our Brigade also took this road. The other one runs through Moorfield, up the River. Ours
     left the river at right angles. We had proceeded but a short distance before the enemy
     compelled us to take the mountains, capturing our guns and cutting down some of the drivers
     from the horses. I was with the rear gun, helping Colonel Radford and
     others to clear away the lead horses of the Cavalry and form a rear
     guard on foot, and so got to use the piece; but 'twas no use. Nothing could be done. I soon
     found myself surrounded and after six vain efforts to get my pistol to fire, it having become
     damp in the recent rain, I plunged into the woods with horse and Harry for my <u>watchword</u>, and after one of the <sup>most</sup> painful and
     toilsome marches, principally on foot and through or over the most rugged mountains for 40
     miles, I am here and except (for) complete exhaustion from fatigue and exposure to severe labor
     and storms of rain am as well as could be expected. </p>
<p class="p10">Be not uneasy dear, I shall recover soon. It would not have been so hard upon me, but I had
     been unwell for some days and Dr. Bee had told me that I must come out in an ambulance and was
     out before day hunting one for me when we were attacked. I received
     yours of June 10th in Maryland on this trip. I will answer your query
     in my next. Most of these notes were written hurriedly and on horseback, some marching. I do
     not expect you to read them. I intended to copy them but as a matter of curiosity shall send
     them in MS. They are only intended for you.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Write to me as usual, only put "McCausland's" instead of 5th Cavalry "Brigade" My love to all. I have serious notion of
     resigning. I do not think I can remain in this Brigade for certain
     reasons, one of which is in these notes. My love to all. Goodbye dearest.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me in your devotions.</p>
