<p class="p10">Dear Cousin
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I received your civil
                    and
                    welcome
                    letter and was very glad indeed to hear from you all. We are within 30 miles of Richmond and
                    expect to attack the Rebels at Richmond in 4 or 5 days. i think there will be some
                    fighting
                    done
                    there but our cause is just. i
                    must be done and am bound to see it
                    through. the Rebels are worse
                    than
                    <br><br>[<i>page </i>]<br> a set of heathens. they take our men and pin
                    them up against
                    trees with their bayonettes
                    and fire upon our hospitals where the sick are. And they have fired on several
                    of our flags of truth and when it
                    comes to that <i>[unclear: 
                        roust
                    ]</i> i think it is time to do
                    something it raises my blood
                    every time i see such things. i
                    have seen more than i ever
                    expect to see and more than ever i want to see again.
                    general pope has given orders to take every
                    <br><br>[<i>page </i>]<br> thing we want of the farmers and we will do so. i think the rebels will not get
                        much on the ground. We have
                        gone over that <i>[unclear: 
                        ought to have been
                    ]</i>
                    done
                    sooner and the rebels supply would not be so great when
                    ever we had to <i>[unclear: 
                        return
                    ]</i> Why the rebels got their supplies by that is over and though the war is not over yet and i think 1 year will not end it but i am bound to see it As far as i can.
                    uncle david said that all was right. he doesn't
                    think hard at all of <i>[unclear: 
                        you
                    ]</i>
                    at all. he will lend you the money if he doesn't come home till august. he has promised again that time his discharge. i am in a hurry.
                    you must excuse bad writing. i can not write
                    much this time. i will write
                    more next time. write soon. </p>
