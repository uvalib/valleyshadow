        </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March, 1862
            
          </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 23, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">General Jackson moved from near Strasburg this morning toward Winchester. The report
              that the enemy had abandoned Winchester, with the exception of two or three regiments
              was generally believed by the soldiers and it was thought there would be no engagement
              in reoccupying the town. </p><p class="p10">About ten o'clock the enemy commenced advancing and drove out skirmishers back a mile
              or two towards Newtown.</p><p class="p10">The troops, having arrived soon after the middle of the day, the line of battle was
              immediately formed and the artillery of both armies commenced their fire which was
              kept up for several hours. This did but little damage to our side, wounding one or two
              and killing two or three horses.</p><p class="p10">The regiments in crossing an open field to their positions were in full and easy
              range of the enemy's guns. A number of shots were fired at the 4th but all fell a
              short distance off, without doing any damage. </p><p class="p10">Late in the afternoon our skirmishers were driven in and the fight became general
              along the whole line. Our men were eager for the fight and advanced most impetuously,
              and poured their fire into the ranks of the enemy, driving them completely from the
              field. </p><p class="p10">Heavy reinforcements were immediately brought forward by the Federals so completely
              out-numbering us that we were compelled to retire and leave them masters of the field. </p><p class="p10">Our forces were sheltered by a skirting of woods and the nearby brow of a hill and a
              little in advance of the latter, a stone fence.</p><p class="p10">In this place the Fourth fought and the enemy say was most hardly contested, and the
              dead lay in heaps. Our troops fought most gloriously and their deeds are the theme of
              admiration on enemy tongue. The Liberty Hall volunteers fully sustained the reputaton
              they gained at Manassas: no one quailed under the storm of bullets around him but
              fired upon them to the last. They with the Pulaski Guards were the last to leave the
              stone fence, the regiment having gone without our knowing it--and only left when the
              enemy gained the top of the hill to our right, and pouring a deadly fire down the wall
              and parallel with it.</p><p class="p10"> Captain Morrison, finding the two companies left to themselves, ordered them to
              retire. We found the whole army giving way rapidly and the enemy firing upon them as
              they went and everyone endeavoring to make good his own safety.</p><p class="p10">After having retreated half a mile beyond the branch, I saw the cavalry of the enemy
              rapidly dashing upon us; I immediately turned off to the right (left wing of the
              enemy) hoping they would not pursue a single man but on they came and 4 or 5 calling
              on me to stop; not doing that they fired several shots at me, none of which however
              took effect, but by this time they were so close on me that I found further efforts
              useless and surrendered my gun and cartridge box and was marched back by two of them
              while the others still pursued the flying rebels.</p><p class="p10">I had gone a short distance only when I fell in with Captain Morrison and Lieutenant Lyle, whom I had just left as the cavalry charged
              upon us.</p><p class="p10">It was the First Virginia Cavalry who took us and escorted us with over a hundred
              others to Winchester where we were confined in the basement of the Episcopal Church.
              Others were lodged in the Court House, jail, etc. The whole number of prisoners is
              about 230, besides the wounded who could not be removed from the field.</p><p class="p10">We reached Winchester about 9 o'clock. The citizens sent us plenty of provisions for
              supper, having been furnished nothing by our captors. The room being crowded, there
              was but little opportunity to sleep or rest in any way.</p><p class="p10">Breakfast was also provided by the citizens--bread, meat, butter, coffee, milk, etc,
              were supplied to all.</p><p class="p10"> Blankets and clothing were also being brought in, but soon prohibited.</p><p class="p10"> Shortly after the middle of the day, we were ordered to "fall in" and were marched
              off--we knew not where, but were soon relieved of any doubt as we went direct to the
              depot, where we were put on the cars (freight) as fast as the roll could be called,
              and started for "Yankee Land." It was by no means a pleasing thought.</p><p class="p10">To go North, to be imprisoned in some prison or fort, to receive the contempt and
              supercilious treatment of Lincoln's tyrannical and despotic officers was humiliating
              and goading beyond expression. To have a yankee soldier and most probably a foreigner
              at that, with musket or drawn saber in hand, march one about at every call, was so
              offensive as to be borne with no sort of ease or compromise.</p><p class="p10"> When performing the same offices for Federal prisoners in our hands, I had often
              wondered how I could bear it if I should ever fall into their hands. And now it was to
              be realized. I was to be put to the test.</p><p class="p10"> I was to have them speak to me as peremptorily as to a negro, never once saying
              "will you do this" or "do that if you please," but always "stand over here," get back
              there," "pull off your hats," etc. </p><p class="p10"> The cars were so crowded that the men could hardly seat themselves.</p><p class="p10"> Reaching Harpers Ferry after dark, we remained there until morning, Tuesday 25th.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 25, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Started again this morning for Baltimore. On account of there being no windows in the
              cars, the view of the beautiful scenery was almost entirely lost.</p><p class="p10"> At Jefferson's rock, I had a very important sight from the door of the car, by
              looking over the top of it. A temporary bridge has been thrown over the Potomac here,
              completing the connection of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad.</p><p class="p10">For several miles down the river the country is hilly and rough, but after leaving
              the river, it becomes level and gently hilly and very beautiful and rich.</p><p class="p10"> Arriving in Baltimore about the middle of the afternoon, we halted at the Camden
              Station; being unexpected visitors, but few people were about; but soon it became
              known that a lot of Rebel prisoners had come to town; and several thousands quickly
              assembled, eager to catch a glimpse of such deluded creatures and rebellious subjects.
              However not a few among the throng came to look upon their friends and those who were
              battling for liberty and freedom.</p><p class="p10"> All communication was prohibited, as far as possible, but questions would be asked
              and answered. "Throw me a button" said one; "a postage stamp," another; a third, a
              "Confederate note," etc.</p><p class="p10"> At length we were formed in line and marched down Howard to Madison street and
              thence to the City jail for lodgings. All the way the crowd grew more dense and more
              boisterous, until we reached the jail, where the ladies waved their handkerchiefs and
              the children hurrahed for Jeff Davis. </p><p class="p10"> We were confined in the North end of the building. It is very strong and most
              conveniently arranged. </p><p class="p10"> Having had nothing to eat since breakfast at Winchester, our appetites were
              proportionately craving. The long wished for supper came at last--and such a supper,
              bread and coffee--at least what they called coffee, a concoction of rye sweetened with
              with molasses, a nauseating mixture, tasting as if there were something rotten in it.
              Next thing wanted was sleep, which was to be had by the two in each room, sleeping on
              a single cot. Worn out by loss of sleep + travel, I had a tolerably comfortable
              night's rest. </p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 26th--Wednesday</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Having passed my first night in Baltimore and in jail, I rose much refreshed, made my
              toilet, and waited breakfast, in hopes of getting something palatable, but it was only
              a repetition of the supper, the same hard bread and detestable coffee.</p><p class="p10">There was no recourse left but to wander about the building or sit down in my cell
              and think over my condition, of how long I would be there, whether we would be
              exchanged or paroled, and other kindred thoughts.</p><p class="p10"> The papers were filled with glaring falsehoods and gross exaggerations of the late
              battle. The mind of the northern people would be so perverted by its first details
              that it would never know the real results of the engagement.</p><p class="p10"> Kind friends in the city sent us numerous articles of clothing during the day,
              shirts, drawers, shoes, blankets, etc. For dinner we had bread and soup with a chunk
              of beef in it. Supper, nothing. Neither knives, forks, plates or spoons were to be
              had. </p><p class="p10"> The "Clipper," noticing the arrival of prisoners, said they were lodged in the jail
              and "rations issued to them to which they were strangers." We were indeed strangers to
              such rations as we received.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 27th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This day was passed in about the same way as the day before. All were eager to get
              the papers for further details of the fight and to know the position of General
              Jackson. </p><p class="p10">The papers, throughout the North, hailed the event as a glorious victory for the
              federal armies and illustrating the prowess of the Yankee mercenaries, but never
              mentioning the 23,000 men in their army which a Federal Captain boasted they had as
              soon as we were captured, and which all were very anxious to bring down to six or
              eight thousand when they found out the smallness of our force.</p><p class="p10"> Correspondents of the press doubled and even trebled our force, boldly asserting
              that Shields had defeated Jackson's, Smith's and Longstreet's united forces. This
              unmitigated lie has been circulated far and wide, throughout the North, and will
              doubtless be believed by the mass of the Northern people.</p><p class="p10">Marvelous stories were told of Bank's pursuit and, and Jackson's disastrous retreat.
              Banks was shelling them all the way, with immense slaughter, and capturing 700 army
              wagons (2 or 3 times the number Jackson had) and Jackson was throwing the wounded and
              the dead from the ambulances and wagons, literally strewing the whole way with them,
              to facilitate his retreat. </p><p class="p10"> The special correspondent of the "Herald" said that Jackson's forces was 16
              regiments of infantry, numbering 11,000 men and three battalions of horse, under Ashby
              and Stuart; when in truth there were but 9 regiments and 1 battalion, less than 5,000
              men and one regiment of horse (Ashby's)</p><p class="p10"> Every effort was made to increase our force and diminish theirs.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday, March 28th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Crowds of ladies and gentlemen daily assembled without the walls where a view could
              be had of the windows of the jail and testified their sympathy and support by every
              demonstration in their power. Those known to sympathize with secessionists were
              prohibited admittance to the jail; but still they found many ways of ministering to
              our comfort and necessities, for which I (and I doubt not, all the prisoners) will
              ever feel most grateful. It was a cheering thought that there were many thousands of
              our friends in the city, ready and anxious to assist with their means and cheer us
              with their sympathy in our lonely confinement. It was rumored that we would be
              transferred to Fort Delaware.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 29, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Received notice this morning that we would go to Fort Delaware at 10 o'clock but the
              hours passed without any sign of movement, of which we were not sorry, for we
              preferred to remain in the city of our friends, rather than go to a fort, shut off
              from all the world by water as well as by its walls and be among our enemies. </p><p class="p10"> Such sympathy was expressed and so much excitement stirred up through the city, that
              the authorities feared another outbreak of the populace (as on the 19th of April 1861)
              if they moved the prisoners through the streets in daylight. The keepers of the prison
              expressed this opinion to our officers. </p><p class="p10"> The morning was cloudy and soon commenced snowing. In the afternoon we were again
              ordered to be ready to leave and started between 4 and 5 o'clock, under the escort of
              the 111th Pennsylvania Regiment. </p><p class="p10"> Stormy and cold as it was, a large crowd was assembled at the gate to witness our
              departure. As soon as the prisoners appeared, the crowd commenced waving
              handkerchiefs, shouting and hurraing for Jeff Davis and the South. As we moved off,
              the crowd became perfectly uproarious, shouting and hallooing at the top of their
              voices. Many ladies were among the throng, some standing in carriages, from which they
              waved us a silent adieu, sometimes with a fervent "God bless you." </p><p class="p10"> We marched up Calvert street, thence along the latter to the boat landing in which
              we were to take passage to the Fort. </p><p class="p10"> The police (appointees of General Dix) were in attendance, some; of whom were very
              nice men, but the most of them bear a cruel and malignant hate towards the Rebels and
              delight to taunt and vex them in every way. </p><p class="p10"> Some ladies were standing in the hall one day, asked the prisoners for a button; one
              was thrown out and fell at their feet, a policeman standing by grabbed it up and
              refused to let her have it. </p><p class="p10"> We were soon aboard, all crowded into the lower part of the boat where nothing could
              be seen, and steamed down th bay to Fort Delaware. </p></p>
