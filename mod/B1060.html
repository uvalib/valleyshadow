<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Roswell Waldo to Orlando
                    Brown, September 30, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waldo comments on the lack of criminal cases involving blacks during the current
                    month, and notes that he is continuing the practice of settling civil cases
                    through the Bureau office.</p>

<p class="p10">September 30. 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">In accordance with instructions contained in Par 6 Circular No 10 - dated Head
                    Quarters, Assistant Commissioner, Richmond Virginia March 12<sup>th</sup> 1866 - in
                    relation to the result of the operation of the Order restoring to the Civil
                    Authorities jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over colored persons &amp;c - I
                    have the honor to submit the following report as far as said order relates to
                    this Division (Highland and Augusta Counties) viz:</p>
<p class="p10">On account of the peaceable disposition of the colored population and their
                    desire to confine their actions within the limits of the law, there has been but
                    few Criminal cases tried by Magistrates during the present <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>month. In
                    these, the accused have been required to answer indictment for larceny &amp;
                    assault &amp; battery before the next Grand Jury. I have no hesitation in
                    saying that impartiality and fairness were observed on the part of the
                    Magistrate in the disposition of these cases.</p>
<p class="p10">In settling difficulties of a Civil nature where a colored man appeared as a
                    party, I have adopted the course of my predecessor - by adjudicating them at
                    this office as far as possible. I am convinced that this course results to the
                    welfare &amp; interest of the freedmen, they being relieved of the expense
                    of a trial by the Civil tribunals, which expense, in their poverty stricken
                    condition, they are unable to bear.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient Servant</p>
