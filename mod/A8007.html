<p class="p10">Jany 28th 1857.</p>
<p class="p10">Fort Leavenworth K.S.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Cousin;</p>
<p class="p10">I take the liberty of addressing a word to you from this far off region. I have
                    been Stationed in Kansas for the last 2 years and owing to the Army's
                    participation in the Kansas difficulties have had a fine opportunity to become
                    well acquainted with its resources, and local advantages; that opportunity I
                    have <u>not</u> failed to improve. And I am now entirely
                    convinced from personal knowledge, that with a little capital, and attention I
                    could in a short time make a handsome fortune, by investments in real estate.
                    You can form no idea <i>[deleted: to]</i> what prices that species of
                    property will command at the opening of navigation. The rise is already evincing
                    itself, and the tenacity with which the holders hold on to their property is the
                    best evidence of its worth. But I did not mean to argue the propriety of what I
                    am going to propose, which is to borrow <u>from</u>
                    <u>or</u>
                    <u>through</u> you ($2000.) Two thousand Dollars with
                    interest at 6 per cent per annum for the period of two years or, if preferred,
                    for a longer period. I feel perfectly<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> sure of realizing a handsome
                    profit in <u>six</u> months even a draft on Corcoran
                    &amp; Riggs Washington or any current Northern Bank will suit. I sincerely
                    trust that you will accede to my proposition by sending me this amount at <u>your</u>
                    <u>earliest</u> convenience for <u>here</u> time is emphatically money.</p>
<p class="p10">I moreover tender to you my services and best energies to invest <u>for</u>
                    <u>you</u> whatever amount you may think proper to entrust to
                    me, in what I believe to be the most <u>profitable</u> real
                    estate in the Country. During the Summer months I will be absent on an Indian
                    Campaign but expect to return early in the fall.</p>
<p class="p10">My kindest remembrances &amp; love to your family in which Flora heartily
                    joins, for I have made her acquainted with you.</p>
<p class="p10">An early answer is particularly requested.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.E.B. Stuart</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I will of course <u>complete</u>
                        all my investments early in the Spring. JEB Hon A H H
                            Stuart
                    </p>
