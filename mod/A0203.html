<h4>Augusta County: A. F. Kinney to Alfred Chapman, April 1, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>A. F. Kinney writes Alfred Chapman regarding shipping flour and fish by rail.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 1<sup>st</sup> 1869</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I received your <i>[illeg.]</i> of the 29th <i>[illeg.]</i> + on yesterday saw Mr. Bucher
     in regard to the flour. He says that he will ship it to day + I told him to come to the Bank +
     draw a draft on you + I would give him the money for it at once, which is perfectly
     satisfactory to him. He says he will change you $9<sup>00</sup> but that it will be
     a very superior article of <u>Extra</u> flour- Extra flour is selling out of
     the wagon at 8<sup>25</sup> to 8<sup>50</sup>.
     I understand however that there is a great deal of indifferent flour brought in. I had been
     thinking of writing to you on the subject of fish when I received your letter.</p>
<p class="p10">I wish you would send me <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>about 8 pair nice shad by next Saturday's train. If you
     can get some of the men on the train to agree to deliver the box to the Pat Woodward baggage
     master on Central Road he will bring it up to me, but if you find any difficulty or have any
     doubt about their getting here on that day, just put them in the express, the fish we get here
     from the husksters are all so old + stale, they are not fit to eat. I want these fish for
     myself + friends. if you can put in some kind of <u>pan</u> fish for
     breakfast I would be glad. Let me hear from you on the subject</p>
<p class="p10">You have never said anything about the flour I sent you. How did it turn out?</p>
<p class="p10">With much love to Cousin Mary + the rest of the family, I am</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>A F Kinney</i></p>
