                <p>With pleasure I avail my self of the first opportunity to respond your ever dear
                    letter of the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi>
                    <abbr expan="instant">inst</abbr> which was <abbr expan="received">rec<hi

                    very anxious to reply sooner but could not possibly do so my dear friend I can
                    not find words to express the delight with which your letter was received and
                    read, just at the time of its reception the two grand Armies in Virginia began
                    to move. That day we had been under arms &amp; in the saddles <orig
                        reg="all day">alday</orig>. <orig reg="All">all</orig> was excitement
                    looking forward to the result of the coming great battle. <orig reg="Of"
                    >of</orig> course it was a time for excitement, curious thought &amp;
                    sadness. <orig reg="Late">late</orig> on the evening above mentioned, when I
                    felt that our thoughts prayers &amp; vigilent acts should be directed to the
                    great task before us to be performed, I, for my part felt quite <pb n="2"
                    />dejected &amp; very anxious as to the issue of the next few days, Just
                    then your pleasing &amp; ever welcome letter came The well recognized hand
                    writing upon the back sent a thrill of joy to my very soul &amp; when I had
                    given its interesting pages a <orig reg="careful">carefull</orig> perusal you
                    must know that my countenance wore an expression of delight for just then a
                    friend <orig reg="passed">past</orig> by &amp; remarked "Bob that must be a
                    letter from your lady love. See boys said he how his brow is lit up. I answered
                    no, but told him that it was from one whom I love as such &amp; true it is
                    there is no one who has a larger space in my heart than the one to whom I am now
                    writing.</p>

                <p>I am glad to hear that you spent such a pleasant time attending church believing
                    as I do that you have the proper appreciation for such duties. Now let me <pb
                        n="3"/>tell you of my profound admiration of your frankness &amp;
                    honesty of heart in telling me of your engagement I truly hope you have selected
                    one worthy of your hand &amp; I must say for him that he has been fortunate
                    in winning the heart &amp; hand of so noble a being as your self who in my
                    humble opinion is worthy the love of a prince. Not withstanding he has but
                    little of Earthly treasure I am satisfied he is a worthy young man as you think
                    so. Earthly treasures should not be our object in matrimonial selections, it
                    might be well said for me for I know if ever I am loved it will be for my self
                    alone for I have neither Earthly treasure now mental or spiritual gifts. All
                    that I can offer at the shrine of bounty is my worthless self.</p>

                <p>As regard your picture rest assured I want it &amp; shall anxiously await
                    your next letter hoping you may conclude to trust me with it &amp; I promise
                    if you wish mine you may have it as soon as I can have it taken, I suppose the
                    sight of it may <add hand="h1" place="inline">be</add> gratifying to your
                    curiousity <pb n="4"/>but certainly not pleasing to the eye but I would only
                    give it as one taken of momento of of friendship for were you free to now be
                        <orig reg="wooed">wood</orig> I am not endowed with any of the qualities
                    that are likely to be admired. Well my friend I reckon you expect some news but
                    I think it useless to under take to give you all the particulars as I suppose
                    you've the substance through papers as for our brigade we for the first time in
                    any campaign since the war began have had comparitively an easy time it is time
                    we have had hard marching &amp; very hard duty but little fighting upto
                        <orig reg="today">to day</orig> we have been constantly with our horses
                    saddled &amp; on duty (22 days) &amp; have only lost about 25 or 30 men
                    from the Brigade 8 or 10 from my Regiment, none from my Company one man was
                    struck but uninjured. I <add hand="h1" place="inline">am</add> thankful to God
                    that we been as blessed but the work is not hard and we are now confronting the
                        <orig reg="enemy">enimy</orig> on the North Anna river in Hanover county
                    looking for a fight at any time our troops are in fine spirits &amp; always
                    ready for action. I hope that freedom will soon be ours though I may not live to
                    see it. I trust the Lord may hasten the happy times, I have told my brother of
                    our correspondence. <orig reg="He">he</orig> will according to your wish destroy
                    any letter coming to me &amp; inform you of the fact should any thing
                    happen. I close for want of paper with my imperfect prayers &amp; many
                    wishes for your welfare &amp; happiness. I ask you in like manner to
                    remember &amp; write soon to your unworthy but constant friend</p>
