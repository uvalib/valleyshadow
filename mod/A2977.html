<p class="p10">Camp Winder, Caroline Co. Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I have seated my self for the purpose of writing you a few lines to inform you of
                    our whereabouts my health is very good &amp;
                    hope these
                    few lines may find you enjoying the blessings of health
                    and happiness I have been waiting in suspense for some time for a letter from you I have
                    come to the conclusion that my letter never came to hand I wrote soon after I
                    came down, you can well imagine how lonesome I have been in looking for a few lines from you I will now send out the second arrow hoping it
                    may <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>find it's destination Jake told me
                    yesterday evening that you had never heard from me since my return to camp I had in writing
                    yesterday but I thought I would wait and send this by Mr
                    Carson as the other failed by mail I have no news of importance to write We
                        were on pickett last week had a very easy tour of
                    it, I could not see any yankees across the river I think the greater portion of their army has gone South &amp; some twenty or thirty thousand of our
                    army has gone to meet them we have orders to keep one
                    days rations in our haversacks until further orders
                    Some thinks we are going to South Carolina I haven't but one objection to going It would be so seldom <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>that we could hear from home I would
                    like to See the country &amp; then we would be on the coast
                    where we could get plenty of oysters we have to pay six dollars a gallon for them here &amp;
                    no butter then to eat with them, well I got a letter the other day from the
                    mill; I tell you that it had Sams name in more than one line I had to laugh at several of her conclusions of the hearafter we
                    have a large Co. now for duty some sixty odd, the largest in the brigade we have
                    got our tents at last the boys are busy building chimneys to them, I hope we may camp here all
                    winter We have plenty of wood and tolerable good water, and are enjoying all the
                    sweets of camp life, and you know they are few at best
                        <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I hardly know what to write to interest you I hope you have received my
                    other letter before this time I wish I was where I
                        wouldn't have to write for it is a great deal more pleasure to me to talk to you than to
                    write I have often been near you in my dreams since I last seen you, but alas
                    what are dreams they vanish in a moment from our sight &amp; are gone forever I hope the time may soon come when I may
                    fondly encircle thee in my arms &amp; call thee mine oh Kate forget thee I never can &amp; would not be forgot for the gold
                    of opher, I hope your path may be strewn with flowers
                    and if I can not make you happy some other may I ask an interest in your prayers
                    excuse this uninteresting letter I will try
                    and do better next time let no one see this my respects to all &amp; my love
                    to you</p>
<p class="p10">from your true friend</p>
