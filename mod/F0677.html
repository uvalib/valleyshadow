<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">I now take this opportunity to inform you that I
                    am well at Present hoping that these few lines may find you and all the Rest of
                    the folks in the same state of health we are now laying about five miles south
                    of Nashville we got here on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Nashville is a pretty Place and it has the appearance of being a business Place at one time but business is suspended There now. all the stores and business shops are Closed and the City is deserted of nearly all its inhabitants except the
                        ladies and they are all secessionist and wear a secessionist flag for
                    Aprons and have a belt around their waists with an Ivory handled Colt Revolving
                    Pistol of the best quality sticking in it. Nashville and all the surrounding Country is secessionist and they don't try to hide it neither we were out on Picket
                    night before last and towards morning about time the
                    moon went down the left end of our<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Picket Line was fired into by some
                    Rebel Cavalry there was about 300 of them in all but they stayed about 200 or
                    300 yards away from our Picket line with the
                    exceptions of 15 that dismounted and Came up to within hailing distance of our
                    Pickets they were 5 or 6 abreast as we Could judge for it was dark and the minute our Pickets <i>[deleted: they fired]</i> Challenged them they fired one volley and Retreated our men fired on them while they were Retreating
                    but with what effect we couldn't hear if there was any of them hurt they were taken along by their Comrades on our side there was nobody hurt but I must say they did some tall shooting
                    for random shooting Te only guide they had was the Direction the Pickets voice
                    Came and he came near being Put out two balls struck the fence one each side of
                    him but Captain Philips made the Narrowest Escape of all the upper band of his sword scabbard was shot
                    off one shot grazing the Back of his hand taking the skin off about an inch another struck about the<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>

                    on]</i> goes on a Post 20 yards apart is the General Rule but the Indianna Boys were Placed
                    about 50 yards apart and the Rebels took advantage of the Distance and took 4 of
                    them off their Post in Broad day light and carried
                    them off as Prisoners and they have not got Back yet
                    either the way they managed to do it there was about 25 of them (Cavalry) rode up with about 30
                    yards of the Pickets taking care to keep behind a hill that the Pickets couldn't see them when one of
                    them dismounted and to hide suspicion he had on one
                    of our uniforms on so he got to the Pickets without much trouble and got talking
                    them awhile when he give a certain signal and as quick as lightning the Rebels
                    galloped up to<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> them dragged them on their
                    Horses and off with them it was done so quick that the rest of the Pickets didn't get a shot at them I tell
                    you they're as sharp as they make them these days the
                    next attack they made was on the First wisconsin killing one and wounding five
                    The wisconsin killed 3 of their men wounded 3 and some of the 29<sup>th</sup> Indiana Boys took one of them Prisoner he belonged to the First

                    Cavalry he is a bold looking fellow and he says he
                        don't give a damn whether
                    school keeps or not and he says if they let him go he will fight against the
                    Union Troops as hard as ever he says he won't be a
                    Prisoner 6 month he would be shot first. The next attack they made on us the
                        Particulars of which I have stated on the
                    other Page This morning about 3 o'clock there was
                    firing our Picket line again and at the same Place we were fired on yesterday
                    morning But I didn't hear how
                    they made out The 49<sup>th</sup> Ohio Relieved us yesterday about 4
                        o'clock in the afternoon and they will be relieved
                    by some other Regiment at the same time to day and I
                        won't Close this till I hear how the Ohioans made out with the secessionists They'll be in about 4 o'clock But I
