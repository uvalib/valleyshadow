<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I most respectfully beg leave to call your attention again to my Case. Some time
                    ago I call on your at your office and showed you my papers, as also a letter
                    from Miss Van Lew Regarding the Building that is on my lot and represented how I
                    had been treated by the Military Authorities. You give me some consolation and
                    assurance that you would do all in your power. In my
                    case, the power lay with you to do so. I now address myself you as a christian and a justice loving
                    gentleman to do something for me. I am a poor man,
                    unable to put my lot in the same condition that it was in when they took
                    possession of it. There was good garden and also a fence on lot <i>[unclear: I know it a common]</i> I am too poor to fence the lot and consequently
                    cant garden on lot. I am <i>[illeg.]</i> man If you dont do some thing for me I must earnestly request of you to give Mr Tukey
                    your Agent here <i>[added: &amp;emissary]</i> to leave
                    me Lumber enough to put me up a Shanty and fence my lot
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>he Mr. Tukey is now having the Building taken away. I have been
                    treated very badly there is not a man in this county as been treated half as bad
                    as myself -- hoping you will give this your attention and do some thing for me. Hoping to hear favorably from you</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be <br>Very Respectfully your most<br> obedient
                        Servant</p>
