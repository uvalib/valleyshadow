<p class="p10">As I am not able to come down I thought I would write a few lines. My toe is getting something better. Also my health is
                    improving I hope in the course of another week I may be able to go about if so I
                    will not fail to come down for I never wanted to see my Kate as bad in my life
                    dear Kate you must not think hard of me for not coming
                    today for when ever I move
                    about my toe is very painful I know it is not your
                    desire that I suffer more than I can avoid by remaining quiet your cousin John
                    is going to cavalry
                    tomorrow &amp; would take me if I were able to
                    go. I am sorry to lose

                    was in Staunton sick with the fever. I hope he may get home where he will have kind parents
                    &amp; sisters to wait on him I have been looking for you nearly all week but
                    I believe you are afraid to come to Greenville when I am here. Your Bro Geo. was at the Mill this morning if I had have seen <i>[added: him]</i> I would have sent you a note by him. If the gent you spoke of takes you away next week you
                    must write to me I hope he will leave you where you are for I do want to see you the worst in the world But you must go if you can enjoy your
                    self for when ever I think you are happy then I am happy. Well I must close write to me by the first opportunity Good bye
