                    describes the problems arising from the fact that his district spans two

                <p>I have received your order to turn in the transportation in my possession, and in
                    reference to it desire to state that I have but one (1) officer acting as
                    Provost Marshall, under the order of <abbr expan="Major General">Maj.
                    Gen.</abbr> Terry, and he is at Lexington, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> and
                    he is at Lexington in charge of <abbr expan="Sub-District">Sub. Dist.</abbr>
                    "A", three (3) counties. At Staunton there is a Civilian <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> in charge of <abbr
                        expan="Sub-District">Sub. Dis.</abbr> "B", two (2) Counties, and in these
                    five (5) Counties there are no <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> Forces,
                    and no other effective means of interim communication, than by the mentioned
                    officer and civilians.</p>

                <p>The boundary line between Augusta and Rockingham Counties separates the <abbr
                        expan="Department of Virginia">Dept. of Va.</abbr> from the Middle Military
                        <abbr expan="Department">Dept.</abbr>, and compliance with this order will
                    leave the remaining (8) eight Counties, much the larger portion of the Sixth
                    District, without any means of transportation since the orders of <abbr
                        expan="Major General">Maj. Gen.</abbr> Terry are not effective here.</p>

                <p>I have in use a spring wagon with two (2) horses, and I can more economically
                    traverse my District in it than by any other means of transportation.</p>

                <p>I have also in use two (2) horses at Staunton by the <pb n="2"/>Civilian <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> and me at Lexington by
                    the <abbr expan="Military Assistant Superintendent">Mil. Asst. Supt.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="acting Provost Marshall">actg Pro. Mar.</abbr> and in my judgement
                    each officer should have at least two (2) public horses. One reason being that
                    it is unsafe for an officer of this Bureau to travel in these Counties
                    unattended and in the entire absence of Military support. In this Middle <abbr
                        expan="Military Department">Mil. Dept.</abbr> with the voluntary assistance
                    of <unclear>
                        <abbr expan="officers">offrs</abbr>
                    </unclear> I have managed as well as I might in the hopes that at some time
                        <abbr expan="Quartermaster">QM</abbr> supplies might be obtainable, but am
                    unable now to make requisition <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> officers on duty in this portion
                    of my <abbr expan="District">Dist.</abbr> because they are not acting Provost
                    Marshalls awaiting instructions.</p>

                <p>I shall proceed to Staunton, and retaining one (1) horse for the officer at
                    Lexington, turn in the other four (4) and the wagon, equipments &amp;c with
                    the least possible delay, as ordered.</p>
