<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: William H. Effinger to
                    [Thomas P. Jackson], April 12, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Effinger, an attorney for the Commonwealth, writes to Jackson about an upcoming
                    bigamy trial involving a man (Samuel Hall) about whom Jackson might have
                    information. Effinger asks Jackson, or someone from the Bureau office to attend
                    the trial and submit whatever evidence they might have in the case.</p>

<p class="p10">12th April 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Harrisonburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">A freedman is now up on bail to be tried at our May Circuit Court upon a charge
                    of bigamy The first marriage is alleged to have been under the act of the Virginia Legislation of 27<sup>th</sup> March
                    1866 - immediately suceeding which a large number of freedmen went to your
                    office (then in this town) to be registered Among others I have been informed
                    this one <u>Samuel</u>
                    <u>Hall</u> alias Samuel Johnson alias <i>[unclear: Doctor]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Damin]</i> - He has gone by the three names but doubtless used the
                    first at that time He is the one who lodged complaint against General S. H. Lewis of this county <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for
                    driving him away from his wife <u>Eliza</u> formerly the
                    slave of said Lewis Eliza claims him as her husband and any information you can
                    give will probably further the ends of <i>[unclear: justice]</i> justice - If
                    the facts be as stated in regard to the complaint and registration could some
                    one of your <u>Bureau</u> attend the trial and give evidence?</p>
<p class="p10">Please let me hear from you</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very respectfully</p>
