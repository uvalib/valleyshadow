    <p>I seat myself this morning to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well and hope
     you may be enjoying the same blessing. I have written to you some four letters since I was at
     home last summer and have not received an answer from you yet but I suppose It is owing to the
     irregularity of the mails. We have had a <del hand="h1">f</del> very wet winter<pb n="2" entity="Smiley3b" pid="uva-lib:503084"/>
    here so far but I think we will have some good weather now as the
     past few days have been clear and warm. We are still in our tent but we have our hut built and
     had expected to move into it yesterday but the <orig reg="weather">wether</orig> is so fine we
     concluded to stay in our tent a while yet; the tent is much warmer than a house would be We
     have a stove in our tent and it keeps us very comfortable. We have had a very hard time<pb
      n="3" entity="Smiley3c"/>
     since we left Centreville and came into the Valley almost all the
     time on the march and that <orig reg="through">throug</orig> a mountainous country On the road
     to Romney and at that place the Yankees destroyed everything that came in their way There was
     one little town about fourteen miles from Romney that they burnt the houses down and killed all
     the stock that that they could find they shot one man that was engaged in government works and
     only wounded<pb n="4" entity="Smiley3d" pid="uva-lib:503086"/>
     him; they then took him and laid him before the fire and roasted
     him slowly until he died; then burn him up in the house. In some places they killed all the
     horses Cattle and hogs and piled them up in one pile along the roadside. This will I think be
      <orig reg="revisited">visitited</orig> on their heads in a tenfold proportion Enlisting is
     going on rapidly in the regiment there has 8 or 10 of our company enlisted for the war and more
     of them talking of doing so I have not done so yet and will not until I hear from home. But as
     my paper is about out I must close by asking you to write soon. Give my love to Aun Ann Uncle
     James family and receive as large share yourself</p>
