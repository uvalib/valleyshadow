                </opener>

                <p>This Sabbath morning, I seat myself to inform you that I am well. Hoping that
                    these few lines may find you all enjoying the same blessings of health.</p>
                <p>I got to the 148th <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg</abbr> on the 30th. We were gladly
                    received. I feel very well satisfied. Hoping that you all feel <orig
                        reg="content">contend</orig> with my absence.</p>
                <p>I wrote you a letter from Baltimore. I hope that you got it.</p>
                <p>As long as the Army is on the move a man sets down to write-he can't <orig
                        reg="tell">teel</orig>
                    <orig reg="whether">wether</orig> he can finish a letter or not.</p>
                <p>I am noting <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> down in my day book so when
                    we get to winter quarters I can give you more interesting news about Army Life.
                    In Rachel's letter see something about the rations.</p>
                <p>I am perfectly well satisfied. I was <orig reg="examined">exaimed</orig>
                    yesterday. Again I passed for a sound mind.</p>
                <p>Now, I will <orig reg="tell">teel</orig> you that a Settler can make plenty of
                    money. He must have recommendation from the Governor so that he can get
                    permission but here is the trouble. There is only one settler <orig
                        reg="allowed">alowed</orig> to a Regiment and it is dangerous as that is the
                    first thing the Rebs will pitch for.</p>
                <p>If I only had <orig reg="tobacco">tobaco</orig> plenty, I could <orig reg="sell"
                        >seel</orig> it just as I please. I brought 1 pound with me. I think I shall
                    sell it and quit <orig reg="chewing">chawing</orig>. I Think that I can make 7
                    dollars out of my <orig reg="tobacco">tobaco</orig>.</p>
                <p>I want you to get my watch fixed and then make a small box out of pase board.
                    Make it like an likeness case. Then lay the watch in and pack cotton or wool in
                    the corners of the box. Make the box very little thicker <orig reg="than"
                    >then</orig> the watch. Send it by <orig reg="mail">male</orig>.</p>
                <p>Keep account of what you lay out for me and I will pay you for your trouble.</p>
                <p>Now, I will give you the post address and this will follow me anywhere
                    direct.<lb/> Franklin Rosenbery<lb/> Company A 148th <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">P.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Volunteers">V.</abbr><lb/> 3 Brig. 1st Division 2nd Corps<lb/>
                    Washington, D. C.</p>
                <p>Now, <orig reg="be sure">besure</orig> always to write in this way and the watch
                    direct it the same as a letter only have it sealed up neatly and I will sell my
                    tobacco tomorrow for if I can make something nice out of it. I will sell it.
                    Then I will get you to send me some still by <orig reg="mail">male</orig>. That
                    is if it will pay I may as well make all that it. Take good care of Rachel and
                    the 2 little babes.</p>
                <p>I still feel determined to try and to save my <orig reg="soul">soule</orig>-let
                    come what will if God will give me grace.</p>
                <p>I must close by asking you to write when it suits you.</p>
                <p>Tend to the getting of the watch fixed as soon as you can as I need it very much.</p>
                <p>This morning is the first time the engine has come up the road since the Rebs
                    blew it.</p>
                <p>You read Rachel's letter of yesterday.</p>
                <p>I think now we will get a little more grub. I think that we need it.</p>
                <p>No more at present.</p>

                    <salute>So <orig reg="farewell">fare well</orig> for this time.<lb/> From your
