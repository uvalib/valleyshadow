                    would go &amp; let you stay. Mr. Sam Ferror did not call. Did you think when
                    we met him coming up that I knew he was coming Sunday to see me? I did not know
                    it. he had not told me he was going to call. I just then supposed he would do so
                    to hear from pa that was all. You hope in your letter that I will <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>have a pleasant visit I will no doubt, but shall not be happy as I should be
