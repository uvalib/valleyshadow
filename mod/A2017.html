<p class="p10">Feb 9 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Mossy Creek, Augusta Co. Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">I rec your letter of the 7<sup>th</sup> which contained a check of a hundred
     dollars. I handed it to Mr. White who gave me his receipt. Receiving your letter has perfectly
     satisfied me in regard to staying here, and things are moving on about as usual. last week and
     part of this has been taken up with examinations, and they were very hard indeed. two of my
     first examinations on Chemistry and Moral Philosophy were valued at one hundred and from the
     first of them I got ninety, and the other ninety-eight which put me in the first division by
     far in both as only 3/4 is required for 1st division. The other
     studies I have not heard from yet, that is Geometry Latin and Surveying, but I hope to stand
     pretty well in each. I have taken up Surveying as I think I will have time to attend to it, in
     connection with my other studies. it is a new work on the subject called Gillespie's Surveying.
     by the time I get through with that, in connection with the knowledge I had of it before, I
     think I will be qualified for work, although I may never have use
     for it. and another thing I did not like to get rusty in it, as you went to the expense of
     buying me a compass. I shall not neglect my other studies on account of that. Mr. White
     experimented on Chemistry last night, and it was very interesting indeed, he made Hydrogen gas
     and Oxygen gas which are the sole elements of the atmosphere we breathe, they also unite and
     form water, therefore being two of the most <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> essential gasses in existence. he also
     performed a great many amusing scenes, such as burning Hydrogen gas it burns very brilliantly.
     he placed some of it in a vessel and set fire to it and it exploded making a loud report. he
     also over a lamp of great intensity bent glass tubes in every shape he wanted to bend them,
     such were some of the feats he accomplished all of which were instructive.</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta has sent three Union Candidates as well Rockingham, but I see that Shenandoah has
     sent two good secessionists, which I think are the right kind, but I am fearful that the
     Convention will be made up of Union men, or we can hardly call them union men submission would
     be the better name. for to wish to stay in this union as it now is would be downright
     submission. the Black Republican party will hear no compromise, and will concede none of her
      privileges
     whilethe dominant party and what good is
     that peace conference going to do. first I do not believe that they
     can make any compromise whatever, because, some of the delegates go there instructed not to give up the Personal Liberty Law <i>[deleted: Bill]</i>.
     Massachusetts is an instance of that. And it would be better for Virginia if <i>[deleted: she]</i> that Conference did not settle the question for this reason, if the North made the
     proper promises, she would not keep them, because she has violated the constitution which she
     had sworn to obey. and the consequence would be we will be hooked on to the north in a few
     years abolitionized and be trampled in the dust by the
     tyrannical heel of the North. Whereas if it <i>[deleted: seceades]</i>
     secedes with the South, it will be the great Commercial and
     Manufacturing state of the Southern Confederacy. Thus it will be enriched and in case of
     staying in the Union, it will be impoverished, the North will scoff at it when once in its
     power and the South will spurn it as being an untrue state. Such are my views, and I would like
     very much to hear yours. You must excuse this long letter. My love to all, write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">Your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
