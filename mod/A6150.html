<p class="p10">Dear Cousin</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this pleasant evening to answer your kind letter
     that I received a few days ago affording me pleasure to hear from you as I received a letter from you sometime ago &amp; did
     not answer it I hope you will pardon my for not writing I've been so
      busy &amp; flying around with the boys that i forgotten my duty I
     received a letter from you the other day with some songs in it I'm very
     much pleased with them &amp; am thankful to you for them I feel very sorry to hear of the
     loss of your horse but I've heard it said there
     never was a loss but what there was a gain &amp; I truly hope that
     may be your mutual blessing as we are all doomed to disappointments &amp; bad luck may god be in our midst to bless us in our trials
     &amp; temptation in this world of sin &amp; misery whilst we are traveling through this wilderness of woe well Cousin I have
     enjoyed myself better for the last two weeks than I've done since the
     war has commenced going to Church &amp; to singing we will have singing tomorrow night in
     the neighborhood &amp; I expect a   fine time but I'm afraid it will turn out a bad night as it often does but my
     doom is disappointments anyway well James you wished to know if I had<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> got insulted at anything when you were here I never get insulted at any person unless
     they mistreat me in some way &amp; I'm sure you done nothing as I
      know of well Jimmy Pa says to tell you when he gets those caps &amp; powder you sent him he'll have enough to kill the Devil &amp; I hope he may get at it if he
     thinks he can Kit her best old green specks to you &amp; her love to Cousin Monroe well
     Cousin I think this Confederacy is almost gone up the spout the next time you write tell me
     what you think about it I don't think I'm wrong
     &amp; the sooner the better they have taken almost every man
     &amp; talk of calling on the men from seventeen to fifty
     &amp; then I suppose they will search they graveyards and swear
     them to the length of them they have been dead &amp; if old Master don't be very careful they will steal away his Just Claims
     &amp; make him out a liar well I haven't
     anything to write that will interest you there is nothing here now but hard times &amp; worse a coming &amp; some of the longest faces you ever saw I will Close by giving you my
     love &amp; the love of the family</p>
