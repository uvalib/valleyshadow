<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Statement of David Fultz,
                    February 8, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Fultz, a lawyer in Staunton, offers a statement about his acquaintance with
                    Frederick Tukey. Fultz states that he had the confidence of the local black
                    population, and would therefore have known about any complaints against Tukey,
                    of which, he says, there were none.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">February 8. 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">With surprise I have learned that complaints have been lodged against Mr Tukey in
                    connection with the Freedmens Bureau at this place. I made the acquaintance of
                    Mr T. very soon after he first came to our town; and my Office being in close
                    proximity with his, and having frequently attended professionally to
                        <i>[unclear: business]</i> which came up before him officially, I had a
                    better opportunity perhaps than any other person to view his conduct both as a
                    private citizen and a public officer.</p>
<p class="p10">And it is but justice to say, that his course has given universal satisfaction to
                    all colors and all shades of party. He has happily mingled a spirit of
                    moderation and conciliation, with a <i>[unclear: firm]</i> upright and
                    impartial administration of justice to black and white, loyal and disloyal. I am
                    satisfied that no man could <i>[unclear: accept]</i> that office who would be
                    more acceptable to our people <i>[added: without regard to
                        color]</i> than Mr T.</p>
<p class="p10">I am not the less qualified <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to judge of the conduct private and public
                    of Mr T. because of the <i>[unclear: sentiments]</i> I have
                        <i>[unclear: entertained]</i>, and maintained in relation to the rebellion.
                    I never have had but one opinion on that subject, and that was, that such folly
                    and wickedness never was exhibited in any age by any civilized people. This opinion I have expressed on all suitable
                    occasions, for which I have been frequently insulted and threatened with
                    personal violence.</p>
<p class="p10">After the order directing a Freedmans Court, I was selected by the Freedmen to
                    attend to their interest in said court, but owing to my professsional
                    engagements I had to decline. This would show that I had their confidence, and
                    never having heard a solitary complaint from any one of them, I take it, that
                    there could have been no cause for it.</p>
