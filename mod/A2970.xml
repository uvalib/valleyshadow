                <p>You kind and welcome letter of the 8th inst reached me safe today which found me
                    well &amp; very glad to hear from you for I was anxiously awaiting your
                    reply. I felt so lonely lying in camp with no excitement but at last your dear
                    letter came which was indeed a healing talisman in writing &amp; anxious
                    hearts if ever I prize a letter it is when <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> such circumstance I
                    am satisfied there is no one who is more fond <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                    >of</add> communicating with dear friends than I am. Letter writing is a
                    pleasant mode of binding a vivid remembrance of friends &amp; I think I
                    enjoy it as much <pb n="2"/>as any one but some times it does not suit my
                    purposes. I pine for a more general &amp; extended chat, I wish very much
                    that I could have the pleasures of meeting with you again &amp; again that
                    we might become better acquainted my short stay with you I have discovered many
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> qualities in you which has made undescribable impressions
                    on me ours is a very singular case it is not often the case where such a
                    friendship springs up <del hand="h1">two</del> between two relative strangers
                    Ever thankful I hope our friendship may be a lasting one &amp;c Sister you
                    say that you have lately <orig reg="heard">hurd</orig> that I met with one of
                    your neighbors &amp; made enquiry in regards to your self. I am indeed
                    surpised to hear <pb n="3"/>that it is indeed a mistake let me assure you that I
                    have never met with any one from your county since I saw you it <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">is</add> not my interest that I should have done as you heard
                    I did but I assure you I did not have the opportunity <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> I <orig
                        reg="don't">dont</orig> claim to be all <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Sister but I dont
                    hesitate to say that your pleasant appearance gave me entire satisfaction as
                    regards your definitive worth Many thanks, Miss Kate, for your favorable <orig
                        reg="opinion">oppinion</orig> of me I am very sorry that it is not a <del
                        hand="h1"/> matter you asked if I was in the fight near Richmond, I was not.
                    I had not been relieved from duty in Westemoreland, I returned to camp on the
                        9<hi rend="super">th</hi> of this month. have not been very <pb n="4"/>quiet
                    since I got here as the enemy kept <add hand="h1" place="inline">us</add> moving
                        <orig reg="until">untill</orig> two days ago at which time we settled
                    affairs all is quiet now. Our losses were very slight. Well Miss Kate fearing I

                    guess I had better close. My kindest regards to your fair family, please let me
                    hear from you ever sooner. your letters are most welcome messengers, with my
