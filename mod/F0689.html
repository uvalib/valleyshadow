<p class="p10">wJuly 18<sup>th</sup>" 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Headquarters 107<sup>th</sup>" Regiment
                            Pennsylvania Volunteers, Camp At Warrenton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I received Your letter I expected it the very day I
                    received it, at least it was about the time if You was prompt in answering my
                    letter, I was glad to know You were all well. I received a letter from Frank
                    Since his return to his Regiment. I wrote to Margaret Yesterday She told Frank
                    that She wanted me to write, I was not aware of her husband running on the road so near me last Spring we guarded that part of
                    the railroad. now we have gone 26 miles further
                    down. the road is now being repaired to Gordonsville which is about 50 miles
                    from here, then from there to Richmond the road is good, a distance 46 miles but
                    I think if the rebels have the knowledge of our
                    army coming they will destroy the road.</p>
<p class="p10">Father there is an army in this valley 80 thousand
                    Strong good troops General Pope at their head. we fear
                    nothing if General
                    McClellan watches his time as we approach to
                    richmond. he will be able to whip them and go into Richmond. he will be able to
                    whip them and go into Richmond. as you See they will have to Send out of the
                    city a large force to watch us on the north Side while McClellan can go right into the city.</p>
<p class="p10">This war must be conducted on different principals than what it has been or our
                    cause will be in danger, the abolitionists must be put down Slaveholders must not look for their property or
                    negroes to be protected they must either be for us or against us, that is they
                    who are loyal must come out. and them who are rebels must Swear Allegiance to
                    the country or be taken as prisoners of war. Such I believe<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>is the
                    orders that has been issued lately. We cannot Succeed if we allow rebels to run loose carry all information to the enemy they
                    can, we must Stop this thing, and Start out on the new. I fear very much whether
                    Pennsylvania can make up her quota of troops
                    without drafting I only hope She can for her own credit. if things are as dull
                    as Reid Says they are in his Section, the State will have to draft the men.</p>
<p class="p10">Father You Speak of the great loss at Richmond. Yes it
                    was dreadful, I had heard nothing of Captain Hess or
                    the Regiment he was in I could See nothing in the papers about the first
                    reserves. I thought perhaps they were not in the
                    fight.</p>
<p class="p10">You also Say if You was in my place You would resign and come home, well Father it is not that I have not been tempted to resign
                    before this when I look and See how things are going but, I have taken an oath
                    to Support the Constitution of the United States and
                    obey the President and assist him in carrying out and administering the laws.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not like the idea of resigning when I am well in fact there is, according to late orders a difficulty in a Officer
                    resigning without a good reason Such as bad health or Severe illness.</p>
<p class="p10">I would be Satisfied now with even a furlough for ten days or two weeks. but all
                    applications for furloughs now must be made to the war department instead of the
                        Brigadier General.</p>
<p class="p10">Father we have met with a severe loss in our Regiment,
                    this week in the Sudden Death of our Colonel (Thomas A.
                    Zeigle) of York Pennsylvania. he was a fine man a good Colonel and a brave Officer. but he fell a victim to that one vice which men
                    in the army get into that is drinking too much <u>Whiskey</u>
                    he died with "<u>
                        delirium tremens
                    </u>" His body was embalmed here in camp taken up to Washington from thence to
                    York to be buried "<u>Peace to his
                        Ashes</u>"</p>
<p class="p10">I have been unwell Since I wrote to You but only Slightly I have had the Yellow
                    Gaunders they made me right Sick for a day or two. Today is a wet day it has rained all last night all day today with the prospects of a wet time generally, the weather has
                    been very hot down here very
                    heavy gusts, come up.</p>
<p class="p10">I am pleased to hear of Such excellent crops this Season, down here in Virginia
                    where there is corn Potatoes beans peas etc.
                    planted they all look well there is fine land in this neighborhood but it needs tillers What Wheat has been Sown last
                    fall is harvested but never gathered in there being no horses owned by the farmers they all being in the rebel army. it Serves most
                    of them right had no <u>business to secede</u>. </p>
<p class="p10">Us Officers have to find our own rations, in the city <i>[added: near]</i> where we are encamped the white citizens will not
                    sell us anything the colored population Sell us vegetables,
                    pies milk cakes etc. When we first came here the
                    men in business did not want to take our money for groceries
                    etc but that was soon stopped they were all arrested and brought before the Provost Marshall who ordered them to take the oath of
                    allegiance or they would be taken as prisoners of war and all their Stores taken
                    they came down to the "<u>dots</u>" Preachers was Served the
                    Same way, the Citizens of the town are big bugs with plenty of negroes and were
                    strong secessionists, but the people living in the
                    country are different Some are very Strong Union and
                    voted against seceding.</p>
<p class="p10">I will now Stop tell Cornelius to write my love to all the family write soon
                    again direct as before. no more now</p>
<p class="p10">From Your Son</p>
