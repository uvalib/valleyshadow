<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Roswell Waldo to John A. McDonnell, November 20, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waldo asks for a teacher to be sent to Laurel Hill, a community east of Staunton. He specifically asks for a black teacher, so that he or she will be able to board with a black family, citing white opposition to black schools.</p>

    Bureau Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands<br>4th Division 9th Sub District Virginia
Captain J. A. McDonnell<br>Sub Assistant Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">November 20/68</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">The colored people of Laurel Hill <i>[added: Augusta County]</i> are in need of a teacher for a school <i>[added: which]</i> they are ready to open. They have a comfortable log school house, for the Erection of which this Bureau appropriated $40.00. On account of the poverty of the colored people in that vicinity they could pay the board only of a teacher. On account of hostility of the <u>white</u> population toward colored schools, the people would prefer a <u>colored</u> teacher, as he or she could then board in a colored family.</p>
<p class="p10">Can the Bureau or American Missionary Association send a teacher to this school? There will be about 25 or 30 scholars.</p>
<p class="p10">Schools in other localities could be opened this winter if teachers of <u>any</u> <u>sort</u> could be procured &amp; their wages paid from any other source than by the freedpeople.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Roswell Waldo Assistant Sub Assistant Commissioner</i></p>
