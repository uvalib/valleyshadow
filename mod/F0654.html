<p class="p10">McDougall Hospital</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father, </p>
<p class="p10">I am still here but am fit to go the the Regiment at any moment. the sooner the
                    better. All soldiers here living in Michigan, Vermont, Rhode Island, Maine, New Jersey and New York soldiers living west of Albany, were transferred or furloughed. It is reported here that
                    Pennsylvania troops are to stay here and vote. I don't
                    know how it is. There was no <i>[unclear: agent]</i> around yet, to give us
                    tickets. five sixths of the men won't vote if kept here, since men from other states were transferred. the Doctors say that they have no order
                    for us yet and don't know if one will come for us or
                    not. The Ohio troops are in the same<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> fix. I expect we will be kept
                    here and not get a chance to vote. Today every man in
                    the Hospital was Vaccinated. There is now about
                    three hundred men here since the rest were transferred. Out of the 300 men here not fifty votes will be polled if they are kept here. Can't you send send me a blank filled up, all but signed, so that I can
                    send it home and still vote. If I don't get it nothing
                    will be lost. Don't write to me until you hear further from me, but send a blank or something so that I
                    can vote, as soon as you receive this. From three to
                    eight die every day here. I am well.</p>
<p class="p10">Give My love to all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Son </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Henry C. Metzger. </i></p>
<p class="p10">If here I will write to Ruth tomorrow. </p>
