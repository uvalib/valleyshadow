<h4>Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris,
                         December 28, 1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter written soon before the army set into winter quarters, Pastor
                         describes light losses in a recent battle as compared to huge (over 15,000)
                         casualties on the Union side. He discusses his ideas about northern morale
                         and the Lincoln government. He also is happy that the Rockbridge Cavalry
                         has been dismounted since he believes they have contributed little to the
                         war. He later mentions that there are no alcoholic drinks around.</p>

<p class="p10">Sunday evening December 28<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Fredricksburg</p>
<p class="p10">
                              <u>My</u>
                              <u>Dearest</u>
                              <u>Annie</u>
                         </p>
<p class="p10"> Your very welcome &amp; interesting letter, (for which I have been
                         anxiously looking for a long time) has just come to hand, the perusal of
                         which gave me great pleasure I assure you. I had very near come to the same
                         conclusion that you were about to come to; but I am happy to say, before I
                         had entirely despaired the expected document
                         was handed me. I was just in the act of setting down to my scanty meal, but
                         did not until after I had read the aforesaid document, sent in the care of
                         "Friend Tom" But friend Tom was not forthcoming. What has become of him? I
                         suppose he got <i>[unclear: storm]</i>
                         <i>[unclear: staid]</i> somewhere between Newport &amp; middlebrook,
                         or some other unforeseen accident has befell him; be that as it may, he has
                         not turned <i>[added: up]</i> here yet. Well I hardly
                         know what to write that would prove at all interesting to you. I guess you
                         have heard all the particulars relative to our late fight before this; you
                         spoke of having heard from all the companies in our Regiment excepting the Southern Guards, &amp; hoped that they
                         had not met with so many casualties as they had done in times past. I am
                         happy to say we suffered but little, only one of our "gallant band" was
                         wounded, (although we were<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> under a heavy Artillery fire all the
                         time) Namely Cyrus Lotts who had his little finger shot off by the
                         accidental discharge of his musket in the night whilst getting a drink of
                         water.</p>
<p class="p10">In regard to the loss of the enemy I am unable to speak at present _ as I did
                         not get a chance to visit the battle field; but judging fom northern
                         Journals, they suffered a heavy loss. They admit a loss of 15000, &amp;
                         say that it was the greatest defeat of the war. Great dissatisfaction is
                         prevailing at this time in the Lincoln government &amp; it is to be
                         hoped they will burst up in a row. The weather has been very cold since we
                         came to this camp, but it is quite mild now. This day one week ago (being
                         the day your letter was wrote) was one of the coldest days we have had this
                         winter. I tell you we have had hard times since we <i>[unclear: came]</i>
                         on this side of the "Blue Ridge", can't get
                         anything in the country at all, and nothing in camp except some little
                                   <i>[unclear: motly/knotty]</i> apples
                         &amp; ginger bread for which we have to pay about twenty
                              <i>[unclear: pieces]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">I wish so much I could have been with you all a Christmas to have partook of
                         the good things prepared for that occasion, but this privilege<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                         has again been denied me. however I had a splended dinner on that day, a
                         description of which you can get by going to Annie B. I am happy to hear
                         the Rockbridge Cavalry have been dismounted; for they have never rendered
                         any service yet to the Confederacy worth speaking of. I trust they may yet
                         have a chance to redeem their character, by performing some "heroic deeds".</p>
<p class="p10">Everything is quiet along the Rappahannock once more. The enemy have
                         recrossed the river, and are now occupying the same position they did
                         previous to the fight. Hope they may continue in their present position, or
                         return across the Potomac. Some of our Divisions are engaged in putting up
                         Winter Quarters. I expect we will change our camp in a few days, when we
                         will go into "winter Quarters" providing the Yankees remain quiet. I am
                         thankful for your kind advice, but sorry to say that I have not seen a drop
                         stronger than water, what you think of that? Well I suppose it is best so.
                         for I might have gotten tipsy had I have gotten my will at it. Well I must
                         close for the present, as I have gotten some official letters to write, that must be attended to. Excuse haste
                         etc. &amp;believe me to be as ever yours.</p>
