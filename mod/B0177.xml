                <p>Allen Rodes wishes me to write to you and state the circumstance concerning a
                    matter that he will apply to you on and it is as follows as you will see by his
                    papers in June 1866 he was Registered by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt</abbr>
                    Hooks as married to Ann Davis and has been living with her ever since and before
                    as for some time as man and wife and on Sunday last a black man by the name of
                    John <add hand="h1" place="inline">Cooper</add> came to my house (I having
                    Allen's wife employed), and took his wife off claming her as his wife <del
                        hand="h1">and</del> he having had her before as his wife but left her some
                    six or seven years ago as I am informed and is now I understand claiming the
                    property that Allen has gathered up since his marriage and will apply to you for
                    an order for it and I think it nothing but fair that you should be informed on
                        <orig reg="both">boath</orig> sides of the case before you act in the
                    matter. I can say for Allen, as fair as I have <orig reg="seen">sean</orig> of
                    him he is a <orig reg="truthful">truthfull</orig> honest man and will not state
