<p class="p10">March 21/63</p>
<p class="p10">Carthage, Tennessee</p>
<p class="p10"> My Dear Friend:</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor of March 10th <br> was duly received and I <br> wrote an answer and mailed <br>
     it day-before yesterday, but <br> I have just learned that <br>
     the mail was captured by <br> the Guerillas between here &amp; <br>
     Gallatin, so I will have it <br> to do all over again. </p>
<p class="p10"> So you have committed <br> matrimony, have you? Or <br> were you only joking? If <br> you
     really have "gone and <br> done it" allow me to congratulate you on your choice <br> and to wish you and your<br> bride a happy voyage
     together 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitSho7b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitSho7b.gif"></center></a><br><br> down the stream of life, <br> together with the "little responsibilities. I am sorry <br> however to lose you
     from <br> among the noble fraternity of <br>
     Bachelors. I fear that the <br> joys and cures of matrimony may induce you to forget your friends who have <br> not yet joined the Benedictine order. </p>
<p class="p10">The fact is I intend to <br> take me an helpmate myself <br>
     from among Pennsylvania's
     <br> fair daughters, some day--<br>
     perhaps. With this <br> view I expect you to spread <br> a good word for me to all <br> the
     "genuine fenders" and it <br> may be I can find some one <br> fool enough to have me.-- </p>
<p class="p10"> I quite agree with you in <br>
     
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitSho7c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitSho7c.gif"></center></a><br><br> regard to the wish you express
     in regard to that holding affair. </p>
<p class="p10">Since I last wrote to you <br> we have "changed our base" to <br> the north side of the
      
      Cumberland
      river as it was getting <br> quite unhealthy on the other <br> side. A forage train
     of 18 <br> six-mule teams <i>[deleted: was captured <br> on the 6<sup>th</sup>]</i> together with the <br> escort of 62 men from our <br> regiment was captured on
     <br> the 6th, and hardly a night <br> passed without some of our <br> pickets being shot.
     Since we <br> crossed we have not been <br> troubled in that way. Four <br> of our boats
     were fired into yesterday 7 miles below <br> here and two men
      wounded. Our gun-boat shelled 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitSho7d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitSho7d.gif"></center></a><br><br> the town (Rome) and the adjacent roads and quite a number of the rebs were killed.--<br> The town was nearly burned <br> to the ground. We
     are every <br> day expecting an attack from <br>
     General Bragg, who
     has lately been <br> heavily reinforced. We are also <br> expecting reinforcements.--<br>
     The small pox has made its <br> appearance here in some of <br> our regiments. Otherwise the
     <br> health is good. </p>
<p class="p10">This is about all the local <br> news. With the general news
     <br> you are better acquainted, I presume, than I am. </p>
<p class="p10">The weather is quite fine <br> and ploughing and gardening <br> is the order of the day
     among <br> the citizens. In that respect <br> I presume they are about three 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitSho7e.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitSho7e.gif"></center></a><br><br> weeks ahead of you. </p>
<p class="p10">Our regiment was today
     <br> furnished with brand new <br> Norfolk Rifles (Springfield<br>
     pattern) I am quite proud <br> of mine, which I call "Katie <br> Darling" and I am anxious
     <br> to draw a bead on a rebel <br> with it. I intend to sleep <br> with it tonight. </p>
<p class="p10"> Give my respects to your <br> lady and all the friends, and <br> write soon </p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
