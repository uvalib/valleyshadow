<p class="p10">February 16th, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Enclosed I send you a copy of an order for muster (out as Captain and in as Maj.)
                        <i>[unclear: given]</i> 27th of Aug. last, same date I called at Capt.
                    Woods office + was informed by his clerk that the Capt. was absent on special
                    duty but would return next day. I returned next day but the Capt. had not
                    returned + was not expected to for several days. I stated to the Clerk that my
                    Regiment was under orders to march + I was desirous to have my papers complete,
                    he said in reply that the order for muster would place me all right in case I
                    failed to meet with a mustering officer. My regiment marched to Sharpsburg M.D.
                    where I was taken back + sent to Chambersburg Pa. I here remained under the care
                    of the Medical Director <i>[illeg.]</i> this month when as my Regt. was in want
                    of an officer = i having no prospect of returning health resigned. My
                    resignation was accepted and I receive my discharge dated Feb. 22nd 1862 + in
                    the mean time I had no appointment to be mustered.</p>
<p class="p10">Maj. Lyon the paymaster of Harrisburg on presentation of my pay roll + papers of
                    discharge + orders for muster refused to pay without certificate of muster. Gen.
                    Thomas happened to be in Harrisburg to whom he referred the case. I was ordered
                    to find a copy of the order for muster stating the case + ask for an order to
                    Capt. lane at Harrisburg to be mustered in as Major.</p>
<p class="p10">You will therefore much oblige by forwarding said order to me at Chambersburg,
                    Franklin Co. Penna.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Major<br> Very Respectfully<br> Your Obt. Servant</p>
