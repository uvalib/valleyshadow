<p class="p10">The last Sabbath  
in May, Jackson was fighting in<br> 
Winchester,  
the first in June was the battle of  
Seven Pines<br>  
near 
Richmond, which <i>[deleted:

Saturday  A sacramental meeting was in progress 
in this place at the<br>  
same time.  Preaching by Mr. Harris. 
The second Sabbath<br>  
in June, Jackson <i>[added: or rather 
Ewell]</i> was fighting at  
Port Republic with<br> 
<i>[deleted: Shields]</i><i>[added:  
Fremont]</i>.   
 
The firing was heard here all day by many, a<br> 
distance of 33 m.  The next day firing was heard for some<br>  
hours -- an 
engagement between Jackson &amp;  
Shields.</p>

<p class="p10">Firing has been heard in the vicinity  
<br> 
of Richmond for several days, &amp;  
intense anxiety has been  
<br> 
felt to learn the result. Tidings was brought to  
church  
<br> 
that our armies have been victorious thus far,  
that many <br> 
prisoners, &amp; cannon had been taken--heavy loss on both  
<br> 
sides.  
Public thanks were offered for their deliverance.   
<br> 
Our help is in God  
&amp; in him alone.  The battle still

<p class="p10">Mr. Wright, a neighbor who has four sons in the  
<br> 
army, one of them now a  
prisoner, passed by.  To the  
<br> 
usual inquiry "What news?" he pulled out  
of his pocket a  
<br> 
copy of the telegrams he had copied in S. reaching to 
<br>  
Monday.  
midnight. McClellan has  
been driven from his entrenchments,  
is in so local across  
White Oak Swamp to  
<br> 
James river.  
Stuart took  
3000 prisoners yesterday.  A S. J.  
<br> 
brigade (2300) have laid down their  
arms.  McClellanhas  
<br> 
destroyed vast quantities of stores, &amp; the opinion is  
that  
<br> 
the whole army will be <i>[deleted: demoralized]</i> "demolished."  
<br> 
This news afforded great  
relief, as it had been feared that  
<br> 
Halleck would come on with 100,000  
men as rumor 
<br> 
said he would by Sabbath  
eve while our men <i>[added: (By command)]</i> could

have seldom been able to hear it before, but heard it

the watch.</p>

it eagerly, but got little  
<br> 
about the battle as they are not permitted  
to publish  
<br> 
yet.  Heard that some Louisianians advanced to  
<br> 
the charge  
with the name of Butler as their war

desperately.  Butler

Lincoln &amp; Seward &amp; Greely,  
tiumvirate No 2.  <u> 
Greely</u> it may be, the most deeply  
<br> 
stained of  
the whole.  Butler is the best man for  
<br> 
our cause within the limits of  
the S. C. He has  
<br> 
given a union to the Southern heart, and a nerve<br> 
 to  
the Southern cause as one that none among ourselves  
<br> 
could possibly  
have done.  They thought theywere united &amp; in earnest, before his reign came,  
<br> 
but there's a  
difference since.  Lincoln  
<i>[deleted: did]</i> 
performed a similar operation for us at the  
commencement of the struggle by his proclamation for 75,000  
<br> 
men,  
insulted Va. almost to a man &amp; drove her out  
<br> 
of the Union as by a  
thunderbolt.</p>

when it comes.  Pity, pity, that the Northern  
<br> 
people should have been made the dupes of such  
<br> 
a set of knaves.  I seldom think of  
it without remembering the lying spirit which was permitted to  
<br> 
take  
posession of Ahab's prophets, that he might be  
<br> 
persuaded to go to R-- &amp; 
fall.  This judgment from God <br> 
 
has fallen upon the North because of  
their declension  
<br> 
from him.  Its effects, <i>[added: it is true,]</i> 
 have come upon  
us, &amp; more  
<br> 
heavily thus far <i>[added: than upon them,]</i> 
 but the end is not yet.  
We too have  
<br> 
cause for deep humiliation, but we shall achieve  
<br> 
our  
independence, &amp; if guided aright, shall fulfill a 
<br>  
 
high destiny &amp; be far  
more prosperous than ever before.  
<br> 
 Never for one moment since this  
struggle 
commenced,  
has my mind wavered as to the final result.Never could I for one moment believe that a righteous  
<br> 
God would  
suffer us to be trodden down as the mud  
<br> 
of the streets, whatever our  
cruel and insolent invaders  
<br> 
might threaten.  Too many prayers have  
been ascending to heavens night &amp; day for such an event to come to  
<br> 
pass.  Retribution may  
<i>[deleted: be]</i>  
possibly be delayed a short time  
<br> 
but it will  
most assuredly come.  The violent dealing of  
<br> 
the wicked will acrue  
down upon his own head.  May  
<br> 
heaven lighten the blow, &amp; turn the  
hearts of both nations to him &amp; to one another.</p>

<br>took place.  He lies  in the centre of the grave yard by  
<br> 
the side of his young wife.  Was killed in the battles  
of Richmond. Not long after was the funeral of  
Mrs.  <br> 
 Buchanan.  
August 11<sup>th</sup>

<p class="p10">A long hiatus.  Couldn't help it. So many  
<br> 
things to occupy the  
attention.  It would be in vain

<i>[added: to attempt]</i> to enumerate the multitudes  
of events which have transpired since the last date.  The 29th &amp; 30th of  
August 
 the  
<br> 
second battle of Manassas took place.  At this  
battle  
<br> 
Colonel William Baylor was killed, leaving a heartbroken  
<br> 
wife &amp; mother &amp; sister to  
mourn his loss, but they  
<br> 
have hope in his death.  James  
Gabert was  
also killed  
<br> 
at this battle.  His brother John was wounded before  
<br> 
but  
died after, &amp; was brought home to be buried.   
<br> 
L Kerr another neighbor  
of ours died the 14th September  
<br> 
of typhoid fever.  Before this on the  
10th, little Emily  
<br> 
Baylor died of diptheria.  On the  
20th, David B.  
died of  
<br> 
the same disease at the age of twelve.  Thus two <i>[added:

 died <br> 
out of three families, two from each.  Fifteen new graves <br> 
<br> 
have been added to our grave yard during this year.

A Mrs.  
Wright living  
with her two of three illeg.

<br> 
of another neighbor came  
from the army with it,

infant  
<br> 
died.  Another neighbor who visited them, took it, &amp; died.

When has a year departed so crowded  
<br> 
with events, &amp; <u>such</u> events as  
the last.  How many  
<br> 
battles have we fought, &amp; how has God blessed our <br> 
armies with victory.  Blessed be the Lord who has  
<br> 
not given us as a  
prey to their teeth.  As a nation,  
<br> 
we have in a measure acknowledged  
God, &amp; he has

appeared for us most wonderfully, on one occasion  
<br> 
giving  
us two great victories in one day; one at  in Kentucky, &amp; the  
other I think at Leesburg<br>  
in Virginia. 
  Our President, who is a plain,  
simple, consistent Christian, as appears, a member of the Episcopal church, has appointed days of special  
<br> 
prayer on three occasions, when  
our cause seemed <br> 
 dark, our prospect rather, &amp; in every case, the answer  
was manifest.  After the two victories in  
<br> 
one day, a day of  
thanksgiving was appointed <br> 
&amp; generally &amp; joyfully observed.  It was  
stated in

Stonewall  
Jackson, who is an elder in the

Presbyterian Church 
 in Lexington, his brother in  
law, Gen D. H.

Hill, &amp; others.  Gen. Jackson sent a special  
request to  
the churches some time since for their <br> 
prayers.  He writes in the Whig

<br> 
prayer for <u>peace</u>

What awful disappointment will be experienced 
<br> by  
our friends the abolitionists.  Never was  
<br> 
a more quiet and orderly  
Christmas &amp; New Years.   
<br> 
Even Sister Catharine  
who is so <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> timid,  
<u>forgot</u><br> 
 to be afraid!  I do not forget it, but a little  
circumstance  
may show how much I was terrified.   
<br> 
Brother Luther having been  
to Charlottesville,  
Cousin S 
<br> 
 went <i>[added: to S.]</i>  
for him, &amp; did not get home  
till late.  I  
<br> 
sat up for them, and having occasion to visit my  
<br> 
chambers, went repeatedly in the dark, &amp; near midnight.  
 Indeed, never  
since have I been in this state  
<br> 
have I felt any reluctance to visiting  
any part of  
<br> 
the house in the dark either here or in Highland.This whole agitation about slavery which 
<br> has prevailed at the S.  
these years, is the most

monstrous humbug ever got up since the flood.   
<br> 
I am <i>[added: if  
possible]</i> a thousand times better satisfied of the  
propriety of  
slavery than I was before the war.   
<br> 
I believe this violent abolition  
spirit grows out of attempting to be wise above what is written, &amp; it  
shows  
<br> 
itself out where it is carried out, by leading those  
<br> 
possessed  
with it to throw away the bible.  It is  
<br> 
my full belief that the  
infatuation which has preciptated the North into this war, is a  
judgment  
<br> 
from God upon them for their deep declension from  
<br> 
him  
manifested <i>[added: among other ways]</i> 
 by their fanaticism and every other

ism.  
The fear of the Lord had <i>[deleted: so]</i> nearly ford where 
 the

upon them.  
It has spent much of its force upon

have miscalculated this eclipse altogether.

<p class="p10">Mh. 6,</p>
<p class="p10">Have written but little for a long time on account of  
indisposition.  Am staying in bed from  
<br> 
influenza, but must try to  
write a little about  
Bishop  
<br> 
Meade.  He died within a few months, had been <br>  
bishop of the diocese of  
Virginia  
more than 30 year.   
Sister  
<br> 
Catharine  
had known  
him for her childhood, &amp; says he  
<br> 
was one of the most excellent &amp; 
devoted of the episcopal clergy which is saying not a little in her  
opinion.  Bishop Meade  
used often to come to her aunt's where  
<br> 
she spent  
much of her time when a child, &amp; she describes him as one of the  
meekest &amp; most Godly of men.   
<br> 
Not many years since, he attended a  
confirmation  
<br> 
in Staunton,  
Sister Catharine  
happened to be present and told me <br>  
on her return how solemn &amp; searching his  
<br> 
address was.  He lived near  
Winchester had embellished his place with the finest fruits &amp; flower,  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 15</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar15.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar15.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
  
&amp; there was his wife's grave.  Just before his  
<br> 
death, he was  
called to Richmond to consecrate  
<br> 
bishop Wilmer.  This finished he was  
attacked with  
<br> 
disease which speedily removed him to his home  
<br> 
above.  
On his deathbed he called for Bishop 
 Johns who 
<br>
was as a son to him, &amp; 
gave him his opinion of the  
<br> 
war.  He told him the cause in which we  
are engaged  
is a <u>holy</u> cause-- but I will leave the space.  
<br> 
 I  
can get the printed account. (Cannot obtain it.)One bitter pang his Heavenly Father  
<br> 
kindly spared him, the  
knowledge <u>that his beautiful  
<br> 
home had been desecrated &amp; desolated  
by the ruthless <br> 
Yankees.</u> I say <u>Yankees</u> because that is the  
universal  
<br> 
appellation given here to the whole nation.Owing to the inflation of our economy, produced in  
<br> 
 
part by the  
abundant issue of treasury notes, our  
<br> 
business affairs are involved in  
much perplexity.  Every  
<br> 
article is from two or three time its usual <br> 
value.  Corn is 3,25 a bushel, flour 20 or 25 dollars  
<br> 
a barrel, pork  
30, a hundred, butter from one to two  
<br> 
dollars a pd in R.  Those who  
have much to sell  
<br> 
make great profits, but those who have all to buy  
<br> 
and little to sell like ourselves, are in danger of faring  
<br> 
hardly.  
Providence has kindly provided for us however.  We had some stores on  
hand of sugar, molasses, coffee, clothing, shoes &amp;c.  Some lady not  
far off  
<br> 
lately bought two calico dresses for 50 dollars apiece, but  
<br> 
we  
have had to buy nothing, &amp; as to bread stuff,  
<br> 
some of my brother's  
people, have sold to him  
<br> 
at the old prices. 
  
It is a hard case that my money is beyond my  
<br> 
reach in this time of  
need.  I have no claim upon  
<br> 
this family, do not even teach the  
children since Cousin S. commenced his school, &amp; 
Sister Catharine often tells  
me  
<br> 
she wishes me to do nothing but what I find necessary for  
exercise.  Still I have ever been treated with  
<br> 
the utmost kindness, &amp; 
assured of a home as long as  
<br> 
they have one.We have much to be grateful for.  For months  
<br> 
we were under frequent  
apprehensions that the Yankees  
<br> 
would come in &amp; get posession of the  
Valley, but the  
<br> 
Lord mercifully preserved us from the danger, &amp; has <br>  
delivered us from the fear.  In our circumstances it  
<br> 
would probably  
have been death to some of us.  How  
<br> 
many pleasant homes have these  
barbarians desolated, strewing the gardens with fragments of  
<br>

not to them their deserts O Lord.  The Lord be gracious

to all  
there as well as here who have shown me kindness

send us some of their corn &amp; bacon.  We are bound to have

Missouri,

<p class="p10">March 11,</p>
<p class="p10">A young man from the neighborhood, not half  
<br> 
a mile distant indeed,  
was taken by the Yankees a few  
<br> 
months since, &amp; has not returned.  They  
look for him  
<br> 
daily as prisoners have been exchanged, but he comes  
not.   
<br> 
Hope it will not be with him as with Willie Hite,  
another  
<br> 
young  
man <i>[deleted: from]</i> living a few miles from us, who had  
<br> 
been taken, &amp; reached home  
only to die from the hardships he had experienced.  
  
James Holladay, Sister  
Catharine's nephew, was a similar  
<br> 
instance.  He was  
in Williamsburg sick when that place  
<br> 
was taken, attempted to escape,  
but fell from exhaustion  
<br> 
&amp; was taken by them.  He was taken to  
Washington first,  
<br> 
says he had no special reason to complain of his  
treatment there.  Many things were sent in by the secession  
<br> 
ladies.  
He was soon removed however to  
Fort Delaware,<br> where he was treated in  
the most inhuman manner,  
<br> 
had nothing but a <i>[added: narrow]</i> board,  
<i>[added: or rather  
two, one overlapping the other,]</i> a sort of shelf to lie on, a little  
<br> 
piece of fat meat &amp; bread twice a day, &amp; was cursed  
<br> 
&amp; kicked about by  
the officers, some of them Dutch,  
<br> 
with their thick boots, especially  
those who were sick &amp; could not  
<br> 
work.  He was there four or five  
months, his mother  
<br> 
the meantime not knowing whether he was dead or  
alive.   
<br> 
An exchange of prisoners was finally effected, &amp; he was<br>  
brought home to die, lived two or three weeks after his  
<br> 
return.  He  
was a most amiable, unselfish youth,  
<br> 
wholly devoted to his mother.

army.  <i>[deleted: The]</i> We have taken  
<i>[added: Winchester

&amp; stores without number.  The old brute  
himself narrowly escaped.  There is such a good story in the

in Winchester.  She  
says God only knows what we have

proceeds to speak  
<br> 
among other things of an old negro who was kept

on  
nothing but water for three days because he  
refused 
 to work &amp; said he  
was "secesh."  The fourth

"Are

splitting wood with iron balls  
attached to his  
<br> 
hands &amp; feet.  This Lady's brother was at the

house &amp; saw him. The officer was cursing

saying "Bless de

<p class="p10">Long time has elapsed since the foregoing was written, &amp; 
innumerable have been the events  
<br> 
which have transpired in the  
interval.  The most important of these to me are two severe illnesses  
which  
<br> 
have occured since last  
October.  A few particulars of these  
<br> 
I will  
note down, as I write for the information of my  
<br> 
northern friends,  
should any of them have the curiosity to read this journal, &amp; leave  
herewith the request<br> 
 that it may be forwarded to them at some future  
time  
<br>if it 
should  not be in my power to do it myself.The attacks spoken of bore symptoms of typhoid  
<br> 
pneumonia at first,  
&amp; the fever in each attack continued  
<br> 
many days, especially the  
quickness of the pulse,  
<br> 
ranging from 120 to 125.  This was attended &amp; 
suceeded  
by extreme prostration so that many of my  
<br> 
friends apprehended  
that I would never be able to arise.   
<br> 
By the blessing of God, however,  
upon the close attention  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 24</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar24.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar24.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
 
of my physicians &amp; the most careful nursing, I was at  
<br> 
length  
restored, though confined to my my bed the second  
<br> 
time nearly three  
months.  I cannot at all do justice  
<br> 
to my feelings here without  
speaking particularly of  
<br> 
Sister Catharine's  
kindness in watching over me with <br>  
the tenderest care by day &amp; by night through both these  
<br> 
illnesses.  
<i>[added: Much more might be added did not my limits forbid. 
]</i>  I must be indulged  
in describing my little  
<br> 
bed, set under the windows by the side of  
hers, &amp; at  
<br> 
right angles with it, in here for the last eight or nine  
<br> 
months, I have slept by night &amp; lain often a great  
<br> 
part of the day.Some of the neighbors sat up with me a few  
<br> 
nights, but for the most  
part, Eva attended upon  
<br> 
me, sleeping in the same room &amp; bringing me  
nourishment at bedtime &amp; at midnight &amp; soon in the  
<br> 
morning.  If she  
got worn out, Sister C. in spite  
<br> 
of all my persuasions, would do it  
herself.For weeks during the second illness, I took no  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 25</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar25.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar25.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
  
solid food &amp; very little of anything.  The doctor however  
<br> 
said I  
must eat often, &amp; after I began to get an appetite  
<br> 
I did not fail to  
profit by his suggestion, for my stomach felt like a shrivelled scroll  
if I did not eat very  
<br> 
frequently.  No one would <i>[added: have]</i> 
 supposed I could  
lose  
<br> 
much flesh, but I did, &amp; when able to a rise from  
<br> 
my bed, looked  
like a walking skeleton.  By a kind  
<br> 
Providence, we had a small  
quantity of cocoa  
<br> 
on hand.  This suited me pretty well, which was <br> 
fortunate as I could not take tea &amp; coffee.  I was  
<br> 
kept constantly  
supplied with chicken soup, which  
<br> 
with porridge &amp; a little bread &amp; 
butter formed a sufficient variety.   
But enough on this head.</p>

<p class="p10">One thing I omitted to mention, a severe cough  
<br> 
a thing very unusual  
for me.  It hung on for many  
<br> 
weeks, &amp; indeed is not entirely cured  
yet.  This cough  
<br> 
seemed a sort of epidemic.  Within the last year, it  
has <br> 
prevailed extensively, has been so violent &amp; long  
continued,

 that many have insisted it was the whooping  
<br> 
cough, even  
those who have <i>[added: had]</i> that already.I was taken the second time, the last of February. 
<br>  Have recovered so as  
to be able to go about the house  
<br> 
but not so as to go to church or to  
visit abroad, &amp; feel  
<br> 
still very weak so that it often requires a  
painful  
<br> 
effort to get about.  During this time, Sister  
Catharine has  
<br> 
been  
sick two or three times.  Once she had inflammation of the stomach &amp; 
was threatened with apoplexy  
<br> 
but was mercifully spared to us.  
Eva was  
sick &amp;  
<br> 
laid up for some time, &amp; she got over done.  One of  
<br> 
the  
neighbors lent us a little chap to wait on me.   
<br> 
Josie was sick a long  
time too, though not at the  
<br> 
same time with his mother.Our friends at the North have probably  
<br> 
been thinking <i>[added: some]</i>  
about us  
of late, hearing that the Yankees have taken  
Staunton, though  
<u>what</u> they have  
<br> 
thought is beyond my power to divine, ignorant  
as we

are of each others feelings.  Sister  
Catharine &amp; I very often  
<br> 
talk of  
them, wonder how they fare <i>[added:  
&amp; what they think of us,]</i> whether they set  
us down  
<br> 
for incorrigible rebels against "the best government in  
<br> 
the  
world," always winding up however by arguing  
<br> 
that we do not &amp; cannot  
believe they favor this unjust &amp; abominable war, though such strange  
things  
<br> 
happen these days that nothing ought to astonish us.But I commenced with the intention of telling a story about some  
Yankee raiders.  We have  
<br> 
often had alarms about their coming but have <br>  
been preserved by a kind Providence until this season.   
<br> 
Not long  
since, they favored us with two visits  
<i>[added: (on June 9 &amp; 10th)]</i> which  
<br> 
will  
not soon be forgotten in these parts.  The first day,  
<br> 
they came in  
from the West, across the mountain.  A  
<br> 
party of 40 or 50 perhaps, came  
riding up, dismounted  
<br> 
&amp; rushed in.  "Have you got any whiskey" said  
they,  
<br> 
"got any flour?  got any bacon?" <i>[added:  
with plenty of oaths]</i> "Come on  
boys," says  
<br> 
one, "we'll find it all"  With that, they pushed rudely  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 28</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar28.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar28.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
 
  
by Sister Catharine 
 who was terribly alarmed, &amp; had been  
<br> 
from the first  
news of their coming, &amp; spread themselves nearly all over the house.  
Finding their way  
<br> 
to a fine barrel of flour which a neighbor had given  
<br> 
us, they proceeded to fill their sacks &amp; pillow cases,  
<br> 
scattering a  
large percent on the floor, till it was  
<br> 
nearly exhausted.  The last  
one told us, on our remonstrating,  
to hide the rest.Some went upstairs, opened every trunk &amp;  
<br> 
drawer &amp; tossed things  
upside down or on the floor,  
<br> 
even my nice bonnets, pretending to be  
looking for<br>
arms.  They stole Cousin Samuel's gold sleeve  
buttons  
<br> 
&amp; 
pin (a present to him) his best shirt, a good coat,  
<br> 
&amp; pair of shoes.  
The shoes, it being nearly impossible  
<br> 
to get shoes these days, he  
afterwards persuaded the<br>
fellow to <u>sell</u> him back for an Ohio ten  
dollar note,  
<br> 
as good as gold to him.  He could with a much  
<br> 
better  
appetite doubtless have knocked him down,  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 29</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar29.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar29.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
 
  
but there was no choice in the matter.We did not say anything to provoke them, but  
<br> 
did not disguise our  
sentiments.  They went peeping  
<br> 
under the beds, looking for rebels as  
they said.   
<br> 
Baxter told them there were no rebels here (meaning  
<br> 
rebel  
soldiers) Cate spoke &amp; said  
<u>We are all rebels.</u><br>  
Ellen spoke &amp; 
said "Yes Baxter, I am a rebel."  The  
Yankee  
looked <i>[added: up]</i> from her  
drawer, which he <i>[added: was]</i> searching just<br>
then, &amp; said "That's right."  
Cate  
then said, "I am a rebel  
<br> 
too &amp; I <u>glory</u> in it."  When  
Sister Catharine  
remonstrated with  
<br> 
them about taking the shoes, asking them why they <br> 
injured innocent persons who had taken no part  
<br> 
in the war, one of them  
replied, "You need not tell me  
<br> 
that, I know all the people along here  
have sons in  
<br> 
the army."  She then pointed to B &amp; said "That is my <br> 
only son."  Ellen then said, "I have no brothers in the  
<br> 
army, I wish from my heart I had."  He then said,  
<br> 
"Now Sis, I don't wish you had  
brothers in the  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 30</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar30.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar30.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
 
  
in the army.  I wouldn't like to kill one of your  
<br> 
brothers.  I got  
some corn here," (pointing to his  
<br> 
plunder) An officer rode up after the  
rest had gone  
<br> 
having the appearance of a gentleman, &amp; asked civilly  
<br> 
if  
he could get some flour.  Sister  
Catharine  
telling <i>[added: him]</i> how they  
<br> 
had stripped  
us of nearly every thing they could find,  
<br> 
said he could go &amp; see what  
they had left, &amp; help  
<br> 
himself.  He said no, he never had searched a<br>  
house &amp; never would, &amp; it was a shame they should 
<i>[added: do so.]</i>That night they camped <i>[deleted: away]</i>  
a mile or two<br>  
 
 
 
from us, extending along the  
road two or three  
<br> 
 
miles, &amp; got a fine supper from the farms around  
them.   
<br> 
Sister Catharine 
 was afraid to undress, but lay down quite  
<br> 
exhausted  
two or three hours in the night.  Ellen  
<br> 
kept watch the first part of  
the night, &amp; Cousin S.  
<br> 
the last.  E soon called to him, "I hear  
footsteps."   
<br> 
He went out &amp; saw some coming up the road  
<br> 
with a torch.  
Thinking they might be coming  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 31</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar31.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar31.gif"></center></a><br><br> 

  
to burn the house, he came to our door, saying we  
<br> 
had better have  
something ready to throw around  
<br> 
us if we should be called out for any  
reason <i>[added: taking care not to alarm us]</i>.   
But  
<br> 
our fears were groundless.  
They started off in the  
<br> 
night for Staunton where there were several  
thousand of them.   
Our visitors belonged to Averill's  
<i>[added: command]</i>.</p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 13, 1864
  
</b></p>
<p class="p10">July 13,</p>
<p class="p10">They told us that Crook's men were a great  
<br> 
deal worse than they, &amp; 
that was true, but they were  
<br> 
bad enough &amp; worse at some other places  
than with  
<br> 
us.  At one of our neighbors,  
 
<i>[added: Mr. H.]</i> they took every thing 
<br>  
they had to eat, all the pillow cases &amp; sheets but  
<br> 
what were on the  
beds, &amp; the towels &amp; some of the ladies  
<br> 
stockings.  One of them made  
up a bundle of ladies  
<br> 
clothing to take, but his comrade shamed him out  
of it.  
<br> 
 They then poured out their molasses, scattered their  
<br> 
preserves  
&amp; sugar &amp; other things about the floor, &amp;  
<br> 
mixed them all together &amp; 
destroyed things generally  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 32</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar32.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar32.gif"></center></a><br><br> 

  
The ladies there are very amiable &amp; genteel in their  
<i>[added: appearance]</i>  
<br> 
which makes it the more strange.  Their visitors as well  
<br> 
as ours  
however had taken a drop too much.  This gentleman had kept some  
things for sale of late, had  
<br> 
a quantity of tobacco &amp; some other things  
on hand, all  
<br> 
which they took to the amount of several thousand  
dollars.At another neighbors, they took all of their  
<br> 
meat (some 30 pieces  
of bacon) &amp; nearly everything  
<br> 
else they had to eat, all their horses  
(4) &amp; persuaded off their two negro men.  One of these  
was afterwards  
seen by one of our men crying to come  
<br> 
back, but was watched so closely  
that he could not  
<br> 
escape.  No wonder he cried.  He has been twice  
<br> 
on  
the brink of the grave with pneumonia, &amp; was  
<br> 
nursed by his mistress as  
tenderly as if he had  
<br> 
been a brother, &amp; she was always kind to him,  
his master also.  He will not find such treatment anywhere  
<i>[added: else  
]</i> 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 33</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar33.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar33.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
 
  
The Yankees (I give them this appellation because every body else  
does) took off all the negro men  
<br> 
&amp; boys they could, as well as all the  
horses, told the  
<br> 
women they would take <u>them</u> next time they  
came.   
<br> 
Many sent their horses to the woods.  Some of these  
<br> 
were found  
&amp; captured.  People here do their farming  
<br> 
with horses instead of oxen,  
&amp; it is an immense loss  
<br> 
to have them &amp; the servants swept off to  
such an extent,  
<br> 
just as harvest is about to begin too.  Many sent  
<br> 
off  
their servants in one direction &amp; another, some of whom  
<br> 
were overtaken  
&amp; captured &amp; others escaped.The lady before mentioned has told me since  
<br> 
that no tongue can tell  
her feelings the day the Yankees  
<br> 
were there.  In the first place, they  
fired on her little  
<br> 
son &amp; another boy several times, as they sat on  
the  
<br> 
fence watching their approach, &amp; afterwards pretended  
<br> 
that they  
took them for confederate soldiers from their  
<br> 
being dressed in gray.  
Then her husband &amp; oldest son  
 
  
<br><br>[<i>page 34</i>]<a href="../papers/images/EmeDiar34.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/EmeDiar34.gif"></center></a><br><br> 
 
  
were hid in the bushes in the garden, &amp; she was in  
<br> 
momentary fear  
of their being discovered &amp; fired upon.   
<br> 
The men &amp; boys always kept  
out of the way, as they  
<br>

to shift for  
themselves as best they could.  Another  
<br> 
of our neighbors was fired  
upon several times until  
<br> 
he either dropped or lay down, it was not  
known  
<br> 
which.  They said it was because he ran, but he  
<br> 
was passing  
between their pickets &amp; ours, who were  
<br> 
firing at each other, &amp; was  
obliged to run.  We heard  
<br> 
of the circumstance, &amp; were very uneasy, but  
he providentially escaped injury.  They always fire upon

those who run  
from them.</p>

much alarmed that

went with her little children to a neighbors'.  They  
<br> 
stripped her  
house completely, destroying everything,  
left nothing but a straw bed  
&amp; one sheet.  It  
<br> 
was a hard case, for it was with difficulty that Mr.  
H.  
<br> 
with his large family, could get along before.  Another  
<br> 
lady who  
was alone, was so much frightened by a  
<br> 
drunken soldier who came in,  
that she left the house.<br>
The Yankees destroyed every thing there  
too.We were better off than most in having Cousin  
<br> 
S with us.  We feared  
they would take him, but they  
<br> 
only inquired if he was a soldier, &amp; 
when told that  
<br> 
he was a teacher, did not molest him.  He had a  
<br> 
large  
school (upwards of 40) &amp; had refused many more  
<br> 
applications.  It was nearly  
out at that time, &amp; was  
<br> 
closed abruptly because parents liked to stay at home  
<br> 
&amp; keep their children with them.  He was the  
<br> 
chief man in hiding our  
things.  I know not what

we should have done without him.  Some hid their  
<br> 
things &amp; had them  
discovered but we were more fortunate.  (Some were betrayed by their  
servants) Some  
<br> 
hid nothing, thinking they would not be disturbed but  
<br> 
found themselves woefully mistaken.  Others thought  
<br> 
they might be  
worse dealt <i>[added: with]</i> if they hid anything.A lady near Staunton a little time since  
<br> 
had two Yankee officers  
come to take tea with her.   
<br> 
She was strong "secesh," but she got them  
a good supper.  It was served up in very plain dishes.  They  
perceived  
that she was wealthy, &amp; inquired if she had not  
<br> 
hid her plate &amp;c.  She  
told them she had.  They  
<br> 
asked <u>where</u>.  She told them in the ash heap.  
They  
<br> 
said "That is not a good place.  It is the first place <br>  
searched."  They then very kindly &amp; politely showed  
<br> 
her a good place  
(in their opinion) She followed their  
<br> 
advice &amp; saved her things.  In  
another instance, some  
<br> 
Yankee officers politely showed a lady where to  
hide her

her <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> silver &amp;c.  The soldiers came &amp;  
searched in vain.   
<br> 
Just as they  
were going away, a little black chap  
<br> 
who had followed them around says  
to them in a  
<br> 
tone of triumph, "Ah you did not find Missis things  
<br> 
hid  
inside the ____"  They went &amp; found &amp; took them.Very early on the morning of June 7th, 
<br> 
 knowing that the Yankees  
were coming (the night  
<br> 
had been mostly spent in preparing for them)  
Brother Luther had taken Eva &amp; John,  
the horse &amp; rockaway, &amp;  
<br> 
started out he  
knew not whither exactly, perhaps  
<br> 
to Eastern Virginia.  He wanted to be  
guided by circumstances.   
<br> 
We had been in a great quandry as to what <br>  
course was best for him to pursue.  If he went  
<br> 
abroad, he might fall  
into the hands of the Yankees.   
<br> 
If he stayed at home, they would  
probably take him,  
<br> 
having such a spite against preachers &amp; especially<br>  
as he has written &amp; spoken so freely, that his sentiments are

<p class="p10">July 16,</p>
<p class="p10">It was finally concluded to ship the whole  
<br> 
cargo, &amp; let them go &amp; 
seek their fortune.  Eva had been  
<br> 
right sick, threatened with  
pneumonia, but when the  
<br> 
time came, she was very anxious to go &amp; 
thought  
<br> 
she was able.  So she wrapped up well, took a strong  
<br> 
dose of  
coffee, &amp; set off.  We heard nothing from them  
<br> 
for <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> <i>[added: a]</i> 
 week.  Then word  
came that they had been  
<br> 
seen riding behind a train of wagons which  
they  
<br> 
could not pass, &amp; that those wagons were afterwards  
<br> 
captured. So  
that there was little doubt they were  
<br> 
taken too.  Sister Catharine was in  
such a state from anxiety,  
<br> 
loss of sleep &amp; fatigue, for she &amp; the  
children had had  
<br> 
all Eva's work to do, that this news brought on  
<i>[deleted: spa]</i> 
<br> 
spasms such as she used to have.  A note was now  
<br> 
brought in from a  
friend, saying that Mr. E. was seen  
<br> 
at such a time in Eastern Virginia 
 beyond  
the reach of the  
<br> 
Yankees, &amp; was therefore safe.  There might be some  
<br> 
mistake about this, but we tried to believe it &amp; rest upon it.

<i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> In a few days, we got a letter from  
brother Luther saying  
<br> 
that he hoped  
to get home soon, &amp; so he did.It seems he wandered around for several  
<br> 
days, &amp; then went over to  
Eastern Virginia,  
to Amherst County  
<br> 
where he taught school on first coming to  
Virginia 
 but  
<br> 
here he was not safe.  In a day or two, news came  
<br> 
that the  
Yankees were coming, &amp; were just upon them,  
<br> 
He mounted his horse &amp; 
made for the woods, his  
<br> 
host also, taking their servants with them.  
They  
<br> 
barely escaped, for in five minutes from the first alarm, 
<br> 
 the  
Yankees were in the house.  The fugitives  
<br> 
<i>[deleted:  illeg.]</i> slept in the woods three  
nights, which was  
<br> 
no benefit to Eva in her weak state.  She has not  
been  
<br> 
well since her return, but has lingered along sometimes better &amp;

from this plantation several hundred weight of bacon (nearly all there  
was) a hundred bushels of corn, a quantity of flour, oats &amp;c. &amp;

<p class="p10">July 19</p>
<p class="p10">I have been anticipating. On the 10th of  
<br> 
June we received another  
visit from our invaders, at  
<br> 
least, several thousand of them passed our  
house  
<br> 
on their way from  
Staunton to  
Lexington.  Sister C.  
<br> 
requested  
one of them who was gentlemanly in his  
appearance to guard us, &amp; he  
did so.  They were four  
<br> 
hours in passing.  None of them came in but  
the  
<br> 
guard.  Some went in the spring house however, &amp;  
<br> 
helped themselves  
to milk, &amp; one went off with a large  
<br> 
panfull in each hand.  
Ellen  
called after him to  
<br> 
"Bring back those pans," but he only laughed &amp; 
went on.  
<br> 
 Another who had been taking a cool draught from  
<br> 
a pan, came  
out with his chin covered &amp; some on  
 
the  
<br> 
end of his nose, like a cat  
from the cream pot.  E.  
<br> 
accosted him with "<u>Ar'nt you ashamed</u>?"  
putting on  
<br> 
as much emphasis as she well could, &amp; adding,  
<br> 
"Who do you  
think is going to drink that milk, 
<br> 
 after you have put your nose in  
it!"  The fellow made no reply  
<br> 
but walked off.I did not see much of them, Sister C. prefering  
<br> 
to have me stay  
home in our room.  I was just getting  
<br> 
able to walk about.  They did  
not find the way down  
<br> 
there at all.  The room was built over after we  
came  
<br> 
here, &amp; they might have thought that the door  
leading into it, led  
out of doors.  I did not feel afraid of  
<br> 
them in the least, but did not  
have opportunity to  
<br> 
say much to them.Volumes might be written, &amp; doubtless  
<br> 
will be, according them  
heroic achievements, but  
<br> 
I must cut my story short.  They burnt a bridge 
<br> 
a very large distillary &amp; some other buildings in 
<br> 
S. Governor  
Letcher's house, the military institute in  
<br> 
Lexington, &amp; some of the mills about the country.   
<br> 
My brother had a  
barrel of flour, four bushel of  
<br> 
wheat &amp; eight of corn at a mill a few  
miles distant from us, all which they took, a great loss  
<br> 
in these  
times for a poor preacher.  It was the

whole of wheat he received this year from the people  
<br> 
at Walker's  
Creek, where he supplies one fourth of his <i>[added: time]</i>. 
<br> 
  I forgot to say that  
they took from us, a very large  
<br> 
ham of bacon, two large rolls of  
butter &amp; whatever  
<br> 
else they could lay their hands on, at the first  
visit.</p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 20, 1864

<p class="p10">July 20,</p>
<p class="p10">One thing which happened at a neighbor's  
<br> 
is too good to omit.  A  
fellow went into their spring  
<br> 
house, helped himself to what he liked,  
&amp; finally  
<br> 
lighted upon a jar of <u>tar</u>.   
 
He asked what it was.   
<br> 
A  
daughter of the family, the only person at home,  
<br> 
told him it was  
<u>blackberry jelly</u>.  He took it, &amp;  
<br> 
made off.  She called after  
him to know if he would  
<br> 
have some cream with it.  With that he put his 
<br>  
fingers in it, &amp; began to suck them, then threw 
<br> 
 down the jar &amp; went  
off cursing with all his might.   
<br> 
His captain coming up just then,  
asked the girl  
<br> 
what that fellow was cursing so for.  When told,  
<br> 
he  
said he thought the Yankees were sharper than that.

<p class="p10">July 21,</p>
<p class="p10">It is doubtful whether this irruption  
<br> 
should be called a raid, when  
so many were consumed in it.  The number in S. was estimated at  
<br> 
15,000  
or more.  Some passed here, &amp; some took  
<br> 
other routes.  It is natural  
to inquire what became of this cloud of locusts from the bottomless 
<br> 
  
pit.  They told us, we need not trouble ourselves  
<br> 
about our wheat  
harvest, for they were coming  
<br> 
back to reap it for us, but the good  
Lord disappointed their expectation.  It was reported, 
<br> 
 that many of  
them suffered greatly, &amp; some even  
<br> 
perished with hunger afterwards, in  
passing  
<br> 
through some districts which they had ravaged.   
<br> 
Their violent  
dealing <i>[added: if so]</i> 
 
 came down upon their own  
<br> 
pate.  They brought on quite a  
number of reapers,  
<br> 
which we captured.  As we had the work to do, it 
<br> 
  
was but fair that we should have the wherewith to  
<br> 
do it, especially as  
they broke up so many of our <i>[added: tools]</i>.  
  
But to return to our inquiry.  From  
 
Lexington  
<br> 
they went to take  
Lynchburg.  Our men followed them,  
<br> 
but we had not enough to handle  
them, till we got  
<br> 
reinforcements <i>[deleted: at]</i> near L.  Then they retreated before 
<br>  
us, &amp; went on to  
Parkersburg &amp;  
Wheeling.There is a report very current now, that General  
<br> 
Grant is killed, but  
there are so many rumors, that  
<br> 
I never believe anything till confirmed  
beyond a  
<br> 
doubt.  It is too good news to be true.  Perhaps, however,  
his cause was the best for us that could have  
<br> 
been pursued.  He fought  
our men in their fortifications, sacrificed them &amp; saved ours.  Will  
he not  
<br> 
have a heavy account to render, crimsoned with the  
<br> 
guilt of so  
many murders.</p>
