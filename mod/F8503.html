<h4>Franklin County: S. L. Russell to Edward McPherson,
                    July 31, 1858<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Russell extends an invitation to McPherson to visit and offers up commentary on
                    the upcoming election in which McPherson is running. Russell appears confident
                    that McPherson will win.</p>

<p class="p10">July 31<sup>st</sup> 1858</p>
<p class="p10">M.Connellsburg</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Having left home on tuesday last to attend to some business in Franklin County I did not review your letter until yesterday
                    afternoon-- it having been forwarded to me here by Mrs Russell</p>
<p class="p10">I regret to learn that you have almost given up the idea of visiting Bedford
                    during the present season unless in the event of your winning the nomination for
                    Congress. I think however, that that event is likely to occur and that I will
                    have the pleasure to meet you there. The much felt vacancy in the kitchen
                    department has been filled and <u>we</u> have got to
                    housekeeping and will be much gratified to have you dine or take a cup of tea
                    with us. John Stevens I think or rather hope will go to Bedford next week. Why
                    cannot you come up with him? Since our return home the health of Mrs. Russell and myself has been very good.
                    <i>[unclear: The]</i> trip was of great benefit to both of us. It was a
                    delightful trip.</p>
<p class="p10">I am told here that the Fulton County conference will go
                    for you which with the votes of them from Adams will give you six votes on the
                    first ballot and if those six will stand firm through a few ballots I believe
                    that you will get enough from Bedford or Juniata to nominate you. If the
                    Conferees from Bedford find that they cannot have Jordan nominated -- and I do
                    not think that they will be <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>long in ascertaining that -- they will I
                    feel confident vote for you. The County Convention for
                    Bedford County does not meet until next week but I take
                    it for granted that the conferees will be <i>[illeg.]</i> for Jordan as I do
                    not think that Mr. King or his friends have made any exertion whatever.</p>
<p class="p10">Since my return home I have ever so much engaged in my office and in preparing
                    for housekeeping that I have paid but little attention to politics. The contest
                    this fall is going to be a warm one particularly in those districts where
                    Lecompton Democrats are re-nominated.</p>
<p class="p10">The nomination of John M. Read appears to give satisfaction everywhere and I have but little doubt of his
                    election.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me to your mother, Aunt Maria &amp; Uncle Sam. I had a letter from
                    Uncle a few days ago and will write to him after I get home.</p>
<p class="p10">When I was in New York Mr Mehaffy &amp; Cousin
                    Elizabeth called to see us and we intended to return their visit the next day
                    but there came on a storm of rain which prevented our getting out before we left
                    the city.</p>
<p class="p10">Let me hear from you again soon &amp; if I can aid you in any way command my
                    services.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly<br>Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. L. Russell</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        E. McPherson, Esq.
                    </p>
