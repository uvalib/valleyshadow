<p class="p10">Dear Brother Franklin </p>
<p class="p10">I was very <i>[illeg.]</i> of may 30<sup>th</sup> and to hear that
                    you were all well. As I received your letter with Sister Louisa's. I thought I
                    would also send you a few lines again with her letter, which i hope may find you
                    all in as good health as I enjoy at present. I expect you have grown a good deal
                    since I saw you last, as I see by your letter you bear on the plough now which
                    William used to do for me. Have you got the old horses yet, Thom, Perry and
                    Bill? I have a little gray secesh pony now, I wish I could give you a ride on
                    him, he is quiet as a little dog, I call him Taylor<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Give my love to
                    Willimina and Frad and William and the rest. I can write no more this time and
                    will be happy soon to hear from you again. From </p>
