<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I am most happy to have this opportunity to write you again Christmas is near at
                    hand &amp; today finds me in the cold We are building winter huts but I am
                    afraid that I will not have a cabin to go in to at Christmas. <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    working hard to get it done I had hoped to spend this Christmas with you all but
                    there is no such thing as that now. Adam will not get off either I wish he could
                    get off but he and I will both get furloughs before the winter is over if they
                    continue to give furloughs. I gave Adam the <i>[illeg.]</i> and butter the
                    first day after I got to camp while on picket I had to go on picket the next
                    morning I got here <i>[illeg.]</i> on the river toward Fredericksburg They
                    awaited the enemy in rifle pits but instead of advancing they retired - as usual
                    I saw Add the other day &amp; he is well and hardy. he looks fine much
                    better than he did when I left the night before he had a good reason George I am
                    proud of my shirt that Josie made I appreciate your gift very much and in return
                    I shall give you a barrel fife made by my own hand if all goes right when we get
                    into our cabins I have &amp; get out of the cold George these are fifing
                    times with us all the boys have their fifes but myself I have not seen it
                    smoking All are cheerful &amp; gay with their fifes I am on guard today
                    &amp; what a time I will have musing about the just &amp; penetrating
                    the future You will not understand this phrase unless I explain it When I am on
                    post my mind is - out from every thing else &amp; I can study all &amp;
                    my mind - - - I build great air castles I soar aloft in ecstasy of sublime Tell
                    Jane the butter she gave me done a great deal of good after I got to camp Give
                    Josie and Louise my regards &amp; tell them to write to me George send them
                    to school if you can consistently for an education is - - - to all a Happy
                    Christmas to you all I am well </p>
