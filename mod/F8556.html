<p class="p10">January 6th/60</p>
<p class="p10">Hagerstown</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I received your last- in due time and since have
                    heard from Lizzie as I suppose you have too, that she is better. I thought I
                    might possibly hear tonight but was disappointed. I
                    was very anxious about her for a few days. Dr was so apprehensive and said upon
                    reading Mr. <i>[unclear: Myers]</i> first letter her symptoms all indicated
                    pneumonia which it proved to be, you know it is a very dangerous disease
                    particularly in a delicate person. she will have to be very careful and avoid
                    taking cold, she may not get away from New York for weeks. <u>Mary Emma</u> got this far on her way home <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> on Tuesday and
                        stayed until Wednesday evening, they sent the
                    sleigh for her-- she told me she had seen you twice and had gone to the hall
                    with you. She is in excellent spirits and enjoyed her visit to Lancaster very
                    much. Mrs Berry's children were overjoyed to see them; it was so unexpected that
                    is was almost too much for them. I return the letter from John, and am sorry the
                    paper with the <i>[unclear: price]</i> referred to was torn up before I received yours. I was quite amused at it and am sorry
                    such a thing found its way into the public prints -- Are you not tired of this
                    delay in business it must be truly worrying to be so long unsettled. I think
                        everyone is becoming tired -- of the question
                    is there a Speaker yet--. Did you go to Gettysburg? I
                    am glad to hear you -- have secured those rooms, I called on our two brides
                        today. Mrs <i>[unclear: Gasey]</i> and Mrs
                        <i>[unclear: Darby]</i> Mr G. has gone to housekeeping and is very
                    comfortably fixed, he has his children with him. We are all very well, write
                    soon</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly </p>
