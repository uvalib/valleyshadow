                    Dispatch McClure is evidently making an effort to impose on the President Elect.</p>
                <p>Pennsylvania is desirous of being represented in Mr Lincoln's Cabinet, and there
                    is no other person thought or spoken <orig reg="of">off</orig> for that position
                    than yourself in Pennsylvania the great body of the Republican as well a portion
                    of the Democratic party expect M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Lincoln to have
                    Pennsylvania represented in his<pb n="2"/>by you in whom they have the most
                    implicit confidence upon all the leading Questions which the state of <abbr

                    all national Questions to which the Republican Party are identified M<hi
                        rend="underline">r</hi> McClure is aware of all these facts but from his
                    personal hostility to you and probably to be <hi rend="underline">bought off his
                        favorite</hi> project, my impression is the only hope left to accomplish his
                    purpose, is to create an impression on the mind of Mr. Lincoln that there is a
                    great diversity of opinion as regards the person and also a formidable
                    opposition in our party against you, therefore P<hi rend="underline">a</hi>

                    McClure as I am he would avoid his council as that of the most loathsome

                        M<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Lincoln as represented and which I firmly

                    District I desire to address a letter to Mr Lincoln stating the position you
