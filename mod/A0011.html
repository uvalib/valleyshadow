<p class="p10">Dear Mag</p>
<p class="p10">I have just read your letter and was very glad to hear
                    from you again, yours found me well and quite happy;; I receive your favor of october the 12th And wrote an answer to it a few evenings after;; But on reviewing it I concluded not to send you
                    that answer But write another; deferring it from time to time the present evening has arrived with out it being answered; Not because I did
                    not wish to answer it + from the fact that I did not have time; As another
                    reason was that I did not know what to <i>[unclear: write]</i> to you,, you
                    still wish to come here to live, I have not heard any thing about Miss Lamb
                    going to leave I rather think that a mistake,; As I
                    have not heard any thing about any the <i>[unclear: attendance]</i> leaving, I
                    for my part do not know how long I may stay; or how soon I may leave, I have no
                    notion of leaving here now, if I should take the notion to leave why I will
                        write to you and let you know you wish to know what
                    kind of a Christmas I had; May I first tell you it was as dry a Christmas as
                    ever a seen in my life; I have seen no Christmas yet; nor New Year either This night a week ago I was
                    at a party in town; the party was given by the Firemen of Staunton; They were
                    not many there that I was acquainted with; I enjoyed myself tolerable well
                    considering all things; The amusement of the
                    evening was dancing; of which in course i did not take part in it; there fore did not do anything but
                    look on and say nothing, you write as though Mag Potmer
                    was going it Strong with <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    someone, success to her; I wish that I may soon hear
                    the same good news from you; Bob Strawsburg is gone to the West <u>Why</u> I am not surprised to
                        hear that you wish to come here, But my Dear Friend
                    there is no use to cry over spilt milk the best way is to take it easy Tell Mag
                    that she must ask me to her wedding when ever she gets married you speak of the singing in West View being very interesting, I was glad to here that, We have no
                    sing here now nor have they had any since I have been here</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mag the thoughts crosses my mind of the time we had at Bethelham They are past and gone; But the joyous moments spent there
                    will never loose their influence over me; They are
                    days when my mind wanders back in the past; And gains strength there from; oh shall we who name the name of Christ ever
                    grow weary in well doing I pray you that we may not Dear
                    Mag I must close for the present hoping that I may
                    hear soon from you; So good night Mag pleasant dreams
                    throng thy brain Till I shall hear from you again</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Yours in the bonds of Amity</u>
                    </p>
