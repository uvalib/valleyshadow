<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">It appears that the writing is all put off for me to do not that it is any unwelcome task for
     me to do but I think that they should write some the excuse they have is that we don't write until the day we want to send a letter
     then they put me to work to get it done in time to send you maybe think strange that I do all
     the writing but the above is the reason I have no news to write but <i>[deleted: as]</i> we
     have a good chance of sending Mr McCarny expects to start tomorrow he got home last Friday I
     reckon he was almost tormented with people calling to see him We saw him Sunday but had no talk
     with him as he was in a great hurry to get along further to the next block, you know. This is
     election day it has been beautiful so far even the morning appears to favor the election for
     ratifying what the convention has done I think a great majority of the people will go for
     secession revolution or whatever it is called The greatest number
     of the papers urge the people to ratify the acts of the Convention to present a bold and united
     front to the North against its tyranny Even to the Spectator which
     you know was as strong a union paper as could be found I don't hear of
     many union people about here now Billy Beard J Buchanan &amp; John Withrow are all that I
     hear spoken of. Billy Beard was here one night he was wishing Virginia
     had let the South alone and stayed in the union I'll declare I could
     hardly hold my tongue but as he was talking to ma I had to, pa
     didn't agree with him<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley54b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley54b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     There is some of the awfulest bad reports get out here here about
     one of the latest it was reported that a parcel of Irishmen and negroes from the Penitentiary
     that were working on the railroad had broken out and killed thirteen families but there is
     nothing of it Uncle James Aunt Lizzie Sallie &amp; Lettie have come down today they have
     been telling us that John Berry has got home I do think it is a shame that he has got off on the plea of bad health it make the balance
     of us feel dissatisfied I hope his father will get a good scolding I think it was very
     dishonorable for him to get him off in that way when others in that
     company are as weakly as John and others are going away that are in
     bad health Aunt Lizzie and Sallie send their love to you and would like to see you Ma &amp;
     Tish also send their love to you and also receive a large share from myself</p>
<p class="p10">From your affectionate sister</p>
