<p class="p10">Dear Parents</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter of the 6th about one week ago but had no chance of answering it. there
     has been no mail come nor goes from here the rail road is not fixed this far yet, we are
     stationed where Lee surrendered I don't know how long we will stay our Brigade is scattered all around this country there is one Regiment in Lynchburg The
     rich people of this country went around among the poor and took every thing they had there was
     some ration of flour and such things gave to the poor when our army went back after the
     surrender and there was bands of eight or ten went around and took it all and the old horses
     that were left they took from the poor. you don't know any thing about poor people up there poor people here are worse off than the slaves I received a letter
     from Mariah before I left Petersburg they were all well</p>
<p class="p10">Cyrus Baughman is the only one that is along from Fayetteville the rest are all at dismounted
     camp Forage is very scarce we only get about five quarts of oats a day and no hay and for
     grazing there is no grass. I don't see how the people keeps their stock the corn looks pretty
     well and that is the only thing that does look any thing like. there will be any amount of
     Peaches in this country. this is a dull place we cannot get any papers nor any thing else when
     you write I want you to send me some stanps for I can't get any here. from the time we broke up
     winter quarters till we got here was forty seven days and out of that time we marched thirty
     three days, so you may know we were traveling a good bit. I must close for this time write soon</p>
<p class="p10">your son</p>
