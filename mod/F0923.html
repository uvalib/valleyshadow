<p class="p10">Aug 9th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Mercer Pa</p>
<p class="p10">Hon T Stevens<br> Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse me for troubling you and my application must be my apology.</p>
<p class="p10">My son Capt Ralph Maxwell was elected Capt of Company F 57th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers on 16th Septr
                    1861 - and march with his company &amp; Regt thro' the Peninsular campaign
                    under M'Lellan was in all <i>[unclear: those]</i> battles also Bull Run under
                    Pope &amp; Fredericksburg under Burnside - after Burnside's second advance
                    his limbs became ulcered &amp; was unfit for duty for a long time <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and last spring was honorably discharged for disability - He has now got well
                    &amp; we have applied for a commifsion in the Regular army for him - There
                    is on file in the War department a recommendation signed by all the members of
                    the Senate of Pennsylvania &amp; letters has been sent to the President by
                    Col Campbell who commended the Regiment highly endorsing him and asking for a
                    commifsion for him also by Govr Curtin- <i>[unclear: Hon I lh Morehead, T Melleary A
                        Myers Genl Howe - Hon John Covach, I W Wallace &amp; W
                    Stewart.]</i></p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Will you do me the favor to use you influence with President &amp;
                    Secretary of War to urge the appointment of him to at least a
                        <i>[unclear: Lieutenary]</i> in the Regular army. He is
                    <i>[unclear: brave]</i> - a good soldier &amp; well <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    officer.</p>
<p class="p10">I should say to you, that on the first alarm of secession I took my stand in favor of the Union &amp; the
                    Government &amp; know no party but the one in opposition to Rebellion and
                    all the fault I have with the government is that they are not <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    enough with the Rebels in the South &amp; Coperheads in the North. If you
                    have time please <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> let me hear from you.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours with<br> respect</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. Maxwell</i></p>
