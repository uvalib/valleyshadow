                <p>This morning I take the opportunity to inform you that I am well. Hoping these
                    few lines may find you all enjoying good health and happiness.</p>
                <p>I have come to the conclusion that if I have not much to write-I will write <orig
                        reg="short">shorte</orig> letters and more of them. Things appear pretty
                    quiet. Yet not knowing how long they will remain so.</p>
                <p>The weather was so very pleasant in January and February and part of March that I
                    think it will make up now with rain and mud. These few days back it has been
                    raining. This morning is <orig reg="middling">midling</orig> clear.</p>
                <p>We have not much duty to do a out camp more than we are drilled pretty freely.</p>
                <p>About our getting home in 9 months it is still kept in darkness. Some say that we
                    will not be <abbr expan="paid">paide</abbr> off till we are taken out of The
                        <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr>. It appears very much like it. Some say
                    that we are only transferred. Some has one story and some another. So I can't go
                    by what I hear.</p>
                <p>Now, the substitutes are only good for 1 year. The 300 dollars are only good for
                    1 year. That is why I think that they <orig reg="cannot">can not</orig> make us
                    stay longer <orig reg="than">then</orig> 1 year.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may. Time will reveal all things. I will be contented trusting in a
                    higher power. My desire is to do my duty and live in such a way as to make
                    Heaven my home when I come to cross the cold Jordan of Death.</p>
                <p>My prayer and sincere desire is that-if we never meet on Earth, that God will
                    help us to meet in Heaven where there will be no War or no parting then.</p>
                <p>Take care of your health and if it is God's will-we will soon be permitted to
                    meet each other.</p>
                <p>Write soon.</p>
                <p>May God provide for us all. No more at present.</p>
                <p>When you write-Direct in this way. 1st Division- 2 nd Corps, Washington, D. C.</p>
                <p>So farewell for this time.</p>

                <closer>
