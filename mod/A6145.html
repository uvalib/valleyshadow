     you that I am in good health and Praying that this may find you and all the family enjoying the same blessing. my health has
      been good since a prisoner but am deprived of many comforts that we
      once
     enjoyed but i trust this cruel war will
     soon come to a close so we could enjoy
     ourselves as the past. The health of the camp is good at present. the Officers in charge here
     spares no pains in promoting [promoting]
     the health and comfort of the prisoners. Our rations are of a good quality. Some complain that
     they they don't get enough but i think it is enough. Anderson Stombaugh, Knott, Jacob Michael Wright, E Samuels and A Hansberger are
     all well. Send brother David Rolston post office address if you can. I
      wrote in my letter for some greenback
     money. if you had it send it if you can as i need some little
     here.</p>
