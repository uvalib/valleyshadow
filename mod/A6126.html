<p class="p10">December 1<sup>st</sup>. 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near New Market</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to inform you that I am well at this time hoping this may find you
     enjoying the same blessing I received yours mailed the twenty fifth
     was glad to hear you were well. there is no
     stir in camp at this time the weatheris fine now there may be a move soon but which way
     we do not know Giney I wrote to Pa since writing to you do not know
     whether he received it or not have been expecting to hear from him by this time but
     have beendissapointed tell him I would like to hear from him in regard to the matter of which he wrote to me I thought I would have gotten a pass to
     come home but the officers here refuse to give detailed farmers a pass
      what they mean by that I know not unless they do
      not trust them perhaps it will come right some day if not in this world
     it will in the next I am trying to do the best I can but I intend to get out if I can tell Pa
     to let me know what can be done I would pitch in
      right now but am expecting to hear from him
     before I know how the matter stands,<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Clemer put in a pass to
     go home to thrash and butcher but it came back dissaproved. he
     has written to Sturd in Staunton concerning matters that I will not state here as there is
     nothing of importance going on hereat present I will close soon hoping
      thesefew lines may find you
     <i>[unclear: all]</i> well write to me soon I always like to here from you</p>
<p class="p10">For nothing but remain yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>D.J.P.</i></p>
<p class="p10">Dec 2<sup>th</sup><br> Since writing the above I have thought Pa may not have bin able to go to town to tend to
      that matter tell him that three of us have written to Sturd to do
      what he can in regard to it. J. Clemmer, G. Cochran and myself if
      Pa is not able to see about it he can get some one to do it for him, three of us in
      company<br> J.P.D </p>
