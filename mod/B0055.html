                    to cook, She was not Stout and dont suit as a cook, and we find her so
                    quarrelsome and disagreeable with the other negroes that they wont agree to stay
                    with her, They have gotten it in their heads that she is a conjurer and are all
                        afraid of her, we cant get along without other
                    hands on the farm, all say they will leave if she dont, we didn't rent the house to her only hired her by the month her time is
                    out and we have paid her two weeks ago, now she says she wont leave before
                    Christmas, that we have no right to put her out We dont want any fuss or trouble
                    with her So I write to you to know what to do about it, she is a very
                    disagreeable creature, hard to get along with We want the room she is in very
                    badly, you will please answer this immediately and let me know what course to
                        pursue.</p>
