<h4>Augusta County: A. Waddill to J. H. McCue, January
                    29, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waddill discusses the profitability of publishing a newspaper and feels that
                    McCue lives in a "wealth section of country, and that a paper could succeed well
                    there." Waddill added that he thinks "a neutral paper would succeed better than
                    a political one, but I am <u>Whig to the core</u>."</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 29th 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Lynchburg,</p>
<p class="p10">J. H. McCue, Esq.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir; I recd. yours this morning, and I am sorry to trouble you so much in my
                    behalf, but I must, you know, get all the information I can, where nearly <u>my all</u> would be at stake; Therefore I am in hopes you
                    will excuse me for intruding on your time. My object in requesting the
                    subscription of a dozen citizens for the <u>first</u> year
                    was merely to put the paper in a firm footing; I did not wish it in advance, for
                    there are but few villages where there are not a dozen men to be found, who
                    would not be willing to advertise to the amount of $30 each during the year. But
                    if 500 subscribers, (good) can be obtained, to <i>[unclear: convince]</i> with,
                    the thing would be settled. I never was there, but it strikes me that that is a
                    wealthy section of country, and that a paper could succeed well there. If we
                    succeed in getting the subscribers, I am in hopes we will be able to remunerate
                    you in some way for your kindness in taking such an interest in the enterprize.
                    If you say so, I will send my son-in-law there next Court-day, and get you and
                    your friends to make a strong pull and we will have an office there, and I
                    believe your<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>citizens will support it liberally. Of course your
                    Clerks, Lawyers, Merchants &amp;C., would do all they could to keep it up.
                    500 subscribers to begin with would establish the paper on a firm footing. I
                    have all the material, <u>and all of it paid for</u>. I think
                    a neutral paper would succeed better than a political one, but I am <u>Whig to the core</u>. I presume you will be there at your
                    court day. How near Lovingston does the Railroad run? I mean when it is done,
                    and how far is Lovingston from Charlottesville? When is your court day? </p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully your friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>A. Waddill</u>
                    </i></p>
