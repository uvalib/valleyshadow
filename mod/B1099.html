<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Garrick Mallery to
                    Orlando Brown, March 7, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Mallery reviews and considers the available evidence pertaining to the various
                    accusations against Frederick Tukey. He concludes that there is no firm evidence
                    to point to fraud or dishonesty on Tukey's part, but recommends that due to his
                    lack of organization, and the fact that his reputation has been damaged beyond
                    repair, that to allow Tukey to continue on as Bureau agent would further damage
                    the Bureau's standing in the community. Mallery also concludes that the counter
                    accusations raised by Tukey against George Cook and several female school
                    teachers merit further investigation.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">March 7<sup>th</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond, <u>Virginia</u></p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">I have visited Staunton and have carefully examined all the papers referred to me
                    by endorsement of 20<sup>th</sup> ult. from Headquarters
                    Department of the Potomac, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. I
                    also held long and patient conversation with Mr F.S. Tukey, Assistant Superintendent for the counties of
                    Augusta and Highland, and took the statements of all persons he desired me to
                    see.</p>
<p class="p10">I likewise examined other persons whose opinions and knowledge on the subject of
                    Bureau affairs in the Sub-District I consider of value. In order not to increase
                    beyond reasonable bounds the already voluminous mass of papers in this case, I
                    state in the following report what was the result of my investigation instead of
                    giving detailed statements of the various parties examined.</p>
<p class="p10">I <i>[unclear: premise]</i> by stating that Mr. Tukey has enjoyed a very ample
                    opporunity for defense. Not only did Captain and
                        Superintendent McDonnell take the evidence of
                    such parties as Mr Tukey presented, but after the departure of the former, the
                    latter sent on a considerable number of exparte statements which the former
                    forwarded with his report. Mr Tukey also prepared an elaborate statement in his
                    defense and after this had been forwarded to Captain
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>McDonnell he requested its return for correction and made several
                    pages of additions. After this and the considerable number of hours he spent
                    with me, I do not think Mr Tukey can have any further explanation to make.</p>
<p class="p10">On the other hand, Lieutenant George T. Cook whose
                    conduct is also the subject of inquiry was not present at the investigations of
                    either Captain McDonnell or myself, and as far as I am
                    aware, is not yet informed of any investigation being ordered.</p>
<p class="p10">The specific charges brought against Mr Tukey as shown in the papers referred to
                    me are as follows:<br> 1. That he sympathized with disloyal persons.<br> 2.
                    That he used Government rations in his family.<br> 3.
                    That he sold clothing sent for gratuitous distribution and kept the
                    proceeds.<br> 4. That he defrauded Oscar Morris, freedman, a former employee in
                    his office, out of part of his pay.<br> 5. That he overcharged and endeavored
                    to make a profit out of the African Church at Staunton in the matter of repairs
                    to the same.</p>
<p class="p10">1. I find no sufficient evidence that Mr Tukey has sympathy or prejudice in favor
                    of disloyal persons. The statements made to that effect are at least balanced by
                    counterstatements of loyal and reliable residents.</p>
<p class="p10">2. The using of government rations is to some extent disproved by the evidence of
                    Mr Tukey's cook, which is however liable to the objection that she only knows
                    the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>time when Mr Tukey brought the stores to his house and remembers
                        <u>his</u> statement that he purchased them from the
                    commissary. But as Oscar Morris who originates this story could not positively
                    know that the identical pork and mackerel were what Mr Tukey received from the
                    Bureau, Mr Tukey's explanations may be allowed due weight in this matter.</p>
<p class="p10">3. Mr Tukey acknowledges the sale of clothing sent to him for gratuitous
                    distribution and that he did not turn over the proceeds but gives a detailed
                    explanation to the effect that he procured through Mr Scott, a former teacher,
                    the proper authority from the society contributing the clothing and that the
                    money was lst under circumstances which awaken sympathy for him. As there is
                    some recollection at Head Quarters of this matter, I am not inclined to regard
                    it with severity, except that Mr Tukey's conduct in keeping no account of the
                    sales of <i>[unclear: trust]</i> property -- and not even a copy of the
                    authority given by the society for a proceeding so open to remark deserves
                    attention in connection with his extraordinary want of method and prudence shown
                    in other transactions.</p>
<p class="p10">4. Oscar Morris, freedman was employed as messenger in the Assistant Superintendent's office at Staunton
                    from 15th January 66 to the following July. He charges Mr Tukey with retaining a
                    portion of his pay, which at first was $20.00 per month and afterwards was
                    reduced. Mr Tukey makes an elaborate explanation of this matter the whole of
                    which is based on the theory that "for the first two months Oscar received
                    $20.00 per month and for the balance of the time $10.00 per month," and <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>he refers to an order from Brevet Major How, then Superintendent of the District and to Oscar's receipt book to sustain him.
                    But the order (Among the papers referred to me and dated March 26th 1866) does
                        <u>not</u> state that the pay of Oscar should be reduced
                    to $10 -- only that the pay <u>should be reduced</u>. And on
                    the contrary the books of the Superintendent at
                    Winchester show (see exhibit "A" hereto attached) that the pay was reduced to
                        <u>$15</u> and not to $10 -- to commence on April 1st
                    1866. The forms No. 2 for this period on file at the Headquarters of the Assistant Commissioner agree with exhibit A and Oscar's memorandum book also herewith
                    forwarded, likewise exactly agrees with the accounts of the Winchester office.
                    It is therefore perfectly clear that Mr Tukey's explanation is not founded in
                    truth, as for the two months of April and May and subsequently, Oscar was
                    entitled to $15 per month instead of $10. -- Mr Tukey says that as Oscar was
                    discharged on the 10th of July, on the assumption of the diminished rate of $10
                    per month commencing the 1st of April, he was entitled for the whole time to
                        $83.85, his memorandum book showing the
                    receipt of $80 and Mr Tukey thinks Oscar has neglected to put down the odd
                    $3.85. But for the same time at the rate of $15 per month from the 1st April,
                    Oscar was entitled not to $83.85 but to $100.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Tukey was relieved from the duties of Assistant Superintendent on 19th May 1866 and some of the latter payments were
                    not made by him but by Lieutenant Cook. Mr Tukey
                    entered the office as clerk on the 1st July 1866.</p>
<p class="p10">The exact charge which Oscar makes, that <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>Mr Tukey cheated him out of
                    ten Dollars per month by falsely alleging that his pay was reduced while it was
                    still $20, and keeping the balance, is not correct, as the pay was in fact
                    reduced to $15 and according to his memorandum book he actually got all of his
                    pay until the expiration of Mr Tukey's office as Assistant Superintendent in May. The later
                    accounts do not seem to be important.</p>
<p class="p10">But the striking point to me is that Mr Tukey cannot at this moment tell what
                        <i>[deleted: he]</i>
                    <i>[added: was]</i> paid or what was due to his regular
                    employee, Oscar Morris, <i>[added: he]</i> being the only
                    messenger regularly employed during the months named, and the only employee
                    except a clerk, with whose accounts there could be no confusion. He makes a
                    gross mistake and a false calculation when he seeks to defend himself even from
                    an unfounded charge. From the time of the last payment when Mr Tukey was clerk,
                    to the commencement of this investigation was not quite seven months, and
                    neither from records, accounts or memory can Mr Tukey make any clear statement,
                    but with great elaboration, and his recollection being warped by a mistaken
                    theory of what, if true, <u>might</u> be some explanation, he
                    evolves a most absurd and silly account. It was by my own search of the books at
                    Winchester that I find Oscar to have received his pay due during the time of Mr
                    Tukey's administration, without which and only examining the latter's false and
                    mistaken defense I should have believed him guilty.</p>
<p class="p10">5. The most important charge and the one an understanding of which is most
                    difficult to arrive at, is in reference to the repairs on the African Church.</p>
<p class="p10">There appear to have been two sets of rebel buildings which in the early part of
                    1866 were disposed of by Mr Tukey, one on Beverly street in the Suburbs of
                    Staunton and one at Swoope's Station. These buildings do not appear to have been
                    on any official papers and the transactions connected with them were not kept
                    intelligibly seperate. Mr Tukey claims that by oral orders from Major How, he
                    was authorized to tear them down and dispose of the lumber without rendering
                    account. He has also a written order from Major How bearing relations to one of
                    these barracks which is hereto attached marked "Exhibit B". This gives authority
                    for the freedmen to take the lumber, 2200 feet being left for a Mr Wholey the owner of the land, and concludes by the very
                    strange direction that Mr Tukey shall make no unnecessary explanations to Mr
                        Wholey nor anybody else.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Tukey states that the trustees of the church had partially contracted with a
                    party to do the repairs at the price of one hundred and twenty dollars but that
                    he told them it was too much and that he could have the work done so as not to
                    cost over seventy five dollars and thereupon they entrusted him with the job -
                    which he undertook. There was nothing wrong in this although it was outside of
                    his, Mr Tukey's, duties, provided he did not in fact enter upon it as a
                    speculation, and which is perhaps equally important, provided he so conducted it
                    as to render it <br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br>clear that he made no profit out of the freedmen in
                    the transaction so as to bring himself and the Bureau into discredit. Mr Tukey
                    states that a part of this lumber was given to satisfy the claim of Mr Thomas
                    Wholey - but how much he does not in his written defense say. In addition to
                    "Exhibit B" above referred to I find however in the endorsement Book at
                    Winchester (see extract "Exhibit C") that with the approval of the Assistant Commissioner the amount to be retained by Mr
                    Wholey was fixed at 2200 feet, and that the balance was ordered to "be given to
                    the freedmen to be used in the construction of a church."</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Tukey also claims that in compliance with oral orders from Major How nine
                    hundred feet were given to a Mr Shaver to satisfy a claim recognized by Brevet Colonel C. C. Clay, former post Commander.
                    He also relies upon oral orders from Major How allowing him to pay for the
                    taking down of the lumber by selling a portion. The portion he acknowledges to
                    have sold amounts to $16.55. There was also an amount used in alterations in Mr
                    Tukey's rented dwelling house which amount is not given.</p>
<p class="p10">It is to be observed that there is no attempt to state what was the balance of
                    lumber remaining after these deductions, or what was the cost of taking down the
                    same beyond the above $16.55 if anything. With this indefinite balance, Mr Tukey
                    volunteered the work of repairs on the church. He makes a statement about the
                    purchase of a wagon, harness &amp;c and repairs to the same which he places
                    at $64 but as the wagon and harness became <br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br>his property, their costs
                    would not properly be chargeable in this transaction except perhaps the sum of
                    nine dollars alleged to have been expended in repairs made necessary by hauling.
                    He says that he paid out of his pocket $88 though he only rendered the amount to
                    the Trustees as $80 independent of mason work costing eleven dollars, of which
                    he made a present. It is not clearly stated that the above sum of $64 spoken of
                    in connection with the private wagon &amp;c is or is not a part of the sum
                    of $80 charged the Trustees, but leaving that out of the question Mr Tukey does
                    not now give any details about the $80 - though he says he had Bills made out by
                    the parties who did the work and handed them receipted to the Trustees.</p>
<p class="p10">The latter refused to pay the amount of $80 and finally
                    compromised with Mr Tukey for $40 by which the latter says he is a considerable
                    loser.</p>
<p class="p10">It will thus appear that Mr Tukey while Assistant Superintendent entered as an individual into an unwritten contract with
                    the Trustees to repair their church and used government lumber which was turned
                    over to the church for that purpose. The very irregular and reprehensible order
                    of Major How that he should render no unnecessary explanation respecting the
                    lumber as Assistant Superintendent cannot of
                    course apply to his business arrangement with the Trustees of the church. There
                    is hardly any transaction known to me which would have been more likely to
                    produce complaints and accusation, and in which a full and clear settlement at
                    the time <i>[added: would]</i> have been <br><br>[<i>page 9</i>]<br>obviously necessary. Yet there is no account to show now on Mr Tukey's behalf.
                    No settlement was made at the time and the Trustees disputed the bill rendered,
                    now a large body of the Freedmen, the objects of his official care, charge that
                    he cheated or attempted to cheat them under the guise of benevolence, and appear
                    religiously to believe the same.</p>
<p class="p10">It may be perfectly true that the above charges were instigated or excited by
                        Lieutenant G. T. Cook, and his friends owing to
                    that officer being lately relieved, but the fact remains that they <u>are</u> made and are believed by probably a majority of
                    the freedmen, and that Mr Tukey's conduct has been so destitute of either method
                    or prudence that his best friend is without the means of persuading those who
                    have formed this opinion that it is erroneous. Mr Tukey desires to be retained
                    in office that he may regain the good opinion of the freedmen, but under the
                    circumstances the experiment is in my opinion hopeless and would injure the
                    Bureau without benefitting him.</p>
<p class="p10">Captain McDonnell's report about the condition of the
                    office records is correct - and shows the same want of administrative ability as
                    applies to the above specific transactions.</p>
<p class="p10">After a most careful and laborious examination I am not of the opinion that Mr
                    Tukey, Assistant Superintendent for Augusta
                    &amp; Highland Counties has been guilty of fraud or dishonesty, but I am
                    satisfied that his want of order and prudence has placed him in such an
                    unfortunate position that <br><br>[<i>page 10</i>]<br>his retention at Staunton would be
                    seriously detrimental to the interests of the Bureau. I also believe that though
                    not devoid of intelligence or even of education to a considerable extent, his
                    want of system and of appropriate training render him unfit for duty in that
                    branch of the public service which more than any other is exposed to accusation
                    and reproach.</p>
<p class="p10">With reference to that part of the papers which applies to Lieutenant George T. Cook, I also submit the following
                    report.</p>
<p class="p10">That officer relieved Mr Tukey 19th May 1866, and was in turn relieved by him
                    under order dated 26th December 1866. The office
                    papers and records were in the same situation as while Mr Tukey was on duty -
                    that is - very bad.</p>
<p class="p10">His general reputation in the town of Staunton and elsewhere in the Sub District
                    was good and even some of Mr Tukey's friends state that they have no complaint
                    to make of Lieutenant Cook.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Tukey now however makes accusations concerning his personal character relative
                    to dissipation, undue familiarity with the lady teachers and neglect of duty.
                    Some allowance should be made for recrimination and the excitement produced by
                    the violent and unfortunate quarrel <u>now existing</u>, and
                    the accusations above referred to are somewhat intangible and not well supported
                    by evidence.</p>
<p class="p10">On one subject however, Mr Tukey's statement is so clear and definite that I deem
                    it my duty to repeat it in his words, taken down by me as follows:</p>
<p class="p10">"During the months of August or September last, when I was clerk in the office, I
                    was aware of Lieutenant Cook leaving his District on
                    four different occasions without permission. Twice he went to the Natural Bridge
                    and twice to Washington. I know that he had no leave of absence because he told
                    me so and requested me to shield him in the even of an inspector coming. He
                    requested that if an Inspector came I should say he had gone into the Country,
                    leaving it to be inferred that he was in the rural parts of his Sub District. I
                    agreed to do so."</p>
<p class="p10">On examination at Head Quarters, I can find no leaves of absence granted to Lieutenant Cook which would apply to the time above
                    specified and consider that the charge requires attention.</p>
<p class="p10">In the papers referred to me and still more in his conversation with me, Mr Tukey
                    has assailed the character of all the school teachers stationed at Staunton with
                    the exception of Mrs Anna A. Dunn who is his sister. No charges involving moral
                    character is made against Mr. N.C. Brackett, Superintendent of schools, but he is accused of weakness and incompetency. Mr
                    John Piper the male teacher is charged with having been intoxicated, and the
                    ladies, Misses Ellen <br><br>[<i>page 12</i>]<br>Leavitt, Sarah Gillespie and Eliza Gilmore with
                    conduct, which, though no very serious breach of morals is alleged, is
                    considered by Mr Tukey as unbecoming in Christian missionaries. He also
                    distinctly charges neglect of the school interests entrusted to their care.</p>
<p class="p10">The same allowance as above suggested should be made for Mr Tukey's acting in
                    self-defense and recrimination in this matter. The absence of Mr Brackett and
                    the illness of the lady teacher most seriously concerned, prevented me from
                    forming any definite opinion respecting the general subject, except that the
                    schools did not appear to be thriving. I may add that it would have been beyond
                    the powers of my office as I understand them, to subject these teachers to a
                    trial of their private characters, that duty being more in the province of the
                    charity which sends and sustains them, and which in my opinion should be
                    notified of Mr Tukey's accusation.</p>
<p class="p10">The recommendation I make on this subject in the interest of the Bureau, is that
                    there should be such a change in the teachers as will stop the whole of this
                    discreditable quarrel. Mr Tukey is not without friends at Staunton, and has a
                    party which will undoubtedly injure the schools if the present teachers are
                    continued. Besides this, the charges above referred to, and which Mr Tukey has
                    made to some extent public in Staunton, must impair the efficiency of the
                    teachers and render their always delicate position still more unpleasant.</p>
