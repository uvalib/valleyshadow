                <p>I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> your letter a few days past. Was truly
                    glad to hear from you. This is a cold wet dreary morning. We <orig reg="moved"
                        >mooved</orig> our camp yesterday <orig reg="evening">eavning</orig> about
                    three hundred yards we just got our bunks up in time for the chance of weather.
                    The President was going to review <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> will be put off on account of
                    the inclemency of the weather. I had intended writing soon but squire Newton
                    came down a few days ago &amp; I concluded to send a letter or two by him.
                    He starts for home tomorrow. We have been <orig reg="moving">mooving</orig>
                    about <pb n="2"/>almost continually since I last wrote to you. We <orig
                        reg="moved">mooved</orig> to within six or seven miles of Orange C.H.
                    &amp; erected our selves rough cabins thinking we would stay in them for the
                    winter but only had the pleasure of staying in them two or three nights then
                        <orig reg="moved">mooved</orig> to the front &amp; commenced throwing up
                    breastworks which we have nearly completed now. It is reported <orig reg="here"
                        >hear</orig> that Gen. Ewell our corps commander is dead. If it be so I am
                    sorry for he was a good Gen also a pious man. I was very sorry to hear of the
                    death of Uncle James. Oh I cannot but reflect about him, for <orig reg="too"
                    >two</orig> well I know if he died as he lived he could have no hope in
                    eternity. I hope he changed his ways &amp; found peace in our Saviours love;
                    before the <orig reg="brittle">brickle</orig> thread of live was broken. You may
                    well imagine <pb n="3"/>how sadly we miss our beloved capt. When I look and see,
                    we have none capable of filling his <orig reg="place">blace</orig> in the camp.
                    I can hardly help from complaining. And say Lord why hast thou taken our leader
                    from us; "but the Lords will be done" we will let our dear brothers ashes reast
                    in peace; hoping he is now joining the choir of saints and angels around the
                    throne in heaven. You tried in your last to shame me for a thing I was not <orig
                        reg="guilty">gilty</orig> of. I can prove I gave my letter to you, to your
                    Pa, in the <orig reg="presence">presance</orig> of a crowd around a fire whether
                    he <orig reg="recollects">recolects</orig> it or not I do for several remarked
                    it would go home free of charge. I have <orig reg="heard">hurd</orig> that you
                    have a large meeting going on in Greenville &amp; that your sister Mollie
                    Rachel Crobarger &amp; John Rubushs wife have professed religion. I hope
                    they only <orig reg="prove">proove</orig> true &amp; virtuous Christians <pb
                        n="4"/>This is the last page well Kate I have no news to write George Brite
                    is in the bunk with me writing to his sister and I am trying to write to my more
                    than sister. George &amp; I had a big <orig reg="laugh">laughf</orig> just
                    now about your Cous, K <orig reg="wedding">widding</orig> cake Lina wrote to him
                    that she was saving it &amp; it was all molding. A young gent wrote that she
                    was making pickles suffer I hope she is well supplied if they will help to kill
                    trouble I have learned all about the troubles in the precinct of Greenville Is
                    she not to be pitied; &amp; the one that has left to be <orig reg="shunned"
                        >shuned</orig> You spoke of my coldness. dear Kate it is not my desire to be
                    cold, it must be my nature I hope the day may soon come when I may prove a warm
                    hearted companion live in hopes <orig reg="there">thare</orig> is still a sunny
                    day for us. I hope you must write soon.</p>
