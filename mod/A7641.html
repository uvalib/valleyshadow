                    evident at a recent meeting.</p>

                    whilst little F sleeps sweetly by my side &amp; all is quiet through the
                    house. I think fondly of the &amp; our little ones with you hope you are all
                    well. I heard with joy the other day that you were all well &amp; that you
                    had a young lady with you who I think you can well rely upon &amp; who will
                    doubtless remain with you. her friend<sup>s</sup> are glad to hear of
                    her good home</p>

                    drafts for you to collect &amp; I was not here when the letter was started
                    &amp; I omitted to endorse my name on the back of each one which is

                    &amp; so well that it is not necessary for me to direct at least whilst
                    absent do the best you can &amp; as you may desire, I hope it will not be
                    long until we will be together. I am sorely
                    tired of this life &amp; hope soon for a change
