    <p>I seat <orig reg="myself">my self</orig> to drop you a few lines. this will inform you that i
     am well and <orig reg="hope">hoap</orig> that when this comes to hand it may find you <orig
      reg="enjoying">injoying</orig> the Same <orig reg="blessing">blesing</orig> i received. i
     received the letter yours of the 23rd yesterday and was happy to <orig reg="hear">heare</orig>
     from you all and that you was all in good health but am sorry that you are so through other. i
      <orig reg="hope">hoap</orig> that this may find you all right. I <orig reg="know">no</orig>
     when one gets to <orig reg="studying">studing</orig> they <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> feel so
     well for i have had the trial of it more than once. this appears to me to be a hard way of
      <orig reg="living">liveing</orig> the way things <orig reg="goes">goas</orig>
     <orig reg="nowadays">now days</orig> but then i think <orig reg="there">their</orig> is a
     better day a coming and that <orig reg="cheers">chears</orig> me up [a]gain and i look forward
     to the future and <orig reg="hope">hoap</orig> this cruel war will soon come to an end and so
     we can return to our <orig reg="homes">hoames</orig> and have the pleasure of sitting around
     our own fireside with our wives and children. i think often of the times that is past <abbr
      expan="and">an</abbr>
     <orig reg="gone">goan</orig> and think of the times that is now. what a change of <orig
      reg="affairs">afairs</orig> in a few years. it is enough to make one <orig reg="shudder"
      >shuder</orig> to think of it. [part of the letter is missing or illegible at this point]
     Doctor Robson was down <orig reg="here">heare</orig> a few days <orig reg="ago">a go</orig> and
     he told me that some of the <orig reg="neighbors">neighbours</orig> was or had reported John
     had for to be <orig reg="old">oald</orig> enough for service but David Kyle said he would do
     all he could to keep him with you and the Doctor said he would do all he could in our <orig
      reg="behalf">behaf</orig>. i did or <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> think John Rolston is <orig
      reg="eighteen">18 teen</orig> yet but i <orig reg="sort of">sorta</orig> forgot his age but if
     he is <orig reg="eighteen">18 teen</orig> they <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> keep him out of
     service i am <orig reg="afraid">a fraid</orig>. You stated in your last letter that some of the
      <orig reg="neighbors">neighbours</orig> thought that <orig reg="there">their</orig> was a
     chance for me to be exempted as a farmer. the sooner you attend to it the better it will be. i
      <orig reg="haven't">havent</orig> much chance to do anything of that kind <orig reg="here"
      >heare</orig> and you could do more with it than i could <orig reg="here">heare</orig>. <orig
      reg="there">their</orig> is nothing like trying. you wish to <orig reg="know">no</orig> what i
     think about our chance about the times of war. it is a hard question but i <orig reg="don't"
      >dont</orig> think that our chance looks as gloomy as it did some months <orig reg="ago">a
     go</orig>. the <orig reg="soldiers">soaldiers</orig> is is pretty good <orig reg="spirits"
      >sperits</orig> now to what they was some time <orig reg="ago">a go</orig>. those <orig
      reg="people">peopel</orig> that <orig reg="goes">goas</orig> to the yanks i judge they are of
     northern sentiments or ought to be. if they think they are <orig reg="right">rite</orig> i
      <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> stop them if i had the chance. for my part i <orig reg="don't"
      >dont</orig>
