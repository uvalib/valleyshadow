<p class="p10">June the 4 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta CountyVirginia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Nephew</p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind letter by Mr Arehart and was pleased to hear that you were in good
     health and spirits We as a family are enjoying the same blessing. I had the pleasure of reading
     your letter to your father by Mr Craig I am sorry to hear that the Measles have broken out in
     camp, It is a bad disease for anyone to have But particularly for
     soldiers as they cannot take proper care of themselves Your mother feels quite anxious on your
     account as you have not had them. I trust that God will slay the disease that it spread no
     further Many are the prayers that have been sent up for the health and safety of the soldiers</p>
<p class="p10">There was a prayer meeting held at New Providence for the soldiers, particularly for those
     that have gone from the congregation. You are deprived of the privileges of the sanctuary But
     you are not forgotten by those who still enjoy them you are not in the pulpit your pastor does
     not forget those who have gone from the congregation to fight their Countrys battles He prays
     earnestly for soul and body that both may be preserved from all evil and that peace may be
     restored to our distracted Country</p>
<p class="p10">Our northern papers are all stopped We get no news from the north Perhaps it is just as well
     We are going to take the Central Presbyterian But we would like to take another paper one that
     would give the news from the army</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you will be surprised when I tell you<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley57b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley57b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      We heard the Cannonading last saturday I thought it was a battle
     somewhere But had no thought of its being so far away as I have since learned it was We were
      making tents for you last week I am sorry you are so long getting
     them as you will be on the background in that branch of
     training. The ladies about Brownsburg have been sewing for more than a week fitting out Mr
     Currys Company I think they ought to be well filled out as they have had 4 and sometimes 5
     sewing machines employed besides a number sewing by hand They were not near through at the
     close of the week They are probably preparing for a long Campaign</p>
<p class="p10">Hugh Beard got home from the Missouri last saturday I suppose he must have changed in his
     appearance as his mother did not know him John Berry is still complaining of sore throat I
     think he looks about as well as he did when he left home I suppose the march to Shepherds Town
     was the cause of his sickness</p>
<p class="p10">I will here give you a remedy for Diarrhea Taken from suggestions for soldiers, written by a
     man who has been in actual service in other countries. It may be of use to you or some of your
     comrades</p>
<p class="p10">He says take a tablespoonful of wheat flour and mix with two or more of water and drink In
     most cases one dose stops it instantly I will not close my letter till Mr Yeago comes back from
     Mr Craigs I will then hear when he is going back I would like to send this with him<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley57c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley57c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     </p>
<p class="p10">But I am writing on your birthday and did not think about it
     being your birthday
     until this minute This day you are 19 You have early been called to
     go forth in your Countrys service To fight her battles and maybe to
     shed your blood in her defense We hope that God in his Providence
     will order it otherwise But there is another war in which you are required to engage. The
     Saviour wants soldiers He loves youthful soldiers He is calling on you to enlist under his
     banner Will you not respond as cheerfully to the call as you have
     done to your Countrys call. You have every encouragement to do so Assured that you shall come of conqueror and more than
     conquer</p>
<p class="p10">What more can you desire than he has promised to give Just take him at his word your Aunt
     Annie sends you <i>[unclear: Dodridge]</i> And requests you to read it carefully &amp;
      <i>[unclear: prepare]</i> I noticed in the central Presbyterian the ladies of Richmond were
     fitting up a reading Tent for the soldiers there I was much pleased with idea I would be glad
     we could have one at Harpers Ferry The Cent Society has money
     enough on hands to furnish one I think I will suggest it to them and see whether it meets their
     approbation</p>
<p class="p10">But I must close write when you can I had the pleasure of reading your letter to cousin
     Hannah I see you are daily expecting a battle May the God of battles shield you from all harm
     when the conflict comes Is the prayer of your affectionate Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">your Uncle &amp; Aunt join me in sending much love to you</p>
<p class="p10"><i>E Martin</i></p>
