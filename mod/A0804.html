<p class="p10">July 21, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Ashby</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">We got <i>[illeg.]</i> Friday evening and picked out a place to pitch our tent and built a
     big fire and sat down by it and rested until 9 <i>[illeg.]</i> the wagon to come up which our
     tents were in it did not come on time, we slept under a tree the first night. As we were coming
     down we met 10 or 12 Yanks coming in to town and every day some one or two are brought in the
     camp the Col. sends them on to the Provost Marshall office to be kept until he has a pretty
     good crowd and then send them on to Staunton. We are encamped about 2
     1/2 or 3 miles from Harrisonburg on the Gamble place about 1/4 of a mile from his house he was
     up to see us Sunday and asked me over to see him which I will do soon. I asked Cousin Ash what
     company he should advise me to join. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/garb4b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/garb4b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      He said hold on a day or two until he could look around and then he would tell me he is going to make Color sergeant but he has no
     collars yet so I am going to be his orderly until he gets the flag. he sent Bunch to Staunton
     Saturday evening. I told him to tell Pa to send me sone smoking tobacco and a pipe. Bill
     Waddell has some good tobaco put up in bags 2 1/2 pounds each tell Pa to send me one of them.
     Cousin Asher &amp; Lewis have gone out to see the companies
     drill and left me in charge of camp and about every 5 minutes some come for a pass to go to
     town the Col did not give me any orders about it so I refused them all. I don't believe there
     is any news in camp there are several yankee papers in camp the first
     one I get ahold of I will send it up to Ma give my love to all of the
     girls and tell Sister <i>[unclear: Seal]</i> she must write to me.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Brother</p>
