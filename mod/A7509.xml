                <p>Barber writes to his cousin, thanking her for her recent letter and complaining
                    that no other family members have yet written to him. He describes the
                    unpleasant duty of reviewing applications for exemption from military service
                    because of injury and worries about the personal effects of long service, noting

                <p>Your very kind &amp; excellent letter of 22 inst. was <abbr expan="received"
                        >recd</abbr> yesterday. Allow me to return you my sincerest thanks for your

                    of strangers; your letter was the first line <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr>
                    since I left you. <orig reg="Notwithstanding">Nothwithstanding</orig> I have
                    been so prompt in writing my <abbr expan="brothers">Bros</abbr>, Sisters, Nieces
                    &amp; nephews &amp; friends, &amp; gave all my P.O. address before
                    leaving <unclear>Easton.</unclear> &amp; insisted upon their writing me,
                    &amp; in addition to this, have myself written nearly all my <abbr

                        <unclear>East.</unclear> yet not a line from one have I <abbr

                    again thank you for your mindfulness of me.</p>

                <p>Since I left you, I have been the "<hi rend="underline">grand rounds</hi>"-- to
                    Lewisburg, Union, Giles Ct. House, Dublin, Newberne, Wytheville, Abingdon,
                    Saltville, Marion, <unclear>Glade</unclear> Springs &amp; then again back
                    here. At Each of the several places I was busily engaged @ several days, in the
                    execution of orders. I have done much labor &amp; feel quite broken down.
                    For last several days been here, examining <unclear>Reviews</unclear> for <hi
                        rend="underline">Exemption</hi> from service-- 'Tis no pleasant work-- to
                    see them coming with their walking sticks &amp; then to have to set (if one
                    would) &amp; listen<pb n="2"/>to their <hi rend="underline">ten</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">thousand</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">"Ailments"</hi> would worry one even of more patience than
                    your "cousin Andrew" But the work is well nigh over, &amp; soon again "I'll
                    be marching" to other &amp; as yet <orig reg="unknown">unknow</orig> fields
                    of labor. I yesterday <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> an order to hold myself
                    in readiness to take command of Rendezvous at Abingdon &amp; the Reserves of
                    West Va. When the <hi rend="underline">order</hi> comes I am going to decline
                    it-- I am but <hi rend="underline">one man</hi>, &amp; <abbr expan="though"
                        >tho'</abbr> having been disabled from active service in the field by <abbr

                    in Medical &amp; Military <abbr expan="Department">Dpt.</abbr> of our Army.
                    I want to perform duty in the Medical <abbr expan="Department">Dpt.</abbr>, or
                    am willing to return to the field &amp; take my command ss once I had it,
                    but I will not much longer, be a subject to obey orders in both branches of the
                    service.</p>

                <p>I have made but very few acquaintances outside business transaction. I have met
                    with one or two pleasant Ladies-- spent one <abbr expan="evening">eveg.</abbr>
                    in <orig reg="ladies'">Ladie's</orig> society since I left Lewisburg. Have heard
                    some fine music. At Wm Y.C. White's Abingdon. I care but little for making
                    acquaintances now. My heart once so full of tender affection seems now to be
                    drying up, or if refreshed at all, 'tis only by the memory of, &amp; sweet
                    dreams of happy byegones. I regret dear cousin that you seemed to labor before
                    getting a "<hi rend="underline">theme</hi>" upon which to <hi rend="underline"
                        >write me.</hi> Glad however, that when you <hi rend="underline">selected
                    it</hi>, that you gave me such a fine essay on the subject that rules &amp;
                    governs</p>

                <p>Excuse this letter-- I have written in great haste &amp; have frequently been
                    interrupted-- will do better next time. Here's a kiss, &amp; a loving
