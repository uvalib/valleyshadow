<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: C. J. Peyton to David
                    Fultz, [June 25, 1867]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Peyton contests Monroe's claim on the boy, James, stating that he is better cared
                    for with him, and that Monroe only wants the boy now that he is old enough to
                    work.</p>

<p class="p10">The boy James is not willing to go with Richard. That is: was not some time ago.
                    I have not mentioned the matter to him since Richard's last application for him.
                    The boy James also stated that Richard did not marry a sister of his. There can
                    be no doubt but what the boy is better cared for &amp; his condition better
                    every way, then if Richard had him <i>[unclear: bound]</i> his mother she died
                    when James was an infant. Since then I have taken good care of him. He is just
                    getting large enough now to do a little something, which is the <u>sole</u> cause of Richards anxiety concerning him. I shall
                    not give him up until compelled to.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
