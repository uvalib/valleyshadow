<p class="p10">I am this day in receipt of your letter in relation to General orders No. 51 Current Series which order I have not as yet received
                    or read.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 30th day of September 1865 I had no Employees serving under me in the
                        Quartermaster Department because I was then, as
                    now on duty in the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, as
                    Superintendent of the Sixth District Virginia and since
                    the 1st of October 1863, I have neither employed Printers for a compensation nor
                    paid any person for such services.</p>
<p class="p10">My Post Office address as previously reported by me to the Quarter Master General
                    is <u>Winchester</u>
                    Virginia, and the direction of your communication to
                    Staunton is the reason of this delay in replying to it.</p>
