<h4>Augusta County: E. J. Evans to David H. Evans,
                    August, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>E. Evans writes to David Evans in outrage over a perceived insult which he will
                    hold David accountable for. He goes so far as to threaten to come to Staunton
                    and "cowhide" David in the middle of Main Street.</p>

<p class="p10">Agt <sup>th</sup>/68</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Evans</p>
<p class="p10">I received a very inSulting
                    letter from you today
                    which I will hold you responsible for. I Meant exactly what I
                    Said in Joh's letter about it Was for the want of sense
                    you Showed that letter. I Suppose you did not care if it had been confiscated. this of course made very little difference to you</p>
<p class="p10">I Would like to Know Sir by What authority you have
                    to take a private letter &amp; exhibit it around
                    it did not concern you in the least &amp; the letter was not written to you
                    &amp; of course it was none of your business at
                    all. to Say the least of it it was a great <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>piece of presumption in you</p>
<p class="p10">I don't Know what you mean When you Say circumstances
                    connected with the <i>[unclear: firm]</i> We are
                    Not ignorant Sir of your Small opinion of H &amp; My <i>[illeg.]</i> Self
                    for there has been
                    enough coming from you against us that you perhaps
                    think we are ignorant of but you are MistaKen. you have <u>Said</u>
                    <u>Some</u>
                    <u>
                        very
                    </u>
                    <u>hard</u>
                    <u>things</u>
                    <u>about</u>
                    <u>us</u>
                    <u>in</u>
                    <u>the</u>
                    <u>last</u>
                    <u>three</u> Month which we have paid
                    no attention to I could refer to Some if I felt So
                    disposed but I will refrain at present but it May become necessary in the future to Say Something about them in regard to the
                        tobacco I Shant Say one word to you about it for it is none of your
                    business</p>
<p class="p10">Now Sir there is one thing which
                    I want to call your special
                    attention to &amp; it is this you Say I have
                    written <u>a</u>
                    <u>
                        direct
                    </u>
                    <u>falsehood</u>
                    <u>or</u>
                    <u>in</u>
                    <u>plain</u>
                    <u>
                        lie
                    </u>. Now Sir this is more than I can Stand I Know exactly what I wrote &amp; John underStands all about it, but for you
                    to put down in black &amp; White that I am a <u>liar</u>
                    is Something Sir that I don't take from No Man, and if
                    you don't take it back I Shall get on the Stage
                    &amp; come to Staunton &amp; Settle it by more
                    than words. Now I Mean every
                    word I Say and will cary it out you have got to retract or I will cowhide you on Main Street &amp;
                    will give you the privilege of preparing <i>[deleted: ]</i> the <i>[unclear: Same]</i></p>
<p class="p10">Joh B Evans can testify whether I told anything but truth he Knows a little More about it
                    than you he Knows things that you don't</p>
