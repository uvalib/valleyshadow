<p class="p10">Dear Brother Mike</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your letter today and as Cousin Fanny is going down to see <i>[deleted: you]</i> Cousin Tom this evening I thought I would answer it right off and set you a good
     example. I will thank Cousin Sally and the rest of them for sending your the jacket,
     &amp;c. The company which Ned was Elected 1st Lieut.. in is called
      <u>Southern Fencibles</u> hard run for names they have not been mustered
     into service yet but expect to be in a few days. Ned had been riding
     around the county getting more volunteers. They have not enough men yet to mustered into
     service but will have this week. Mag Garber is not here but is in Charlottesville or somewhere
     near there. Will be here in a couple of weeks. I will give her a kiss for you and ask too if
     you want me to excuse this short letter as I have not time any more.</p>

     to write soon and tell her. </p>
