<p class="p10">Sept 1866</p>

<p class="p10">My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">In response to your request to furnish you with a full account from my pen of the
                    circumstances connected <i>[deleted: y]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: no]</i> with <i>[deleted: the]</i> my capture, trial and
                    imprisonment &amp;c. I give the following unvarnished statement of facts.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 25<sup>th</sup> of March 1865, J. Logethin with five others of
                    Mosby's Command provided from Westmoreland County in
                        Virginia into St. Mary's County, Maryland on a
                    scout to ascertain the face of the enemy at <i>[unclear: Scondotown]</i>: after
                    performing that duty, we proceeded into Prince George County, in which at a
                    place called Croome, on the night of the night of the 3rd of April, myself and
                    the others - three of the party having deserted, in an effort to get possession
                    of the United States Post Office at that place, came in contact with four
                    detectives of that government all armed and the Post Master - named Coffon -
                    provided with an axe. On the enemy firing the first volley, the others of my
                    comrades fled and made good their escape, leaving me alone to fight for my life
                    with five men. In the encounter, I severely wounded one and killed another, but
                    was then overpowered, badly hurt and taken under heavy guard to Annapolis, where
                    I was kindly healed, and thence removed to the negro jail in Baltimore where I
                    was under the immediate command and control of Major Neigh, a second edition of
                    Beast Butler, Thad Stevens and all that ilk. I arrived in Baltimore and was
                    lodged in the <i>[illeg.]</i> jail on the day of <i>[deleted: March]</i>
                    April 65. I was treated not as a prisoner of war, but as a convict. While there
                    was <i>[added: kept in irons &amp;]</i> thrown into a
                    solitary cell, <i>[deleted: without any coat]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: no]</i> blanket and no fire, and when a fellow prisoner <i>[deleted: threw]</i>
                    <i>[added: pushed]</i> me a blanket between iron bars, the
                    guard ordered <i>[deleted: it to be]</i> me to throw it out: which I did. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I was taken to Baltimore in chains. At Croom, after being
                    overpowered, a rope was gotten with which to hang me unless I answered <i>[deleted: ques]</i> inquisitional questions: Captain Curry <i>[added: Provost Marshal of
                    Annapolis]</i> who came up the next morning <i>[deleted: as on]</i> ordered
                    a rope to be gotten for that purpose. <i>[deleted: The rope]</i> A rope
                    halter taken from a horse was brought: I refused to
                    answer any questions and said to know, if I was hung, Mosby would hang seven men
                    for me. Upon that remark, they desisted, and I was taken to Annapolis. The night
                    I was at Croom, <i>[deleted: I was tied]</i> My hands were tied behind me
                        <i>[added: with ropes,]</i> and so tightly that the pain
                    was excruciating. I asked to have the ropes
                    slackened and the guard refused. I was taken into the room where the men I had
                    wounded - one mortally &amp; the other severely, <i>[deleted: to be]</i>
                    were lying and there kept during the night as above explained: I saw whilst
                    tied, on the mantlepiece of the room a small silver mounted seven shooter: I lay
                    upon my back <i>[deleted: with]</i> and very quietly endeavored to slip my
                    hands from the rope: I had gotten them so nearly released, that, I supposed by a
                    spring and powerful effort I could entirely extricate myself - seize the pistol
                    and make good my escape. I made the effort - but the ropes were not as nearly
                    loosened as I supposed: I was instantly seized &amp; thrown down by the
                    guard and the ropes were drawn upon me as tightly as possible.</p>

                        <i>[deleted: the wounded men]</i>

                    mortally <i>[added: &amp; the latter severely]</i>
                    wounded - and he, about 4 o' clock in the morning requested that I be brought to
                    his bedside - my hands tied behind me - and remarked: Sir you have done your
                    duty - I don't blame you - you were in combat uniform - fought me as a soldier -
                    hard as you will: he had no body to blame but himself - and he hoped that I
                    would be treated as a prisoner of war. He was a noble, gallant and brave man -
                    and fought me with such an unconquerable spirit.</p>
<p class="p10">As above stated, I was then taken to Annapolis, thence to Baltimore, and after
                    four days incarceration in the negro jail, was removed in irons to the
                    magnificent city jail of Baltimore where I was healed with humanity &amp;
                    kindness. It is unnecessary for me to give an account of the horrid negro jail
                    in Baltimore: its vermin, the character of its inmates - negroes, Yankees -
                    desperadoes - and gentlemen from Maryland and elsewhere who were there <i>[added: under suspicion of <i>[illeg.]</i>]</i>

<p class="p10">As above stated, I was removed to the city jail - charges were pursued against
                    me: a military commission: not an ordinary court martial, appointed. The charges
                    were as follows to wit:</p>

<p class="p10">I deem it unnecessary to copy the record further in this connection: it would
                    cumber your book with much irrelevant matter. Let it suffice that I was charged:</p>

<p class="p10">The finding <i>[added: in reference to]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: upon]</i> the 1st charge - murder - is so singular and
                    unprecedented in Criminal Jurisprudence, that I cannot forbear quoting it
                    verbatim - "Guilty <u>except</u> with malice aforethought."
                    Malice is the essence of the crime of murder, and how under any civilized <i>[deleted: ]</i> is it possible to be guilty of murder "except with <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>malice? In other words, murder <u>without</u> malice
                    aforethought?</p>
<p class="p10">I was sentenced</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>The trial commenced on the 27 day of April
                    1865 and continued until the day of when it was at the

                    they reached Baltimore under guard - were thrown into the same negro jail, and
                    on the following Monday at the meeting of the Commission - when the hour of
                    trial had arrived I was ushered into their presence. It is not necessary to
                    state what my feelings were - in manacles as I was,
                    when brought into the presence of my father and my
                    relation Mr. Halsey. They were examined as witnesses, in reference especially to
                    the status of Mosby &amp; command in the service of the Confederate government. On this subject, their evidence was clear
                    and conclusive - to the effect that Mosby was a commissioned officer that his
                    command was organized in result of and obedience to acts of the Confederate Congress &amp; orders from the Secretary of War. I was charged and piled <i>[deleted: ]</i> with abuse, as a guerrilla. The trial continued in days. Mr. William Whitney &amp; Mr. John Mills represented me
                    as counsel. The speech of Mr. W. was powerful and eloquent. - The trial
                    concluded - <i>[added: the commission consisted of - officers

                    and then awaited anxiously for almost 2 months the action of General Wallace who had to review and confirm or reject
                    the decision of the commission.</p>
<p class="p10">On the day of that decision was announced - which consigned me to solitary
                    imprisonment and hard labor for life in the Curtin Prison - near Lake Champlain
                    New York - to which place I arrived <i>[added: in heavy irons

                    <i>[deleted: in heavy irons - hands &amp; feet]</i> on day of 1865. After reaching there was shaved, washed and prison
                    clothes put upon me. Was first put to striking in the blacksmith shop - and then
                    to cutting nails by machinery. I was resigned to work <i>[deleted: 10]</i>
                    <i>[added: eleven]</i> hours per day - with only one hour of
                    intermission in meals - and at night locked up in a cell. - 10 x 4 - and this
                    was my home on Sundays. I worked side by side with a negro convict: and was
                    required to walk <i>[added: to]</i> and eat with him at the
                    mess hall. His name ______ and I have no hesitation in saying he was the best

<p class="p10"><i>[deleted: In my]</i> I occasionally received letters from my parents
                    assuring me that every effort was being made to procure my pardon. This
                    sustained &amp; cheered me. My father, immediately on his return home about
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> of July 1865 from prison -
                    went to work and did not abate his efforts until success crowned his efforts in

<p class="p10">Major Weigel had me brought into his presence and told me
                    there was only one chance for my life - and that was to confess before the
                    commission, that I was a guerrilla - and had murdered Ryan: I indignantly
                    replied to him: that I was a Confederate soldier - engaged in legitimate warfare
                    - belonged to Mosby's command - was no guerrilla - that <i>[deleted: I was
                        under]</i> there was a predetermined purpose to execute me - and he wanted
                    to be saved the trouble of having witnesses and a protracted trial: that my life
                    was to be taken I knew - <i>[deleted: but]</i>

                    - and would do <i>[deleted: over]</i> again under like circumstances what I
                    had done - and regretted nothing I had done. To others he represented me as the
                    most hardened heathen &amp; reprobate of my age he had ever met with. Not
                    satisfied with his interview with me he put a detective in Confederate uniform
                    in the cell with me: who <i>[deleted: represented that]</i>
                    <i>[added: said]</i> he and myself were - in a bad fix: he
                    knew I had done something for which I would be hung - and his case was no better
                    than mine - and after he had, as he supposed gained my confidence in that
                    however, he was mistaken for I suspected him all the time &amp; was very
                        reticent, he <i>[deleted: proposed that]</i>

                    States government were aroused to a pitch of madness
                    &amp; frenzy unprecedented except in the days of
                    the French Revolution. The slightest spark would have kindled a flame that must
                    have led to the destruction of the thousands of Confederates in the Nation

<p class="p10">As above stated, I was taken to Annapolis, thence to Baltimore, and after four
                    days incarceration in the <u>negro</u>

                    jail of Baltimore where I was healed with humanity and kindness. I shall ever
                    remember with gratitude my keepers in that prison.</p>
<p class="p10">It is unnecessary for me to give an account of the horrid negro jail in Baltimore
                    under the immediate management and control of one Major Weigel <i>[added: Provost Marshal of Baltimore]</i> whose office was in a room
                    of the prison, would induce the necessity of my speaking of Yankees - outlaws -

                    commission that I was a <u>guerrilla</u> and had murdered
                    Ryan. To this, my indignant reply was - "I am a Confederate soldier - engaged in
                    legitimate warfare - belong to Mosby's command, no guerrilla -, and know there
