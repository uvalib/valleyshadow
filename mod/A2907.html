                    Sallie's yesterday evening we had quite a nice visit they all wished you could
                    have been along; none of the girls were at home but Harriet Mattie is down at
                    Moscow with her sister her husband is dead, died at Lynchburg took gangrene in his wound had been dead a week before she got there she brought him home and buried at

                    to Mr. Heiser's Saturday Mr H took me to Nelson next day in the buggy we heard
                    Mr Preston preach. I was to see Cousin Hettie Heller on tuesday We got our cloak
                    cloth home it is <i>[added: almost]</i> as nice as broad
                    cloth your cloth is done, we could not bring it home as we were disappointed in
                    getting a buggy. Cousin Alf was at home busy making gold rings. I heard from
                    home yesterday they were all well I saw Mrs. Cooper, Essie, and Alex going down
                    to Aunt Sallie's Mag is down at Mr. Shirreys. <i>[deleted: Mr.]</i> You spoke
                    of having a pair of boots made I do not know whether Mr. Row is at home or not I
                    dont think he is, his brother is at home sick, or was the last time I heard from
                    there I expect to go over home the first of next week I will find whether Mr.
                    Row is at home or not and let you know You said in your last letter you would
                    like for me to be down there to take dinner with you I would like to be there
                    some day, but much rather you were at home to eat with us. Phebe received your
                    letter thursday Ma said to tell you she did not send you any thing, as you
                    requested not she would like to send you some apples if she knew where to <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to send them Pa has not got all of his apples gathered yet he is busy
                    working with his potatoes &amp; corn he thinks he will have about 75 bushels
                    potatoes. there are some men here now gathering the corn out field for the
                    Artillery horses. I heard last Thursday that Jim Hanger was killed I do now know
                    whether it is true or not he went to see Miss Paxton in Rockbridge several times
                    when he was at home last summer, when she heard he was killed she said to his
                    sister I told you he would keep a bullet from killing some good man I believe I
                    have no interesting news to write this time Aunt Sallie's said to give their
                    best respects to you. The family all send their love to you. Sister is going to
                    Greenville and I will have to close as I have to send the letter over there. I
                    hope you will get home soon nothing more, but remain your affectionate Wife
                        until death,</p>
