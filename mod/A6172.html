<p class="p10">Dear Cousin Maggie:-</p>
<p class="p10">I will try my luck in writing to you this time, and I am almost certain that I will meet with
     success. I want to hear from my many friends in Frederick- how they are getting along- what
     they are doing, etc., I have written several letters to my
     Frederick friends since the Yanks left, but have not received even a line from them. not even
     sister Becky has thought it worthwhile to write. And I now hope
     you will do me the kind favor to answer this by return mail, and tell me how &amp; what you
     are all doing, etc., I heard that Becky was married; but am still
     at a loss to know if it is true. Please excuse this short letter, as my candle is almost gone.
     We are all well, &amp; hope this may find you the same. Give my love to Uncle James
     &amp; Lizzie, your Ma, and all the rest. &amp; <u>reserve</u>
     <u>a</u>
     <u>good</u>
     <u>portion</u> for <u>yourself</u>. I will try &amp;
     give you a long letter if you will answer this. Are you most married? I will try &amp; come
     down to Frederick next Winter. I received the other day a letter from my dear friend Jennie
     Ritchen of Clarke County. I am anxious to see her. Tell my sister that she is very bashful
     about writing since she is married. Well I must close- please excuse this miserable letter
     &amp; return me a letter next mail. </p>
<p class="p10">Truly your sincere friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.H.H. Frenger</i></p>
