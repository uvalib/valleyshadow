<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    September 12, 1854
        <br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure attests to the strength of the local Whig ticket, as well as affirming
                    his loyalty to it.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>Repository &amp; Whig Office

<p class="p10">September 12</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel-</p>
<p class="p10">Your <i>[unclear: fame]</i> is at hand. I hope that whatever action the State
                    Committee may take in reference to <i>[unclear: Darsie]</i>, will be taken
                    speedily, for in many counties tickets are printed four weeks before the
                    election.</p>
<p class="p10">You have doubtless been apprised of Sellers' nomination in Juniata. I supposed
                    that such must be the result, for there is no man in the county approaches him
                    in personal &amp; political strength. I do hope indeed that he will be
                    elected, I go to Juniata tomorrow &amp; will be there some days on private
                    business.</p>
<p class="p10">How so ridiculous a story as that I am opposed to the Whig ticket in this county
                    got into your section I cannot imagine. There is not a man on the ticket for
                    whose success I do not feel a <u>personal</u> as wel as a
                    political interest, for it is without explanation, one of the very best tickets
                    ever nominated in the county. The candidates are every one men of eminent moral
                    worth, unquestioned competency, and sound Whigs. Besides <u>I
                        don't oppose Whig tickets</u> - its against my principle and I have never
                    done it in my life.</p>
<p class="p10">Hoping to hear from you frequently, believe me.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Colonel Eli Slifer
                    </p>
