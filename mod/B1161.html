<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, January 23, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How recommends that a Thomas Wholey be allowed to take lumber from an abandoned
                    barracks in Staunton, and that the black community should use the remaining
                    lumber for the construction of a church.</p>

                    Colonel O. Brown, Assistant Commissioner<br>Richmond, Virginia
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 23d 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">In relation to the accompanying papers of Mr Thomas Wholey I have the honor to
                    report that the barracks referred to by him were turned over to the agent of the
                    Bureau at this Post by an order of Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Clay, 58th Pennsylvania Volunteers
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        commanding
                    ]</i> (copy endorsed) dated January 10th 1866,
                    and that immediately upon the withdrawal of the troops from this Post, and the
                    consequent removal of all guards from the premises, the barrack was stripped of
                    anything moveable by persons unknown, and there now remains nothing but the bare
                    walls and roof of a building without windows or doors.</p>
<p class="p10">Taking into consideration therefore the <i>[unclear: correctness]</i> of Mr.
                    Wholey's claim for lumber taken, the presence of the lumber on his grounds, his
                    loyalty and the fact that this building is not now needed for any use which
                    would justify its repair and the payment of ground rent <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and the fact
                    also that balance of the lumber would not meet any considerable sum over the
                    expense of its disposal, I respectfully recommend that Mr Thos Wholey be
                    permitted to retain an amoung of the lumber comprising the barrack equal to
                    twenty two hundred (2200) feet, and that the Freedmen be allowed to remove the
                    remainder for use in the construction of the church now being built by them in
                    this place.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Colonel<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. Storer How, Captain
                        Assistant Quartermaster<br>Superintendent Sixth District
