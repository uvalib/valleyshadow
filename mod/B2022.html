<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to R.
                    M. Manly, November 1, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson asks for reimbursement for furniture purchased to supply the teachers'
                    rooms. He was unable to find anyone willing to board them, so had to rent
                    private rooms.</p>

<p class="p10">November 1st 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I ask your direction how I can be reimbursed for purchase of barely necessary
                    furniture for Teachers. I could not find a boarding place public or private, no
                    one would have a teacher, and I had to rent two rooms which were <u>entirely</u> unfurnished &amp; buy some few things.</p>
<p class="p10">I have paid about $33 and $15 or $20 more will be needed to give them chairs to
                    sit on. The school is progressing well, but Miss Rowell's assistant has not yet
                    arrived and her services are much needed.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Your obedient servant
                    </p>
