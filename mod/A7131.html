<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have had three applications for teachers of small schools near here.  Greenville, <i>[illeg.]</i> and Mt Solon.  The last named place is about 15 miles from here and in the vicinity of several Union families</p>
<p class="p10">This is the nearest point of Rail Road:  There may be 30 scholars,--perhaps 40--:  They are very anxious, and pledge themselves to <u>board a teacher and pay ten dollars per month in addition</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">They are able and one of the men (colored) wanted me to inform him as soon as possible if you couldn't send a teacher.  I haven't seen the place.  I told him I would write.</p>
<p class="p10">(over)</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you will conclude to send me another teacher as per yesterday's request--if you can</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
