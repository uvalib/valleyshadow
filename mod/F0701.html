<p class="p10">May 21<sup>st</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Henry
     </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of yesterday was received in due time and<br> being fully digested I embrace this
     privilege of writing to you again.<br> I was sorry to hear of your disappointment on Saturday
     last,<br> and can only measure your feelings by imagining what mine<br> would have been under
     corresponding circumstances. Saturday<br> was a day of interest and satisfaction to me having
     never<br> seen the like before, when I cast my eyes along the line, which<br> was formed
     along the one side of the street, with arms presented<br> and beheld the field of bayonets
     elevated above the heads of thousands, and the Governor of
     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,<br> which is the Keystone of
     the Arch, moving steadily and silently<br> along that line, with his penetrating eye firmly
     fixed upon them,<br> and his countenance remaining unmoved and apparently<br> speaking of the
     condition of the Country and the object for<br> which so many sons of labor had been called
     together, I was led<br> to exclaim, "who can tell what a day may bring forth." 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitCre2b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitCre2b.gif"></center></a><br><br> From a person who came from Williamsport Maryland yesterday<br> we learned that two Regiments of
     Secessionists had come there and<br> by yesterday's Tribune, that the plan is to come on
     through<br> until they reach Philadelphia, in order to get
     provisions,<br> should they attempt to carry out that design, we will<br> have a bloody time
     here, and you may be sure the men<br> here will give them a breakfast job at any rate, and
     I<br> hope Shippensburg and the Pines
     will, by the time they<br> reach you, have their 10 O'clock peace ready for<br> them and see
     that every man gets his portion due.<br> This is to much to trifle about, as it may be
     their<br> design, however I am not yet uneasy, but should they<br> come it may be that I
     might never see you again<br> let come what will, I expect to be prepared for the<br> worst
     that can happen <i>[added: to]</i> me. The citizens of 
      Chambersburg
     <br> are calm, and do not apprehend an attack from the<br> rebels from the South. I
     have not in my imagination<br> marked out the plan by which the present troubles<br> may be
     settled, but find that the opinion of some is<br> that war is the only remedy. If such be true then the<br> Northern boys must go to the work, and what could
     be<br> more cheering to the hearts of freeman such as we are,<br> than to see that the <u>whole</u> north will move to the<br>
     
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitCre2c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitCre2c.gif"></center></a><br><br> work, as one mighty machine none of the parts<br> being wanting,
     but all complete, and all of which have<br> been tried in the days of '76, and found to be as true<br>
     as steel, and since the fall of Sumpter it has
     been greatly<br> strengthened and now is the Greatest Structure, and most<br>
     complete machine under the Canopy of Heaven, and<br> when it begins
     to move forward upon the foe, stretching<br> from the Atlantic to
     the Pacific,- every part reveling<br> in grandeur and might, not
     being driven by steam,<br> but the hearts blood of million, and the smiles<br> of Heaven,
     although moving slowly, its tread will<br> be the surer, and long before it reaches Cape Sable,<br>
     <u>secession</u> will be crushed out of existence, and like a<br> mighty
     cloud, it will rain Union sentiments on every<br> farm and plantation south of Mason's
      and Dixon's<br> Line. Let us start the ball rolling, and send secession to the place from whence it came, you will now<br> allow me to tell
     you a little anecdote, which I heard a<br> few days ago. Mr.-- <i>[added: A]</i> said "that it has often been his<br> wonder what the
      Devil tempted people to sin for that<br> their sin could not make
     him any better," when Mr.-- <i>[added: B]</i><br> said, "Don't you
     know that he<br> is a secessionist<br> - that he was the first to secede from Heaven, and consequently 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitCre2d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitCre2d.gif"></center></a><br><br> the father of secession," - more truth than joke -<br> This is a
     day of sweet recollection to me, being<br> the 21<u>st</u> day of May. "Rather let my right hand<br> forget her cunning and my
     tongue cleave to<br> the roof of my mouth," than for me to forget<br> my hours of unalloyed
     peace three years ago at<br> old 
      Stony-Point.
      Those were <u>the</u> happy hours<br> of my life. And I hope the
     Friend I there formed<br> may be my friend for life - would to God<br> that all who
     participated in that season of<br> refreshment might be able to say - My labors<br> there
     have not been in vain, I hope you will<br> let your mind run back to that era in your<br>
     life and call to memory the hours that you with<br> me and many others spent there. Henry
     dear<br> remember <u>then</u>. I am looking for you this<br> week; don't forget to come. I have been interrupted<br> a great deal while writing this, so that you<br> will find some
     trouble in reading it. Write soon <i>[deleted: I]</i><br> if
     it is not too much trouble, I sometimes think<br> that I am imposing on
     your time to ask you to write<br> but I can't help it no person else
     will write<br> and I am very glad to hear from the pines. </p>
<p class="p10"> Yours Forever</p>
