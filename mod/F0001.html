<h4>Franklin County: Abraham Lincoln to Major General

</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Lincoln writes to Major General Hooker on April 15, 1863, to report on the

<p class="p10">It is now 10_15 P.M. An hour ago I received your letter of this morning, and a
                    few minutes later your dispatch of this evening. The
                    latter gives me considerable uneasiness. The rain and mud of course were to be
                    calculated upon. Genl S. is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition
                    come to anything. He has now been out three days, two of which were unusually fine weather, and all three without
                    hindrance from the enemy, and yet he is not twentyfive miles from where he
                    started. To reach his point, he still has sixty to go: another river the Rapidan
                    to cross, and will be hindered by the enemy. By arithematic, how many days will
                    it take him to do it? I do not know that any better can be done, but I greatly
                    fear it is another failure already. Write me often. I am very anxious. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly </p>
<p class="p10"><i>A. Lincoln </i></p>
<p class="p10">I certify the foregoing to be a true copy of the original
                        now in my possession. Tho<sup>s</sup> Lawlor, Secretary { }
