<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Frederick S. Tukey to W.
                    Storer How, February 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Tukey submits a report on the condition of free blacks in Augusta County, noting
                    the efforts to build a school, as well as some of the problems faced by the
                    poor.</p>

                    Report of Bureau Affairs for the Month of February 1866 in Sub-District "B"
                    Captain
                        W. S. How
                        Assistant Quartermaster and<br>Superintendent

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Captain:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following report for the month of February 1866 in
                    Sub. District B.</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta County</p>
<p class="p10">Since my last report the Freedmen at this point have made some advancement
                    towards a better Condition. By the assistance of the Bureau in furnishing
                    lumber, they have been enabled to fit up and repair a building to answer the
                    double purpose of a church and School House which they purchased for the former
                    purpose, and which promises to be of the greatest advantage to them.</p>
<p class="p10">The amount of suffering among the Freedmen is comparatively small. But in cases where there is Extreme privation
                    and are paupers, the Overseers of the Poor invariably deny such admittance to
                    the Poor House on my application thereby setting a defiance the order of the War
                    Department requiring each County to support its own poor. The County Court has
                    issued an order requiring all of its Officers to assist the Bureau in Serving
                    processes, and which if carried out will be of incalculable benefit to the
                    Bureau.</p>
<p class="p10">Highland County</p>
<p class="p10">Transportation has been so limited that I have been unable to visit this County,
                    consequently cannot say much about it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have learned however that like Augusta County the Overseers of the Poor refuse
                    to receive any pauper Freedmen in the Poor House.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient
                        Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F.S. Tukey<br>Assistant
                        Superintendent
                        Sub-District B</i></p>
