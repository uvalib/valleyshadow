<p class="p10">Dear 
                            Brother
                        
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter last night or night before I believe it was <i>[unclear: right
                        as the boys are almost]</i> all sending some money home. I write to let
                    you know why I don't send any. we were paid for four months but owing to a
                    mistake in signing my name, I with several others
                    did not get <i>[unclear: counted]</i>. When I enlisted I signed my name as I
                    always do S.W. North, but somehow my name was copied on the roll, Samuel J.
                    North, and has always continued so on the muster rolls and this time when I came
                    to sign the muster roll I put my correct signature to it and the paymaster this
                    time was very <i>[deleted: correc]</i> strict and did not give us who had
                    mistakes in our names. There were several who did not get paid but we will get
                    it when we are discharged. there will not be the least risk of losing it. I had
                    just as like have it then as now as I don't need it and would run the risk of sending it home.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    when I do get it I will get six months pay at once. We had orders to move but I
                    will give you the whole account on Monday the 91<sup>st</sup>
                    regiment with four men from each company of ours and
                    the 134 &amp; 124 started on monday morning. they are now at U.S. ford
                    &amp; Banks ford holding them. they are about six miles up the river. our
                    whole cavalry force has come out towards Warrenton. they are reported to have
                    had a fight. We were to have gone this morning but it commenced raining last
                    night and has been pouring down all day and this night - it is raining still. it
                    will raise the river and may delay the move. It seems as if providence was
                    against us all along. the mud march was defeated on account of the weather. Burnside's plans were
                    disclosed another time now this move has just gone far enough to be exposed. I
                    think it is the plan <i>[deleted: is]</i> to cross the main force below those
                    above were for a decoy though a considerable force may cross above the city.
                    This is my idea. Some of our boys were out to see those at the fords they say
                    they could not see many rebels at first<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> but
                    they soon came pretty thick. they are on good terms with our boys they made a
                    raft of cornstalks and put a Richmond Examiner on it and sent it over to our
                    fellows. one of the boys from our company got it the war news was torn off one
                    hollared will you let me come back again if i come over our boys said yes he
                    stripped off and was coming when one of the 91<sup>st</sup> officers
                    said I will have to make a prisoner of you he then stopped and went back our
                    company was at Stonemans <i>[unclear: 
                        Switch
                    ]</i> yesterday unloading cars we unloaded a great deal of hay and grain
                    they have splendid engines on the road the finest I ever saw tell pap to send me
                    some postage stamps as mine are most done. I sent the April agriculturist. I
                    might most as well have a sharp stick to write with as this pen. give my love to
                    all the friends. I will write soon again if anything is going on. </p>
<p class="p10">write soon. </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. W. North </i></p>
<p class="p10">I forgot to say that we have to carry 8 days rations of
                        all but meat that is driven along with us. I think if I live to get home my
                        shoulders will be so used to staples that I can tote a
                        bundle of <i>[illeg.]</i> or a box of goods. I know I will always be able
                        to feel for sore shouldered horses. My own have been pretty
                        bad blistered and rubbed after a march so they hurt whenever I
                        would move but only four weeks and then I'm done
                        fighting 
                            back
                        
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> still if it was not for this horrid butchering I believe I
                        would stay in the army. I fear I will not feel contented at home it is hard
                        to tell what I will do.<br>S.W.N. </p>
