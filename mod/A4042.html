<p class="p10">June 28<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Head Quarters 2<sup>
       <u>nd</u>
      </sup> Corps Army of Northern Virginia Carlisle Pa.</p>
<p class="p10">My Darling Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I have just returned from our regular Sermon by Mr. Lacy to our quarters in the U.S.
     Barracks, at Carlisle, having heard a good sermon &amp; been well rested by the good long
     sleep of last night, undisturbed by an order to march at dawn -- We reached here yesterday and
     took quiet possession of the place, quartering a portion of our forces at the U.S. Barracks, a
     lovely place, and a portion in the ample yard of Dickinson College -- The people here are not
     half as sullen as they are farther down the Valley, the German element not being as strong
     &amp; the humanizing influences of schools &amp;c have made a better population -- but
     we found them in quite a state of alarm, expecting us to burn pillage &amp; destroy as they
     have done, but when they saw the conduct of our army they seemed
     surprised, We made requisition on the town for<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>supplies, medicines &amp;c and
     obtained some $50000 of medicines &amp; large supplies of provisions &amp;c -- We are
     subsisting entirely on the country we are in and are constantly sending valuable stores to the
     rear -- The people here had time to send many things away and we do not find many things left
     to purchase -- I have not been able to find any shoes but will probably find some before long.
     I sent to Winchester a large bundle for you of Calico &amp;c -- I do not know how many
     yards, but a good many -- I want you to save enough of some piece for William to have a dress
     for May and one for his child until I write , any how -- I intend to buy more for him if
     another opportunity offers, as he has the money &amp; you can then use all I sent you as
     you see fit -- you may be able to trade some of it for other things you need, price being made
     equal to price -- You may make me two shirts <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>from such as you prefer -- and I will
     buy myself some more if I can find them. I hope you will find the goods such as please you -- I
     had to select them in a hurry &amp; had but little time to make choice -- if there are any
     other little things you may want let me know of it &amp; I will try and get them for you in
     the course of our marches. Our success has been complete, no opposition, the enemy moving off
     as we advance -- &amp; having only militia to oppose to us -- they are preparing to oppose
     us two miles to this side of Harrisburg -- but I do not know where we are going now -- but am
     quite sure the enemy is much alarmed -- The Gen. sent word to the clergy to have their services
     as usual, as no one would disturb them -- so some of the churches were open today, and the
     preachers, though nervous, prayed for their country in peril and their friends in danger --
     they also prayed for the strangers that were among them, some of them prayed for peace -- We
     have had a very pleasant time so far, an abundance to eat, and in variety, our men get<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>vegetables from the people -- onions especially, and they are very good for them.</p>
<p class="p10"> I am extremely anxious to come home but the calls of country
     and duty forbid, but I hope we may soon end this, and rest at home in peace again -- </p>
<p class="p10"> One of the preachers here prayed that God would bless those he was in the habit of praying
     for -- we told some of them we hoped they would meet &amp; pray for Lincoln as he needed
     praying for -- The Lutheran preacher was very sensible -- the Presbyterian preacher prayed for the dear ones <u>we</u> had left at home
     -- I hope our success may continue as it has begun &amp; the movement has been a very fine
     one, admirably conducted -- and eminently successful -- The weather here is very pleasant --
     but we had quite a hard rain day before yesterday. We occupied a house night before last which
     the family had run away and left-we fared very well there and found many good things there --
     our army likes this country very well -- and O what a relief it will be to our country to be
     rid of our army for some time, I hope we may keep away for some time and so relieve the calls
     for supplies that have been so long made so long upon our people. Good bye &amp; may God
     bless &amp; keep you all safely and may you be kept in health and abundance -- Write to me
     often and some of them will surely reach me. I will write to you as often as I can -- Kiss the
     children for me --</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
