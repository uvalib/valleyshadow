<p class="p10">Dear Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">I seat my self this morning for the purpose of dropping you a few lines to let you know where I am. I
                    have the Diptheria. My throat is very sore but I am in hopes that I will be well in a week or
                    two. I left camp on the 24th there had been but very
                    little Infantry fighting but some heavy cannonading across the river the enemy seemed
                    to have the advantage in position at every ford. We have
                    a very large Army in Culpepper for Pope to contend with. Your Brother John was
                    well when I left the Company
                    they
                    were all in good spirits when I left. I met Jacob, Abe,
                    &amp; Isack Vines on <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Monday. Jacob gave me a half Cheese. Abe
                    told me he had something to tell me how he had fooled you out of some secrets. I
                    be glad to see him &amp; find out what they are. I seen John Plunkett in Gordonsville he told me
                    that Charles had a letter for me I am sorry I did not meet him as he is so
                    careless he may lose it before I get back this is a
                    very mean hospital. Very little accommodations, nothing but bread &amp; meat
                    to eat &amp; my throat being sore it is very hard to
                    swallow. I wish I could come home and let Churchman tend on me a while every thing is very dear around here &amp; there is but little change in
                    the circulation. I have been trying to get a note Broke ever since <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I
                    left the Regiment. This is a very lonesome place. There is nothing of
                    importance to write I hope these few lines may find you
                    enjoying both health &amp; happiness. I pray the God of mercies may soon
                    visit me with health.</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more but remain your sincere well wisher</p>
