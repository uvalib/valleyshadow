<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">your favor came to hand Whilst I was in Louden <u>Va</u> I
                    read it on My return I would be Sorry to Know that you was afraid of Me or to
                    Know anyone was afraid of Me I Say I would hate this
                    very Much this is not the idea at all all that I was
                    doing was to reSend one of the grossest
                    insults that one Man can give another</p>
<p class="p10">if it had been
                    anything else I would have paid no attention to it
                        whatever but that was more than I could Stand,
                    and I will assure you that I am glad from My Heart that you took it back perhaps
                    more So than you for I would Not had anything of the Kind to happen <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>if it could
                    have been avoided for any reasonable amount &amp; I Say again I am glad you took it back
                    it don't Show anything like
                    cowardice in you to take it back in other words its
                        shows a better principle. and I Say it is More commendable in you than if you had perSisted in it and I Shall regard it
                    as Noble in you, instead of cowardly</p>
