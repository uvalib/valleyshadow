<h4>Letter to James Brooks
<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Andrew Brooks writes about his fellow students' unsuccessful
appeals to the governor to call out their company from Washington
College.  He also asks his family to send money to help outfit the company.

<p class="p10">Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">When I wrote home <br>
last week I believed that our company <br>
would <i>[added: not]</i> be ordered out, but
now we <br> think we will be. </p>
<p class="p10">Two or three weeks <br>
ago, we determined to write to the <br>
Governor (before we would get <br>
coats) to know whether he would order <br>
us out or not.  After waiting two <br>
weeks, Mr. 
James Davidson of this place <br>
came home from Richmond, bringing <br>
us word that the Governor would not <br>
call us out under any circumstances.<a href="#n1">[1]</a> <br>
Saturday night 
Captain Nelson received <br>
an official answer from
S. Rafael French, <br>
Aid de Camp to the Governor requiring him <br>
to ascertain the consent of the parents <br>
of the boys and to report to the Governor, <br>

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Bro1e284.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Bro1e284.gif"></center></a><br><br>

and he would then "decide the matter." <br>

By the same mail Professor White received <br>
a letter from Greenlee Davidson (son of the <br>
above and clerk in the
Executive department) <br>
telling him to ascertain the consent of the <br>
parents of the boys, and that the
Governor "would <br>
order us to Harpers Ferry
or the Manasas <br>
Junction"<a href="#n2">[2]</a>.
A good many of the boys <br>
had gone home.  They have been written <br>
to, to return.  The parents of a few of the <br>
boys will keep them at home, but we <br>
have been getting some recruits to fill <br>
their places.  There is no doubt but that <br>
the company will be filled out, in a day <br>
or two.  We are drilling four times a <br>
day.  Recitations suspended. </p>
<p class="p10">The captain ordered us to get flannel <br>
shirts or jackets.  We have no coat.</p>
<p class="p10"> We are out of money and would <br>
like to have some this week if you can <br>
send it.  The County Court appropriated <br>
$25,000 to equip volunteers, allowing $25 <br>
per man.  An effort will be made to <br>

<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Bro1e285.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Bro1e285.gif"></center></a><br><br>

have <i>[deleted: ou]</i> the remainder
of our uniform<br>
knapsacks paid &amp;c -paid for out of this <br>
fund.  Some of the court object to it, <br>
because we do not all belong to the <br>
county.  We have heard a great many <br>
reports about the fighting at
Hampton<br>
Harpers Ferry
 <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>, but they are too <br>
favorable to our side to be believed.  <br>
I heard this evening that 7 houses in the <br>
upper end of Waynesborough were burning <br>
yesterday as the cars came by, couldn't <br>
hear whether it was by accident or had been <br>
set on fire<a href="#n3">[3]</a>.
In consequence of so many boys <br>
leaving, the Faculty has called a meeting <br>
of the Trustees, next Saturday, to graduate <br>
the Senior Class and suspend College. <br>
Whether the company goes or not it is <br>
not probable we will have any more <br>
 College duties this session.<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
</p>
<p class="p10">We will write again as <br>
soon as we hear from the Governor.  </p>
<p class="p10">I would like to have two new pair <br>
of woolen stockings.  <br>


<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Bro1e286.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Bro1e286.gif"></center></a><br><br>

William &amp; I both want a new <br>
strong cotton shirt.  We have one <br>
apiece, our sleeping shirts which <br>
have never been used.  You need <br>
not send them here, as we will <br>
go to Staunton and most likely <br>
by Waynesboro of which we will <br>
give you notice. Has Ma gotten<br>
home? and has she improved?<br>
Write to us soon. </p>
<p class="p10">As ever your son, </p>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> As Andrew observes, throughout May the company requested
to be brought into service.
Virginia's Governor John Letcher
finally called the Liberty Hall Volunteers to action on June 2, 1861 and
ordered them to
proceed to Harper's Ferry, where the Valley forces were mobilizing.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a>
When the Liberty Hall Volunteers company was formed in April of 1861,
Professor Alexander Nelson assumed the role of captain, but he was forced
to resign in June because he contracted erysipelas (Bean 7, 9, 11).
James White, a professor of Greek at Washington College, was
commissioned as a
Captain when Company I was organized on June 2, 1861.  Because he was
thirty-two at the time that he became a captain, White was nicknamed
"Old Zeus." He resigned on September
6, 1861 due to illness (see Turner).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> Andrew Brooks may be referring to the fighting
that broke out near Hampton Roads, Virginia on May 18, 1861 (Denney, 44).
Harper's Ferry was a crucial site during the Civil War, not only because
it was formerly a Federal arsenel, but because it was "the northern gateway to the
Valley of Virginia" (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 4).
On April 18, 1861, even before Virginia seceded from the union,
Virginia militia members took control of Harper's Ferry in order to win possession
of the arsenel. Andrew's speculations demonstrate how rumors
were swirling in the early days
of the war.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> Classes at Washington College were suspended on June 1
(Turner, 39).
