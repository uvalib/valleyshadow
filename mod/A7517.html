<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dec 4th /66</p>
<p class="p10">Buffalo Forge</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Miss Sibert</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter by your Papa, and was very much pleased to hear from you,
                    as we missed you very much.</p>
<p class="p10">Well the "<i>[unclear: Potoss]</i> mine," has proved a grand thing, and Mr.
                    Sibert says the best opening for <i>[unclear: Barytes]</i>, he has ever seen.
                    He dined with us to day, and desires me to say that he will not return, until he
                    can realise a pocket full, and that the finding of this new bed of mineral, will
                    detain him three weeks at least over his allotted
                    time He is in <u>jubilant</u>
                    <u>spirits</u>, and has invited Nan and myself to visit the
                    mine this week: he has five or six miners, and is throwing out<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the
                    mineral beautifully. Nan will answer your letter very soon, she begs to be remembered to you. Sadie, Min and Ellie send a kiss.
                    Rex &amp; Miller have removed their <u>entire</u>
                    <u>stock</u> of dry goods &amp;c, in the store house on
                    this place, over the creek. Will is as much devoted to his store as ever, and is
                    as <u>lively</u> as ever.</p>
<p class="p10">There have been several weddings around us since you left, Nan attended quite a
                    large wedding party at Fancy Hill, and expects to attend one at Botetout next
                    week. We have been confined pretty closely to the house, the roads have been too
                    heavy to make riding pleasant, and as to walking--you
                    know how much we do of that.</p>
<p class="p10">Our Sewing Machine has proved a treasure, and we<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>have been kept pretty
                    busy with it, and have accomplished a great deal with it. I have been writing
                    several letters, and I believe ought to write as many more this evening, so as I
                    have nothing very interesting to tell you, will make my letter very short. Nan
                    will write you after the wedding of next week is over. Much love in which Nan
                    joins from </p>
<p class="p10">your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Emma W. Brady</i></p>
<p class="p10">I saw Mrs Cupp last evening after she returned from her
                        fathers, says he is doing well but is weak and very much fatigued from
                        travelling Mr. Hites limb was taken off at the knee. The
                        amputation was done in Washington City. Mrs Cupp says he does not seem to
                        suffer any pain<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Dear Sister, I found Ma &amp; the children all
                        well. I was almost frozen when I got home. Old Mt Solon
                        looks horrible. I wish I had stayed in Bridgewater.
                        I would have stayed But I knew what work I had to
                        do at <u>home</u>. This letter was here when I returned.
                        Have you sent for your clothes that I left at Mrs Whites? You must not get
                        home sick it will not be long till the Captain will come home &amp; Cousin David will
                        bring you home. Had Ella heard from home lately her father was hurt at the
                        oil wells and had to have his leg amputated They have brought him home
                        &amp; I suppose is doing well<br> Mrs. Cupp went up this morning to see
                        him. She says she don't want Ella to know it yet a while But I think she
                        ought to know it she must hope for the best &amp; not distress her self
                        too much. If he was in much danger they could not have moved him home. He
                        has much in his favor the cold weather &amp; many other
                        favors. Try &amp; cheer Ella up this is a duty we owe
                        to our fellow creatures. You must not get the blues your self. I haven't
                        time to write any more. All send love to you &amp; Ella kiss the babe
                        for me Good
                        bye<br> Truly your sister<br>Rennie<br>David please
                        give this to Sister Mary</p>
