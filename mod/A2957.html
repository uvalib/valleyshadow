<p class="p10">Again I attempt to write you a few lines with the earnest hope that I may soon
                    hear something from you it has now <i>[added: been]</i>
                    nearly four months since I have heard one word from you so long &amp;
                    anxiously have looked for a letter from <i>[added: you]</i>
                    that I have all most despaired of ever hearing from you again. I often fear that
                    something serious has happened or that it <i>[added: is]</i> possible
                    that I <i>[added: am]</i> now writing to the dead. I truly
                    hope &amp; pray that the sad thought is incorrect you know not <u>my dear friend</u> what
                    anxiety of mind I have experienced since you have been so long silent. I have
                    had all sort of imaginations but can come to no conclusion. I earnestly hope now
                    to hear from you &amp; have all fully explained or if I have lost my dear
                    friend Kate &amp; this letter is read by her dear parents any surviving friend that they will speedily favor me with a letter that would bear to me sad sad

                    child of God. That it has drawn out my fondest attachments for you are such. I
                    will not write much more. if you are yet alive (&amp; God grant you may be)
