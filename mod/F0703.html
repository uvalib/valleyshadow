<p class="p10">June 18th 1861.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Henry:-</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 16th was<br> received in due time, which found <i>[added: me]</i> wa<i>[illeg.]</i><i>[added: iting]</i><br>
     and also well and hearty with a good<br> appetite. The troops have all left<br> here but one
     Regiment <i>[added:  and that had left too]</i> so that our town is
     coming<br> back to its former quietness, but false reports
     and<br> rumors are in great abundance, and correct reports<br> are very scarce. But as I enjoyed Saturday<br> evening with its scenes and a mess of
     strawberries<br> I will commence a description, if I should not<br> get it finished in this
     letter, look for the balance<br> in the next, so here goes. </p>
<p class="p10"> The boisterous winds of noonday had died away and given<br> place to the gentler zephyrs of
     a delightful June<br> evening. The intervening clouds, which had emerged in<br> mountain like
     masses, from the Western horizon had<br> dispelled the scorching rays of that luminary,
     which<br> was gently sinking in the western sky and all was calm<br> and serene, save the
     evening notes of a few joyous 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/BitCre4b.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/BitCre4b.gif"></center></a><br><br> birds whose carols seemed sweetened
     by the quiet &amp;<br> beauty of the surrounding landscape. Indeed nature was<br> gently wrapping herself in her most gorgeous robes<br> of
     beauty, while the odors of a thousand flowers had<br> filled the air with their sweet perfume.
      And thus<br> while my mind was straying in unknown channels contemplating the magnificence and glory of surrounding<br>
     nature, a sound from the distance fell upon my ears<br> which by its unrivaled powers for
     engulfing the mind in<br> paroxyms of unconsciousness, had so enlarged my former conception of instrumental music, that the perpendicular of
      astonishment fell outside the base of consciousness and
      consequently submerged my powers of reason in a "ker
     splash," how<br> I extricated myself from the strong embrace of that fit<br> of ecstasies, could only be told by a scrutinizing observer,<br> however,
     when reason again returned I found myself<br> journeying towards that place from whence
     proceeded those bewitching strains of music, soon I was
     standing in the suburbs of a very splendid little city, the
     appearance of which<br> was quite picturesque of itself, and grotesque when compared<br> with
     the cities of the country. This modern city is about<br> one-half of a mile in length and
     about one-eighth of a<br> mile in breadth having a population of about 3,000 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="/papers/images/BitCre4c.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/BitCre4c.gif"></center></a><br><br> inhabitants; the dwellings were of uniform size, the<br> largest
     being a little more spacious than the smallest<br> and the
     smallest being somewhat less in dimensions than<br> the largest, with streets leading along
     every side of the dwellings; and running either straight or
     crooked from <i>[added: the]</i> one end<br> to the other side so
     that strangers could amuse themselves by<br> turning as many times as there is differences of
     direction. </p>
<p class="p10"> The architecture was of the latest style being neither<br> Grecian nor Gothic but a style
     of necessity. The roofs<br> of <i>[deleted: which]</i><i>[added: the houses]</i> were shingled with canvas, and the end of
     those<br> that were not round were neatly lapboarded with canvas<br> the roofs of some reached so near the ground that the ground<br> came in contact with
     the roofs, while with others the roofs<br>
     came in close conjunction with the earth, but others had a<br> partition wall of about 3 feet
     in height, this wall being of<br> solid masonry, the material of which was canvas, served to<br> point out the dimensions of the edifice by plainly distinguishing the outside from the inside of the
     structure, but I<br> would have you also remember that where the eve of the roof<br> reached
     the ground, there was no such wall, but in all<br> such cases the roof separated the inside
     from the outside<br> so that there still remained an inside and outside
     to<br> every temple. These buildings for convenience could not be 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="/papers/images/BitCre4d.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/BitCre4d.gif"></center></a><br><br> surpassed the door being just at the place of entrance and<br>
     after becoming <i>[deleted: iniated]</i>initiated into the presence of the<br> occupants of
     the building and wishing to leave, you will<br> always find the door just at the place where
     you <i>[added: come out]</i>
     <i>[deleted: entered]</i>,<br> and if your company has been burthensome to the inmates<br>
     of the house, you'll find no difficulty in leaving.<br> Among all
     the Ancient and Modern <i>[added: cities]</i> of the world
     perhaps<br> none were so well adapted <i>[deleted: to the]</i>in a point of convenience, to the wants of the aged and infirm, there
     being<br> but one apartment in each dwelling in which were<br> found all the necessaries for
     house cookery, with the couch<br> on which to rest the weary head, which was usually
     placed<br> upon the soft earth, and in the left corner of the<br> room was the clerk's desk
     at which all the business<br> of the family is transacted, these halls are large and<br>
     spacious while one person is occupying them, and<br> small and
     precious while six or seven, the usual<br> number in a family, were
     enjoying the luxuries of<br> their table. </p>
<p class="p10">Fashion was carried to a state of perfection among<br> the inhabitants of this place, our
     eastern cities may<br> boast of their fashionable ladies and gents, but must<br> not attempt
     to compete with this city of these latter </p>
