<p class="p10">Sunday Eve - <br> Feby 2nd 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Lollicoffer</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Annie</p>
<p class="p10"> I will take this opportunity of answering your welcome note sent in <u>Buck's</u> note, which I received several days since. I
                    would have answered it sooner, but we were expecting to move our camp every day
                    &amp; I thought perhaps that it would be some satisfaction to you to know
                    where we would be <i>[illeg.]</i> in the future, so I put it off until the present. Well I suppose I can tell you where
                    our winter quarters will be now. We are encamped about 3 Miles from Winchester,
                    on what is called the "<i>[unclear: Pear]</i>town" road. We have been engaged
                    for two or three days putting up huts. not withstanding this is the Sabbath, a great many of our men worked all day at them.
                    some building, some chopping &amp; others dragging logs.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> All seem to be anxious to get in to their new
                    homes. I have nothing much, worth relating about our trip to Bath &amp;
                    Romney except to say that we had a hard time of it. It rained &amp; snowed
                    nearly every day during our entire march - which was
                    about 26 days. But I suppose Buck has given you all the news worth relating.
                    from the time he joined us in Romney up to the present; so I'll not trouble you
                    with it again. I was greatly in <i>[unclear: hopes]</i> that I would get home
                    soon to see <u>you</u> &amp; all the rest of my friends
                    but it is a settled fact now, that this privilege will be denied - unless I
                    reenlist. Well I think I can stand <i>[unclear: through]</i> my time out.
                    &amp; then I will make a strenuous effort to get there. With this, I will
                    close for the present hoping that I may <u>still</u>
                    <u>hear</u>
                    <u>from</u>
                    <u>you</u>. Yours truly.</p>
<p class="p10">In haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Tony P.</i></p>
<p class="p10">excuse this short note as it is the half of my paper
                        &amp; I have two other letters to answer. I expect to go to town to <i>[deleted: ]</i> for the lecture. - &amp; I will get one <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        so that I will be prepared betting for the future.
                            Sam sends his love.</p>
