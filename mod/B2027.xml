                <p>In declining an offer of transfer to Southampton, Jackson launches into a
                    personal political manifesto, expressing his views on the current political
                    situation, the prospect of black suffrage, and the relations between whites and
                    blacks. He writes, "I want the fullest equality for all men before the law but
                    am opposed to attempting to mix oil and water, black and white in one homogenous
                    social mass because it cannot be done." He also expresses his belief in the
                    importance of widespread education for ensuring the stability of society.</p>

                </opener>

                <p>On receipt of your "personal" note I write to Richmond expressing my willingness
                    to go to Southampton so soon as I could settle up any registration and other
                    accounts here. Since I have thought over the matter carefully and I am not sure
                    if a Bureau agency is a good "stepping stone" and unless the majority of
                    freedmen <unclear>is</unclear> decided it might happen that le jeu ne vaut par
                    la chandelle. Is there no really good resident loyal citizen? and how about the
                    politics of the colored men. I am not disposed to run things into the ground to
                    admit color as either a qualification or disqualification or that we owe such a
                    debt of gratitude to the freedmen that we must <unclear>denigrate</unclear> our
                    own privileges. Our difficulties, and they are serious, arise almost in toto
                    from making the rights and wrongs of <pb n="2"/>the freedmen our staple doctrine
                    political. The ignoramuses in the convention have done an incalculable injury
                    and it is hard to say who is most to blame the <unclear>Hodges</unclear>
                    &amp;c or the <unclear>Hannicatts Bowdens</unclear> &amp;c who hope to
                    "tool" the colored votes to northern individual <unclear>s--cents</unclear> into
                    Governorships &amp;c We must put the brains of the party in the lead or we
                    shall upset all I fear. I am positive on these few points. I want to "make the
                    traitors take back seats in the work of reconstruction"
                    (<unclear>order</unclear> A. Johnson) I want intelligence &amp; integrity as
                    well as loyalty in office. I want the fullest equality for all men before the
                    law but am opposed to attempting to mix oil and water, black and white in one
                    homogenous social mass, because it cannot be done and I want education so
                    general and placed on such a solid foundation that <unclear>each</unclear>
                    resolution cannot overthrow it, for depend upon it an ignorant constituency is
                    almost always a venal constituency and colored suffrage may prove a dangerous
                    privilege when it is subjected to the <pb n="3"/>proof of rebel bribery.
                    Gratitude is not over developed in any freedman I have yet met and when they
                    think they have secured all Republicans can give a few acres of waste land will
                    do wonders. But let education become general and thorough and we have a
                    guarantee of safety.</p>

                <p>Do you differ much with me? and can you give me any light which may be of
                    service? If so, please say. A.J. made a bold bid for the Democratic nomination
                    but I fear even this poor Judas reward will not be doled out to him. Martyrdom
                    has had its day of grand results, and political martyrdom is very poor stock in
                    which to invest in 1868.</p>
