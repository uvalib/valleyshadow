<p class="p10">I once more seat myself to
                    write you a few lines to let you know that, i am well and hope these few lines
                    may find you all enjoying the same blessing of god, well, i have been looking
                    for Brother James since last saturday but he has not
                    came yet i was sure he would get here today, he may
                    come yet this evening for it is only one oclock, Bill Anderson came a few
                    minutes ago so did Hugh Adams,</p>
<p class="p10">Well after i commenced writing Hugh handed me a
                    letter from you &amp; Sarah &amp; J. Horn, i was glad to hear that you
                    all are well Hugh says if James started yesterday morning he won't get here until
                    tomorrow, we have had some very rough weather, last sabbath night
                    was very rough, i never heard heavier thunder nor seen sharper thunder in my
                    life it rained very hard till
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    midnight and then got very cold, I was Corporal of the guard that night. there is still some snow here yet the roads are
                    awful bad, we are getting along very well we have good quarters and plenty to
                    eat now it was for one week that we did not get any meat only what we bought our mess bought one side
                    of bacon and it cost us four dollars and thirty cents
                    apiece it was seventy five cents a pound we have the
                    half of it yet and the side that Jacob Anderson brought with him we are getting
                    plenty of beef again it is dried beef nearly all
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        rounds
                    ]</i> it is about right to make good steak, I can
                    beat the woman frying steak we get plenty sugar and
                    rice but we don't use the rice i wish i had a chance to send it home, </p>
<p class="p10">John Kirkpatrick &amp; Davy Dice started home on furlough yesterday i don't want to go til we get our horses we have drawed
                    dried beef to do us till the middle of April so i think about that time we will get our horses. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> i got a letter from brother William
                    yesterday he wrote it the 10 &amp; the 11 he is well he wrote very little it is not worth reading i will send it to you, I
                    reckon you have a big time going going to old bucks to singing, I did not think
                    you would go up there you had better come out to our singing some night and you
                    will hear something that is worth listening at, well
                    we just heard that Captain Lackey has got home i hope
                    it is true and the rest of the boys will get home soon, we have preaching every
                        sabbath in camp, i think our Chaplain is a fine man his name is Crook, i believe, i have no more
                    news to write so i will close for this evening.
                        please give my love to all the friend that think
                        worthwhile of inquiring after me, i hope these few lines will find you all well write
                    soon and give me all the news tell Cousin John I will
                    write to him soon, i would like very much to send my old boots and a shirt home
                    tell mother i would <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> like for her to make me a saddle blanket if she
                    can i have not had my comfort <i>[deleted: on]</i>
                    since i came out i have most too
                    many clothes now but i don't
                    think we will leave here til we come home for our horses this leaves me well, i
                    will write as soon as James comes out, i remain your brother
                    till death so goodbye to all
                    and may god bless and watch over you all is my sincere
                    prayer. </p>
