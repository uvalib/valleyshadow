<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 17t 66</p>
<p class="p10">Office of Superintendent
                            Education</p>
<p class="p10">Fellow-workers:</p>
<p class="p10">Not having the pleasure of your personal acquaintance, I address all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your November school report through the office of Captain Lacey Superintendent
                    7th District has reached me, and has some things in
                    it "hard to be understood." Your day school is reported as having 233 male
                    pupils 183 female, 416 total during the month of Nov. yet the average attendance
                    is given as "0". So the night school has an aggregate of 241 (which must be an
                    overwhelming number for five teachers) and 0 is given as the average attendance.
                    "No. of pupils enrolled" and "average attendance" are the two most important
                    points of information required.</p>
<p class="p10">Again your report shows 48 in Alphabet 142 in easy lessons and 45 in higher
                    readers making 235 in all. Where are the balance of the 416? All the scholars
                    are supposed to be reading somewhere.</p>
<p class="p10">Sympathizing deeply with you in your trying but noble work.</p>
<p class="p10">I am very Respectfully<br>Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>R.M. Manly<br>Superintendent
                    Education</i></p>
