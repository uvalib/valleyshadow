<p class="p10">January 27. 57.</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Harrisburg
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I arrived today about 3 o'clock, &amp; found E. extremely ill.-- At one time
                    this afternoon, before my arrival, it was thought she was dying; but she rallied
                    a little.- She thinks, &amp; so said, that she would not die until probably
                    tomorrow. She has a marvelous knowledge of her symptoms &amp; the extent of
                    her strength. She &amp; the rest -- the children especially -- were very
                    glad to see me, &amp; appear comforted by my presence. Mr. Briggs, Mr. Orth
                    &amp; many others are assiduous in their attentions. All their wants are
                    supplied so far as they can be. The Doctor said this
                    evening about tea time that she might go off suddenly or might linger a day or
                    two. She is entirely resigned &amp; composed. The change within the past two
                    weeks is very great, &amp; startled me when I saw it. The seal of Death is
                    upon her now.-- She has lost her voice almost, but her mind is as clear
                    &amp; active as ever. I am going <i>[unclear: around]</i> there to stay, as
                    she requests.-- Mr. Wallace is pretty well, as the rest are.--</p>
<p class="p10">It began to rain on us about Petersburg, but Captain
                    Irwin bought an umbrella, &amp; I did not get <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>wet. The ride is
                    not agreeable, as the roads are in bad condition. I expect to return the other
                    route, taking the morning train &amp; reaching home by tea time.-- I cannot
                    say when I will start.-- We had several passengers, &amp; several others
                    came on in a chartered machine.-- All could not be carried on our sleigh.-- I
                    forgot to bring your cloak, which is at George's hanging up.-- I did not need
                    it, but would have brought it if it had not escaped my memory.</p>
<p class="p10">The Governor &amp; Mr. Curtin are absent, but are
                    expected tomorrow <i>[deleted: afternoon]</i> evening.-- My friends are in
                    good spirits, but I had heard little. I meet some of them in a few moments.-- 17
                    Senators <i>[added: I learn]</i> have signed a remonstrance
                    against the reappointment of Mr. Dewitt; and the Governor is said to have mentioned that if he does not renominate him, he
                    will not nominate any citizen of Harrisburg; which, if true, will rule out Reverend Mr. Colder. But in a few days the <i>[deleted: ]</i> will be resolved. Fortunately, I am prepared for either result
                    -- Give my love to Mother &amp; Charles &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Edward</i></p>
