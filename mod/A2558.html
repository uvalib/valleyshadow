<p class="p10">Sunday, Oct -- 12<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Near Bartonsville -- Frederick Co. Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Little Wife:</p>
<p class="p10"> I have, today, been spending a quiet Sunday in the country, at a farmhouse, where I have had
     a good fire to sit by, a good book to read, three good meals to eat and quite a number of
     pleasant people to talk to, therefore you will say I may well have been very well satisfied
     with myself &amp; everybody else -- &amp; so I have been, the only bar being that two
     of the children of mine host have the scarlet fever, that dreadful disease, and are suffering
     from it much, but are doing very well, and secondly, indigestion troubled me some, my own
     fault, from eating or drinking too much after eating &amp; drinking too little. The day is
     spent &amp; now, after retiring to my room, I must write you a few lines, though I have not
     heard from you for some time, owing to my scouting propensities of late, and not being much in
     camp -- I have been spending two days on the memorable Kernstown battle field, mapping it
     &amp; the vicinity. It was the first real battle field of The Valley, and, therefore, aside
     from its other memories, it has a peculiar interest to the dwellers <u>between</u> the mountains. I traced with sad interest the wondrous line of march of one
     regiment that regarded not the fire of artillery, but went on to its post of duty, and the
     position of another that met &amp; repulsed the pursuing foe &amp; by one dreadful
     volley sent a hundred of them to eternity and let but one of its <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> own brave lads
     accompany them to the judgement bar to tell why it had thus sent them there I gazed long upon
     the bloody ground where the fight raged so hotly for the possession of the stonewall &amp;
     where at least 500 Yankees poured out their life's blood for no good reason but a vain effort
     to subdue us -- but I hope to be able to show you the finished map and tell you of the
     incidents I have heard from many mouths -- It has been cold and rainy and I have not had a very
      <u>pleasant</u> time, but I have been well housed at night &amp; well
     fed and therefore have been better off than many of my companions in arms -- and as I am very
     thankful to the God of all goodness and grace that his care has been such for one --</p>
<p class="p10">I today saw a gentleman from <i>[unclear: Moorefield]</i>, an uncle of the Moslin boys, he
     says they are well, have been working on the farm at home -- Mr. Moslin stays on the farm
     nearer the Valley as he wishes, to have a good start if the Yankees get after him as he is a
     cripple -- The paroled Rich Mt. men of Hardy are now gathered at McDowell under the command of
     Capt <i>[unclear: Momare]</i> Imboden wants to get them for his force -- he has done good
     service -- he made a dash and destroyed a Railroad bridge a few days
     ago &amp; burned many stores, capturing some prisoners, the
     Yankees got after his wagons, led by a union man, and took them while he was gone, burning two,
     but he retook the others. Gen. spoke of him in high terms. He was at my tent a few days ago
     &amp; brought the Spectator -- it looks oddly -- I shall probably go to Winchester tomorrow
     if it does not rain, and shall then strike up the Valley again in pursuit of information --
     where I may stop is more than I can now tell. I hear many things, once out of camp, about
     Stuart's going into Pennsylvania, an advance of the Army &amp;c
     but I do not attach any credit to it, for I only left Thursday noon &amp; all was quiet
     then -- but good night -- <i>[unclear: D.V.]</i> I will write in the morning</p>
<p class="p10"> Monday Morning -- It is still raining and I am remaining in the house waiting for a change
     of weather to enable me to continue my ride -- Every thing quiet but the moan of the wind --
     and the thought that will intrude as to when the war will end, peace come to us with all our
     rights secured and each one be permitted to sit down under his own vine &amp; fig tree
     &amp; enjoy a quiet life -- such weather as this inclines one to such thoughts I have hired
     the sending of my bundle to Staunton &amp; hope it has gone -- I have a pair of shoes for
     Allen in my saddle bags -- hope to get them to him soon -- Excuse my short letter -- I am dull
     &amp; cannot write -- Love to all -- Kiss the babies -- they must be good -- Allen must do
     all he can -- to merit good shoes</p>
<p class="p10"> God bless you all -- write often -- </p>
<p class="p10">your Affectionate husband</p>
