<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    December 20, 185x<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure writes to Slifer about negotiations over Curtin's possible resignation as
                    Commonwealth Secretary.</p>

<p class="p10">December 20</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel-</p>
<p class="p10">Yours is at hand, and I am grateful for the trouble you have taken in the matter.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard from Sellers yet, but likely will tomorrow. He means to try and get Curtin to consent to an arrangement
                    whereby there shall be an appointment for Secretary say till Spring, and there
                    is a possibility that he will do so. If not, I shall be perfectly content,
                    though I do hope that he will then withdraw from the field for Senator.</p>
<p class="p10">Kunkel did not see Johnston in Philadelphia, and he does not know when he will
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>be at Pittsburgh. If I understand out business there, we want to
                    see Johnston more than any other man, and we must not go until it is certainly
                    ascertained that he is there. I wrote to Kunkel to let me know when he goes
                    home, and we will follow him as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall of course make it a point to go to Pittsburgh with Killinger &amp;
                    Kunkel, unless I should in the mean time be in <i>[unclear: ]</i> by Curtin's
                    resignation, of which there now seems little probability.</p>
<p class="p10">Keep me advise of the progress of matters, and I will do likewise. I seen
                    communications to the city paper on Monday.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Colonel
                            Eli Slifer
