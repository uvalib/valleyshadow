<p class="p10">December 22<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to let you know that I am still on the land of
     the living I received your kind note mailed the 16<sup>th</sup> of this month was glad to
      hear from you <i>[unclear: 
      especially
     ]</i> to hear that you were well hope
     this may find you still enjoyingthe same great blessings here on earth I wroteyou a note before this since I came from the valley do not
      knowwhether you got it or not, also <i>[deleted: ]</i> to Pa received one from Pa the same time I did yours
     tell him was glad to hear from him will answer it soon. Dear Giney
     you don't
     know how glad I am to hear from you writeme whenever you can tell me all you can
      think<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">In my last note I wrote that I was not well the water in this part of
     the country causes me to have the diarrhea but I am in hopes i will
     get use to it by and by since last writing to you we have moved our camp a mile or two left the cabins we were
     in at that time and are building for ourselves will soon be ready to go
     in them the weather is very cold
     here
     today a good shelter would be very acceptable
     now I am free to acknowledge that I do not like this country no way it can be mixed up but if I must stay here I will make the best of it I can though I believe I am a little homesick by times but do not like to acknowledge it, but I hope all things will I work for the best<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> if it goes hard in this world and we
     should be so happy as to reach a better world
     here after the change will be the greater we will appreciate it more O for Grace from above to be
     prepared to meet our God at his coming
     then all will be well little <i>[unclear: ods]</i> from where we are called to go I pray the Lord to give me a will submissive to his come what may I know he directs all things,
     and I am thankful that he do for there is no other power able to do it
     right</p>
<p class="p10">Well Giney I wish to say a word to you about something else. I
     suppose that is is my lot to stay here this winter for
     anything that I now can see I know no other
     chance I expect one of our company will be
     home on furlough in a few days<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I
      refer to Goloday he expects a furlough soon
     he promises to try to bring me something to eat if he starts in a
     day or two I will send this by him should he come if you can send me anything I think you had better pack in a barrel send me some meat and flour some dried fruit then I can have some pies made
      here also some dry yeast to make raised bread and whatever
     else you think best also you may send me twenty or thirty Dollars in
     money I know it will be
     troublesome to you to send this barrel but it will be good to me</p>
<p class="p10">Well I must stop for this time hoping the Lord may bless you with a happy Christmas though I am not with you</p>
<p class="p10">as ever yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John P. Dull</i></p>
