<h4>Franklin County: John B. McPherson to Edward
                    McPherson, December 29, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>John B. McPherson tells his uncle, Edward McPherson, of the local newspaper, an
                    unfortunate sleigh ride, a Good Templars convention, and "Extra Billy Smith" in
                    Congress.</p>

<p class="p10">December 29<sup>th</sup>, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Sidney</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Uncle,</p>
<p class="p10">The paper, which you sent me; has been received and read. I like it very well
                    &amp; will soon send you a paper, published here <i>[deleted: eveery]</i>
                    every Friday, the merit of which you may find yourself. It is a Republican
                    paper, entitled the "Sidney Journal." I took a sleigh-ride tonight, and while a good ways from town, it began to rain, and the
                    consequence was we got wet through and through. And to complete the chapter of
                    our misfortunes, it began to freeze. By the time we reached home, we were both
                    as stiff as icicles. I immediately changed my clothes and hope I have <i>[added: escaped]</i> any bad effects, which might have
                    resulted from the wetting. The "Cincinnati Daily Gazette" gives bad accounts of the doings in Congress, especially of
                    "Extra Billy Smith." I hope I may hear no bad accounts of you or I shall be
                    tempted to think that are as bad as Congressmen generally are.</p>
<p class="p10">Last night the Good Templars held a Convention, as it <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>was called,
                    which was free to every person. Several persons spoke on the good effects of the
                    Society, and also for the cause of Temperance. It was very interesting to me at
                    least.</p>
<p class="p10">The scarlet fever is still in town and there are a few new cases. The <i>[deleted: nen]</i> new bell for our church has arrived and is in <i>[deleted: rogress]</i> progress of being hung. It will probably be up
                    before next Sunday. I play checkers during this vacation with the other boys, to
                    pass away the time, which would otherwise hang heavily on my hands, as there is
                    no skating worth anything. With my best <i>[unclear: respects]</i> to all my
                    friends in Gettysburg, which I expect you to send to them, when you write again.
                    I remain</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate nephew</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John B. McPherson</i></p>
