                    an apology for my long delay I was prevented from writing sooner by sickness in
                    my family the children have had the diptheria James Samuel has been quite poorly
                    for better than a week indeed his recovery was thought very doubtful but is now
                    improving &amp; two of our neighbors children have died with it &amp; I
                    had to be in attendance there so you see I have not had much time for writing. I
                    got Johnnie one shirt knit &amp; it took twelve cuts to knit it &amp; it
                        weighed but half a pound when it was done so you may
                    know what I think of it when you only took three for yours. I was sorry indeed
                    to hear of your Grandmother's death give my love to your Mother &amp; the
                    girls I wish you still to write to me when you hear from Charlie tell your Pa
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the leather which I spoke of for him Mr. Roadcap has never come
                    across any suitable for a collar as he is busy working for the government - we
                    had a great fire in our neighborhood Mrs Sloans house caught fire on Sunday week
                    &amp; from it Mrs. Bears house caught &amp; some other buildings thereby
                    consuming some ten buildings, the fire originated from the black woman making on
                    too great a fire a sad disaster indeed you will have to excuse this short letter
                    as some company has come in &amp; I will have to close by desiring you to
                    write very soon &amp; often I remain</p>
