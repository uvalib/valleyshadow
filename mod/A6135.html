<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">being at leisure this morning I thought to write you a line to let you know that I am well at present hoping this may find you enjoying the same blessing I have written to you lately but
      know not whether you will get it or not owing to the uncertainty of the mail, I am
     glad to be able to say that my health is better than it has been for some time, we have moved our quarters since
     the raid in the valley if you get the last I wrote you it will inform you of it if not you will hear the
      particulars soon I like this place better than the one we left except the quarters and they are not so bad as they might
     be I bought a first-rate tent for our mess
     yesterday so that we are pretty well fixed for soldiers I gave
     fifty Dollars for the tent, so that it has taken the most of my money, if you have a chance I
     wish you would send me some more, if you see no chance To send by hand -send a small sum in a
     <br>letter at a time<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I do not care for a little confederate if it will add
     any thing to my comfort I have some money
     loaned to some of the boys they cannot pay until the government pays them the company is out of money at this time in most
     cases many of them have not one cent so you may know it is no hard matter to loan or give out money Well Giney I
     have no news to write you of importance except Baylor is at the hospital with the measels Swartzel is also at the
      hospital so there is but five of us left in the mess This is very
      windy
     weather
     here the sand flies in a hurry it is quite disagreeable, I will write soon again
     if I am spared with health and strength will try to give you more
      news next time hoping to hear from you soon I close for this time</p>
<p class="p10">This I expect to send with a man by the name of Reevs he is going home
     on furlough he lives near mossy creek,</p>
<p class="p10">the Lord bless you and take care of you is the humble prayer
      of your affectionate husband</p>
