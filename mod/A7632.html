<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, July 28, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife worried that his last letter may not have gone
                    through. He discusses hotel business, Freddy's happiness and activities, and
                    mutual acquaintances. He sends an inventory of supplies he needs, and asks that
                    they be shipped.</p>
