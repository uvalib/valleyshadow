                <p>We are no doubt preparing for an important movement - 3 days rations to be put
                    into Haversacks - the enemy are not very far off - but we believe have fallen
                    back - May God give us a great victory &amp; preserve me to you &amp; my
                    child - I am in command of the Brigade - feel my inability for such a
                    responsible position &amp; rely only on heaven for wisdom &amp; strength
                    in the discharge of my Duties -</p>

                <p>All of the fellow officers present in the brigade and the Captain of batteries
                    signed a most complimentary petition to have me made Brig<hi rend="super">d</hi>
                    &amp; Gen Jackson expressed regret that he did not know the wish of the
                    Brigade and the he could not sign the papers - he had signed a letter on behalf
                    of another person - you know I had told<pb n="2"/> you before that I had told
                    Gen Jackson I did not want promotion - Gen Jackson told them to send the
                    petition to Richmond which they they did - I believe fully that my own conduct
                    &amp; <unclear>reservation</unclear> with Gen Jackson stopped my promotion -
                    I have no regrets so far as my judgement is concerned, but of course my ambition
                    is like everybody's. Gen A.P. Hill I understand wrote a complimentary
                    recommendation.</p>

                <p>Say to father that my friends may do as they choose in this matter - To know that
                    I am considered worth of so high a position is certainly a compliment long to be
                    cherished. Harman I am satisfied cannot get it. <lb/>
                </p>

                <p>I had jacques with me yesterday - we are lying quite close together and no doubt
                    will be near together in the fight may a kind Providence protect us both.</p>

                <p>I hope you &amp; Lottie both with all at home are well - I do not feel well -
                    but must keep <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> not to be sick again. Love to all -</p>
