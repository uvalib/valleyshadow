<p class="p10">Jan 4<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Winder</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter yesterday dated the thirty first &amp; now hasten to answer it. I
     am well with the exception of a cold which is nothing new. There is no news of importance
     except that there was a slight stir in camp yesterday in consequence of a rumored advance of
     the enemy but it appears to have subsided now General Stuart has made another dash around the

      prisoners, two hundred wagons, and destroyed five days rations for the Yankees.
     Christmas &amp; New Years day passed off quietly with us. We had a great variety on the
     table for our christmas dinner<i>[deleted: s]</i> the breakfast consisted of beef steak &amp; bread, dinner was bread &amp; Roast Beef,
     &amp; supper out of what was left <i>[deleted: for]</i> at breakfast. To give you an
     idea of what we have to pay for little extras I will mention the price of a few articles.
     Apples are selling at from $1.50 to two dollars a dozen, Ginger Bread 3 cakes for a dollar,
     Butter two dollars a pound, sausage 1.50 per pound, dried apple pies that are baked in camp
     bring 75 cents and a dollar &amp; everything else is in proportion. There was but few of the men that could afford to get
     drunk this

      Christmas as Whiskey is selling at fifteen dollars a quart. During the last year we lost
     out of our brigade 1220 men in killed &amp; wounded no mention being made of those that
     died from disease the loss in our regiment was 400 almost one-third of the whole amount We marched over 1500 miles encountering the snows &amp;
     ice of Winter in the mountains of Morgan and hampshire. The miasma of summer in the swamps of
     Henrico &amp; Hanover Our bridgade numbers but 1200 muskets at the beginning of the present
     year. If I can obtain a copy of the order I will send it to you which contains a history of the
     past years campaign in few words. We are now fixed up
     pretty well having a little tent fixed up
     &amp; a chimney in it in which we do our cooking</p>
