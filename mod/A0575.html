<h4>Augusta County: John H. Cochran to His Mother,

<p class="p10">January 12<sup>th</sup> 61 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter is received. I will not trouble you with a long one in answer -- as I
                    expect to come up on Friday. I will bring up the things mentioned by you.</p>
<p class="p10">There is very little of the sort of news that you care to hear.</p>
<p class="p10">The house today passed a convention bill such as it is.
                    I do hope that it will be amended in the senate and not come before the people
                    the "namby pamby" affair it is now. </p>
<p class="p10">We have nothing new from Charlestown tonight. But I
                    expect there will be stirring times there in a day or
                    two. I think it more than probable the Star of the West is in the offing waiting for the Brooklyn who will take the troops
                    on board and attempt to force a passage to Sumter. If she does I pray God that the Carolinians may
                    be able to sink her with all on board. And wish most fervently that Scott was on
                    board to share their fate. He seems to have forgotten that he was (not is) a
                    Virginian.</p>
<p class="p10">All are well</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Son </p>
<p class="p10"><i>John H. Cochran </i></p>
