    <p>I am aware that Ephia is no more, but it cant be <orig reg="helped">helpt</orig>. I dreamed
     last Saturday night that I was home, and that Ephia was dying. There is an astrologer in our
     company and he told me that Ephia was dying when I was dreaming, and he also told me that you
     wrote a letter to me, and it got lost on the road coming. he also said that I would get a
     letter from you <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig> stating that Ephia was dead, and also that
     she got buried<pb n="2"/> on Monday the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi> inst.</p>

    <p>dear Sister, it is over two weeks since I had a letter from you but the astrologer told me
     that I would get a letter from you <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig>. I knew that there was
     something the wrong because I did not get no letter.</p>

    <p>Dear Sister if Ephia is dead, then the astrologer is a true man, I believe that, he told me
     the truth. if Ephia is dead let me know <orig reg="immediately">imeadiately</orig>. for I
     dreamed that I seen <orig reg="you">yous</orig>, all weeping and mourning, and I also was home
     in the house when she was dying. if my dream is true let me know it. I am well and in good
     health and I hope this will find you the same.</p>
