<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, January 4, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes to his wife to inform her that Captain Brown may arrive in
                    Martinsburg, and can help her move if she decides to bring the family to
                    Staunton. If she chooses not to come, he asks that she send supplies for the
                    hotel, and any goods in advance of a future move.</p>
