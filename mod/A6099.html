<p class="p10">Mr Smiley,</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse me for taking the liberty of answering your letter which we received this evening. Emma is not at home now and will not be for two or three weeks,
     she has gone back to <i>[illeg.]</i> our old home in Johnson County
     she has been gone about a week she will write when she returns. We heard from Hugh and the boys
     at Camp Chase a day or two ago they were well and in fine spirits Do you know anything
     about Jimmie Beard he is in prison somewhere I do not know where I think they came very near taking all the <i>[deleted: Va]</i> Virginians that time, but I hope they will be so kind as to release you all before
     long. Oh I.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley69b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley69b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      want to see Mary and Tishie so bad I dreamed the other night that
     I saw Mary I thought she was the most beautiful girl I ever saw, I suppose the little boys and
     girls that I used to know in Virginia have grown to be men and women I
     would like to see them so much If you ever write to Mary and Tishie tell them I am almost as
     large as Miss <u>Lizzie</u>
     <u>Echard</u>, Hugh used to laugh at me so much about being so large. If you
     are needing anything, money or clothing, <i>[deleted: we]</i>
     let us know and we will try and get them for you and if any of the boys who are with you need
      anything we will help them also. When you are released (and I
     hope our President will be so kind as to do that soon) you must write and let us know. Well I
     must close the candle gives very poor light</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon to Your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
      <u>Mattie E Hull.</u>
     </i></p>
<p class="p10">
      <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley69.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley69.gif"></center></a><br><br> P.S. I dont know whether this is directed right or not, Dr Jones
      is dead, he died in <i>[deleted: ro]</i>
      Rockport. perhaps his family is there, yet. <br> Mattie.</p>
