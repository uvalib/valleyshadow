<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 10th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Centreville Fairfax County
                            Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind and affectionate letter by Mr
                    Britton I was happy indeed to hear from you and to hear you were well with all the rest of your brothers and sisters. My health
                    is very good and hope when these
                    uninteresting lines come to hand you may be
                    enjoying the same with all the pleasure this poor world can afford. I have the
                    blues this morning and you must not expect as long a
                    letter as usual. Brother John &amp; Tom Graham got to disputing about a very
                    trifling matter. John was left out of his mess to get breakfast, and it not
                    being ready when we came off
                    of drill Graham commenced cursing John when he had been
                    swearing as John thought long enough he told him to
                    stop. Graham yanked up a stick and let him have it over
                    the face, at that moment the Captain
                    interfered &amp; sent Graham to the Guard
                    house. Captain told John when ever he got a chance to
                    give him a good whipping I am sorry the fuss
                    occurred but it can not be helped now. The Staunton band has came down to play for the regiment. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> We were marched out yesterday morning
                    to be reviewed by the prince Napoleon. There was two brigades making ten
                    or twelve regiments all drawn up in line of Battle it was a magnificent view. The Prince just passed along the road. I should have
                    liked to have seen him; Cousin Joseph R Brand was over the other day. I think he
                        wears the same old face he used to wear he seems to be a very kind &amp;
                    tender hearted young man he seems to be acquainted with young men all over the
                    State his school mates at College. We took dinner with one of his former Teachers he had a very
                    nice dinner such as Chicken pork and good light bread
                    &amp; blackberry
                    jam
                    which we used instead of butter. I renewed Jo's acquaintance with J.P.L. Jo. said he didn't know any in our company
                    but your Brother, Charles &amp; my self, he said he
                    never would have known me if I hadn't
                    laughed when I saw him. Jo.
                    was at fairfax Court house when the Yankees came on them &amp; they had to
                    retreat back to Bulls run. Another of our old school mates was to see us, William Weeb. You would not know him for he has such a
                    large beard &amp; mustache, he belongs to the Monticello Guards, has a very nice uniform. Weeb &amp; Cousin
                    Jo. both belong to Brigadier General <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    Cox's brigade. I have seen both my uncles since the great Battle of bulls run.
                    I shall now give you a short account of the Battle.</p>
<p class="p10">We received orders about the dawn of day to march
                    down to the run &amp; to charge on a battery near our breastworks; we had
                    been there an hour and a half when we recieved orders
                    to, Change our position we marched about three miles north our enemies had been cannonading us for sometime at
                    different points</p>
<p class="p10">at eight o'clock the attack became general. I can not
                        describe the firing
                    of small arms at nine o'clock our brigade was ordered
                    to the scene of slaughter on our way we met the Staunton
                    Artillery the men said they
                    were almost out of ammunition and were nearly surrounded.</p>
<p class="p10">We advanced in quick time to support the Washington
                    Artillery on the right which
                    done
                    excellent sevice in the engagement. We threw down a
                    fence and advanced a few paces and was ordered to lay
                    down and incessant fire was kept up by our enemies
                    for about ten or fifteen minutes. I believe if we had have raised up at one time
                    we would have all been wounded or killed the balls seemed to range about two
                    feet above the ground. The regiment in advance of us
                    fell back in confusion but on passing our line
                    immediately formed again. We then were
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> ordered to advance in quick time to the old <i>[unclear: home]</i>
                    we then laid down waiting orders to fire we beg<i>[added: ged]</i> our officers to let us fire at a regiment
                    on our right but they said they were our friends
                    &amp; would not let us fire on them. We then commenced firing at three or four Regiments in
                    front of us I gave them three rounds &amp; then we fell back some twenty or
                    thirty yards &amp; met another Regiment advancing
                    we went up with them some of our boys went on &amp; never stopped at all &amp; some had left before we went up
                    to the house I hollered at Sam two or three times
                        but he would not listen to me. When we went up the
                        second time that Regiment
                    on our right fired on us but with little effect we
                    returned their fire throwing them in to confusion for a
                    little while we all got behind the house &amp; corn crib fences &amp; every thing that would
                    shield us from their
                    Minie balls I got behind the crib and fired five times at them I looked round &amp; couldn't see any of our Regiment. They had fallen back to the woods I had
                    got mixed with a South Carolina
                    Regiment &amp; they were
                    now falling back I turned round and jumped over a dead man &amp; commenced
                        retreating to the woods. I couldn't find my own
                    Regiment or at least I did not hunt long for I came
                    upon the fourth Alabama Regiment and laid down
                        beside<i>[deleted: s]</i> my Uncle
                    William Mosley one of the men was
                    shot on the opposite side of Uncle
                    William from me the men seemed
                        greatly excited the most of their field officers was killed in the Battle Uncle
                    William was not touched
                    Uncle John was not there he
                    was sick in Winchester I reckon you was at the mountain with that large crowd of
                    Mr Brittons he said he kissed upwards of twenty ladies &amp; said he could
                    have kissed them all but he told them they were too willing &amp; he would not kiss any more. I
                    should like very much to come home for a few days but it is impossible at present I must bring this scrawl to a close asking an interest in
                    your prayers excuse all mistakes &amp; bad
                    writing.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon to your devoted friend.</p>
