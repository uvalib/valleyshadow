<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 27th 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stoneman</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Jennie</p>
<p class="p10">It has been so long since I heard from you but I believe I told you to direct
                    your last to my Regiment so I could not expect to receive it here when I wrote
                    last I expected to be sent to my Regiment - the next
                    day but we were sent to Camp <i>[unclear: Cadwalader]</i> where we stayed until
                    the 10<sup>th</sup> of April when we were sent to Alexandria and from
                    there back to this place again we are encamped on a high bluff on the Maryland
                    side of the Potomac and nearly half a mile from the river, we have a plain view
                    of Alexandria, Fairfax, Arlington, Georgetown, Washington, the long bridge<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and the navy yard besides almost innumerable camps on both sides of
                    the river.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been well contented here and would be willing to stay till the close of
                    the war but that is more than I have a right to expect we have everything very nice we have good tents and shade trees planted
                    among them, pretty uniforms and splended new Sabres as bright as steel can be
                    made and several good Brass Bands playing every day with the booming of the big
                    guns on the forts rendering this quite a military place, indeed, Jennie I am <u>quite</u>
                    <u>proud</u> of my situation it is splendid. I just wish you
                    could be here to see how nice soldiers can live there is a great contrast
                    between this and what we will soon have to see. We will get our orders in a few
                    days and when they are drilled we will go "to fill the vacant ranks of our
                    brothers gone before."<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">I must confess I was a little sorry to leave Philadelphia it is the best place I
                    ever found <u>in</u>
                    <u>some</u>
                    <u>respects</u>. I mean but there are some more <u>virtuous</u> places in the world (Sherman's dale for
                    example) we are not bothered with many lady <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> about here but it is said that a brick building on a hill about
                    two miles from here that was once the home of some aristocratic rebel is now the residence of half a score of very pretty young ladies: for my part I have not seen
                    them so I will not pass my judgement upon them.</p>
<p class="p10">It is my business now to learn how to handle the instruments of death so that my
                    life will not have to go as the price of my ignorance. I have a good sword and
                    intend to make good use of it. The rebels have lately been commiting some
                    horrible wholesale murders among our soldiers<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and now "<u>revenge</u>" shall be our motto. there are more than forty thousand Yankee soldiers pass Washington this week
                    and where they go there will be something down there has been an almost
                    continual stream of soldiers crossing the long bridge for several days and they
                    are not all over yet I think that from present appearances we will soon be able
                    to write that lovely word peace with the heart blood of rebellion.</p>
<p class="p10">Now Jennie I hope you will excuse me for not being more interesting this time for
                    I am a little inclined to be lazy this afternoon
                    my tent mates are all out on guard and I am alone; the weather is very warm and
                    the trees begin to look green. Indeed Jennie I really wished myself back in
                    Perry County some of these pretty moonlit nights last week but I must quit and
                    go to my supper. Give my love to all the rest of your family and believe me as
                    ever</p>
