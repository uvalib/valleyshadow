                <p>This will be my farewell letter from the Village of hills. If I should live to
                    write again it will not be from the hills but <hi rend="underline"
                    >mountains</hi>. The grand &amp; glorious mountains where I can breathe the
                    pure fresh air of <unclear>Virginia</unclear>. I have your dear &amp;
                    welcome letter of the 5th I was so sorry to read that you were not well my love
                    &amp; I am truly glad that you are not going to ride again in the night air.
                    I hope you never may have to do so. it is not good for your health &amp;
                    then it is not safe for you to ride <pb n="2"/>after night. I always feel so
                    anxious <orig reg="about">a bout</orig> you. Do you not think you would improve
                    very much if you were to be more moderate in smoking I do certainly believe you
                    would feel better my love I have never said a great deal to you against the
                    habit as you seem to enjoy smoking so much &amp; I do love to see you enjoy
                        <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig>. but it would be best for you if you
                    could only smoke occasionally or not at all. I was so sorry that you left last
                    Monday without your breakfast &amp; I did not get to give you Goodby. I did
                    wish you could have staid until sunrise. I felt lonely all day Monday after you
                    were gone I missed you sadly my love &amp; always do when you leave. my home
                    has lost its dearest happiness <pb n="3"/>when you leave it. I wish from my
                    heart that you were here <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig>. Oh how glad
                    &amp; happy I shall be when you come &amp; spend a week with me in our
                    new home. it will be so sweet to have you there to stay more than one day
                    &amp; night &amp; I shall try &amp; do all I can to make you happy
                    &amp; feel at home. I hope we shall spend many very delightful &amp;
                    happy hours with each other at Buffalo but you must promise me that you will not
                    ride after night. your health &amp; life are too dear to me not to be
                    anxious &amp; unhappy when I feel that you are exposed to danger in the lone
                    hours of night. I shall be ready to go up with you next Sabbath if we live
                    &amp; will remain in Staunton a few <pb n="4"/>days then I can have the dear
                    privilege of seeing you often while I am there. how I do love to be where I can
                    see you. I can scarcely wait for the time to come I am so anxious. Hamie has
                    just arrived &amp; tells me you are well again I am so glad to hear it,
                    &amp; that you are coming for me if you live early Saturday evening. May God
                    guide you safely here. I love you with all the deep unchanging devotion of my
                    heart &amp; Soul &amp; ever shall while I have life. No one on all the
                    wide Earth is so dear to my heart as you are my only love. I can never tell
                    fully how much &amp; how devotedly I do love &amp; cherish every thought
                    of you. I love you only of all in the world. All send love. I send a loving kiss
                    to you &amp; a hope soon to be with you. May God bless you my love. This
                    last letter to you from Mt. Solon says Goodby. Come my love I want to see you Oh
                    so much. I love you only</p>
