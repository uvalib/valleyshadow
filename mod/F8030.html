<p class="p10">September /1860</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Honorable Simon Cameron</p>
<p class="p10">It has been intimated to me by an individual of our town that the state Committee
                    has appropriated to this Congressional District
                    (17th) $2500 - and placed to the credit of Colonel McClure chairman of the state committee
                    If you have any way of ascertaining the truth of this I would like to know it,
                    as there has been no money distributed by him for that purpose and if he has
                    received the money he shall pay it out instead of using it for himself. there
                    may be a necessity of using some money in this district for to elect our
                    congressman and McClure proposed to a friend of mine to give $50- for this
                    object &amp; he would give individually the same sum and to get the same
                    from me &amp; others, thinking you might have an opportunity<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>privately of getting the information from some of your friends in that
                    Committee, It would be desirable to know if there is any truth in the intimation
                    I had, McClure states there is no money used by the Committee except what they
                    are expending for there own expenses and what may be required in Philadelphia for Political purposes but you are aware
                    of a failing he has in regard to statements he makes and in addition his
                    avaricious disposition, the Committee may be appropriating money through him to
                    some of the doubtful Congressional districts &amp; he is sinking it in his
                    own pockets</p>
<p class="p10">yours respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>D. O. Gehr</u>

                        prejudice</p>
