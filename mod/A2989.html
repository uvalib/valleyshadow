<p class="p10">Sept 22nd /64</p>
<p class="p10">In line of Battle at Fishers Hill</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I received your highly appreciated letter of the
                    13th; by Abe the 20th. You can not imagine with what anxiety I perused
                    over its contents to find out how that absent one was
                    getting along. I hope this may still find your health improving &amp;
                    enjoying many blessings My health is very good &amp; hope it may continue so. On the 19th we had one of the hardest
                    Battles that was ever fought around Winchester or in the Valley of Va. And the
                    worst of all I have to acknowledge we were badly whipped. Many brave Southerners <i>[added: bit the
                        dust]</i>
                    there in our noble cause. By the mercies of a great
                    &amp; good God I am still spared I cannot be too
                    thankful for the many special providences that has protected me thus far. His loving kindness
                    has been very great towards me &amp; my prayer is
                    that I may so walk as becometh one of his true followers. Our Company came out <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>very well I think, only one
                    wounded, William Plunkett received a flesh wound in the thigh, &amp; was lost in Winchester He
                    was wounded just as we ware falling back into Winchester. Our defeat was I think
                    caused by our Army being scattered. Our Division the
                    day before went to Martinsburg, driving the Yankee Cavalry
                    from that place. We fell back the same day to Bunkers
                    Hill, twelve miles below Winchester &amp; Rhodes'
                    Division was camped some ten miles below Winchester
                    &amp; before we could get to Winchester the other portion of the Army was
                    nearly whipped &amp; at the same time they
                    were trying to cut us of from Winchester. But we arrived
                        there in time to meet the heaviest onset of the Battle, &amp; succeeded in driving the
                    enemy near a mile when every thing lay quiet except
                    skirmishing until the middle of the evening. When the enemy's
                    cavalry drove our Cav. back <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>then making
                    three or four desperate charges on the left flank of our lines driving them back
                    in confusion which soon demoralized the whole army. We have to mourn the
                    loss of many brave men and officers. Maj. Gen. Rhodes
                    was killed early in the engagement one among the
                    best officers in our army Colonel Funk was mortally wounded through the bowels
                    &amp; left at his home in Winchester I hope he may recover but it is doubtful. Maj. Newton was wounded in the ankle bone
                    broken is on his way home. He acted very bravely in trying to rally the men. All
                    say he covered him self with glory. Capt J Bumgarner
                    was killed also Lieut J. B. McGuffin My Cous, R. Brand was badly wounded one
                    thigh broken the other a flesh wound had to leave him on the field his comp told
                    me he begged them to take him off
                    the field, but the enemy was so close that they could
                    not. All that tried to get off were wounded &amp;
                    killed but one <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>poor fellow I pity him
                    &amp; hope he may be kindly cared for, Cous &amp; Koiner came out safe.
                    We are now lying in line of Battle at Fishers Hill. Both cannon and musketry are loudly booming on our front. The enemy are trying to drive in our skirmishers. We may be
                    closely engaged before two hours. We are strongly fortified &amp; have a
                    commanding position I think by the blessing of God, we may be able to give them
                    a sound thrashing I am fearful they may advance up the Page Valley &amp;
                    cause us to fall back as we have only a small cavalry
                    force commanding it I hope you will not take the capture of Jake too much to heart I can't help but think he
                    is not in as much danger as if he was here. I hear the
                    roar of cannon now in the Page Valley. I was sorry that
                    your cous, had a relapse of the fever hope she may
                    soon recover her former health excuse me if I failed
                    to answer anything in your letter I have not taken time to look over it May the
                    blessing of a great &amp; good God be with you the news from yours as ever</p>
<p class="p10">Good bye</p>
