<p class="p10">In your letter to <i>[illeg.]</i> Hughes June 9th 1849 you say now nothing about
                        Ja<sup>s</sup> Coopers guarantee on the Release on the Fonhanon
                    Share of H. Fisher Estate -- and that no notice has been served on you by S.
                    Fisher not to pay Fonhanon and you say I have no Claim against him I say In the
                    first place that a notice is put into your hand by Mr Hughes to <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    you that It takes all the estate of Jacob Fisher to pay his Debts and dues and
                    the amount coming from the Real estate Is coming from you to me Samuel Fisher Administrator
                    of the estate of Jacob Fisher and If I failed In two Releases you must hold the
                    money In your hand until I see you satisfy. For you
                        certainly know that the Debt must first be paid
                    before the heirs can Draw any money--- However I believe you have it In your
                    power to pay me what you have left In your hands by Susan Macks Heir I am
                    informed By Mr <i>[unclear: Sholl]</i> one of them that he left twenty
                        <i>[unclear: D]</i> on the Administrator's
                    account I am in <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: need]</i> I hope you will answer this as soon as this comes to
                    hand</p>
