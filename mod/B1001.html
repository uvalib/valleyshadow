<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to J. H.
                    Remington, May 31, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook's monthly report discusses rations to the poor, the registration of married
                    couples and their children, and problems encountered by free blacks in the court
                    system.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 31<sup>st</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to make report of Bureau affairs in compliance with Circular
                    from Headquarters Sixth District
                    Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta County.</p>
<p class="p10">In this County I am informed by my predecessor the freedmen are as a rule working
                    steadily, during the month rations have been issued to sixteen (16) persons -
                    mostly women and children.</p>
<p class="p10">Complaints of various kinds have been entered upon the books but mostly for small
                    sums of money.</p>
<p class="p10">Highland County</p>
<p class="p10">I have not visited as yet but learn that the freed people do not number more than
                    one hundred (100) person in the County - have received no complaints from them.</p>
<p class="p10">Rockingham County</p>
<p class="p10">has never had an agent of the Bureau for any <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>length of time - the
                    better class of whites are inclined to treat the freedmen fairly and are I think
                    willing to give them opportunities to improve and have subscribed quite freely
                    toward building them a church - but there are a large number bitterly opposed to
                    them. I had two or three cases of assault brought to my notice by freedmen about
                    the middle of the month and referred them to Civil Magistrates but have received
                    no notice to attend trials - some freedmen complained that they were often
                    threatened with violence if they went to the "Bureau" - I do not apprehend that
                    much can be done for them under the present restrictions of the "Bureau."</p>
<p class="p10">I have registered in compliance with Circular number 11
                        Headquarters
                    Assistant
                    Commissioner - in the County of
                    Rockingham one hundred and fourteen couples with their Children and since coming
                    to this County one hundred and seventy (170) couples <i>[added: additional]</i> enclosed please find a blank form which I
                    filled and gave out in both instances as an incentive to them to come forward
                    and also to make it easier to find their names in future if required - It has
                    been suggested to me that by putting a <i>[unclear: Rev.]</i> Stamp on, it
                    would be a legal instrument for them to retain and with which in case of the
                    husbands death the widow could claim property <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I think the idea worthy
                    of mention but do not feel at liberty to take such a course without authority.</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be Sir,<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient
