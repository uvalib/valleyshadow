<p class="p10">July 10, 1867</p>

<p class="p10"> On the 27 of May Marian Hall (colored) made com- plaint at this
     office that S.C. Slaven of Highland Co witheld from him his daughter Mary Elizabeth on the
     ground said child had been bound to him by the County Court of Bath Co. Va. I wrote to Slaven
     on the 30 of May but received no reply. Since, looking over some papers, I find letter from
     S.C. Slaven received some time before I took charge, which I respectfully transmit asking that
     the records of the court of Bath Co. be ex- amined to see if the indenture will be recognized
     as fair and valid by the Bureau. The father claim he is fully able to support the child and was
     when taken from him but being himself a slave the authorities would not allow him to retain or
     provide for it. </p>
