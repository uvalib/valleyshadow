<p class="p10">March 28 1869</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I should have written you sooner in regard to that suit, but have been waiting to
                    find out something satisfactory.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Eskindger]</i>, cashier said your note was
                        <i>[unclear: survived]</i> at the rate of <u>one</u>
                    percent, a nice <u>
                        gauye
                    </u> when it is know that many of the stockholders have not paid for their
                    stock except by their notes renewable at 12 percent &amp; are getting about
                    15 percent dividends. I can hear of no such order as the one said to have been
                    given by General Wilson, Bank inspector. That suits
                    should be brought on all <i>[unclear: protested]</i> notes at once: - he merely
                    counted as Banks have always done bills and <i>[unclear: protested]</i> as part
                    of the assets of the Bank, he had no
                        <i>[unclear: business]</i> taking buy and the reports available <i>[deleted: ]</i> and did not <i>[unclear: even]</i> have I am sure, no business
                    in making such an order or suggestion. There will be a <i>[unclear: ]</i> in the notes
                    at the May County Club, &amp; the counsel will I have no doubt send the
                    execution <i>[unclear: ]</i> you. They have no <u>excess</u> of
                    indulgence, and the lover of a <i>[unclear: fes]</i>, as you <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> say is
                    ruling passion with them and then one of them may apprehend that he might have
                    something to <u>pay</u> &amp; notwithstanding the
                    singular fact that he has sued himself, his clients apprehending I
                        <i>[unclear: presume]</i> that the debt was no longer, he will doubtless
                    advise his colleagues in opposition to them only as delegate counel not to send
                    out an execution against himself, but enough of his every wants his <i>[deleted: ]</i> + opposition in such matters.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Mayor]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> informs me that our money has been sent here by Mr. Macon, and
                    say that your note can be renewed <i>[illeg.]</i> payment of one + I suppose
                        <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10">Judge Fultz <i>[illeg.]</i> last evening <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> to Amherst Court. We were Monday <i>[illeg.]</i> officers--a
                        <i>[unclear: blank]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: prevented]</i>--to day the county is overrun with the <i>[deleted: ]</i> issue--so we go.</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i>[illeg.]</i><br>Your friend</p>
