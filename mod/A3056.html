<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McCutchan thanks Miller for sending him the shoes he requested and asks her to
                    send money for paper and tobacco. He remarks that his clothes are very thin for
                    the upcoming winter.</p>

<p class="p10"> Owing to an order prohibiting persons to write only to relatives I could not acknowledge the
                    receipt of the shoes and letter but suppose
                    <i>[unclear: Mr Mawffet]</i> did as I requested him
                    when he received the box I feel very thankful indeed
                    to you for them I would have suffered
                    without them the cold finds
                    my clothes very thin if we have to stay here all
                    winter If you can find it convenient to send me a few dollars to buy some Tobacco and writing material as I am obliged to sell
                    my rations to buy such articles. I am sorry that my situation requires me to ask so much of you
                    but hope you will be rewarded some day for your kindness if I do not have the
                        opportunity of returning it myself William Sproul and Howard
                    McCutchan have died since I heard from you with fever
                    I think they were at home also your uncle
                    Steel's
                    dwelling was burned by fire from the cooking stove my
                        comrades are generally
                    pretty well here hope this will find you and family
