<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 7th 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter came duly to Hand. I was glad to hear You was
                    all well in Staunton. this finds us all the same in
                    Winchester and doing as well as the times will permit.</p>
<p class="p10">"You I suppose have heard that Henry &amp; Edwar Have opened a Tobacco store
                    in Town their Business I beleive is very flattering they are doing Much better than they anticipated.</p>
<p class="p10">"Samuel is also driving a good trade at his Business.
                    he has also opened for himself and is doing remarkably well! I Suppose Edward will be in "Staunton by the time
                    this reaches You. He started for Richmond Via: Baltimore last week he will come
                    back By the way of Staunton" and he can give you all news in town. I don't
                    believe
                    anything has transpired worth noticing since his
                    departure.</p>
<p class="p10">You Speak of <u>Hard</u>
                    <u>times</u> the times in Winchester is dull comparatively Speaking, but there is a tremendous
                    business done here considering the times it looks more like a city Now than it Ever did</p>
<p class="p10">"Little Staunton" Now will Have to stand back! You Ought to try and make it suit
                    to pay us a visit and take a look for yourself. You
                    would not recognize a Portion of the Town all the
                    Store Houses has been neatly repaired and all occupied and full of goods they
                    Present a pleasant and business like appearance! Winchester I suppose has picked up more since the war than any other Town In the Valley.</p>
<p class="p10">You ask me to send you your Trunk and shirts you left behind you. I will send
                    your Trunk the first opportunity but your shirts
                    I cannot send as they are now in other Hands. William
                    has Come Home and all his clothes has been worn out and He now has not a Shirt
                    to wear of his own and he thinks no more than right that he Should take these
                    that is here. So You need not wait for them. You will have to buy more and Send
                    others down and I will make them for you. I am sorry that I have to disappoint
                    You but you Know I can't control them now as he (Wm)
                    says he will take them for his own use! You say John talks of a going to
                    Richmond this winter. Henry &amp; Edward talks of going this fall. Edward
                    can tell you More about it when you see him in Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">We Expect <u>Tif</u> down in a few weeks from Moorefield She will come to live Samuel is talking about selling out in "Moorefield" and settle permanently in Winchester. You must write soon again.
                    All is well I had had been very sick but am well again.
                    My Love to all in Staunton.</p>
