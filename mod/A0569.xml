     from you. We expect a fight soon now we have had one or two <orig reg="skirmishes"
     >skermishes</orig> at honey wood mills we <orig reg="were">wer</orig> down there a few days ago
     that is about 20 of us working at a dam to blow it up whilst we were at work a body of men the
     other side of the river showered <orig reg="their">there</orig> balls amongst us from the bank
     of the canal from behind the stone wall but none of us were hurt we ran under cover and got our <unclear>
      <orig reg="carpenter">carpiner</orig>
     </unclear> then <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Stuart ordered us to make for the dam and
     cover I was the first one to step from the house<pb n="2"/> which we were behind I made a
     slight <unclear>

      reg="enemies">eneymes</orig> side or badly wounded We have but little time for play we have to
     stay up every other night on picket there is one post 15 miles from camp four of us have to
     stand picket there some times when we start from camp and very often <orig reg="there is"
      >theris</orig> nothing to carry with us to eat we go out one morning and come back the next
     about 12 oclock without a thing to eat some times the neighbors send us something to eat<pb

    <p>There is no <orig reg="news">knewse</orig> here you can <orig reg="hear">here</orig> more
     than we can for we are not <orig reg="allowed">alowed</orig> to go out of camp without a pass
