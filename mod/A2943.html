<p class="p10">Walnut Hill Westmorland Co. Va.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>My Dear friend</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I avail myself of the pleasant opportunity of droping you a few lines which I
                    hope will reach you safe &amp; find you in the full enjoyment of health
                    &amp; prosperity. I have not heard from you since through your letter of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> of July which I received while at the Hospital, I
                    answered it immediately telling you that I should leave for home in a short time
                    which I did. I left Richmond the 13<sup>th</sup> day of July. When I
                    last wrote I instructed you to direct your letter to Sorrells, Essex Co but on
                    my way home I learned that the mail was not running to <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>that office
                    owing to the enemy having broken up the Mail route
                    while on his line of March to Richmond but Since I have been home the line has
                    been reestablished consequently letters sent by the directions given you will
                    reach me safe.</p>
<p class="p10">I will now tell you of some of my suffering after getting home another abscess
                    formed on the out side of my face, which gave Ms Muck panic, so soon as that got
                    better the Erysipeals took hold in my face &amp; my throat &amp; tongue
                    became seriously affected so that I could not talk &amp; I assure you my
                    suffering I cannot describe I surely must have died
                    but for the mercy of God &amp; the attentions of two good physicians thank
                    God I have recovered from my Extreme illness &amp; now able to sit up
                    &amp; walk about a little but am very weak, I hope in <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>a few weeks
                    to gain considerable strength if I am not taken worse
                    which I hope will not be the case. I often think of the character of your last letter &amp; the feeling it produced when
                        received a letter from my sister surely could
                    not have been received with more delight &amp;
                    while I constantly think of you I have become more &amp; more anxious to see
                    you why should we have friends and never meet with them? It is pleasant indeed to speak with our friends through silent medium of
                    the pen, but how much more pleasant to meet them &amp; grasp the hand with
                    the gentle press of friendship &amp; can meet
                    the friendly &amp; impressive gaze. Oh! how much I would appreciate the
                    realization of such an ideal, with you my <u>Ever dear friend
                        Kate</u> I have come to the conclusion that I will if possible visit
                    Rosedale Augusta Co. if I can make my <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>arrangements to suit. My idea is to go up some time in September that
                    is if I should get will Enough to travel &amp; my jaws are not strong Enough
                    to return to the Army that would give me an opportunity too as what would be to me perfectly delightful. Well my friend you must
                    write soon I am so anxious to hear from you. When you write let me know which is
                    the nearest Rail Road station to where you live. Waynesboro &amp; Staunton
                    are the only stations that I know any of &amp; dont know the distance they
                    are from your place. Well I must close please excuse
                    bad writing &amp; mistakes as I am quite feeble &amp; nervous. My
                    kindest regards to your Pa &amp; family with much love for your self believe
                    me to be your true friend.</p>
