<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham Rosenbery (father), May 1, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery writes that he visited the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry to meet up with family and friends there. Rosenbery also wonders--as he often has--about when he will be able to return home. And, as in earlier letters, he requests his repaired watch and his tools from home.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 1, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself to inform you that this morning I heard that the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry laid near us so I got permission from the Captain.</p>
<p class="p10">I went to see them.  I saw Abraham-Asway--Lee Horn-William Long-jacob Long-Mike Painter and Captain Snider. They were all well and look well and feel in good spirits. Jeremiah Leidigh he has the measels and was sent back to Washington. The boys were all glad to see me. I presume that I was just as glad to see them. They as well as myself are expecting to see some fun before long.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope we may be successful in the First Battle- I am well at this time. Hoping that these few lines may find you all enjoying the same blessings of health that I enjoy at present.</p>
<p class="p10">Some time ago I expressed to you 20 dollars to Chambersburg. It left Washington on the 20th. I hope that you have received it safe. If you have let me know.</p>
<p class="p10">About our getting out of this in 9 months looks very doubtful but some of the conscripts are yet in good hopes.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon. You give my respects to all inquiring friends. I have no particulars to write at this time. So farewell for the present.</p>
<p class="p10">Goodbye for this time</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
<p class="p10">I think that we will get home in 9 months maybe sooner. There is talk of us going home the 17th of this month.<br>
But I cannot see the point. We can tell better when the time comes.<br>
<br>
After slow motion gets my watch fixed you may send it.<br>
<br>
I signed the payroll. I Think that I can send you a little money..I can't say how much in your letter.<br>
<br>
Let me know if Abraham and Ashway talks anything of getting home on a furlough or not.<br>
<br>
I got a letter from John Markey asking me if I could send him some money or sell him the tools. If he does not watch I will sue him for stealing them away from Uncle Joseph Rosenbery. You get the tools home as soon as you can. I will pay you for your trouble.<br>
<br>
Goodbye for this time<br>
                       Franklin Rosenbery<br>
<br>
I will not sell my tools for love or money to him. But if you need them use them. It will be all right.</p>
