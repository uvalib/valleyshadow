     happy to say that i received
     your kind letter on the 20th of may and i Was very happy to hear from you and all the rest it make me feel glad to hear that you are so fat since i left
     home and then i get mad to think that i Can't get home to see you and now it has been over a year since i left home and had to sleep by myself and do
     my Washing and sometimes
     do
     my
     own
     cooking but i hope that it Will over before long and that i Can be With you i Went and saw the <i>[unclear: Curlel]</i> and he
      said that he Would try and get me a furlough as soon as he Could
     and as soon as he Could get me home he said and it Will be
     awhile
     before i Can get away but as soon as i Can i Will be home and if i ever get home again
     safe and get out of the army Why i Will never leave you again as long as i live for i
      know What it is to be a soldier in a battle i
     am glad to hear that Johan stayed home but he Was not like me but the reason that i Come Was
      because i thought it a big thing to be a
      Soldier i have found out about it and it Was so <i>[unclear: losom]</i> at home but i Could stay at home if everybody
     Would
     leave
     there but i think that We may all live to get
      home
     again and if We do
     Why i will have
     something to live on for i never Was as long
      Without money in my life our
     Colonel say that We will get our pay in thirty
     Days or he will take us to boston and pay us off
     for it is too bad that We have to go so long
      Without money we have been
     Waiting
     for
     <i>[unclear: Coner]</i> to a turn pay us the thirteen Dollars a
     month and the last mail say that the <i>[unclear: uinter]</i>
     <i>[unclear: stle]</i>
     won't pay us but but ten
     Dollars a month and governor
     andrew say that he Will Call us out of the
      field and pay us off and send us home
     again and i hope that he Will i Was glad that you wrote to me about bob rite for he had wrote to me for help to pay for the house and that that he Was trying to get it paid for but if he
     is too stingy to pay for a post
     stamp
