<p class="p10">Wednesday May 11<sup>th</sup> 1864 5 A. M.</p>
<p class="p10">Near Spotsylvania Court House</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife --</p>
<p class="p10">We have now been a week on the war path -- fighting more or less every day, &amp; still
     the horrid work goes on -- through the heat &amp; dust of this dry
     "spell."</p>
<p class="p10"> We fought the enemy, with varying success, but the results of advantage were only until
     Saturday night -- then the enemy left the vicinity of the Wilderness &amp; moved further
     down the river &amp; of course we followed on parallel roads, Keeping ourselves between him
     &amp; Richmond &amp; skirmishing as we went on -- cavalry performed prodigies of valor,
     fighting stubbornly, every advance of the foe &amp; losing heavily -- Ab. Hanna was killed,
     Bumgardner wounded, a young McCourt killed &amp;c &amp;c -- our advance met that of the
     enemy at Spotsylvania Court House &amp; drove it back in
     confusion on Sunday -- Monday we skirmished with them on opposite sides of the Ny, holding them
     in check everywhere -- yesterday the enemy made constant &amp; heavy attacks all along our
     line, attempting to take some of our positions 8 or 9 times &amp; late in the evening, by
     missing 3 divisions charging down on one line, they broke it and captured the line of
     breastworks passing over Doles' &amp; part of the Stonewall &amp; Daniel's Brigades but
     Gen. Walker gallantly brought in the rest of the old stonewall &amp; drove them out aided
     by Battle's Brigade, the enemy again &amp; again attempted to
     take the position with a fire of death perfectly terrific, but all
     in vain &amp; though we lost many our line stood firm &amp; by God's blessing, the
     battle was not to the strong alone --. in the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>mean time Gen. Early, in command of 2
     divisions of Hill's Corps, flanked the enemy's right &amp; came down on them in Jackson
     style, carrying 3 lines of the entrenchments &amp; driving them a mile &amp; a half,
     the fighting kept up until in the night -- I never heard heavier firing &amp; of course we
     have to mourn the loss of many brave men -- Gen. Lee was in the midst of it cheering on our
     men. Col. Higginbotham of the 26<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> Va was killed. In the previous fight Thomas Reeves was killed.
     Yesterday Capt. Turner of our staff was severely wounded in both
     legs -- Capt. Ister was wounded -- The enemy had over 15000 wounded in Fredericksburg day
     before yesterday &amp; they had their negro brigade there -- some of their cavalry got
     through our lines and went in to the Central Railroad &amp; did
     some damage, but I heard that they were captured The enemy was handsomely repulsed below
     Richmond by Bushrod and Johnson &amp; we hear cheering news from Western Va -- . Mosby has
     broken the Orange &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i>
     Railroad -- the enemy now communicates by the Acquia Creek Rd. Grant fights stubbornly &amp; keeps butting his head against
     our breastworks &amp; is getting it badly bruised. We have been eminently successful
     &amp; have abundant cause for thankfulness. I am in good health &amp; getting along
     very well &amp; hope <u>you</u> are all getting along well. Be of good
     cheer &amp; may the Lord bless you -- Love for you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
