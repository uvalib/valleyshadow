<h4>Franklin County: John H. Reed to General L. Thomas,
                    January 10, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>John H. Reed tenders his resignation, citing his injuries and his reluctance to
                    receive pay while recuperating.</p>

                    L. Thomas Adj., Genl. U.S.

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 10, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Johnstown</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I herewith must respectfully tender my resignation as Captain of Co. D. 126th
                    Regt. Penna Vols.</p>
<p class="p10">For the following reasons Viz. 1st from the 25th of September 1862 until shortly
                    before the battle of Fredericksburg I was unfit for duty and away at
                    Chambersburg Hospital. Shortly before the battle of Dec. 13th I rejoined my
                    regiment although my disability was not entirely recovered. In that engagement I
                    received severe and I fear permanent injuries to my back and whole left side for
                    which I received leave of absence for twenty days. My physician has certified to
                    my condition at this time as being unable to travel. He thinks my recovery will
                    be tedious.</p>
<p class="p10">2. I am unwilling to be in the role of officers and receive pay when I cannot
                    render service for the same. I therefore ask you to relieve me of my command.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. H. Reed</i></p>
