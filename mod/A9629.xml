                <p>It is with pleasure that I can this morning seat my self to drop you a few lines.
                    My health is very good, &amp; spirits are good, &amp; hope that these
                        <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> lines come to hand you may be enjoying the same
                        <orig reg="unaccountable">unaccountible</orig> blessing.</p>

                <p>We all arrived safely <orig reg="here">hear</orig> last Monday. I know not how
                    long we will remain in <orig reg="Harpers">harpers</orig>
                    <orig reg="Ferry">ferry</orig>. Now I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> care for it
                    is a very dull <orig reg="place">plase</orig>. The ladies look so sour that I
                    never speak to any of them. <orig reg="There">Thare</orig> are no beauties in
                    the burg. <pb n="2"/> On our way to the burg the Ladies of <orig reg="every"
                        >evry</orig>
                    <orig reg="village">villige</orig> cheered us onward by <orig reg="their"
                    >thare</orig> smiles &amp; waves. Miss Fannie Lincoln presented our company
                    with a secession Flag. I seen her <orig reg="but">put</orig> did not <orig
                        reg="know">no</orig> her as we pushed on so past in our press <orig
                        reg="wagons">waggons</orig> we had to travel all day last Sunday which
                    seemed very hard in old Jackson. I almost fell in love with a girl the way I
                    happened to get acquainted with her was I had <orig reg="broken">proke</orig>
                    one of my straps that held my scabbard &amp; I just went &amp; asked her
                    to <orig reg="sew">sow</orig> it for me if she pleased. She very kindly said she
                    would &amp; before the lady had finished it <pb n="3"/>a dozen of my fellow
                        <orig reg="soldiers">solders</orig> had joined around me, the Ladies all
                    along the road seemed so pleasant that it it cheered us onward <orig reg="their"

                    &amp; we generally gave them three loud cheers. <orig reg="There"
                    >Thare</orig> are so many <orig reg="rumors">rumers</orig> afloat that I can not
                    say what we may <orig reg="have to">hafter</orig> do. John is very well and
                        <orig reg="seemed">seemd</orig> to enjoy him self very well. I hope that if
                    it is Gods will that we may all arrive safely at home ere long.</p>

                <p>Dear Cate I should like to <orig reg="express">exspress</orig> my self freely to
                    you. It was my intention to show you the hidden love that I always felt for you
                    the <orig reg="Saturday">Sadurday</orig> that you left Mr. Burkholders <orig
                        reg="but">put</orig> I <pb n="4"/> was disappointed in my plans. And it may
                    be well for the love I have for you might have been blasted &amp; treated
                    with disregard, but oh Cate I shall ask one thing of <orig reg="thee">the</orig>
                    that is your prayers that I may with stand the wilds and temptations of the
                    devil, that I may <del hand="h1" rend="none"/> upward &amp; onward &amp;
                    may <del hand="h1"/> the heavenly city with all the blood washed <orig
