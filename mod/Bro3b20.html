<h4>Letter to Emmet Brooks

skillets and mentions the court martials of several soldiers in

<p class="p10">
Dear Emmet,
</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter was<br>
received yesterday evening.<br>
I had mailed one to you in the<br>
morning. I have had very little<br>
opportunity to make the inquiries you<br>
wish. I have been on road detail<br>
today (making corduroy road to<br>
Guinney's<a href="#n2">[2]</a>)
and have to go again tomorrow, so you see it will be<br>
impossible to go to Guinney Station<br>
before Monday, if indeed I can go then.<br>
I suppose you were led to believe, that<br>
large profits could be made on skillets<br>
from having <i>[added: heard]</i> us speak of having to pay<br>
12 or 15 dollars for one.  If you could get<br>
that price, it would pay very well, but<br>
I do not think you could get it; unless<br>
you could get them to the different<br>
brigades of the army and sell them there,<br>
in which case, I think they would bring<br>
12 dollars. The sutlers
<a href="#n3">[3]</a>
of regiments do not<br>

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Bro3b202.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Bro3b202.gif"></center></a><br><br>

buy them at all, so far as I can hear, unless<br>
they get orders for them. As for the<br>
Sutlers at the Station, I can not speak<br>
positively, but think they act in the same<br>
way. The day you went up, McKee
<a href="#n4">[4]</a> failed<br>
to get one, but got the promise of one soon, if<br>
he would leave 10 dollars, his name etc, which<br>
he would not do. However I am of the<br>
opinion that you might sell them there<br>
for 8 dollars apiece, in lots of 20, or 30,<br>
and it might be as many as 60.<br>
I think there would be no risk in you<br>
staying a few days, at the Station. But you<br>
know there is no accomodation there, and no<br>
place to keep them. I got the box that night.<br>
It was a treat, I tell you, but you will know that<br>
after the sight of it. The coffee is delicious.<br>
McKee got his furlough next day and started<br>
in about an hour. John D. got his too,<br>
and went Monday. I want you to send me a<br>
tin plate by him.  If you buy skillets, you<br>
ought to do it at once while the army is<br>
lying quiet. A good many soldiers have been courtmartialed<br>
in the brigade. Several were publicly whipped today, and<br>
four others <i>[unclear: ]</i>.<br>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> The Stonewall Brigade constructed Camp Winder for
their winter quarters in December of 1862. Located in the forests of
Moss Neck, Camp Winder was easily accessible to the Richmond,
Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad and offered good drainage, wood and
water supplies (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 175).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> Guinney Station was located south of Fredericksburg
and was the site of General Stonewall Jackson's death on May 10, 1863
after the battle of Chancellorsville.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> John Telford McKee (1845-1912) was a farmer who
enlisted in Company I on June 8, 1861. He was captured on March 23, 1862
at Kernstown along with Andrew Brooks. After being exchanged on August 5, 1862,
he was promoted to Corporal. McKee was captured during the Battle of
Gettysburg and imprisoned at Fort Delaware until February of 1865 when
he was exchanged. He died in Buena Vista, Virginia (Robertson, 63).
Edward A. Moore, a cannoneer in the Rockbridge Artillery Company,
includes an interesting anecdote about McKee's capture at Gettysburg
in his memoirs. He relates that the "stalwart Irish Federal" who pulled
McKee up over the breastworks said, "Gim-me your hand, Johnny Reb;
you've give' us the bulliest fight of the war!" (Moore, 199).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> Sutlers were people who followed an army in order to
sell provisions to the troops. </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> Cyrus W. (1842-1906) and George Henry Killian (1840-1888)
of Waynesboro, Virginia joined the 5th Virginia Infantry, Company H on
March 10, 1862  and April 19, 1861
respectively.  George was promoted to
Second Lieutenant in April of 1862. Sometime between December 1862 and
late January 1863, he went AWOL.  He was arrested and sentenced on
January 26 to forfeit a month's pay. George was wounded at
Chancellorsville (May 3, 1863) and captured at Spotsylvania (May 12,
1864) along with his brother Cyrus. Both were imprisoned at Fort
Delaware; George was later transfered to Hilton Head and Morris Island,
SC and then Fort Pulaski. The brothers were released in June of 1865.
Cyrus went on to become a farmer and merchant in Salem, VA, whereas
George eventually moved to Alabama and died of yellow fever in
1888 (Wallace, 136).</p>
