                    his decision to hold on to it until after the war to take advantage of better
                    currency values. He also discusses supplies he is shipping from home.</p>

                <p>I suppose you are anxious to hear how we got home. I had written to you &amp;
                    forwarded with some money $100 Maryland <orig reg="$20">20$</orig> green backs
                    but the carrier could not get it through and brought it back to me again,
                    &amp; now I start it on again hope it may reach you safely this time.</p>

                <p>We reached here safely after a hard tiresome time camping out each night Freddy
                    enjoyed the trip very much. we are well now. Freddy enjoys himself here very
                    much <orig reg="knocking">

                    for me &amp;c &amp;c I find him of great help to me he stand<hi

                    room door thus making himself quite useful. I write this &amp; send both
                    together. I hope you are all well Freddy wishes for you daily &amp; I too I
                    do wish you were all here we are doing a good business here now.</p>

                <p>I had a bidder for the hotel yesterday I think we could have sold for $200,000<hi
                        rend="super">
                        <hi rend="underline">00</hi>
                    </hi> two hundred thousand Dollars furniture &amp; all. but this we would
                    not take. gold is 25 for one which would make but Eight thousand dollars in coin
                    and to hold the property until after the war it will always bring about fifty
                    thousand dollars in good currency &amp; from this it would seem best to hold
                    on to it as we could not apply the money now to any advantage. I would much
                    rather rent it out but if I have to stay away from home, I <orig reg="don't"
                        >dont</orig> see any better chance to make money than this although it is a
                    disagreeable business</p>

                <p>I wish we could have had more time to consider this matter and have come to some
                    definite <pb n="2"/> conclusion on this subject</p>

                <p>The things I had with me I got through safely the articles groceries &amp;c,
                    I sent out are still at the place I sent them near millcreek I could not get a

                    get back again</p>

                <p>Use the money enclosed as you desire. if from time to time you can, you might
                    collect up such things as we will need here, you can tell what is most needed.</p>

                <p>I forgot the letter paper &amp; pencils &amp; small long narrow
                    memorandum books if have a chance try &amp; send them out to me</p>
