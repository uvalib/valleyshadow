                <p>I received yours of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <orig reg="today">to day</orig> for which you will be pleased to receive my
                    thanks. I gave it to my brother Jefferson who left this morning for
                    Charlottesville to attend the meeting. There is a good deal of interest
                        <unclear>encited</unclear> on the subject here--Michie and J B Baldwin have
                    each addressed a long letter to Jeff as the representative of the Western
                    Interest in the Rail Road, in which they have taken pretty much the same view
                    you have, I have no doubt it will have a good effect on the Directors--I have
                    not yet determined, whether I will purchase Peyton's interest in the concern,
                    there are several applicants for it; but it is rule in the concern that no
                    partner is to be admitted without the consent of all the others; they have all
                    consented that Farrish who is <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> may sell to me. I shall determine on it in two or three weeks. </p>
                <p>I am apprehensive a day or two since, that you were about to get into a <hi
                        rend="underline">breeze</hi> with the Revd B. M Serrett, who addressed me a
                    letter, to which I replied, copies of which I enclose you. At the same time he
                    addressed a similar letter to Dr. Stribling who replied substantially as I did.
                    You will <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> sure in my answer. I marched right up to the point, so
                    that he could not misunderstand what you said on the subject. Well! What do you
                    suppose is the result; the evening of the day he received the answer; he went to
                    the Hospital to see Dr. Stribling<pb n="2"/>as I suppose, and desired that he
                    had defined to <unclear>about</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> had understood he had. Dr S. said he thought from the first
                    paragraph in his letter, he had admonished it. He <unclear>pardned</unclear> him
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and read it to him. It is however a complete <hi
                        rend="underline">exoneration</hi> of you. I am very much pleased it has
                    taken this course, as I do most heartily detest these <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and
                    misunderstandings. I think it very much the wisest course he could pursue. </p>
                <p>Every person I meet seems to be rejoiced at the course pursued by Mr. President
                    in relation to the Boston mob. His prompt actions, will convince many, who
                    doubted, that he will be as ready to put down a mob in the North as the South,
                    Should it appear on investigation that the Deputy Marshall has been remiss in
                    his duty, or <unclear>quailed</unclear> in the least to popular opinion his
                    principal who it seems was absent, ought to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> him, this would
                    satisfy even S Carolina. As far as I can gather the tone of public opinion and
                    feeling, the administration is getting on most gloriously, and unless something
                    unforeseen occurs, I feel our very sanguine in the belief that it will become so
                    popular at the end of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> four years, that no opposition can
                    succeed against him. The Democrats themselves seem to be at a loss to know who
                    to <unclear>fin</unclear> on, Cass who I think is decidedly their strongest man
                    (at least in Va) seems to be but coldly received even in the West. Dickinson at
                    present seems to be the favorite, But there is so many views to work among <del
                        hand="h1"/> politicians, that we in the country, know but little, and all we
                    say is a <unclear>Many</unclear> more than guess work. </p>
                <pb n="3"/>
                <p>Gerrard and Mr Chapman arrived yesterday morning. Mr C. found his children
                    better, two of them have been extremely ill, three days ago it was believed one
                    of them could not live, but strange to say, today there is <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> fair
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of its recovery.</p>
                <p>We have had a great deal of sickness this winter and many deaths, particularly
                    among the servants--Scarlet fever, pnemonia, <unclear>Erydipelas</unclear>
                    &amp;c &amp;c. the latter is now prevailing as an epidemic at the
                    Asylum, about 10 cases there, one death yesterday.</p>
                <p>We all miss you very much, and we never have one of our social meetings, but what
                    honorable mention is made of you, &amp; hopes expressed that we may all live
                    to meet and greet you again as one of members. </p>
                <p>Present my kind regards to Mrs. Stuart and accept for yourself my best wishes for
                    your health &amp; happiness.</p>
