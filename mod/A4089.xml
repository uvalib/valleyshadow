    <p>Your letters of the 20<hi rend="super">th</hi> &amp; 25<hi rend="bold">th</hi> inst. came
     to hand about the same time last week &amp; I have not had time to write to you since But
     we are now, this warm Sabbath P. M. quiet in camp, having moved back here, 11 miles from
     Martinsburg, this morning, starting about 3 o'clock, I have had a good sweltering nap in the
     shade &amp; now will write &amp; answer your queries first, for fear I may forget it. I
     wrote to you about Gen. Ramseur's fight, about which you are so uncertain in yours of the 20<hi
      rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">th</hi>
     </hi> &amp; gave you the particulars &amp; have since written to you about the battle
     of the 24<hi rend="super">th</hi> at Kernstown &amp; our pursuit of the Yanks to
     Martinsburg. Friday we went to the Potomac at Williamsport &amp; crossed over &amp;
     made a demonstration, our sharp shooters going up to Hagerstown, at the same time the cavalry
     crossed higher up &amp; is now on a raid into the Cumberland Valley &amp; Westward
     Mosby crossed also towards Frederick City<pb n="2"/>I am glad your package <orig reg="came"
      >come</orig> safely Yesterday I sent you, to the care of Maj. Bell, a small box containing a
     set of cups &amp; saucers, 1/2 doz tumblers, some pepper, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, soap
     &amp; a set of new &amp; novel Reading Books for the children, they are beautifully
     illustrated &amp; will be a source of information &amp; amusement for the children -- I
     did not see any other books there worth getting for them -- I could not find any tea
     &amp;c, but may yet, as I desire to get them much -- I know you need them. The Red Book is
     a capture of Mr. Robinson's near Washington -- take care of it. I have asked for Indigo often
     &amp; could not find any. Sell your butter unless you need it yourself, for there is no way
     of getting it to me &amp; you can use it to advantage. I want a full pattern frock coat
     from my cloth &amp; then, if there is enough left for a pair of pants you may make them
     from your pattern, if you have time -- I am in no need of them now as I got<pb n="3"/>a very
     good pair from the <abbr expan="Quarter Master">Q. M.</abbr> in the Spring &amp; have 2
     pairs with me. The overcoat is Mr. Robinson's, but I have conditionally bought it, take care of
     it &amp; keep the moths away from it -- I think it is very pretty too -- I am glad the
     Brandy got home, was fearful it <abbr expan="would">wd</abbr> get broken. Use the socks as you
     please -- I am wearing some of them that I kept - use them for yourself. I wish I had kept some
      <abbr expan="handkerchiefs">hdkfs</abbr>. I ame delighted that Nelly is doing so well,
     &amp; writes her compositions without help -- . When I spoke about your letter of the 12<hi
      rend="super">th</hi> being filled with "Hunter" I meant an account of Hunter's Raid &amp;
     its sad consequences. <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> Hanger took up my horses &amp; he
     will get them into pasture. I spoke to Mr. Geeding about pasture when at home &amp; he
     agreed to take one horse, I now send 2, after the lapse of 2 months, instead of one. I shall
     get Anne's shoes the first chance. I will send you some <abbr expan="Post Office">P. O.</abbr>
     Stamps in a few days. In your letter of the 20<hi rend="super">th</hi> You speak of being quite
     sick but say Dr. Hamilton cured you -- I am <pb n="4"/>very much obliged to him for his
     attentions to you -- hope I may be able to reward him. In the letter of the 25<hi
      rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">th</hi>
     </hi> you say you are all well I am glad you have an opportunity to aid the soldiers some --
     but hope you will not be made sick by your attentions to them I shall have to get you a pair of
     spectacles if you say so -- though it will seem odd &amp; make <hi rend="underline">me</hi>
     feel old too, I am sorry we are so far off that I cannot send William up to help you -- Don't
     work out of doors so as to injure your health -- Cannot Mary be made by Capt. Sterrett to do
     more of the out door work she is old enough &amp; strong enough. I am very sorry for Mrs.
     Bear -- hope she is better now &amp; may get over her great loss, at least become
     reconciled to bear it with Christian resignation I am willing to let Allie
     <unclear>Hanger</unclear> have use of the benches - there are a good many of them in the "Hall"
     now -- with the condition that they are not to be cut up -- You may let Nelly take Music
     Lessons if you think she will be properly taught &amp; I do not wish to send her to <hi
      rend="underline">any</hi> school if it can be avoided -- but you must use your own discretion
     -- you have the burdens &amp; cares of the family &amp; I do not wish to add to them --
     There is a good deal in the reading books I send for her to study Grammar -- You might put her
     into French when you think best. I am sorry Anne gets along so slowly, but hope <hi
      rend="underline">time</hi> will aid her -- I wish Nelly could study Botany, Words, but it is
     too late in the season now -- Write often my Love -- Kind regards &amp; Heavenly blessings
     for you all -- </p>
