<p class="p10">My Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">As we are getting your other uniform ready to send I will write a little and send it in your
     bundle for we do not know where to direct to, and I suppose you will be certain to get it If
     the weather is as warm where you are as it has been here for the past few days you will
     certainly need something lighter than your winter uniform We have received two letters from you
     one Wednesday and one today and I tell you we (as well as others)
     were about as anxious to hear from you as we could well be only Thomas they were entirely too short Ma wants you to write the occurences of every day, if possible, and
     then when you get enough to send it home. It appears like there has been a stop put to business of every kind there is very little doing except what is obliged
     to be done that is farming. Pa has been ploughing this week. it sets very hard with him.
     Runnels is still about he has joined a volunteer company at
     Brownsburg. The Brownsburg troop passed this evening on their way home I guess there would be a
     great many persons glad this evening. I wish wish we could be surprised in the same way.
     Providence congregation looked sadder last Sabbath than it has done for many a long day. There
     has been a Home Guard formed around here and I suppose it is needed for some of the negroes are
     not to be trusted even around here and then they are backed by some of the mean white folks
     There is one of the Sensabough that there has been a talk of taking to jail and they have a son
     of Davies Kerrs in jail. We are all well and have been since you left and we want you to be
     very careful of your health do not expose yourself rashly if you get your clothes wet try and
     dry them and above all dont sleep on wet clothes if it is possible to have them dry for as you
     know it is so very much more injurious to health than when you are taking exercise<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley15b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley15b.gif"></center></a><br><br></p>
<p class="p10">
      We would like very much to know what sort of a life you lead in
     camp What have you to eat and have you plenty of it. great fears are entertained that you will
     suffer for food so many soldiers and where will bread come from to feed them Who cooks for you
     or do you have to do it yourselves and <i>[deleted: w]</i>how are you camped, in houses in
     tents or in the open air with the sky for your covering. I would like very much to know who
     your messmates are. How is cousin John Berry getting along has he got his spirits raised yet or
     is he still down. I reckon you live in excitement I hope you dont have to live on its so near
     the city. If you want anything write for it and if we have an
     opportunity we will send it.</p>
<p class="p10">Farewell dear brother do yor duty as a soldier and as a man and if I never see you again may
     we meet above.</p>
<p class="p10">from your sister </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mary A Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">P/S/ Write often and tell me when you received this and where to direct
      to so that we can write. MaryDear Son I<br> It is with a trembling hand and a sad heart that I t<i>[deleted: h]</i>ake this pencil in my hand to drop you a fine but fearing that I may never
      have another opportunity I will exort you once more to put your trust in the mighty God of
      Jacob take Jesus Christ for your Saviour and then if you even fall in the battle field you
      will still be safe There has been much fervent prayer offered for you and the dear friends who has gone from amongst us. O will you not pray for yourself.
      Nothing more From your affectionate mother C. Smiley <br> To her son T. M Smiley. Thomas M Smiley
