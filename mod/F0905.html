<p class="p10">Camp in Front of Petersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife,</p>
<p class="p10">It is with the greatest of pleasure that I take the present opportunity to answer your  
 kind letter which came to hand on Friday night and was glad to hear once more from you for I began to  
 think that you were going to quit writing to me but I think you haven't forgotten altogether.  I  
 am well and getting along very well and I hope when these few lines reach you they may find all well.</p>
<p class="p10">Well I must tell you that we  
 have been making breastworks for several days  
 and there is A lot<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> of the boys out today and I think I will have to go tomorrow but I would about as soon go    out as stay in camp for we don't do very much when we are out.  Well you were talking about them sheep.  I think you better give them  
 to him but if they have any lambs this spring I don't want you to give him any of them for I would sooner pay pasture for them.  I  
 am going to write to <i>[unclear: Stribker]</i> to see  
 how them sheep is doing I have A  
 mind to leave him have them another year well</p>
<p class="p10">Hally I think if <i>[unclear: McAnasky]</i> will take them sheep I will<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> give them to him so you can see him and  
 let me know and if he don't want  
 him I will let <i>[unclear: Stribker]</i> keep them  
 another year I want you to  
 see him and let me know as soon as you can.  I suppose Pap will take his home this summer and he can take yours over  
 along.   I expressed my  
 money to Pap and I wrote to him to give it to you.  I sent you sixty five dollars and let me me know if gave it to you or not.  I wrote you a letter several days Ago  
 and I put one dollar and ten cents in it and I am  
 going to<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> put two dollars in this letter.  So nothing more at present but  
 remain your husband.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sylvester McElheney</i></p>
<p class="p10">write soon  
 every week and tend to it.  ask Pap whether he paid for fixing of my watch or whether Bill Sibert for he said he paid it and  
 I paid.  Tell Pap to ask J. Camble if he paid him or not  
 and let me know.</p>
