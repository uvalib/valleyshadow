<p class="p10">Dear Colonel-</p>
<p class="p10">You have doubtless noticed that they are cutting up Jack in Union County about
                    sending Delegates to the Whig State Convention. The <i>[unclear: Eyster]</i>
                    Men have presented you for Senatorial and Major Sharon
                    for Representative Delegate to the Convention, and the other faction have
                    presented Old <i>[illeg.]</i> for Senatorial Delegate,
                    and left the Representative Delegate for
                        <i>[unclear: Juniata]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Feeling persuaded that you are as earnest in your desires for harmony as I am, I
                    propose that <i>[unclear: Juniata]</i> shall concur in the nomination of <i>[deleted: ]</i> and Sharon - this confirming one named by each party. We pulled
                    you over hime once rather roughly, and I doubt not that you would not wish to be
                    brought in contact with him again as it would seem as if your friends wished to
                    wage a war of extermination against him.</p>
<p class="p10">Major Sharon will be perfectly acceptable to Juniata as
                    Representative <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>none in the county would be more so, and the fact that
                    it might do something towards reconciling matters in Union, is an additional
                    reason only he should be chosen.</p>
<p class="p10">I have called a meeting of the Committee on Saturday next to take action on the
                    subject; and i will be glad to hear from you as early as possible. We will of
                    course not forget you in our resolutions, as I will prepare them myself.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>A K McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I saw Dr. Rotherck here a day or
                        two ago, and he assured me that if we confirmed either of their men, they
                        would be perfectly satisfied to have the other Delegate from the other faction. Colonel Eli Slifer
                    </p>
