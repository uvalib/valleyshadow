<p class="p10">I have the honor to report that a young freedman named Robert Carter was tried
                    for an attempt at Larceny by the Hustings Court at Staunton, Virginia on the 8th of this month.</p>
<p class="p10">He was just taken before the Provost Marshall, Captain
                    J.M. Collins 58th Pennsylvania Volunteers, to
                    whom he confessed his guilt. He was then turned over to the Civil Authorities
                    for trial. A Counsel was assigned by the Court, Mr. Cochrane, who managed the
                    case with commendable zeal and ability. He contended and I think proved that the
                    confession was not voluntarily made. The other evidence would not convict. The
                    Court thought otherwise, received the confession, convicted and sentenced him to
                    (1) one year in the penitentiary. The case will be sent to Governor Pierpont for <i>[unclear: revision]</i>.</p>
