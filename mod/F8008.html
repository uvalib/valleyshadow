<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of 28 reached me, in due time but has been neglected by a necessary
                    absence on pressing business.</p>
<p class="p10">It is due alike to you and myself that I should answer you promptly and I do so,
                    in the same confidence that you ask for your letter.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[deleted: Various]</i> Many applications have been made to me for pecuniary
                    aid to newspaper and for their editors, since my name has been
                        <i>[unclear: officiated]</i> with the <i>[deleted: high]</i> office you
                    connect with it. I have given but one answer and that<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>is, that I can
                    not with my sense of propriety give any money to aid my own political
                    advancement.</p>
<p class="p10">I have always had a strong sympathy with young men of talent and energy starting
                    in the business to which I belonged in early life, and have very often aided
                    them with my <i>[unclear: counsel]</i> and my money, and so I hope to do again,
                    but not while any one considers me a candidate for the Presidency.--If that high
                    honor ever comes to me, it will come, as a free will offering from the people.</p>
<p class="p10">Very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Simon Cameron</i></p>
