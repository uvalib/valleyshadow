<p class="p10">April the 4<sup>th</sup> , 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp 1<sup>st</sup> V<sup>a</sup> Cavalry<br> Near
       Orange C.H. Virginia </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">We arrived here the evening of the 29<sup>th</sup> of March, and would have
     written you sooner but have been on duty ever since from this fact that we were ordered out on
     picket and the next morning after our return to camp where we remained until last evening.</p>
<p class="p10">We had a very unpleasant and disagreeable time coming down for it rained and snowed on as
     from the time we left Salem and the night we got to camp - I do not think I ever spent as
     unpleasant a night in my life as I did that night - it rained on us all night and we lay here
     in the woods without any tents or thing of the kind in the rain, and a very cold rain it was.
     This morning it is snowing very <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> deep snow -- I wish this bad <i>[unclear: spell]</i> of weather had come
     before we left home for I think we would have gotten another week or two to have stayed at home
     if there had been a pretty good snow fell the <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> before we <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> but wishing <i>[illeg.]</i> no good <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> declare this morning looks more like December than April well Winter <i>[deleted: ]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i>. oh well we will not have any fighting to do whilst the weather keeps bad, but
     we would rather see a little pretty weather now.</p>
<p class="p10">We have not got tents yet but we are tolerably well fixed up in camp if we were not, we would
     be in a nice fix today, for I never saw it snow much harder in my life than it is now.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, sis, you must excuse me for making this a short letter, as I have no news of interest
     to write you and the weather is so very bad that I can hardly write at all. Things are quiet
     along our lines and but little prospects of a fight for some days yet, and would to God that it
     could be settled without any more fighting.</p>
<p class="p10">We are getting tolerably good rations now--are drawing bacon and corn meal, and <u>a little coffee &amp; sugar</u>--enough to make a very good cup of
     coffee once a day and it well sweetened. Please excuse this short, badly written and
     disconnected letter and write soon, very soon and give me all the news. My love to you all and
     a kiss for William. Give my kindest regards to Mr. Nye &amp; family &amp; my very best
     love to Cousin John, folks. Excuse haste and write soon to </p>
<p class="p10">your brother, </p>
