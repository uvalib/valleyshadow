<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">As the months roll round they call loudly for "Reports."  Time passes very rapidly with us.  I cannot realize that it is six months since I arrived here but (what a change there has been in the colored people of Staunton in that time.  when I first came to this place if I would pass through the streets on the Sabbath I <i>[deleted: should]</i> would see perhaps a half Doz. groupes of boys, "shooting marbles" tossing cents etc. but now notice the difference.  Sabbath mornings at 9 O clock come with me up to the colored peoples Church where we hold our Sabbath School.  as you pass along<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> <i>[illeg.]</i> enter the Church and there we find our Scholars seated ready for their lessons.  I can hardly realize that they are the same Children.  it certainly shows that good has been done. but I claim none of the praise.  let us give it to him to whom all praise is due.</p>
<p class="p10">But I must not forget my week day School.  since I wrote you last I have promoted three classes to the "First Reader."  my first class will recite next month.  they are very much gratified with the idea of learning to "write their name."  next month I hope to have something of more interest to write you.</p>
<p class="p10">please remember us in your prayers for if there is any body that needs the prayers of God's people, it is the missionary.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully Submitted</p>
