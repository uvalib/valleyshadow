<h4>Augusta: Robert B. Spillman to Amanda C. Armentrout,
                    January 29, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert asks Kate to please share her fears with him so that he may offer her
                    comfort. He then talks of the especially harsh weather and the number of sick
                    soldiers (an "ill harvest") arriving at the hospital due to the cold.</p>

<p class="p10">Jan 29<sup>th</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Chimborazo
                            Hospital No 3 Richmond Va</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">Your very kind &amp; dear letter of the 21<sup>st</sup>
                    instant reached me safely <i>[deleted: a]</i> three
                    days ago which found me quite well &amp; truly glad to hear from you
                    &amp; to hear that <i>[deleted: you with]</i> your Fathers family were
                    well but I am very sorry to hear of your unpleasant feelings from the tone of
                    your letter you appear to be in a measure greatly troubled. Your language was such as would lead one to believe that you feel
                    like one forsaken, like one enshrouded with the dark shadows of gloom wending this way as it were in some isolated
                    region amid trials &amp; troubles unspeakable with no one to cheer you.
                        No sound of a merry or well known voice to break the stillness of the midnight hour. No strong arm to shield thy fragile form in the hour of apparent danger. No fond eye to
                    meet the steady gaze as <i>[added: you]</i> look to the dark
                    &amp; untried future. Dearest Kate, would that I
                    was capable to day of speaking to you with lanugage that would cheer your
                    drooping spirits, to <i>[deleted: clear]</i> remove the dark cloud from over your way &amp; brighten your path with the
                    briliant sunshine of joy &amp; consolation, but as it is using one of your
                    expressions "You must take the will for the deed." I am exceedingly anxious to
                    have the full <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>causes of your troubles not that I could feel that I
                    would be able to soothe <i>[added: you]</i> in the least but
                    I would be very glad to know all that in any way gives trouble or displeasure to
                    my dear &amp; ever faithful friend Kate. If the secret of your discomfort is
                    not too profound I will be much gratified to know all about it, with a promise
                    never to divulge it to any one. Well for a change of the
                    subject I will give you a little of the news of the day. It is generally believed that our Government is about to send
                    commissioners to confer with the Federal authorities preparatory to coming to
                    some terms of peace. May the blessed Lord grant that they
                    may be able to come to some honorable terms of peace.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather is extermely cold. We have a perfect ill
                    harvest just at this time. Well dear Kate you will have
                    to excuse my short letter. Please
                    don't think I am getting careless about writing, for I
                    assure you that nothing gives me more pleasure than to write &amp; receive a
                    letter from you for you are the only constant &amp; faithful correspondent I have. I hope when I hear from you again
                    that your letter may be teeming with good news, &amp; that you my dear
                    darling sister Kate may be your self again with my tender regards to the loved
                    ones at your home with much love for you dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">believe me to be your affectionate &amp; ever loving Brother</p>
