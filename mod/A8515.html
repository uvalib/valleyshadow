<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">By <i>[deleted: Mr. Hotchkiss]</i> I beg to write you for the purpose of
                    requesting you to <i>[unclear: raise]</i> me the $100 loaned you, in the course
                    of next week so that I may set off for Kentucky (on a
                    very "matrimonial enterprise" perhaps?) immediately thereafter. I hope it may
                    not be inconvenient for you to comply with this request by next Wednesday,
                    Thursday or Friday at farthest. Allow me to
                    present you my heartiest congratulations for your <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp;
                    happiest employment &amp; enjoyment of this new year upon
                    <i>[unclear: whose]</i> threshhold we have just entered. May you &amp; I
                    &amp; all dear to us be <i>[added: so]</i> prepared for
                    whatever events or realities may await us in the developments of the present
                    year, that we shall bear them with the purpose &amp; in the spirit of true
                    Christian philosophy, and if called = as many of our beloved friends have been
                    called in the year just closed = in the providence of God -- to cross the Jordon
                    of death before the dawn of "59" may we be fitted &amp; permitted to enter
                    into the blessedness, the happiness &amp; the glory reserved for the
                    righteous in heaven!!</p>
<p class="p10">Your very sincere friend &amp; kinsman =</p>
<p class="p10"><i>B Estill</i></p>
<p class="p10">Note Bene this note written
                        last week does not express my wishes just now. So you need not trouble
                        yourself to raise me this money till the last of next
                        week or the first of the week following or when I again call to see you.
                        Then I'll get you to look with me over the Miller decree &amp; so settle
                        the matter of difference with your Pa &amp; myself
                        yours<br>B Estill</p>
