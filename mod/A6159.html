     in hopes it had got well I hope this will reach you in due time I find you well hearty. this leaves me well only my bowels is not right yet I am as hearty as a pig, I have no news of interest to write I wrote to you the other day and give you all the
      news it is very cold weather
     here we have Snow at this time though I don't feel the affects of it I suppose the boys is seeing a very bad time
     they are about 40 miles below
     here
     near new market I understand they are furloughing all that is not able for service you wanted me to
     come home I would be gladder than you if
      possible
     there is no one would be gladder to see
     their family than I would at this time though
     my heavenly father will send me when he sees
     proper for I put my whole trust in him not in man I feel but little hopes of coming home before I go to my
      command unless I take relapse which I
     think there is no danger with care I was very
     glad to hear you<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>so keen as to make a little pocket change
