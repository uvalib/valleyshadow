<p class="p10">Oct 7. 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John.</p>
<p class="p10">I would have written to you before now but I have been sick for two or three days.</p>
<p class="p10">When I came home I fortunately met with your father, and talked over your affairs with him,
     and put at him to advance you $500. I did this for two reasons--first because I thought it was
     right--and secondly because I found it would be a difficult matter for <u>me</u> to spare the 500$ from the source I expected--or rather a doubtful matter for me to
     get it. Your father mentioned the stringency of money matters with him--and did not see
      <i>[unclear: well here]</i> he was to do it. I then proposed to advance $250 and that he
     should advance a like sum. He at once agreed to do this. The money to be sent you one day this
     week before I leave. We parted with that understanding.</p>
<p class="p10">On yesterday I was down street a little while &amp; met him again--He told me that after
     going home he thought over the matter--and as tight as money was with<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>him he had
     determined to lend you the whole amount himself--not as a Loan as I had proposed, but as an <u>advancement</u>--That that sum would do you more good now than would the
     amount hereafter--I told him I had no doubt of it and approved heartily what he proposed to
     do--So this matter is off your shoulders--I also named the Alec. Wills matter to him--but that
     is out of his power--and I cant see how that can be arranged--I wish it could for it would make
     you $600 very easily--But you will have to let it go unless you can strike some old fellow with
     money who will advance it and divide profits with you.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been unwell more or less ever since I came home--and for the two last days confined to
     the house with the same complaint I had in <i>[illeg.]</i>--It got a great deal worse--On
     Friday I sent for Dr. Baldwin who has put me nearly all right again. I hope by tomorrow to be
     entirely well--</p>
<p class="p10">I found a letter here awaiting<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>me on my return from <i>[unclear: Mr. McPhail]</i>.
     We leave for Kentucky on next Thursday--the 11th.</p>
<p class="p10">If I can get my matters fixed up tomorrow I will go to <i>[unclear: Charlotte]</i> on
     Tuesday--If I fail in this I will not leave till Thursday morning and then meet Mr. McPhail in
     Lynchburg Thursday morning.</p>
<p class="p10">All our folks are well--With love to Coz. Liz and the children, I am as ever</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. D. Imboden</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. When Old Dr. Coleman pays up send me a check for my fee as I shall
      be pretty hard up this fall</p>
