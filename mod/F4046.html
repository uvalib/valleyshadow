<p class="p11"><b>
     General A. L. Russell <br>
      Adjutant
      General of Pennsylvania
    </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct 3/62</p>
<p class="p10">Head Quarters 107th Regiment
       Pennsylvania Volunteers
       <br> Camp near Mercerville Maryland</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to briefly present for you information &amp; for that of his Excellency
     Governor Curtin, an account of the operation of the 107th
     Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, from the period I assumed the command until it arrived at
     Centreville on Sunday the 21st day of August, 1862.</p>
<p class="p10">I lost no time after receiving the Commission of his Excellency in proceeding to join the
     Regiment, which I found in Camp at Cedar Mountain about seven miles South of Culpepper
     Virginia. I found it organized into the Brigade, commanded by General A. Duryea, in the
     Division commanded by General Ricketts in the 3<sup>d</sup> Army Corps commanded by
      Major General
     <i>[unclear: Jhn]</i> Pope. </p>
<p class="p10">It was late in the night of August 13th, 1862 that I succeeded after great labor and diligent search amongst the multitude of camps that lined the hills and
      valleys of that region to find the Regiment. I found it under
     marching orders, and assumed the command in the morning, and at once took up the line of march
     for the Rapidan.</p>
<p class="p10">On the evening of the 17th we encamped on the outer line of our Army and near the Rapidan
     beyond which it was known that the enemy was in very strong force. On the next day after the
     usual inspections of the Sabbath &amp; the Guard mounting, we rested quietly in camp for a
     few hours, when exciting intelligence was re- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> ceived at Head Quarters of the
     Division and followed by prompt orders for the march, which was soon taken up northward, and
     continued far into the night, when a halt was ordered and the weary soldiers sunk upon the
     ground in order of battle -- This rest although surrounded by none of the usual comforts, was
     refreshing &amp; greatly needed, for the following days and nights taxed their energies and
     strength still more thoroughly. Having attained the north bank of the Rappahannock, after being
     a whole night &amp; day on the way, a day or two's rest were obtained with some fresh
     supplies of rations.</p>
<p class="p10">Whilst at this point (the Rappahannock station) the enemy appeared on the 20th as was
     supposed in force from the direction of Culpepper. There was some skirmishing. We had batteries
     on both sides of the river. General Pope, took his position on a
     little <i>[unclear: eminence]</i> in front of our Division, from which by signal flags he
     formed his line of battle. The enemy did not advance, and our Army bivouacked in the order of
     battle - the infantry drawn up in supporting columns, so as to be a sure &amp; convenient
     support to the batteries. The morning of the 21st found us in the same order which with but
     slight changes, was maintained during the day. The cannonading commenced about 10 oclock A.M.
     and continued with intervals during the whole day, but it was principally north west of our
     position, and with a different corps of our Army. During the 22nd most of the cannonading was
     in about the same quarter with the addition of some on our Regiment
     The enemy however, having secured positions during the night, opened on the morning of the
      23<sup>d</sup> with all their power directly on our point. This artillery battle
     continued for three hours, almost unabated, and with considerable effect on both sides. The
     enemy I think suffering considerably more than ourselves, as they advancing appeared more at a
     disadvantage, and our Artillery was better served. Lieutenant
     Godbold of Matthews'
     Pennsylvania battery lost <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> a limb
     by the Explosion of a shell just a little to our right and front. A shell exploded almost in
     the ranks of Company F of my Regiment, and fortunately only mortally
     wounded one &amp; very slightly one or two others of that company. Many narrow escapes were
     made during these three hours of Artillery battle. The soldiers stood it with a becoming
     courage. After it I felt a greater degree of confidence in my Regiment. This was the first time
     in which they had been very considerable length of time under fire.</p>
<p class="p10">There being a flood in the Rappahannock, and the temporary bridges having given way &amp;
     here coming down threatening to carry off the Rail Road Bridge, the point our Division was
     depending, our troops were under the necessity of evacuating the other side of the river, and
     withdrawing to the north side which was done in good time &amp; in good order and with
     little if any, loss on our side.</p>
<p class="p10">Soon we again took up the line of March (they were known to be flanking as in large force)
     and in the direction of Warrenton, understood as being in the hands of the enemy. The march was
     continued all day and up to about Eleven oclock at night, when we again bivouacked in a wood
     and forbidden from having any fires. The enemy had evacuated Warrenton, or had been driven out
     by our advance. We directed our march past the Town and towards the White Sulphur Springs about
     four miles south west of Warrenton, and encamped about three miles from the latter place. All
     day yesterday and today an Artillery fight was in progress several
     miles to the west or north west of us, understood to be with the corps of Burnside or Sigel.
     For two or three days McDowells Army corps kept possession of the region around about
     Warrenton, the White Sulphur Springs, and Waterloo, during which our men were short of rations,
     but making up the deficiency, so far as could be done by securing green corn, green apples,
     &amp;c. </p>
<p class="p10">On the 27th we left our camp west of Warrenton, our <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> march being through that
     place in the direction of Centreville but when arriving at a certain point we turned off to the
     westward toward Haymarket and <i>[unclear: know]</i> in <i>[unclear: face]</i> Gap, through
     which a day or two before Jackson had passed with a portion of his Army, and
     <i>[unclear: one]</i> which he was expecting reinforcements. He arrived, it is believed in
     time, to drive this (said to be Longstreets) force into and through the Gap or such parts of it
     as had emerged from the Gap. It was soon apparent that the enemy was in the vicinity and that
     there would be fighting. on passing through the village of Haymarket near two miles East of the
     Gap, those Regiments having knapsacks were required to leave them at that point. We continued
     to move forward, but with great caution. On arriving upon the point I was at once ordered with
     the 107th to the support of Captain Thomsons Pennsylvania battery on the right, and also to protect the Rail Road. At
     this time the fight had commenced briskly. I continued in the duty first assigned me until it
     was deemed proper to remove Thomsons battery, or that part of it, of which we formed the
     immediate support to the left and to another part of the field where other infantry support was
     convenient, when I was ordered forward to join the Brigade from which I had been temporarily
     detatched. Coming up to the position then occupied by General Duryea, I was at once ordered by
     him to march my Regiment to an eminence on our right and form line of battle along the crest of
     the hill, which movement was promptly executed, the men manifesting a most courageous spirit.
     Here we remained while the action lasted in support of Captain
     Matthews' (Pennsylvania) battery.</p>
<p class="p10">Our force at this place and engaged in this action was that of Ricketts Division, only,
     perhaps about 4000 men and I presume it was not intended or deemed safe, to remain between
     Jackson &amp; Longstreet, with a force utterly inadequate to contend with either - and
     besides it was understood that our orders had been filled and the purpose of the <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>
     Expedition accomplished. In leaving this ground we retraced our steps to the village of
     Haymarket in the night and thence to Gainsville, where we bivouacked for the remainder of the
     night, and at day light of the 29th, continued on march, taking the road directly to Manassas, where we arrived during the day and found the place
     unexpectedly in the possession of our troops. Our men being very much worn down by the almost
     incessant marching, excitement, and the irregularity in obtaining rations, were greatly in need
     of rest. As much time for this as possible was given, some two hours, and then the line of
     march was taken for the battle field, the battle then raging with great fury near the old Bull
     Run Battle ground. At the close of the day the Division arrived upon the ground, the battle
     still going on and our troops with cheers driving the enemy back. We bivouacked in the field
     while the balls &amp; shells of the enemy were flying over &amp; around us. Although
     upon the battlefield, and upon the <i>[illeg.]</i> of another in which it was known we were to
     take a part, our men I believe rested well and slept soundly.</p>
<p class="p10">Soon after day light of the 30th, the Regiment was in line on the right of the Brigade, which
     Brigade was on the right of the Division, the Division on the right of field, the 107th leaving
     during the operations of the day, being on the extreme right. We moved forward to the conflict,
     early in the morning. The firing of the skirmishers on the right had already begun, we were
     formed in line of battle on the extreme right of the field. We advanced over a ridge obliquely
     to the left, relieving the skirmishers on our point, and pushed forward to a position in the
     little valley beyond the ridge, a position considerably nearer the enemy then any previously
     occupied by any of our troops upon that part of the field.</p>
<p class="p10">Being in close proximity to the enemy whose sharp shooters were endeavoring to pick off our
     officers &amp; men, I sent forward to <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> guard against suprise, several small
     parties of skirmishers. The Regiments of our Brigade (97th, 104 &amp; 105th New York Volunteers) on our left soon began to fire frequent volleys - and this attracting the attention of the enemy, he turned the
     fire of a concealed battery upon us. The range being close, it was soon discovered that the
     fire would be, and indeed was being very effective, some in those Regiments &amp; in my own
     were already wounded, together with General Duryea, commanding the
     Brigade, his wound however being very slight. The General, now seeing that the position was an
     unnecessarily exposed one, gave an order to fall back in order to have the advantage of more
     favorable ground, as to have attempted to maintain this ground without a battery of our own to
     reply to that of the enemy's would have been a useless sacrifice of
     our brave men. The Regiments on our left hastily fell back, and in consequence of not receiving
     the order for some time after, I maintained my position, but in receiving it, I marched my
     Regiment back in good order and re-joined the Brigade. A new line was soon formed more in
     prolongation of the general line of battle, and some time after without pressure from the
     enemy, it was deemed expedient to retire temporarily a few hundred yards, to give room, as was
     at the time supposed for our Artillery to operate, company A (<i>[unclear: Doshumen]</i>) occupying the former position as a
     picket. The battle at this period appeared to have slackened by a partial cessation of fire on
     both sides. Soon however we were again advanced to our former position, with the encouraging
     word that the enemy was falling back! As we occupied the former ground the firing began to
     increase, both Artillery and Musketry, principally on the left of our line. For hours it
     increased in extent and volume. At about 5 oclock in the afternoon, the battle was appalling
     and terrific in the extreme. Our lines were giving way in the left (our left) and center. Gradually the Regiments on the left of our Brigade fell back and
     the enemy immediately in front in large force, with batteries advanced in close proximity, the
     Regiments on our immediate left &amp; in our own Brig- <br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br> ade fell rapidly to the
     rear, leaving my own Regiment the only one in position along the whole part of this part of the
     field. The firing was very heavy and being rapidly concentrated against us. Having by this time
     been flanked on both wings, our supports all gone, and in less that five minutes would have
     been surrounded by overwhelming numbers, we moved back in the direction of the Regiments that
      preceded us under a most destructive fire of Artillery &amp;
     Musketry, and at considerable loss in killed wounded and prisoners. Rallying the Regiment as
     speedily as possible, yet under the guns of the advancing enemy, in the growing darkness, and
     now meeting with the General of the Brigade, yet on the field although wounded, and with him at
     our head took up the line of march for Centreville where we arrived at the dawn of the next
     morning.</p>
<p class="p10">In reviewing the operations of the Regiment during the past
     fifteen days (previous to August 31st 1862) eventful as they have been, of which the foregoing
     is but a brief account, I am more impressed with its good conduct, and that it deserves well of
     the country and the great Commonwealth from which it came. Leading the Brigade that first
     opened the great battle early in the morning of August 30-1862, it has the satisfaction to know
     that it was the <u>last</u> of the whole Army engaged, to leave the line of
     that battle at the close fo the day. Unfortunate as the contest of this day may have been to
     the Army, and country, and deeply as we felt chagrined to have retired before the enemy, yet
     the Regiment feels confidently assured that none of the misfortunes are or can be chargeable to
     it, in any degree, as up tot he last moment and even long beyond any possibility of retrieving
     the reverse, did it maintain the forward and honorable position it occupied.</p>
<p class="p10">For an account of the losses, as well as the names of the officers who took an honorable part
     in these movements, I would refer you &amp; his Excellency the Governor to my official
     report to <br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br>
     General Duryea commanding the Brigade which I had the honor to
     forward you.</p>
<p class="p10">The 107th Regiment, it affords me pleasure to record was under fire in the closing part of
     the battle (being after dark) at "Cedar Mountain" August 9th, 1862, and was also in the line of
     battle, (although not engaged), at Chantilly September 1st 1862, in
     the former of which several were wounded, and should I receive reports of these operations from Lieutenant Colonel
      M<sup>c </sup>Allen, who was in command, I will take pleasure in forwarding them
     for the information of his Excellency the Governor.</p>
<p class="p10">I herewith enclose you a copy of the report of Captain
     <i>[unclear: J.]</i> Mac Thompson, of the gallant conduct of the Regiment in the battle of
     South Mountain &amp; Antietam, on the 14th and 17th days of September, 1862.</p>
<p class="p10">I am General very Respectfully Your obedient
      servant</p>
