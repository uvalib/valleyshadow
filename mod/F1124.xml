                <p>Your letter of the 21st came to hand yesterday evening.</p>
                <p>I was glad to hear from you and sorry to hear your wrists are lame.. I hope that
                    they will get well again.</p>
                <p>I got the envelopes that you sent. The one that directed the paper that you sent
                    some time ago and the envelopes. Tell him or her that they shall learn how to
                    make an A. I had trouble to get it.</p>
                <p>Now, you are anxious to know where Abraham and Ashway is-I got a letter from them
                    which I will enclose as I have not much time to write at present as it is time
                    for me to report.</p>
                <p>I am working at the Carpenty at Division's Headquarters. Yes, I must say that I
                    am very thankful for your trouble tending to Hiram. I shall pay you for it <orig
                        reg="somehow">some how</orig> or other.</p>
                <p>I am well-hoping that these few lines may <orig reg="find">finde</orig> you all
                    enjoying good health. I am getting as fat as a bear.</p>
                <p>A. and Asway lays about 20 miles from me. You will see why we do not go to see
                    each other. In his letters, your letters, I answer them as soon as I get them.</p>
                <p>Well, I write you a letter a week and sometimes 2 letters a week.</p>
                <p>Tell Rachel that I am well. I will soon write again.</p>
                <p>Send my watch as soon as possible. There is some talk of us going to Harrisburg
                    to do provost duty but I can't see it.</p>
                <p>Well, I would like to see you all but I can not go home now.</p>
                <p>But I will in hopes. Well, pay day is slow about coming but it will come. Well, I
                    must close. Write soon.</p>
