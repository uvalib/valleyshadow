<p class="p10">November 24, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Hon. T. Stevens:<br>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I expect to start to Washington in the Second day of Dec. to try and get some
                    petition there the present winter. I am acquainted with very few of the Congrefs
                    men. And as the member from this district is rather hard, I take the liberty of
                    writing to you hoping to have your influence and acceptance. I would not try for
                    any protection or be willing to be separated from my family, if it was not a
                    matter of necessity. I have suffered severely by Stewarts raid in October 1862.
                    And also by the last invasion of the Rebel army. And last, though not least, I
                    wish <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to be in Washington to try and if possible to get my son
                    released, or be able to minister to his wants. He in connection with eight other
                    of our citizens, were taken prisoners by the Rebel army on there retreat from
                    the battle of Gettysburg. My son had been in the nine months service, and had
                    been discharged a few weeks previous to the Rebel invasion, and was making
                    arrangements to again enter the service, and for which I am anxious for his
                    freedom.</p>
<p class="p10">Any thing you could do for me would be thankfully recd.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. H. McDowell</i></p>
