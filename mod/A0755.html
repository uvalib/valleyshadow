<p class="p10">November the 23 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Virginia Military Institute </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Papa </p>
<p class="p10">I had to write to you today as I have been put in a lower section in Math. I
                    commenced this letter yesterday and my heart was touched to the very core to
                    think of telling you that I had been put in a lower section &amp; As
                    Professor Miller did not do me justice about it I went to see him about it and
                    he looked at my marks before I went in the Hospital and found that I stood 3 in
                    the section on Marks &amp; I told him that I had not had time to get the
                    rules that the boys had gone over whilst I was in the Hospital and that If I
                        knew the rules I could keep up. He gave me a lesson
                    in the rules &amp; I hope now to take a higher position in my section than I
                    ever have held yet.</p>
<p class="p10">Tuesday the 11th was the 23 anniversary of Institute &amp; All duties were
                    suspended &amp; the day commenced as follows. The old Cadets hung &amp;
                    bucked every new cadet or rather Rats as they call us in Barracks. They got up
                        between 4 &amp; 5 and tried to catch us in bed
                    but we knew something was out and we were up as soon as
                    they. We had turkies Ham &amp; Rice for dinner. The Beef Sergeant bought 40 odd turkeys for dinner &amp;
                    there is not more than 225 boys here and we ate them all up &amp; every
                    thing else in proportion.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Uncle Archer I saw Mell yesterday. She says she wants 2 Winter dresses, says
                    someone stole the only thick dress she had, says the Captain of the boat says he
                    wants her next year, says he can get the money for her hire now if he wishes.
                    She told me this yesterday and asked me to write to him. </p>
<p class="p10">I am getting rather tired of guard duty as I have to go on 1 every week &amp;
                    stand 3 hours guard at night 1/2 or 3/4 in the day besides having to march on
                    &amp; off. I have gotten 27 demerits but have only 3 Academic reports, some
                    of the others are incorrect and a good many that I can get off with by writing excuses. One of the reports that I got 11 demerits
                    for nearly half of which I have gotten was giving notice that the inspector was
                    visiting which I think I can get off with it as the sentinals on post had always given notice to us that the inspector was
                    visiting and it was 2 or 3 time I was on post and I thought it was my duty to
                    give them notice. I haven't time to write more as I have to get ready for
                    church. Goodbye, love to all both white &amp;
                    black, </p>
<p class="p10">remain your Attached son, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Kent </i></p>
<p class="p10">PS love to all at Edgehill. Mell told me yesterday that
                        Emily told her that Will H was wounded is it so or not, love to cousin Milly
                        &amp; Hues, K. </p>
