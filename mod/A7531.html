<p class="p10">Dear Bro.</p>
<p class="p10">Your last is to Hand I will state I could not come to Staunton to depend Entirely
                    on the Cigar trade as I don't think it would pay us
                    both-- but if John will give us the Entire charge of the retail I would like to
                    Come to Staunton-- I now have a Very good Situation and it would be foolish in
                    me to throw it up for what you state can be done in Staunton I am like Every one
                    Else <i>[unclear: have]</i> a certain amount of Ambition and if I thought I
                    could do better in S-- than I can in W-- I can assure I would not hesitate to
                    come. I desire to get into business but to Enter into it the way you say-- don't you see it would be foolish as we would have to Keep our Money separate that would be difficult to do<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and cause some
                    dissatisfaction if John Wishes to retire from the store why does he hesitate to
                    give us the Entire charge both of us certainly would be competent to attend to
                    it-- you must write soon again and try John again; We
                    are all Well Business good love to all</p>
<p class="p10">Your Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Wm L. Evans</i></p>
<p class="p10">I did think I would come to Staunton but I can't get off as business
                        require all my attention &amp; is not at home much-- I want to come at
                        Christmas<br>Truly<br>Wm L. Evans</p>
