<p class="p10">April 24th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">No. 32 South 3rd St Phil<sup>a</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Patrick Brady of this city has a claim against Mr. Daniel C. E. Brady of
                    Buffalo Forge Va.; accounting to upwards of Fifty thousand dollars. The Claim
                    grows out of a partnership between them which was dissolved in 1857 and can
                    easily be established by the firm books, besides which Mr. Daniel C. E. Brady
                    gave his bond for $25,000 and for such additional sums as should be found due --
                    Patrick Brady agreeing not to prosecute the claims for two years from Feb 16/59.
                    The uncle of Daniel's wife (the late William Weaver of Buffalo Forge) left him a
                    property known <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>as the Bath Iron Works property -- near Lexington, and
                    gave the residue of his Estate to his <i>[added: (Daniel's)]</i> wife -- the personal property absolutely and the land and
                    slaves for life after her death, to her children in like manner as if she were a
                        <u>femme</u>
                    <u>covert</u> dying intestate.</p>
<p class="p10">The Iron works property consists of some 6800 acres &amp; was valued at
                    $12.000 or $15.000. The Buffalo Forge property -- about nine miles from
                    Lexington -- is more valuable, but I understand that in Virginia such a devise
                    given the children a vested Estate.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Daniel C. E. Brady offered, at first, to give the Bath Iron Works in
                    settlement &amp; after some hesitation Mr. Patrick Brady agreed to accept it
                    -- when his nephew refused to carry out his proposal. Mr. James Davideson of
                    Lexington is Daniel's counsel and can give you further information. If you can
                    give the matter your attention I will take charge of it. We shall be happy to
                    send you the paper. I know was said by the late Judge Thompson in the Course of
                    a very pleasant stage ride from Lexington to Staunton in Sept 1865. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I
                    inferred that you would probably attend to the matter, though at some his
                    distance from your home and have, therefore, taken the liberty of addressing
                    you. If Mrs. Thompson be still living in Staunton, I beg that you will make my
                    compliments to her. And believe me, Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully
                        yours</p>
