<h4>Franklin County: Horace Greeley to Edward McPherson,
                    November 4, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Horace Greeley urges Edward McPherson to support Thaddeus Stevens, who formerly
                    lived in McPherson's district, for the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
                    in the House.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">November 4, 1859</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse the liberty I take in making a few <i>[unclear: suggestions]</i> with
                    regard to the organization of the House. I write to you because since you
                    represent the district in which Mr. Thaddeus Stevens formerly lived, I presume
                    what I have to say will meet your concurrence and perhaps secure your
                    cooperation.</p>
<p class="p10">It seems to me desirable that Mr. Stevens should be Chairman of the committee of
                    Ways and Means of the new House. I know no other mem- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>ber thereof who
                    is his superior in ability, in experience, or in the earnestness of his devotion
                    to those principles which I trust the Union is about to stamp with its approval.
                    It seems exceedingly desirable, moreover, that the action of the house, at
                    least, on the Tariff question should be in <i>[unclear: accordance]</i> with
                    the wishes and the interests of Pennsylvania. Who understands these better or
                    can't <i>[illeg.]</i> them more eficiently than Thaddeus Stevens? I know of no
                    one.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. John <i>[unclear: Sherman]</i> of Ohio seems almost certain to be Speaker --
                    provided we triumph in the organization. It seems to me but <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>reasonable that, if Ohio has the Speaker, we should concede the position of
                    leader on the floor to Pennsylvania, provided the latter present one of her
                    foremost men and <i>[unclear: bless]</i> him with reasonable unanimity. Now I
                    fear that Mr. James H. Campbell, having been a member of the Ways and Means in
                    the XXXIVth Congress, may insist on being Chairman -- or at least on that
                    Committee -- now, and so divide your delegation and throw that position out of
                    your State. I cannot, of course, interpose against Mr. Campbell; but <u>you</u> can do much that I cannot. Are you disposed to
                    consult your Members, and ascertain how many of them can be induced to write in
                    requesting the appointment of Mr. Stevens to this important post? I write <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> only to <u>suggest</u> what seems to me
                    important, especially for your State, which must be heartily with us in '60 or
                    we lose the fight. If you disagree with me, drop me a line; at all events,
                    consider this letter confidential and believe me</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Horace Greeley</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable
                            Edward McPherson,<br> Gettysburg,<br>
                            Pennsylvania
                    </p>
