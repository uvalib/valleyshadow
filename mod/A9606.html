<p class="p10">Dec 8<sup>th</sup> 1870</p>
<p class="p10">New York</p>
<p class="p10">My own darling-</p>
<p class="p10">Your sweet letter of the 5<sup>th</sup> has just been received and although I wrote you last night, I do so
                    again, here in my office, send on this formidable looking business sheet of
                    paper. You say you are going to Brunswick next week, and this may reach you
                    before you start. I am so sorry your sister Ella's letter has unsettled your
                    mind again as to the time. You now say <u>May</u> instead of
                        <u>March</u>. Well let it stand till I see you, and I am
                    sure we can agree. And if you are not a very firm and obstinate little woman I
                    will argue you into my views or be greatly mistaken.</p>
<p class="p10">You have heard "jokes" on me? And want to know when I saw Miss Parke Perkins of
                        Prince Edward. I saw the lady you mention in Prince Edward during the fall, though she does not live
                    there. She &amp; I were reported months ago to be engaged &amp; have had
                    a good deal of fun over it. We are the very <u>best</u> of
                        <u>friends</u> - <u>nothing more</u>,
                    &amp; I hope we shall never be less. She is not a marrying woman - declares
                    she never will marry any man upon earth, &amp; I believe she will not. <u>She certainly will never marry me</u>. She is a Poet of a
                    good deal of genius &amp; I have several of her poems now in my hands to
                    have published - besides she is very beautiful. Now aren't you jealous? She sometimes comes to Richmond &amp; when you
                    are mistress of my household I shall want you to invite her to visit us. If
                    there had been any truth in our reported engagement, I shouldn't have so
                    hopelessly fallen a victim in Mecklenburg last August. I don't deny that I felt <i>[added: once]</i> mighty
                    tender towards Miss Parke, but it has all ended in nothing but an abiding
                    friendship - and when I see her in Richmond this winter I'll tell her I belong
                    to you, and ask her if she isn't sorry?</p>
<p class="p10">Now what are the other "jokes" - I am honest &amp; own up to the truth like a
                    man. I send you a slip from a Richmond paper of this week showing how near you will have a church to go to.</p>
<p class="p10">Devotedly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
<p class="p10">Why don't you write me a full
                        account of the Concert. Tell me what you sung, &amp; all the Compliments
                        you received. If I had been there I expect I
                        should have run upon the stage and kissed you "right out in meetin." What
                        are the "ugly words" you are mad about in my letter? I always try to use
                        sweet words to my dearest little sweetheart. "Bye bye" with a kiss.</p>
