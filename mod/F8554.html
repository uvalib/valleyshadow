<p class="p10">December 28<sup>th</sup> 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Sidney Ohio</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Uncle,</p>
<p class="p10">I will commence this letter by offering you apologies innumerable for not writing
                    before. Your's of the 14<sup>th</sup>, is duly received with another
                        <i>[deleted: whome]</i> whose date I "disremember". I am glad to hear
                    that you are fixed so comfortably in Washington and hope you may ever be so.
                    Sleighing has been "splendid", but to-day it has thawed and this evening I am
                    afraid, finishes sleighing until next snow. I have sleighing a good many times
                    this winter and I have had more fun than a little. Skating has also been good,
                    but is now in the same condition as sleighing. Uncle is away now; he went down
                    to Cincinnati this morning. School has closed <i>[deleted: U]</i> until the
                    third day of January. Deer are brought into town very frequently &amp;
                    indeed, game of all kinds abounds. Rabbits, quails, deer and many other kinds
                    are brought in town almost daily. I have attended several parties <i>[deleted: ]</i> the last month <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>&amp; this and have experienced a great deal of
                    pleasure at each. Christmas or rather Saturday, the day kept as Christmas, was
                    decidedly dull and I guess New Year's will not be much, if any, better. The
                    Library of the Union School is very much frequented and I do not know what I
                    should do in the way of reading if it were not here. It is open every Saturday
                    from the hours of ten to twelve to everybody, who chooses to go there. I confess my stock of news is run out <i>[deleted: an]</i> &amp; also my inclination to write<i>[deleted: s]</i>.
                    Please answer soon--</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate nephew</p>
