<p class="p10">Saturday Night -- Aug. 24<sup>th</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Ever Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you a week ago from Huntersville &amp; have thought every day since that I
     could write to you again, but time, fully occupied, has passed on rapidly and now I am at the
     close of another week, and I did not know it my dear, until I asked, that it was Saturday night
     so completely does war unhinge all ones ideas of the lapse of time -- and I am afraid I shall
     have no Sunday tomorrow for maps are wanted &amp; the information is at hand and I must put
     it down -- You can judge how busy I am when I tell you that I had two <u>newspapers</u> lent me today &amp; did not read them had to return them unread -- and
     that is really strange for me you know well -- But I must go back and give you an account of
     the days -- and by the way -- I intend to send you a journal of my doings, seeings &amp;c
     and you must keep it, for that is the only way I can have one kept -- and you will be glad to
     know what I am daily doing -- Sunday Aug. 18 I spent in Huntersville -- it rained very hard all
     day -- no half way work about it, and the streams got very full I read &amp; wrote some
     &amp; talked with Capt. Moorman of the Greenbrier Cavalry, who had by our permission had
     his bed put on the floor in the room where we stayed -- as we had a fine place &amp; some
     fire &amp; so had expelled some of the chilly dampness &amp; gotten rid of the sickly
     smell that pervaded everything there -- Dr. Butcher is my bed fellow -- a kind hearted man from
     Randolph County -- I wrote to you about him -- I declare I must quit --
     the old tallow dip we have is so bad that I cannot see -- so good night &amp; may God be
     with you all --</p>
<p class="p10">Sunday Night 8 P.M.</p>
<p class="p10"> I am seated again at my barrel head to write to my beloved -- this has been a glorious day
     -- sunshiny &amp; clear, the 3 <sup>rd</sup> one of the same sort that we have
     &amp; it has been a quiet one -- though there has been a good deal of stir too -- the
     changing of guards the parties at work on the road -- the making of a coffin near me, for one
     of the Pittsylvania boys that died just below us, on the hill side &amp; then the train
     that went along to the burial -- but I have been in my tent nearly all day -- went down to the
     Artillery Camp, about a mile &amp; a half <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to get a box to put paper &amp;
     drawings in -- and then got 2 lbs. of hard biscuits from the commissary &amp; a pound of
     candles, on my way back -- that was at noon after I had been at work all the morning putting
     down information on maps that the Gen. wanted at once -- and as I supposed he know the wants of
     the service &amp; it was a work of necessity I went at it with a will &amp; worked
     quite hard -- after a breakfast of our own getting up -- by the aid of Charley Woods -- the
     Springs fellow that got into the scrape about Mary Burns, you remember &amp; he sleeps in
     my tent -- we had some honey that Dr. Butcher got yesterday -- wish you
     had some of it -- and Charley got us some bread -- flat heavy, inch thick stuff -- and on that
     we breakfasted -- our first meal under our new messing arrangements -- but more of what I have
     done &amp;c in the eating line -- after breakfast I worked at a map of the country between
     here and Huttonsville -- the Gen. wants to understand fully all the points of the country
     before he makes a move &amp; I do not suppose it will be long before one is made -- well
     while I was gone to the commissary's after the hard bread -- the Dr. baked 15 potatoes -- we
     bought a bushel of fine ones yesterday for $1.25 &amp; after I got back I cut up 2 onions
     -- I bought 9 of them yesterday for 10 cents -- put salt &amp; vinegar on them -- begged
     the salt of the Reg. Commissary of Col. Gilhorn's Regiment -- and
     drew a pint of vinegar from the Commissary on my own account -- so we
     ate roasted potatoes, salt, onions &amp; hard bread for dinner &amp; I relished it much
     -- for we have been eating since we came here with the Randolph boys &amp; they only have
     bread &amp; meat -- the flat, greasy bread of the camp -- then I worked all the P.M. -- one
     fellow that had been with us went out &amp; got a 2 quart basin full of blackberries -- the
     sweet ones -- such as grow in N. Y. -- at dark I quit work &amp; got supper -- Woods had
     bought a small Coffee Pot -- so I rinsed it out &amp; made it full of
     tea -- some of that you sent me -- it made me think of home -- made it first rate - - got a
     handful of sugar from the Commissary -- I intend to draw some for myself tomorrow -- then
     washed our cups -- (the Dr. went off through the country &amp; found at a store 4 cups
     &amp; saucers, white, with handles on &amp; one tin basin) -- put out a nice saucer
     full of honey comb -- poured out 3 cups of tea -- set out the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the blackberries and
     put out some hard bread all on my barrell head &amp; we sat down,
     on the half flour barrel seats -- and I lit a candle -- had borrowed a candlestick from my
     Boss, Major Williams and we went at it, and I tell you I ate a huge supper &amp; enjoyed it
     much --a quiet cup of tea -- good hard bread -- I have learned to like it -- good honey
     &amp; blackberries -- it was so good after the hard fare we have had lately -- I ate long
     &amp; the Dr. &amp; Mr. Crouch that has been with us today did the same -- Woods does
     not yet mess with us -- but he took a cup of my tea &amp; a cracker &amp; said it was
     so good it made him think of his home &amp; mother -- as he was not very well -- after
     supper I washed up the cups &amp;c -- the water is but 10 feet from my tent -- runs out of
     the side of the hill and seated myself to write to you -- after spreading out my hay &amp;
     straw at one end of the tent &amp; putting down my two blankets &amp; quilt &amp;
     the Dr went to bed &amp; Woods was already there -- the play being as follow -- the door of
     the tent facing the E &amp; the end of Cheat Mt -- [DRAWING OF TENT] My bed is the wide
     space across the end -- rail outside &amp; in -- Woods has the same fix on the left side --
     only narrower -- &amp; up near the head of his bed he has two posts driven into the ground
     &amp; boards nailed on for seat &amp; table -- then you see my barrel seat &amp;
     table &amp; up in the corner <i>[illeg.]</i> are stowed away bags &amp;c. There goes
     the tattoo -- drums above and drums below -- but I shall not quit -- they are not as rigid here
     about lights as they were at Rich Mt. -- and there go the taps -- for putting out fires
     &amp;c -- and now the whole camp is one vast roll call -- every Co. has its roll called now
     -- before going to bed and I can hear it now on every side</p>
<p class="p10"> But I must go back &amp; tell you about coming here from H-- Monday Morning -- yes
     Sunday evening -- who came to my room do you -- think -- why Darnall -- who formerly lived
      in Mt. Solon &amp; married Dr. Hopkin's sister &amp; told me he
     was coming out this in a top buggy in the morning to near this place -- after a brother-in-law
     who was sick and had dropped out by the way side -- and he heard I wanted to come out &amp;
     he would bring me &amp; I thought of coming -- but in the morning it was muddy the mud deep
     &amp; the Dr. had not got the wheel we broke fixed, so I could not leave him. D. started
     but he soon came back -- covered in mud, after help -- his horse had stuck fast in a mud hole
     -- but he got help &amp; went &amp; brought back his <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> the buggy &amp;
     left it in H -- &amp; he went on on horseback We i.e. the Dr. &amp; myself then went
     hired a wagon &amp; hauled rails we got of the landlord to the shop to put on the tire --
     the only dry wood we could find, it had rained so long that everything was soaked, then he got
     a man from Capt. Moorman's Company that he knew -- a blacksmith -- to
     come &amp; helped put on the tire &amp; so by dint of work
     &amp; management we got fixed to start after dinner -- We took down Knapp's Creek -- a
     stream as large as Middle River -- found the mud very deep -- we were just behind a long train
     of wagons &amp; so we went very slowly -- we at last got by them and at Greenbrier River
     bridge we met John Arbuckle -- he had been home for a new horse -- he belongs to the Greenbrier
      Cavalry &amp; told us about the skirmish on the Sewell Mt. which
     you no doubt have heard of -- then we crossed the river -- a large stream even there -- where
     are the famous <i>[unclear: Morlin's]</i> bottoms -- splendid flat land -- and there the rain
     began to poor down in torrents -- and we rode some distance in it came up to
     <i>[unclear: Edray]</i> -- 12 miles from H -- and there turned off the main road some distance
     to Mr. Pogue's at the head of the Indian Draft -- to get lodging -- they somewhat reluctantly
     took us in as there were already some 8 there before us. -- You have no idea how the country
     gets filled up with the sick &amp; stragglers -- but we got in -- got a good supper of
     Maple Molasses, good bread &amp; milk and stewed fruit -- then sat down &amp; got dry
     by the side of a blazing fire in a wide chimney -- talked over a good many things with the
     Lunenburg boys we found there &amp; then went weary to rest in a very good bed in the upper
     story, which was all one room -- &amp; full, as is usual of the wealth of the Mountaineer
     -- a loom with a web in it -- a long table full of sugar loaves, made in tin pans -- piles
     &amp; bundles of everything -- saddles -- yarn -- sheep skins &amp;c &amp;c and of
     course we slept well -- </p>
