<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter friday come thursday I am at Aunt Sallies at this time
                    come yesterday evening Eliza Estaline Elec are here
                    Elec and I are going to M<sup>r</sup> Shueys this evening going home tomorrow Miss Lizzie Strain and I come to M<sup>r</sup> Shueys Wednesday
                    evening. Eliza Es and Elec come to M<sup>r</sup> Shuey friday evening yesterday we went to
                    Staunton. Elec got your letter down and one from Henry both were written the 6
                    both come thursday I was glad to hear from you both. I
                    am sorry cannot get home. what ever you do do not you ask for a transfer for cavalry for if you get a transfer to the valley in infantry you cannot stand the march and will get home that is all the hope I have
                    for you to get home and that is Henrys hope <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>we got a letter from
                    Henry a few days before Henry wrote to you he hadn't
                    heard from you since he left
                        there
                    said he was disappointed
                    you didn't get off but hoped
                    you might get a transfer to
                    the valley if you couldn't get off I think your best
                        chance is to get a transfer to infantry if you go to cavalry
                    you are in for the war, if you live you will see that. Henry and Frank Mc. have been transferred to the
                    4 Company
                    Liberty Hall Va. the same Company Baxter was in it was Franks doings they didn't want to separate you try for the
                    same if you can get in I would much rather they both had stayed in the Middle
                    Brook Co but as it is you three had better be together when we send to one send
                    to both if any thing happens one we can
                    hear
                    from one or the other as we are so close. Do the best you can and trust in the Lord he can take care
                    of each one of us we are getting a long very well
                        considering you both a way if your health and lives are spared we can sort of make out a while. Jinnie and Bec went home yesterday Eliza met
                    them friday they were going to their Uncles friday night. Jinnie has
                    her
                    veil I think <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br><i>[illeg.]</i> the one <i>[deleted: ]</i> hundred couldn't take that one but
                    told Elec to go to new Port and report what one to let them have but I told Elec
                    to <i>[unclear: write]</i> H geff and to get off if he I must close w<i>[added: r]</i>ite soon they all send their love to you</p>
