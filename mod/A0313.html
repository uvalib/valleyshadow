<p class="p10">Mss Rate,</p>
<p class="p10">As I am not on duty this morning I will drop you a few lines and give you some of
                    the news we have had stirring times since we have
                    been in Camp we got to camp 8 miles below Winchester last Friday evening on
                    monday morning we met the enemy near Bruce Town they came up on 3 sides and
                    nearly cut us off before we could get out they commenced firing on us from 3 sides we had to fall back a good many of the
                    brigade were wounded 2 young Shepherds were wounded one of them I think mortally
                    John N. Wheat was badly wounded in the shoulder but I don't think it is
                    dangerous I brought him off the field after riding a piece we overtook Fielden
                    Templeton who came with us as soon as we found the doctor he dismounted <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to have his wound dressed but the Yanks
                    pressed us so hard we had to mount and double quick John got very sick I was afraid he would faint and fall off if he had the
                    yanks would of gotten him for they were in sight of us after we passed through
                    Winchester I thought he was safe we traveled nearly all night to keep a head of
                    the army then could hardly do it for John was not able to ride fast the army
                    fell back to Fishers Hill that night we got about 1 1/2 miles above Tuesday
                    morning I turned back and joined the command I hope John will have luck to reach
                    home safe when you write please let me know how he is. Risk Shewy must be
                    captured his horse was shot in the leg we have not heard
                    from him nor horse since the last time he was seen he was trying to lead his
                    horse off the enemy were then close on our rear Glendy's horse was shot dead [last page missing]</p>
