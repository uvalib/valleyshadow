                <p>I wrote you some two or three months ago and as there were two or three letters

                    them reached their destination. They were sent to our office during our rainy
                    spell &amp; as our mails frequently came up more or less<del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <unclear>and</unclear> by the sudden showers, it is likely the letters shared at

                    us other tricks by his negligence.</p>
                <p>In my letter I conveyed a wish from all the family &amp; particularly from
                    Henry that you would permit Sandy to pay us a visit and <unclear>uitie</unclear>
