<h4>Augusta County: James R. McCutchan to Rachel Ann
                    McCutchan, March 21, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McCutchan writes of his boredom in camp and their diminishing rations. He writes
                    that he longs to "fight it out," instead of sitting around and waiting.</p>

<p class="p10">March 21st, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Greenbrier County, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Rate,</p>
<p class="p10">I am determined that you shall not quarrel with me the next time I see you for
                    not writing to you; though I am sure I have written several letters that you do
                    not get, but I am determinded to comply with your wishes, while there is paper
                    ink or pencils in the Confederacy - It is almost night; I have been busy to day
                    - on review drilling etc. I just finished my dinner of
                    bean-soup + biscuit. </p>
<p class="p10">General Breckenridge is here + I think if our rations
                    get much less, General Starvation will be here also or
                    Gen. "Skidaddle" to a quarter where there is more to eat. - Gran. + myself got
                    here safely, but had a tiresome ride over bad roads.</p>
<p class="p10">I got a letter from you when I returned, + also one from Lydia + one from Cousin
                    Mollie. </p>
<p class="p10">I'm getting awfully tired of this camp, I despise this inactivity. I am tired of
                    the war - I wantto fight it out, + the sooner we begin this spring the better. </p>
<p class="p10">We had a grand sight here last night. The mountains around us were literally mountains of fire. It burned all round our
                    cabins + what do you think we did - we just let it burn - I have to reduce
                    myself to half a sheet as paper is scarce just at this
                    time. We can buy nothing here now - nor can we, I suppose until the new money is
                    issued - give my best love to all + write soon, assured that I will do the same.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. R. McCutchan</i></p>
