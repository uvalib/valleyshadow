     <salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I am in receipt of your kind letter. I will avail myself of your <unclear>generous</unclear>.
     &amp; I feel, very efficient will in securing to me my restoration. I suppose none of the
     bills passed at the late session, although I have not yet heard, and it may be <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     to renew the application at once. &amp; I beg if you think so, that you will
     <unclear>put</unclear> me in the Docket for earliest action, as also the name of <hi
      rend="underline">Dr. Stribling</hi></p>

    <p>My original application was made more than <unclear>five</unclear> months ago <hi
      rend="underline">
      <unclear>instance</unclear>
     </hi> of the military authorities of this state. &amp; I believe this Dr <abbr
      expan="Stribling">S</abbr> of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> were of the earlier problems from this quarters. They were warmly recommended
     by <unclear>
      <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>
     </unclear>
     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. I understand &amp; <unclear>forwarded</unclear> by him, but having no
     "engineer" in Washington, they were <orig reg="probably">probally</orig> "pigeon holed". Some
     months ago I had them renewed, they were recommended by <unclear>Genl</unclear> Mumford,
     Wickham, Mr <unclear>Steams</unclear> &amp; others, leading Republicans of Richmond.
     &amp; presented by Senetor Willey, and since then in the lower house in several shapes. -
     My name was put on a house bill in the Senate with others &amp; in that way was sent back
     and has I fear perished.</p>

    <p>There is opposition to me before the Richmond <pb n="2"/> Committee, I understand. The reason
      <hi rend="underline">
      <orig reg="assigned">assyned</orig>
     </hi> is that I was nominated to preside by <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr>
     <unclear>Fontenius'</unclear> friends at the late R.R. meeting. That by accepting the
     nomination I put myself in opposition with Republicans who were for <abbr expan="
General"
     >Gen</abbr> Wickham. This is an <hi rend="underline">assigned</hi> reason &amp; <abbr
      expan="General">Gen</abbr> Wickham condemns it, and is one of my best friends. I have reason
     to believe that the opposition is in part from this place. Mr <unclear>Fullz</unclear> is
     chairman of Republican committee - <hi rend="underline">to be <del rend="none" hand="h1"/></hi> &amp;
     apprehends if I get eligible I <orig reg="maybe">may be</orig> in his way. Curse him! I <orig
      reg="don't">dont</orig> want it. I refused it twice from Mr. Pierpont. Another enemy is Mr.
     Ally Gene Bowden the reason he will not give but certain records missing the rolls in Richmond
     will show. I was chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature to visit <hi rend="underline">
      <abbr expan="Williamsburg">Wmsburg</abbr>
     </hi> &amp; investigate abuses in the Lunatic Asylum. His family were deeply <hi
      rend="underline">implicated.</hi>
     <unclear>He</unclear> was promised that when his brother was a candidate for the Legislature he
     (the Ally) offered the offices &amp; interests of the institution to those who
      <unclear>meld</unclear> vote for his brother - &amp; the result was that those who did not
     so <hi rend="underline">vote</hi> were either themselves or their friends who had places turned
     out, this was the testimony. He appeared before the Committee afterwards &amp; moved to
     have the testimony offering him stricken out because he was not a <hi rend="underline"
     >party</hi> to the record. &amp; I overruled his motion- was sustained by a unanimous vote.
     &amp; he ceased to speak to me. &amp; now wants his <hi rend="underline">revenge</hi>.</p>
