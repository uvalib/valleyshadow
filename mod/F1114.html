<p class="p10">December 23, 1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father---</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday, I was detailed on fatigue duty. But this is nothing, of times I set
                    down to write. Well, about the time I commence I must go and do something else.
                    Either go out on picket or camp guard. There is no use to say that you will not
                    do it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have seen men as Abraham calls it-hitched with his back to a tree-his arms
                    around the tree and his hands tied together around the opposite side of the
                    tree. They don't give a man of this kind a chance to put on his gloves or they
                    don't care whether it is raining or not. Since I have
                    been in the service I have obeyed my officers.</p>
<p class="p10">Last night it snowed some. The ground was covered but the sun is shining. Now the
                    wind is rising and it is pretty cold and has been for the last week back.</p>
<p class="p10">We have middling good quarters. About as good as that
                    pig pen in front of your barn only we have a chimney in our cabin.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 18th of this month I saw a deserter shot. His name was William Devo,
                    Company B 57th Regiment
                    New York Volunteers This was a
                    solemn sight our whole Division was present. No doubt you have read the account
                    of it in the papers.</p>
<p class="p10">And I expect you read about our reconnoitering toward the later part of
                    November.</p>
<p class="p10">I could give you a regular history of all my travels and all that I have seen
                    since I left home. I have it noted down in a book.</p>
<p class="p10">But when I set down to write a letter home I must hurry it over. As often I am
                        interrupted before I get through.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard anything from
                    Abraham
                    Rosenbery or Ashway since the 26th of November. But I
                    suppose they are in front of us somewhere.</p>
<p class="p10">If Rineman gets that watch fixed, I would like to have it for these cold nights.
                    I think that the corporals make 2 pretty long hours for one to stand on post. I
                    know that I have stood 3 hours before I was released.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not received any letter from you for some time. I don't doubt that you write often enough
                    but I do not get them. I know that you do not get all the letters that I write.</p>
<p class="p10">You may send me some postage stamps, if you please as I am out.</p>
<p class="p10">Send the watch as soon as you can. You might send in a letter a pegging awl and a sewing awl and some bristles so that I can make my boots last.</p>
<p class="p10">I want to save the money that I can as it is hard earned.</p>
<p class="p10">I will write to you as often as I can. I will average a letter a week if
                    possible.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not written any letter to John Markey yet. I
                    expect he looks for some money.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope that we will soon be paid again. I could write you a dozen sheets full if
                    I had time. I must close for the present.</p>
<p class="p10">So farewell, Father.</p>
<p class="p10">Your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
