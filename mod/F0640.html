<p class="p10">Lovetsville Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 28<sup>th</sup>, containing your Photograph, =
                    I think it looks very natural indeed, == although it appears that you have changed your, appearance since I saw you last, == I also received the pocket Handkerchief you sent by way of Lieut. <i>[unclear: 
                        Anglun
                    ]</i>, == He did not tell me that he <i>[unclear: upset]</i> on his way
                    home through Providence, = But I plagued him, about it.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell mother that I won't be home till my time of
                    Enlistment is expired, == I have very good situation, at present, == if I should
                    go home they would have to Detail, another man in my
                    place to show, == And very likely I wouldn't get back to the same Establishment, again, == Therefore I
                    wish to be excused from going home, == I hope you
                    won't feel any bad about me not accepting a furlough, == I can remain
                    here until my term of service is Expired, and I won't
                    have to do any Duty in the field
                    of Battle whatever, == I will be free from, all Engagements during the coming
                        campaign if I remain here, at Brigade Head
                    Quarters, == So you must not be unconcerned about me not coming home, == <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> There are six of us Blacksmiths here together,
                    and we, always have comfortable quarters, = And
                    always get rations of the very best and Double the rations of, all others
                    because we do more Duty. = We are boarding with a family here in town and are
                    having the very best of times, =</p>
<p class="p10">So when I come home it will be for good not a furlough, - I am perfectly well and I hope this will
                    find you, all Enjoying a good <i>[unclear: 
                        great
                    ]</i> way of life,</p>
