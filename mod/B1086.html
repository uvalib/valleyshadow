<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to
                    Orlando Brown, February 12, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McDonnell's report sums up his impression of the case against Frederick Tukey in
                    Staunton, and directs General Brown's attention to the evidence submitted with
                    the report.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">February 12<sup>th</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully returned to Brevet Brigadier General O. Brown with the enclosed evidence, and
                    following report.</p>
<p class="p10">First: As to selling clothing sent Mr Tukey for gratuitous distribution. From the
                    evidence of Reverend James Scott, Oscar Morris, Henry
                    Davenport, and the admission of Mr Tukey himself, it appears he sold clothing
                    sent him for gratuitous distribution by benevolent societies. What quantity was
                    sold or amount realized from such sales I am unable to say. Mr Tukey in his
                    conversation with Reverend Mr. Lawson said Eleven (11)
                    dollars was the amount, while his own statement admits eleven (11) dollars and
                    some cents. <u>No record</u> of sales, or cash received was
                    kept by Mr Tukey, and consequently no evidence as to the amount being large or
                    small could be obtained. Mr Tukey in <i>[unclear: extenuation]</i> says
                    authority was subsequently obtained from the Society furnishing the clothing,
                    for its sale, but that evidence cannot be produced by him. Again he says Mr
                    Scott and himself sold the clothing to aid the Methodist Church, but the
                    philanthropy or charity of enriching a church at the expense of naked women and
                    children is as questionable as it was clearly outside Mr Tukey's duty to be
                    engaged in such traffic while employed as an officer of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="p10">Second: As to the reputation he acquired among the several classes of the people.
                    In the absence of the assessor of Internal Revenue to whom my attention was <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>directed in this connection, I took the evidence of the most
                    respectable and intelligent colored people, also the teachers and Mr Graham,
                    with such evidence as Mr Tukey himself could provide, and I am clearly of the
                    opinion from the evidence taken, that those having business with Mr Tukey have
                    no confidence in him, and with them at least his reputation is doubtful.</p>
<p class="p10">Third: As to the manner in which his office was conducted. With the exception of
                    a "Memorandum book of complaints" no records were kept by Mr Tukey during his
                    former administration. That book and a few letters received and filed, are the
                    only evidence that remains to show that the Bureau then existed there. Since Mr
                    Tukey has been re-instated, he has kept no records whatever. He says he has made
                    application for a letter book, but where, when, or to whom, does not appear. He
                    certainly has not done so to me. The letters testifying to Mr Tukeys character
                    and standing in society received subsequent to my visit to Staunton are
                    respectfully forwarded herewith, and attention <i>[unclear: directed]</i> to
                    them. Not deeming it my <i>[unclear: province]</i> to seek grounds for further
                    accusations, I have confined myself as closely as practicable to the
                    instructions received. In reference to Lieutenant
                    Cook no evidence was obtained to show that he disposed of any clothing, while
                    the repuation he acquired seems to be as good as could reasonably be expected.
                    Mr Tukey charges that he was frequently in the teachers rooms after hours, <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>but Mrs Tukey or Mrs Dunn, although in the same house, say nothing
                    about <i>[added: it]</i> in their sworn statements. In his
                    office but one book was kept by Lieutenant Cook,
                    namely a "Memorandum Book" containing a record of complaints and occasionally an
                    endorsement and a letter received, the whole very unintelligible, confused, and
                    insufficient. In the administration of cases brought before him, it appears he
                    gave satisfaction as nothing is known to the contrary.</p>
<p class="p10">In conclusion the attention of General Brown is invited
                    to all the papers in the case which together with this report, is respectfully
                    submitted.</p>
