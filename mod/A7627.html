<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, June 9, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and states he is doing well in Staunton, which is now
                    occupied by Federal troops. He reports that many of the officers have been
                    staying at the Hotel, and there is little disruption in daily life. He expresses
                    impatience with life separated from his family by war, and hopes to wrap up his
                    business in Staunton and move home. He also discusses financial and family
                    matters.</p>

<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I have an opportunity &amp; write you by US
                    mail. I am here at home and quite well except some of the Rheumatism still
                    remaining in my bones. The Federal forces are here in force most of the officers
                    are stopping at my house I have had General Hunter &amp; staff here most of the time all have behaved
                    quite gentlemanly here &amp; treated me exceedingly kind. nothing has been
                    interrupted here except somethings of minor importance. I met with Colonel D H Strother whom I formerly knew. he has been
                    quite kind to me Owing to the stopping of the railroad trains here &amp; the stage lines the business of the house will
                    be quite limited, and I will close it up as soon as possible and will close up
                    my matters and make some dispose of my property here <i>[added: in some way or soon as possible]</i> &amp; return to my
                    home to remain I assure you that I am sorely tired of this life and am anxious
                    for the change My pecuniary interest here of course is too great for to pull up
                    &amp; leave it I suppose what I <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> have around here will bring some
                    two Hundred Thousand dollars in Confederate money one half of which is mine being about 100,000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> which is a fair little sum and should be looked after closely, at even the
                    expense of privation</p>
<p class="p10">I have not come across any one yet who knew you &amp; could tell me about
                    you, but I hope you are all well &amp; getting along well.</p>
<p class="p10">Keep the children at school but not too closely allow them plenty of liberty. I
                    hope soon to be at home and relieve you in these matters to some extent</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me kindly to all friend<sup>s</sup> and tell them that I will
                    soon be at home</p>
<p class="p10">I have no particular news to write you, if the way is open down the Valley can't you come up &amp; bring Freddy along if you come
                    bring food &amp; feed to last you on the way. be sure to write me</p>
<p class="p10">Yours as ever</p>
