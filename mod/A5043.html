                    got to the Regiment Sunday morning, and was glad of it for I very near starved
                    while I was there, we got a snack twice a day. I wrote to Estiline while I was there, it has been so
                    long since I have wrote any I have very near forgot how. I wrote for you to make
                    me a coat but you need not to make it; the Company all
                    gets a good full cloth roundabout and pants, we will get the Cloth at the Factory here and have them <i>[illeg.]</i> and some one
                    will fetch them up there and have them made at home it will be as warm suit as
                    we can have made. I would like to have some more stockons I have one pair that
                    you sent me and one pair of drawers. I would like to have my boots as soon as
                    you can send them. these are bursted along the side. Tell John H. to send John
                    Bartleys boots as soon as he can if he pleases and if he dont please do it anyhow. I <i>[unclear: 
                        reckon
                    ]</i> Father has got my money <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> out of the Bank by this time. It
                    is fine weather for Camping out a body ain't
                    bothered
                    much wiping the sweat off, and
