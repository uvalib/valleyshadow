                <p>Having heard with regret that complaints have been made against Mr F. S. Tukey,
                        <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst Supt</abbr> Freedmens Bureau at
                    this place it gives me much pleasure to say that I have been intimately
                    acquainted with Mr Tukey for the last twenty years. I was at Portsmouth <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> during the whole of the time that he was <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> of Freedmen there which
                    according to the best of my recollection was about twenty one months and during
                    the whole of the time was in the service of the U.S. Government and had in my
                    employ about fiftly colored men nearly all of whom drew rations from Mr Tukey
                    and being then as I am now and always have been an ardent friend of the
                    oppressed colored people I was much among them and not only them but all their
                    Teachers and consequently had a great opportunity to learn their sentiments with
                    regard to Mr Tukey, and can say that he was universally beloved and respected by
                    all parties.</p>

                <p>I left there soon after the <pb n="2"/>surrender (on account of sickness) and
                    went to <abbr expan="Massachusetts">Mass</abbr> where I remained until the first
                    of last <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr>, when I came to this place and soon
                    after received the appointment of US Inspector of Spirits and have as in
                    Portsmouth mingled freely with the colored people both publicly and privately
                    sometimes speaking to them of Mr Tukey, and they invariable spoke in the highest
                    terms of him and I never had heard one single word of complaint against him by
                    anyone until <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="George">Geo</abbr> T Cook was relieved from duty here and nothing
                    since only what I have reasons to believe come from him. I have known since I
                    have been here of a greater degree of intimacy existing between Cook and a Mr.
                    Graham of the Burial Corp and two of the female Teachers then what a <orig
                        reg="sense">sence</orig> of propriety would allow and am satisfied in my own
                    mind that these charges against Mr Tukey are malicious and originated with and
                    have been made by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Cook or the said Graham
                    acting as his agent, and have been <orig reg="skillfully">skilfully</orig>
                    carried out thus far by a combination of these four persons.</p>
