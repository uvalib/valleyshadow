<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. Garrett, Jr. to John
                    W. Jordan, May 8, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Garrett's letter to Jordan deals with discrepancies between the wages owed to
                    several men, and the obligations their employer (name unclear) assumed for
                them.</p>

<p class="p10">Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of this date is received. Mr. <i>[unclear: Chunnery]</i> the <i>[unclear: new]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Muster]</i> notified me a short time ago not to pay any of the men
                    employed on his <i>[illeg.]</i> as he had assumed obligations for many of them
                    which were to be paid out of their wages. I therefore refer you to him and if
                    you will obtain from Mr. F. J. <i>[unclear: Chunnery]</i> a statement showing
                    the amount due William Meredith after deducting such
                    obligations (if any have been incurred on his account) I will pay the amount
                    found to be due. The payroll for April has not been received at this office
                    &amp; I do not know what is due William Meredith
                    for that month.</p>
<p class="p10">The amounts appearing due on payrolls for January, February &amp; March are:<br> January 14.30<br> February 14.20<br>
                    March 21.15<br> April Not Known--<br> (Subject to deductions (if any) for
                    obligations incurred by <i>[unclear: Ch-g]</i> as above mentioned) </p>
<p class="p10">Yours Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. Garrett, Jr.</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I return Meredith's order
                    herewith.<br>J.G.Jr.</p>
