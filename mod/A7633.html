                    seat for the purpose of writing you. we are here and we had a long troublesome
                    Journey up the Valley in the hot sun we laid by during the heat of the day and
                    drove late at night and camping out each night we eat our snack in the ambulance
                    &amp; slept in it &amp; had quite a good time not withstanding the
                    oppressive heat well we are now here- on our arrival we found poor Hen quite ill
                    indeed but he knew us and was glad to see us our arrival seemed to improve him
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> but later got worse and in a few days he died poor fellow he is
                    now gone to his long home. the doctors and all did all they could for him but to
                    no purpose his race was run I hope the good man has taken him home to himself. I
                    am quite well pleased here. This is a fine large nice
                    house and I have good <i>[added: a]</i> time I some <i>[added: times]</i> ride out for the cows &amp; take
                    the black boy george on behind me. He generally walks &amp; brings the cows
                    but is glad when I go with him. We have two cows &amp; buy some of our milk.
