<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your communication of September 19, has had attention
                    but I could not give a satisfactory reply as there was some difficulty in the
                    way of procuring a School Room in proper terms. The Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church have now given consent to use
                    of basement for school purposes if Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands will expend $100 in school fixtures in lieu of rent for
                    the season and in my September report I respectfully
                    urge such appropriation be made and now I ask your assistance in securing this
                    and teachers. If <u>but one</u> can be sent by all means send
                    a gentleman. We want a teacher who can go out among the poor and "make them come
                    in".</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Brackett when here was much in doubt whether his principals could spare
                    teachers here, but the field is too large the in- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>terest of too many
                    at stake to let the door of the school house be closed at Staunton. The room
                    will answer at once for school purposes if you can send a teacher <u>now</u> and his suggestions would be useful in making the
                    $100 provide the most needed articles.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Your obedient servant
                    </p>
