<p class="p10">January, 8<sup>th</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I did not receive the communication relating to outrages until Thursday January 4<sup>th</sup> and as it was dated
                    Dec 27<sup>th</sup> and the report desired by the end of that week I
                    simply dismissed it as an impossible thing to do. Generally, the air is full of
                    outrages on the Freedmen by the Whites, and will be until just laws are made and
                    executed, but I understand you to mean <u>violence</u>, <u>personal assaults</u>, <u>cruelty</u>,
                    of which very few cases have come to my knowledge, and then the facts were not
                    clearly established, because the freedmen dare not testify through fear of yet
                    greater violence. Sam Crawford, black, 60 years, living
                    with Andy Crawford near Mt. Solon, Augusta County,
                    says that in May 1865 Pat McCarly, white, living with A. Crawford, struck him
                    over the head with a corn-knife for <i>[unclear: sacicing]</i> him <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>while at work in the barn, he shows a large scar. Jane Walker, black, 20 years was living with Thompson McClure near Greenville
                        Augusta County who beat her with his fists,
                    and kicked her, and that his mother threatened to beat her with a shovel because
                    she said she wanted to visit a place instead of "Lucy" and that "Lucy might stay
                    at home that day," which was on or about September
                        1<sup>st</sup> 1865.</p>
<p class="p10">Mary Ann Jackson, black, 35 years lives with Joseph
                    McCoomby near Stuarts Draft - Augusta County says he, McCoomby beats her children,
                    and about the 1<sup>st</sup> of September he rode a horse over her
                    boy of 12 years who now bears the marks of the horses
                        hooves on his head, she is afraid to return, as
                    McCoomby has threatened to shoot her if she went away and came back. Jacob
                    McCord, one of the town police of Winchester on finding some freedchildren
                    making a noise in front of his house threw a stone which struck Emily
                        <i>[unclear: Baumgartine]</i>, freedchild, in the forehead causing it to
                    bleed freely. This about November 13<sup>th</sup> 1865. Milton J. Crabill, white of New Market, Shenandoah County on or about December 1<sup>st</sup> 1865 while taking a <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>freedman, Howard Johnson
                    to jail on a charge of theft, and while Johnson was tied hands, and feet upon a
                    horse, shot him three (3) times, but not fatally. At Staunton and at Harpers
                    Ferry on Christmas day December 25<sup>th</sup> 1865 there were several cases of supposed outrages but investigation
                    disclosed the facts that all the parties were more or less intoxicated through
                    the free use of Whiskey, and a sober witness could not be found to establish the
                    guilt of any of the parties implicated.</p>
<p class="p10">No other cases of the kind indicated are within my knowledge.</p>
