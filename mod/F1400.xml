                <p>I returned yesterday to camp and found your welcome letter I have just returned
                    from one of the greatest raids on record <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Stuart
                    left camp the 10th and returned on the 15th traveling over 400 miles in 5 days.
                    We <add hand="h1" place="inline">went</add> through Maryland into <orig
                        reg="Pennsylvania">Pensylvania</orig> about 80 miles to a place called <orig
                        reg="Chambersburg">Chamsburg</orig> destroyed 300 thousand dollars worth of
                    property of the federal government such as Coffee Sugar <orig reg="molasses"
                        >Molosas</orig> bacon flour boots shoes hats and clothing of every
                    description I <orig reg="equipped">equiped</orig> myself fully. I got 8 pair of

                    &amp; sugar. We also took 1600 very fine horses from the citizens we had to
                    ride so fast that it broke down over five hundred of our horses. we would get
                    another as soon as ours gave out. Oh, how I wish I could get some of the nice
                    calico silks and all things for making <orig reg="ladies'">ladies</orig> dresses
                        <add hand="h1" place="inline">to you all</add>. Tell Buffie if he will come
                    up here I will give him two nice suits also two for Papa. I got two pieces of
                    calico &amp; two of silk I gave to some ladies in Maryland We burnt the
                    Depot; there were things of all Description there. I wish I could have gotten
                    some of them home. We went all round the enemy's lines and landed in Old
                    Virginia safely, having only one small fight those we routed directly I believe
                        <orig reg="it">its</orig> is the greatest thing that has ever been done.
                    Fanny I traded for a horse smaller I found she could not stand it so I thought I
                    better trade her as I would never get home safe &amp; sound again. Tell Pa
                    to go to <abbr expan="Samuel">Saml</abbr>
                    <orig reg="Cottrell's">Cottrells</orig> saddle shop when he goes to Richmond and
                    he will find something for Mollie &amp; Isa there. As I am in a great hurry
                    I must conclude to stop give my best to all the Family, tell Ma She must write
                    to me as soon as she can I have a nice present for her if I only could get it to
                    her. Excuse bad writing &amp; mistakes as I have not time to correct my
                    letter I have been <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> going night &amp; day for nearly a week
                    and am so hungry &amp; sleepy I can scarcely keep my eyes open.</p>
