<p class="p10">May 26<u> <sup>th</sup> </u> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Hanover Junction</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I know you are full of anxiety and are <u>waiting</u> to hear from me -- I
     have not written for several days, because I have been too busy, and then
     we are cut off from direct communication -- but I think the road is still open by Lynchburg
     &amp; I will write, hoping you may get it -- I wish I were at home to cheer you up , but
     when I tell you that all is going well I know you will believe it &amp; take heart
     accordingly -- though I am always hoping for the best I think I have
     solid grounds for my hopes -- The enemy commenced a movement very far to our right, on Saturday
     last, &amp; we moved correspondingly -- as the enemy started for Hanover Junction we
     marched <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>by a parallel road nearly all night &amp; got there Scarcely before him
     &amp; blocked up the way to any further advance. Our trains and everything was safely
     crossed to the S. side of the North Anna &amp; we have since Monday noon been here in
     position -- our line extending nearly parallel to the Va. Central Railroad -- leaving a big bend of the river in our front, into which we have allowed the enemy
     to cross -- our line is a very good one &amp; if Grant will advance on it, he will find a
     "fiery mass of living valor" even denser than that he encountered at the Ny -- We have received
     reinforcements &amp; it is thought the two armies are more nearly equal than ever before --
     I do not know but the fortune of war may expose the Valley to invasion, but I trust that the
     same kind Providence that has so far shielded it will continue His favor &amp; keep it from
     pollution -- the many<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>bloody lessons the enemy has learned there ought to teach him
     to keep away -- Every available man has been brought from the North to make up the army of
     Grant, reserves &amp;c and of course we must concentrate to meet them &amp; the result
     will be two <u>immense</u> armies instead of many small ones &amp;,
     eventually some decisive victories instead of many fruitless skirmishes. Our army is well
     supplied now as several ships loaded with provisions have lately come into our ports -- they
     issue 1/2 lb. of bacon to the men in the trenches -- I hope you are getting along tolerably --
     though I am full of anxiety knowing you are illy able physically to endure this fiery trial,
     but your great heart I trust, &amp; an unfailing<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Providence will sustain you
     &amp; enable you to go through these trying times -- I have money but do not think it safe
     to send it -- new issue -- but if you need any money call on either of the Mr. Bears to advance
     some to you until such time as I can send it -- which I hope will not be long -- for this great
     battle cannot be delayed much longer if Grant goes to the Peninsula the road will soon be open
     &amp; if we fight here we shall soon end the act &amp; a charge will take place -- I am
     in the very best of health -- with all I can do. Did you see the Enquirer of the 26<sup>th</sup> -- it had in Mr. Hewson's letter to the London Herald -- he makes mention
     of me -- I am pleased to hear that the children are doing so well much love &amp; many
     blessings for you all -- write -- via Lynchburg -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
