<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">As the most of the boys have retired to their bed of
                    poles I have concluded to drop you a few lines, My
                    health is very good &amp; hope these
                    few lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. There is no news of importance to write, we have to go on picket tomorrow morning I suppose we will
                    get a peep at our enemies I hope we may have a pleasant time while we are on picket, There has been a great deal of snow
                    &amp; rain in the last two weeks I hope we may have
                    some more clear weather now The roads are almost a bed
                    of mud. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>It is almost impossible to get
                        provisions from the depot to our camp I suppose there is plenty of
                    snow in Augusta now for sleighing if so I hope you
                    may have some pleasant
                    sleigh rides we take our fun in snowballing. We
                    have formed a Bible class &amp; meet on Sunday
                    &amp; Wednesday nights to recite our lessons I hope it may be carried on and that some good
                    may come of it we have a grand theatre in the Regt,
                    carried on by Capt Brown of the Marion Rifles he is a very good performer he is
                    a noble singer. Capt Newton started home this morning on furlough he is very
                    lucky in getting home though I do not envy him his good fortune I would have
                    written by the Capt if I had have had notice <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>in time. As it is I will
                        have to risk another by mail hoping it may soon
                    reach your hand Well Kate did your cous, Lizzie make you acquainted with all her
                        secrets if so do you know who she is engaged to
                    I will tell you my reasons for asking you this question in my next letter if you
                    answer it I am a thousand times obliged to you for the cheese you sent to me I
                    assure you it was something I never look for I would like to be in a mess with
                    your brother but the boys would think hard of me for leaving my old mess I may
                    say we are almost one mess for whenever one mess gets a box the other is invited to share its contents but if Lieut Dempster
                    joines the officers mess I expect to change well Kate
                    I wasn't aware that I had <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>shown so many
                        signs of my weakness on leaving Greenville it goes
                    to show the feebleness of mans nature I was very sorry to hear of the bereavements of the Harris families I hope the all-wise God may do
                    unto them as he did unto Job of old bless their future years you said you wished you could take our
                    places down here do you think you could stand out on
                        guard one of these cold
                    nights and if you could don't you think we would be as unhappy if all the Ladies were
                    here and we were at home you
                    wrote as if you had been trying to get me to change my love for you but alas how could I you are constantly in my thoughts by day
                    and my dreams by night &amp; God forbid that I should ever love another
                    woman I have often thought dear Kate that you never loved me as I did you but
                    found the keys of my heart and took pity on me. It seemes to me that man is one
                    of Gods weakest instruments well Kate I have not entirely quit chewing tobacco
                    yet I have used one plug since I came back to the company I used to chew two a
                    week I hope I may entirely quit before long; uncle John was wounded at the Sharpsburg fight in the arm, I expect he is in Buckingham. Bro John
                    had a letter for me from Sister when I came down She was well and going to
                    school I would like very much to see her Jake is well and looks hardy cous, Jimmie is enjoying the same blessing I must
                    bring my letter to a close as it is after twelve oclock
                    Abe stayed up and bothered me until eleven trying to
                    find out who I was going to write to my respects to all; the family write soon
                    as I am always glad to hear from you let no one see this</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your much attached friend</p>
