<p class="p10">August 7<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Magruder</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I seize the present opportunity by writing you a few lines to
     let you know that I am well &amp; hope you may be enjoying the same blessing. Henry Wright
     is not very well he has been complaining for near two weeks but he says he feels a little
     better today. We are camped on Magruders farm five miles from
     Gordonsville he is a brother of General Magruders. There is nothing of importance to write
     every day we hear reports of the advance of the enemy but they generally turn out to be false the enemy are at Orange Court House 10 mile from
     Gordonsville with a very large force it is supposed. we have a considerable force ourselves
     some five or six divisions in all which with Artillery &amp; Cavalry will not fall far
     short of fifty thousand men. We have just had orders to cook two days rations with <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley11b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley11b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      eight days hard bread and be ready to march at a moments warning.
     it is so warm now that it is very laborious marching. but I hope that the weather will soon get
     cooler and we will get along much better. We have had very good living for a few days we draw
     flour beef sugar salt rice and sometimes molasses apples are plenty and we make a great many
     pies and dumplings which though not quite so good as home manufacture are a very good substitute We have heard that four thousand of the Fort Delaware Prisoners
     arrived in Richmond yesterday to be exchanged and some of the company expect Sam Beard
     &amp; Lieutenant Wright to be in the number if they are still
     alive as that is the place where all the troops that were taken prisoner in the valley were sent. But I must close by Asking you to excuse all mistakes Bad
     writing etc.</p>
