<p class="p10">Dec3 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Casey Near Washington D.C.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">Our boys came from Harrisburg yesterday bringing your last letter with them
                    &amp; it made me feel sorry that Bell was sick but I hope she will get
                    better soon &amp; be running around singing &amp; playing with Josey
                    &amp; Lucy making you feel more cheerful. The box
                    has never come yet with Polly Harvey's mince pies. Tell Polly I am sorry she
                    could not get her pies sent, that her kindness will compensate for their loss.
                    Our camp here is very pleasant &amp; we are getting along very comfortable.
                    The Doctor took me with him to the city on Monday. We passed through it seeing
                    the White House and a great many other things that paid for the trip. We went
                    over to the Georgetown College Hospital where there are about 500 sick &amp;
                    wounded soldiers. This was a Catholic College &amp; I saw a number of the
                    priests in their long black robes with white crosses hanging from their belts.
                    They were going about with books in their hands reading to the boys. We took
                    dinner then with the Doctors of the Hospital &amp; visited some of the
                    patients. It was the cleanest &amp; airiest place
                    for the sick I have seen yet. We did not cross the Potomac river but we met a
                    brigade of New Jersey infantry that had &amp; I tell you the soldiers were
                    sweating with their heavy knapsacks, muskets &amp; cartridge boxes.
                    Washington City appears to be full of Government wagons. We met them &amp;
                    passed them at every street by hundreds. There were not very many soldiers
                    around but on every hill there was a camp. Congress is in session now &amp;
                    I wish to go if I can &amp; see the August body. You speak about Miller
                    &amp; Gunn being at home &amp; why may not I be there as well as them.
                    Well I could if I would only run the risk. They only get 24 hours leave of
                    absence &amp; then stay a week or two &amp; no person in the company
                    bothers about reporting them to the Colonel. But my situation is quite different
                    &amp; if I were to go it would cost me my position. It is for your sake that
                    I wish to hold it, so that I can do more for you &amp; the children. Still I
                    will try all I can to get home. We have some sick to see evey day. I have had my
                    bounty 27 dollars &amp; spent part of it. The balance of it I wish to keep
                    to go home on. In the last letter I wrote you I gave you the wrong directions
                    for sending your letters. Send</p>
<p class="p10">S.M. Potter<br>16Pa. Cavalry<br>Camp Casey<br>Washington D.C.</p>
<p class="p10">Be sure to put the number of the regiment on the letter and send it to Washington
                    City &amp; they will send it after the regiment.</p>
<p class="p10">I will close my letter here by sending my love to you alike my best wishes to
                    Polly Harvey, Mrs. Roney, &amp; the rest of the neighbors.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. M. Potter</i></p>
<p class="p10">I dont think of anything else to write. I dreamed of
                        being at home with you last night &amp; had a good talk with you.<br>
                        Sister Mary <br>Cynthia said you were spinning. You did not write any in
                        her last letter &amp; I don't think I answered
                        your last. Since I commenced writing this the Doctor has gone to town, the
                        nurses are out &amp; I am in here by myself with the sick &amp;
                        cannot have much time to write without being interrupted. Mary you are very kind to mine &amp; I wish you
                        may be rewarded for your kindness. Josey I am glad that you are at the head
                        of your class. That is the way my boy don't be
                        behind. &amp; Lucy carries chips &amp; goes to
                        town on errands like a good girl. Poor Bell is sick. Pa would nurse you in
                        his arms Bell if he was at home &amp; Show you the pictures in your new
                        book. Lucy you will help Ma &amp; Aunt Mary wont you. </p>
