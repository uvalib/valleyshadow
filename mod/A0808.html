<p class="p10">September 24<sup>th</sup> , 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Charlestown</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Uncle,</p>
<p class="p10"> I have been for some time intending to write you,
                    but pressing times have prevented my doing so. For a wonder I am quiet this
                    morning with nothing but the usual camp duties to perform. </p>
<p class="p10">Tom is well, tell his Mother that I have been very much &amp; agreeably
                    disappointed with him. When he left Staunton with
                    me I though he would be hard to manage &amp; in truth I thought him little
                    or no account. But I have found him not only useful,
                    generous and Brave to a fault, But I have found in him a pious regard for the
                    truth, His word when given never broken, a disposition
                    and temper rarely if ever muffled, and for one of his age a Boy that any one
                    might be proud to call their son. In the Ardous &amp; hotly contested fields
                    we have operated on. He has always been at his Post.
                    And at Brandy Manasas &amp; Poulsville my heart <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/garb8b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/garb8b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
                     beat with pride, when I saw the flag of my Regiment
                    ever in front &amp; borne proudly in the hottest of the fight by him. Say to
                    his Mother that I will care for him as I would <i>[deleted: &amp;
                    will]</i> for one of my Boys if they were old enough to fight for their country's freedom. I have made no request of Tom, but
                    that is has been readily granted. He has thrown aside whiskey smoking &amp;
                    tobacco, and I think is trying very hard to be all that you &amp; his Mother
                    would desire him to be. I have not written this to flatter him, but as a just
                    tribute to a good &amp; gallant Boy. My kindest Love to Aunt Mary Jane Addy
                    &amp; the Children By the way the Boys tell me Addy &amp; Gen. Thomson
                    are about making a match, tell Addy she must wait until Tom &amp; me can come Home, to enjoy the fun &amp; good
                    things. Cousin Jimmy shall give her a big fuss. Good bye.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affec nephew</p>

                        was the best served Battery on the Field.</p>
