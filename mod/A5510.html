<h4>Augusta County: John Marshall McCue to John Howard
                    McCue, February 12, 1858<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>John Marshall McCue apologizes to John Howard McCue for his delay in answering
                    John Howard McCue's letter and assures him that he has followed the right course
                    of action in his financial difficulties. John Marshall McCue writes that the
                    legislature has been discussing a public printing bill, describes a speech given
                    by Mr. Dawson of Georgia concerning the purchase of Mount Vernon, and comments
                    that discussion has stalled in the legislature regarding the "Idiotic
                School."</p>

<p class="p10">Ballard House</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>My dear Howard</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I regret exceedingly that my delay for a day or two in acknowledging your favor of Monday <u>may have
                    caused</u> the suspicion in your mind that I <u>could under
                        any circumstances</u> have thought hardly of <u>you</u>--</p>
<p class="p10">My dear friend &amp; relative, I do most sincerely sympathize and <u>feel with</u> you, but <u>censure</u> you or <u>reflect</u> upon you <u>never Oh no never</u>--and I do most sincerely regret that
                    I let my engagements in &amp; out of the house, delay me in writing to
                    you--I had fixed on <u>this</u> evening to write at any rate
                    and a moment ago, in calling at the office for my letters &amp;c found your
                    second letter--in which, I fear you feel that I have treated you <u>badly</u> or <u>unkindly</u>--I never
                    entertained the most remote opinion of the sort, and approve the course<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> you have taken--I do not know that you could have done otherwise and I doubt
                    not it is all for the best--I know Cousin Liz well
                    enough to believe that she is <u>just the sort of woman</u>
                    to console you and sustain you in this emergency--God bless her--I wish there
                    were more like her--as I doubt not they will be found in emergencies--In regard
                    to the liabilities that I may have incurred by endorsing for you my dear
                    Cousin--do not let them disturb you in the least--I have not felt any anxiety on
                    that account--I assure you and although I myself in
                    common with <u>all</u> will feel &amp; <u>do feel</u> this pecuniary pressure yet I hope I can get
                    along--I wish I had it in my power to <u>aid you</u> in this
                    your trying hour--I would do it most cheerfully--Bear up like a man--Let your
                    noble wife &amp; your interesting family nerve your energies to meet any and
                        all<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>responsibilities of any kind soever--It is always darkest just before day &amp; I doubt not this will in
                    your case only be a momentary darkness--Imboden with me since I received yours--He said to me the
                    night I was at the Virginia Hotel he wanted to talk
                    with me about your matters--but the opportunity did not present itself before he
                    had to leave--</p>
<p class="p10">I reiterate, that you must not suppose for a moment that I reflect on you in any
                    manner whatever--No, no, not in the slightest particular. Give much love to
                    Cousin Liz for me--and <u>assure her</u> in the strongest
                    language you can use--of my undiminished love and affection for her--and the
                    full assurance I have always entertained that she will be equal to any changes
                    of fortune either prosperous or adverse--and Heaven grant it may soon prove to
                    be of the former character--</p>
<p class="p10">I have little to communicate of interest in legislation--Have spent nearly a <i>[deleted: ]</i> discussing the reports majority &amp; minority in regard to
                    the public printing &amp; adopted the latter today
                    cutting down the printing 25 percent--Had a M<sup>r</sup>. Dawson of Georgia here last
                    night to address the citizens on the subject of
                    purchase of Mt. Vernon--and such a stupid &amp; miserable <u>bore</u> as he proved himself to be--you could not imagine to yourself--and such a wet blanket as he has
                    thrown over the whole subject only those who felt an interest in it, can
                    believe--He is no relation of Honorable W<sup>m</sup> C. Dawson deceased--formerly in U. S. Senate--but is a
                    Kentuckian by birth of Virginia parents &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10">W<sup>m</sup> Ballard Preston was here a day or two ago--on <i>[deleted: ]</i> for Europe--Has succeeded to a favorable extent in his mission--</p>
<p class="p10">Not much said in regard to the Idiotic School--There will hardly be time I fear
                    to get it through unless in an extra session. </p>
<p class="p10">It has been snowing industriously all day--Do you have a prospect of ice?</p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse the hurry &amp; brevity of my letter--I want it to go by tomorrow's mail--Let me hear from you soon and
                    believe me very truly &amp; sincerely</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Your relative &amp; friend</u>
                    </p>
