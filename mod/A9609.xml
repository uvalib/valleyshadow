                <p>I can only write you a very short letter this morning to go off in today's mail,
                    for if I put it off till tonight it will go by Friday's Post and not reach you
                    for a week. The very day I wrote you last I received the longest and sweetest
                    letter you have written to me, and I want to thank you ever so much for it, but
                    to say you must not adhere to your idea that I must write you several letters to
                    your one. If we had a daily mail we should exchange letters daily.</p>

                <p>I enclose you a letter I answered last night. Isn't it charming, and so sensible?
                    It looks more to me like the realization of my hopes than any letter I have had.
                    There are certain practical matters referred to that indicate the certain near
                    approach of the happy day. I am sorry we ever opened the question of time again
                    after we had once agreed upon March. And whilst I would be delighted to
                    reconsider and <pb n="2"/> fall back upon March again, I will not insist now
                    upon a change of your assesment to settle the matter when I go to see you.</p>

                <p>Now when will that be? I answer "in January," perhaps about the middle of the
                    month. I am more resolved to so far arrange my business here as not to be
                    obliged to come back till you come along. And also to have it so arranged as to
                    remain sometime with you on my next visit. Just as soon as I can fix the day of
                    my departure from <abbr expan="New York">N.Y.</abbr> I will write you when to
                    expect me. I know it is important for <hi rend="underline">you</hi> to know
                    exactly when I am coming, but as I can't now fix the day of my departure hence,
                    I can only say it is hardly probable that I can get away before the middle of
                        <abbr expan="January">Jany</abbr>.</p>

                <p>I would give anything to see you for only two hours, and arrange our affairs with
                    a <orig reg="definitiveness">definiteness</orig> that would enable us both to
                    make our plans with reference to it. <hi rend="underline">You</hi> could now fix
                    the day if you would, and the <hi rend="underline">earlier</hi> the better. I
                    will be more than ready at the earliest moment.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>With much love to all, I am so lovingly yours</salute>
