<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure I take this opportunity
     to let you know that I am still on the land of the living thought I am not as well as I have been in my <i>[deleted: ]</i> time yet have great
     reason to be
     thankful that I am no worse I am still
     able to knock around do not suffer from pain but am still
     weak but not so much so as I was a week ago
     think if nothing happens I will get better soon I weighed myself
     yesterday found that I have lost twenty four pounds since coming
     over on this side of the mountain I have not been doing any duty for some time but what I please to do and that is
     not much do not intend to until I get
     stronger Dear Giney I received your letter by the hands of Runkel
     was truly glad to from you as I always am and although<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> you thought <i>[deleted: you thought]</i> you were
     writing so much yet it was interesting to
     me though was sorry to hear you were so much out of heart now Giney I will just give you the same advice you gave me a short time since
     come cheer up and trust to the Lord for the better though things look
      glo<i>[unclear: omy]</i>
     every where the Lord can and I firmly
     believe will bring all things about for the best. though things seem to go hard here it is our lot and it becomes us to endeavor
     to submit to it trusting in him for the issue this is a fleeting world
     at best
     perhaps we have been too much
     attached to it this is intended to show us how transitory it is Oh
     that the people would look at it as they should, well Giney I do think thing must take a change
     before long one way or the other how it will be I know not but it is thought this war cannot last much longer the
     Lord send that it may not<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">well this is the sabbath morning I will try to wite a little more now
     will Say something about my Barrel of provisions it came to camp
     yesterday evening safe and sound the reason it did not get here sooner
     it was delayed at the railroad station because we could not get a Team
     to bring them to camp but it was all right when it came there was nothing injured in it at all and a better Barrel of provision
     does not often come to this part of the country
     and now I wish to send you my grateful thanks for your kindness and for the labor and trouble you
     had with it, our mess is <i>[unclear: but]</i> pretty well supplied with provisions at this time every member in it
     has gotten a box in the last ten days we have
      every thing in the way of eating that
     any body ought to have, I received the
     money you sent me<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> tell Nealey that I am much obliged to her
     for those hickory nuts she sent me. there
     is no news here
     that is of any importance so I must soon stop
     for this time hoping this may find you enjoying health and strength and all <i>[illeg.]</i>
     blessings trusting in the Lord for his care and blessings to watch over
     us all and bring us together in Heaven is my prayer</p>
<p class="p10">Harrison Swartzel expects to be home this week on a furlough he
      does not know
     whether he will get up in our neighborhood or not if you wish to see him on business you can see him by going to his house,</p>
<p class="p10">so nothing more but remain yours</p>
