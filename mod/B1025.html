<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando
                    Brown, June 30, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jordan remarks that blacks in Augusta County have made enormous strides in
                    improving their welfare considering the disadvantages arrayed against them. He
                    believes that they can accomplish much if the obstacles are removed. In that
                    respect, he concludes his report with the following statement: "the interests of
                    the Freedmen, the Loyalists and the Federal Government demands the continuance
                    of the Bureau with enlarged powers and more extended and substantial
                authority."</p>

<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In accordance with the requirements of Circular Number VI
                    from Headquarters
                    Assistant Commissioner
                    etc. Richmond Virginia
                    January 29<sup>th</sup> 1866 I have the
                    honor to submit the following "Report" showing the condition generally of
                    Freedmen's Affairs in the above named Division embracing the Counties of
                    Highland and Augusta.</p>
<p class="p10">There is in the matter of demand for labor, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>not only lucrative
                    employment for all those who are disposed to work but I think from the
                    indications that those who are seeking for good reliable hands have no
                    difficulty in getting them at fair rates and by giving assurances of prompt
                    payment for same. I am of opinion that if the Freedmen would take advantage of
                    their opportunities and secure honorable steady employment at the wages offered
                    them, and encounter no difficulty in effecting settlements they would be more
                    successful and cheerful but although as a general thing they are employed at
                    wages amply adequate to a comfortable support they are treated so ___ <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>shamefully by their employers in the matters of exorbitant charges for Rent
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: last]</i> time &amp;c that there is really but little
                    inducement offered them to become an industrious population. I think they
                    deserve a vast deal of credit for accomplishing what they <u>have</u>, toward becoming a thrifty and self supporting people especially
                    when we <i>[unclear: consider]</i> the disadvantages under which they labor. It
                    cannot be expected of any people that they should make any more rapid
                    advancement then the Freedmen are now making in the South, when they are
                    surrounded by every influence intended to discourage and dishearten them
                    especially in their business transactions. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>When the same field to
                    honorable ambitious industrious effort is opened to these people when they feel
                    that they have full and impartial justice and protection under existing laws I
                    believe they will take advantage of every opportunity within their reach and so
                    advance as to convince their old masters even that they are capable of higher
                    things in the scale of civilization that that of being mere
                    <i>[unclear: hewers]</i> of wood and drawers of water. They certainly are
                    becoming with their limited advantages more prominent &amp; industrious and
                    intelligent and in every respect show the highest appreciation of their moral
                    and religious training. <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>The interest taken by this race in every
                    thing looking to their intellectual advancement certainly demonstrates one fact
                    viz. that they are convinced that their moral as well as intellectual
                    advancement constitutes the foundation of their future welfare, and prosperity
                    and they look upon the Bureau as their only substantial guide, counselor
                    &amp; friend - guaranteeing protection to those seeking to improve their
                    educational advantages but in seeming to the aged, infirm as well as the adults
                    the enjoyment of their rights and privileges.</p>
<p class="p10">Owing to the fact that the Schools as a general thing have closed temporarily
                    during the warm <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>months I have but little to say concerning them They
                    were at the termination of the season in good condition, well attended, and well
                    managed. I earnestly trust that I will be able to report double the numbers at
                    least of Schools and Scholars before the year closes.</p>
<p class="p10">During my experience here I have neither met with nor heard of one single
                    instance of intemperance among this class. They seem to be entirely free from
                    this <i>[unclear: use]</i> which in other localities is making such fearful
                        <i>[unclear: harm]</i> with their means and morals And as far as my
                    observation has been <i>[deleted: ex]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br>extended this fact is not attributable to their poverty etc. but owing more to avoid the evil so disastrous
                    to the fortunes &amp; well-being of the whites in this section of the
                    country.</p>
<p class="p10">In conclusion I beg to remark that the interests of the Freedmen, the Loyalists
                    and the Federal Government demands the continuance of the Bureau with enlarged
                    powers and more extended and substantial authority.</p>
<p class="p10">I Remain General<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient
                        Servant</p>
