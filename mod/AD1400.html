<h4>Augusta: Diary of Robert Hanson Fleming, March 28, 1865-May 16, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About Robert Hanson Fleming:<br></b>A midshipman in the Confederate Navy, Robert Fleming recorded the scuttling of his vessal near the end of the war.  His brief diary describes the burning of Richmond and notes that he and his unit have been chosen to guard a train loaded with Confederate specie.  He observes that civilians in a couple of towns are hostile and wish to return to the Union.  After delivering the specie to Georgia, Fleming returns to Virginia and describes what he encounters on the journey home.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>March 1865 
  
</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 28th, 1865</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Fighting has been going on for several days.  With considerable success, our troops, though greatly outnumbered, fought bravely.  We are expected to be armed and sent to the front.  Today we received orders to leave the ship.  It is to be sunk in the river to obstruct it to keep off the Yankee monitors.  We marched up to the corner of 26th &amp; Franklin.  The school is broken up indefinitely.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>March 29th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Nothing to do.  Saw Mr.     my county     home.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>April 1865 
  
</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>April 2nd, Sunday</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Whilst everybody was in church the awful intelligence was received that Lee had been defeated and that Richmond was to be given up.  We were marched at quick time after arms and ammunition and to get ready to leave.  Left quarters about 4 armed.  Arrived at Danville Depot at 5.  It was announced today that we were picked out by the Secretary to guard a very valuable train loaded with <u>specie</u>.  The train left the Depot about 12 midnight.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Morning.  We find ourselves switched off from our train and left on the track just across the river.  The smoke of the burning city is rising up in dense columns.  I hear the glad sound.  Another train is coming.  We will yet get off, but not it will not stop, but here comes another.  Away we scramble on top.  Can scarcely get a place to sit down.  Away we go leaving the burning city behind.  Farewell old Richmond.  Much blood has been spilt in your defence.  Very few persons are leaving the city.  The evacuation is the most hurried of the war.  We travel very slowly.</p><p class="p10">Evening.  Burkeville Junction.  Yankees reported 4 miles off.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10"><u>Danville</u>, <u>April 4th</u>.  Arrived here at daylight.  Found the rest of our party waiting for us in camp in a pleasant place just outside the town.  Danville is a small place of about 2000 inhabitants.  The people are very inhospitable and     tired of the place.  splendidly laid off, filled with flowers.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>April 20th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">On our way to Augusta we heard today the awful news of the Surrender of General Lee and all his arms.  I fear all is lost but our honor!  Arrived at Augusta today.  The specie is deposited in bank.  I am glad we haven't it to guard.  Augusta is a very pretty place.  The streets are filled with shade trees.  It is a perfect Union hold.  All the people want to go right back to the Union.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>April 26th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Here we go back to Washington again taking the specie along with us.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Intended to leave today but no train.  In consequence of hearing that the Yankees were near I will remain here a few days.  I have met with a Virginia lady.
