<h4>Augusta County: Mary Anna Sibert to David H. Evans,
                    September 17, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Sibert assures Evans that she does not believe he is cold, and discusses her
                    views on the ideal wife and husband. Wives must appreciate men's business
                    strivings, but husbands must not forget to love and honor their wives. Wives too
                    have the power to destroy the happiness of a marriage by behaving as selfish
                    "women of fashion."</p>

<p class="p10">September 17, /'68</p>
<p class="p10">Mt. Solon Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">I did not, &amp; do not think you are cold. I know you have a true &amp;
                    affectionate heart. You are demonstrative but not so much so as I am it is my
                    nature to bestow upon those I love every demonstration of the deep affection I
                    feel for them. I love for you to know how dear you are to me, how devotedly I
                    love you at all times. I think as you do that the caresses of husband, or any
                    who love should be sacred to each other, &amp; not for other eyes to see
                    &amp; be amused at. You wrote in your dear welcome letter of the 15 very
                    beautifully &amp; truthfully of woman's devotion to man it is our nature to
                    love long &amp; well when we do love. I have thought man could love with the
                    same faithful affection. I know they have business affairs to fill their
                    thoughts, &amp; occupy their time. Yet they should not cease to love the
                    dear ones at home who never forgets the husband. The wife does not forget her
                    love for her husband in all her domestic cares she loves &amp; thinks of
                    him. It is true as you <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>write that it depends in a great measure upon
                    the wife in having a happy &amp; cheerful home. if she is true intelligent
                    &amp; devoted to her husband thinking only of his comfort &amp;
                    happiness looking to his interest in every way she will make him happy &amp;
                    the greatest desire of her heart will be in trying to have his home all that his
                    heart could wish. she could make it the dearest &amp; sweetest spot on Earth
                    to him. It is a wife's duty to her husband who is working daily for her comfort
                    &amp; happiness that she should do all she can for his dear sake at home she
                    should love him with all her heart &amp; stive to have home always cheerful
                    &amp; pleasant for him, then he will enjoy it &amp; feel what a blessing
                    to have a wife who loves &amp; cares for him, <u>that</u>
                    <u>is</u> if he can appreciate her worth. but in return for
                    all this care &amp; thought for the husband the wife would expect his love
                    &amp; tender words to tell her how much he felt &amp; appreciated her
                    love &amp; thought for him. every true &amp; loving wife does love
                    &amp; appreciate her husband &amp; all his toiling for her sake she
                    knows <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>sees, &amp; feels what he does for her every day of his
                    life, &amp; she should appreciate all his efforts with her whole heart doing
                    all she can in return for his happiness. these are my ideas of what a wife
                    should be &amp; I think the husband should not forget to love &amp;
                    cherish her. I can imagine the disappointed heart of the wife you have pictured
                    in your letter, sad &amp; very desolate must be such a life to a loving
                    &amp; intelligent wife, not one smile, not one affectionate word or carress
                    from the only man who fills all her heart &amp; thoughts, who she loves more
                        than her own soul, if such a fate was mine I should
                    pray to die. I could not live &amp; drag out the long weary years away from
                    his love &amp; heart. I suppose a wife must be contented with as much
                    affection as her husband can give her it is well! if she knows how to keep it
                    safely there are many cold natured &amp; heartless wives in this world who
                    cannot love &amp; honor their husbands &amp; do not care to make home
                    happy. both heart &amp; soul are filled with dress &amp; fashion. They
                    think only of themselves. home has no sweet
                    &amp; holy charms for them. They never think of the husband, his <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>love, happiness, his comfort, his daily business toil &amp; troubles are
                    all forgotten by the vain &amp; unloving wife, &amp; woman of fashion. I
                    have seen such wives I have a cousin who married just such a woman. Today he is a bankrupt in heart, &amp; purse a sad
                    &amp; most unhappy man. I cannot blame husbands for being cold &amp;
                    silent when they have such wives. The wife is to be blamed in a case like this,
                    for all unhappiness at home I am glad Ella has forgotten your jest &amp; is
                    your esteemed friend again as she has always been. she wrote that she was not
                    angry with you. I cannot bear to think that you &amp; Ella are not true
                    friends. I want all I love to love you it would grieve me so much to feel that
                    it was not so.</p>
<p class="p10">Yes I will with a willing heart bestow upon you every demonstration of my devoted
                    &amp; unchanging love for you it is my nature, I love you &amp; I must
                    let you know how dear you are to me. I wish I could see you today. I can love &amp; think of you. I have no business to attend
                    to which can make me forget that there is such a feeling as love in my heart for
                    you. I think of you all the time &amp; love you with my whole heart
                    &amp; soul, &amp; ever shall while I live. The entire devotion of my
                    heart is all yours. Yes I do love you more than all in
                    this world. All send love. I send a loving kiss to you &amp; a longing wish
                    to be with you who I so dearly love. Pa has not come. May God bless you. Goodby.
                    I love only you in this world</p>
<p class="p10">Yours,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mollie Sibert</i></p>
<p class="p10">I send you a piece I cut from a paper yesterday so you
                        can see that you think as others do about husbands &amp; wives</p>
