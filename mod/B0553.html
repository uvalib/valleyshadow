<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, January 11, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How's letter expresses grave concern that most of the Federal troops are being
                    mustered out of the Shenandoah Valley. He believes that it will be nearly
                    impossible to sustain the Bureau's activities without military support because
                    of the high level of local opposition.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
                    Colonel O. Brown<br>Assistant Commissioner<br>Richmond, Virginia
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 11th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have just learned that the troops are ordered away from Lexington and Staunton
                    and that in consequence I am needed there. I shall leave Captain Wells Assistant Quartermaster in
                    charge here during my absence, and I respectfully request that either
                    transportation or an order for it may be sent to me at Staunton to enable me to
                    visit &amp; consult with you.</p>
<p class="p10">The detachments stationed at Woodstock and Harrisonburg came in yesterday under
                    orders to be mustered out, and it is the unanimous belief of the officers that
                    an agent of this Bureau cannot remain unmolested in these places if unsupported
                    by the presence of troops. General Ayres has found it
                    necessary to send a guard with the supply wagons, because the drivers were
                    stoned by mobs. I attempted the establishment of a civilian Assistant Superintendent at Harrisonburg but he
                    felt obliged to return with the troops. An order has been received here this
                    morning for the muster out of the 193 New York Volunteers now on duty in this Military District, and at Harpers Ferry, and those places in General Ayers Districts are to by supported
                    by <u>one company</u> of Veteran Reserves, which will confine
                    my effective jurisdiction in this part of the Valley to sub-distrcts "D" and
                    "E", and I desire again to express my conviction that it is worse than useless
                    to attempt a continuance of the Bureau in this district, without the presence
                    and support of a military force. The Schools might live but I think it very
                    doubtful.</p>
