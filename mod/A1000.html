<p class="p10">Henry H. Hamilton,</p>
<p class="p10"> I received yours dated Dec 30th today while at dinner, and also a
     small bag of peaches. I am very thankful to you indeed for your kindness and thoughtfulness. I
     am very sorry indeed that you were disappointed in sending me a box. I would of liked very much
     to have gotten it. I have not got but one box from home since I left the last time.</p>
<p class="p10">I would be very thankful if I could get what clothes I wanted to wear from home let alone
     anything to eat. We are drawing sugar now from <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/wilson2.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/wilson2.gif"></center></a><br><br>the
     Comissary at three cents per pound plenty - of it first rate article. Henry I intended writing
     to you and Bell some time ago-but delay followed after delay until the present time and now I
     have no news to write of interest except that I have plenty to do all the time. I have been on
     Gen. Courts Martial ever since we came over here on this side of the mountain. I have
     understood that it is a permanent thing I am getting very tired of it. I have all the writing
     to do for the company. Lt. Calhoon is the act Adjutant for the Regt. John B McGuffin acting
      Sergeant Major and Capt Roberts has gone to Augusta to arrest
     absentees and Lt. Brown writes a very bad hand, I cannot<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>get him to write any for me
     I have just finished the pay rolls for two months they take a great deal of writing more than
     you have any idea of. When the Court is not sitting I plenty to do. You will have to excuse my
     bad writing for I am in hurry to finish before dark.</p>
<p class="p10">Henry tell Bell to write to me and you write also soon as you can and give me all the news I
     send my very best respects to you all </p>
<p class="p10">Yours most respectfully</p>
