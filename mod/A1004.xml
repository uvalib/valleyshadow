     <salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I received yours of the 17<hi rend="super">th</hi> just a few minutes ago I was just in the
     act of writing to you anyway I perused it with unbounded pleasure &amp; love. But I have
     not heard a word from home since I left nor feel any ways <orig reg="uneasy">uneasie</orig>
     about it, for I know Maggie will write when she has an opportunity nor I have never since I
     have been in the army for I have always considered it my duty to write to her 2 or 3 times to
     her once. But to acknowledge I do <orig reg="want">wannt</orig> to hear from her &amp;
      <unclear>Warler Elmer </unclear>all that I have on earth to care for Bell you seemed <del
      hand="h1"/> what inclined to think I ought not become dissatisfied in the Army &amp; he
     contended I know that I just as <orig reg="much">mutch</orig> to care for as any other man
     &amp; I know that I have the same <orig reg="privilege">priviledge </orig> to hire a
     subscribe as they that has done so &amp; more over I love my Wife &amp; child as <orig
      reg="much">mutch</orig> &amp; will do as <orig reg="much">mutch</orig> for them as any
     other man &amp; would love to remain at home with Them as well as as well as any other man,
     &amp; I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know how soon I may be with them &amp; again I
     may not see them till the war is over. for this reason I have been appointed Assisting Quarter
     Master of this regiment 14th till it is organized &amp; then I have the best of nine
     chances out of ten for the appointment of Capt. Q.M. and if I am pleased with it &amp; get
     the appointment I will <add hand="h1" place="inline">remain in servise</add></p>

    <p><pb n="2" entity="sister2" pid="uva-lib:503072"/>Bell you <orig reg="want">wannt</orig> me to write to Pete I would
     do so with pleasure but know it to <add hand="h1" place="inline">be</add> useless to do so for
     I have written to Jacksons several times &amp; none ever reached <orig reg="their"
     >ther</orig> destination. Well I must give you the <unclear>points</unclear> of the Brigadier
     General <unclear>A.G. Jenkens</unclear>
     <orig reg="Brigade">Briggade</orig> in the first <orig reg="place">plase</orig> we were ordered
     here <orig reg="encamped">in Campt</orig> a Camp of <unclear>instruction</unclear>
     <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> disarranged <orig reg="everybody">every body</orig>
     dissatisfied &amp; no nothing you may <add hand="h1" place="inline">say</add> but all I
     have to say about it is in the <orig reg="place">plase</orig> of it being a Camp of
     instructions it a Camp of <unclear>diserfaction</unclear> at the best no rules nor <orig
      reg="nothing">nothin</orig> as I have said. The Company that have <unclear>going
     short</unclear> at all times in the <add hand="h1" place="inline">day</add> &amp; night
     they even spent by volleys &amp; do just as they <orig reg="please">pleas</orig> &amp;
     one hundred <orig reg="Yankees">Yankeez</orig> could come &amp; rout the <orig reg="whole"
      >hole</orig> Camp.</p>

    <p>The weather is very rough &amp; bad we had a very pretty snow last night it fell about
     five or six inches deep but there was enough for a foot of snow it rained all day yesterday
     &amp; consequently it melted. Bob Love is improving very fast I think will be able in the
      <orig reg="course">cours</orig> of a <unclear>
      <orig reg="couple">couble</orig>
     </unclear> of weeks to join his Company &amp; several others are sick, but I still remain
     the same old seven &amp; six. I have no <orig reg="news">neus</orig> of importance of war
     to communicate. So I will have to close for the <del hand="h1">pleasant</del> present.</p>

    <p><pb n="3" entity="sister3" pid="uva-lib:503073"/>Give Miss <unclear>Clemmins</unclear>
     <unclear>my</unclear> respects &amp; Mr. <unclear>Brarey</unclear>
