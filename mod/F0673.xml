                    was 21 years old. He later was transferred to the 21st Pa. Cav., and this letter
                    to his aunt and cousin, dated October 1, 1863, describes his life since joining

                <p>No doubt it will be quite surprising to you, to receive this from me as I am not
                    in the <orig reg="habit">habbit</orig> of writing often to you. I have made
                    different attempts to write you since I was at "<orig reg="Mechanicsburg"
                        >Mechaicsburg</orig>" in "June" but have always failed to get through. This
                    morning I am going to make another one, hoping that I may be <orig
                        reg="successful">sucessful</orig>, at least, in writing you a short letter,
                    long ones, I don't often write.</p>
                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I left you rather <orig reg="suddenly">sudenly</orig>, but as I had a <orig
                        reg="chance">chuce</orig> of riding I thought I had better make use of it.</p>

                <p>You remember it was raining very hard at the time I left. After getting to
                    "Carlisle" we had some distance to walk before getting to a "Hotel," and
                    by-the-way had to cross a stream of water, the foot-log being washed away, by
                    the flow of water, caused by the heavy rain. you may depend I was not a little
                    wet when evening came.</p>

                <p>Did you get your <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. I gave it to one of your neighbours who said
                    he would be kind enough to give it to you.</p>

                <p>The next time I come to see you I hope I may not have to leave you in the way I
                    did then.</p>
                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>In a few days after coming <orig reg="here">herre</orig> our Company started to
                    "Harrisburg" where we received our equipments and were mustered into the "U.S."
                    Service for the period of six months, three of which have almost gone.</p>

                <p>We have fine times where we are now. I am well and have been, since enlisting.</p>

                <p>When I last heard from home they were all well. I get there occasionally to see
                    them, I expect to get home at the time of the election, so as to give <abbr
                        expan="Andrew G. Curtin">A.G.C.</abbr> my little help - </p>

                <p>I hope this may find you all well, as well as all of my friends in and about
                    Mechanicsburg.</p>
