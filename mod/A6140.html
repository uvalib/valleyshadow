<p class="p10">April 3-1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Hamilton Crossing<br> Spotsylvania County Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Companion</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this morning to inform you how i am and how i have
      been since my last letter. I have had a bad cold for the past week but i have had a good appetite to eat
     all the time. I am well at present and hoping that when you receive this that it will find you enjoying good health and in good spirits and hope all of our
     family friends and neighbors may be enjoying the same blessing. I received your letter that you sent by Captain A Airhart in the first of April. J just came off of picket that
     day and we enjoyed
     ourselves very well considering such a spell of weather as we
     had. we was gone three days. the first day it rained very hard all day. the second day it was
      cold and the wind blew very hard and cold
     all day. the third day but quite pleasant until evening after we
     got in camp. it clouded up and the next morning it was a snowing. it fell about 2 or 3 inches
     but it soon melted after it quit snowing and made a slop. it has been
     quite moderate since. the man that was send to richmond that you spoke of had went home three
     times and he would when <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> camp in times of a fight would run off
      until it was over. it is harder on them that flank a fight than them
     that don't. they have been hard on some of the
     others too. there is Jacob and David Shull and John and Richard Michael sent to richmond April
     1st for six months hard labor and 6 months pay. that was their sentence. William Shull hasn't had his trial yet-April 5th. I am well and
     hearty but it pained me when i read in your kind letter the death of your brother. it makes of
      <i>[illeg.]</i> in which a man has but a few days and full of trouble. god giveth and then taketh away. blessed is the name of the
     Lord. We have lost another one of our company. Absolom Michael yesterday morning at 7 o'clock departed this life to a world where
     there is no more parting. he wasn't sick but about 2 weeks. he had the
      typhoid fever. he was able to walk about
     some until the evening before he died. life is uncertain in the
     army as well as at home. i don't know but what he is better off now
     than if he had a lived to heard his trial for his case would be been
     hard the way they punished the others. i don't think we'll stay here many more
     days until we move it <i>[illeg.]</i> report in camp now that we are to go out back in the
     mountains west of Staunton but i don't
     know
     where we will go for they take take us where
     they please. the
     yankees appear to be quiet and they say they don't want to fight if they can help. they say there is a great
     many of them will go home the first of May or rebel against old Abe. if they do that the war can't last much
     longer. from what i can hear and see i don't
     think [letter torn away here]...if you think you can manage any more corn <i>[illeg.]</i> the
     bottom field as you won't have oats enough to
      sow. the field of cornstubbles on the
     hill could plant some in there and if you don't plant there sow the best of the ground in oats as far as
     it will go and let the remainder be until <i>[illeg.]</i> put more on your self than you can
     manage. it is not worthwhile to expose yourself to put out a crop if you don't get any out of it. you can
     keep the stock off the new ground field and the orchard. it will make as much hay as well. keep
     the stock if the season suits and what luck do you have with your help?</p>
<p class="p10">So no more at present but remain yours</p>
