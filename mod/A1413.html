<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I was arrested and brought to this place by the order
                    of Colonel Jackson a man
                        <i>[unclear: unnow]</i> to me on a charge of conducting the Federal troops to the top of <i>[unclear: Rich]</i>
                    Mountain the charge is false
                    and I have called on Colonel
                    Jackson to give me a Fair and honorable hearing on
                    trial and <i>[added: would]</i>
                    prove to him and the whole
                    Confederacy that I am
                    innocent of Such a charge and I will prove also that no
                        man that claims to be a
                    Southern man that has done more than I have to promote the
                    cause of <i>[added: the]</i> South me and

                        sir it is preposterous
                    to think of therefore I wish you would order Colonel Jackson to give me a hearing and let me acquit
                        myself
                    honorably and let the Falsehood fall on the one that <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> the one that perpetrated it I have been
