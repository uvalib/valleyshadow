     for Greenbriar river Camped at Buffalo Gap arrived about dark next day we Marched to the
     calfpastures <unclear>River</unclear> camped at Rians about 15 miles arrived about 11 o clock
     next night we camped at Bullpasture river the town of Hull from there went to Hevenees store
     Struck our tents that night we received the news the Yankees were leaving Cheat Mountain and
     that about one thousand Yankees were near Peters Burg hardy County Va (now West Va.) So we
     changed our line of march for Petersburg Hardy Co. Arrived at Straight Creek Ottobine Chapel it
     is said we will encamp here a few days as we expect a portion of three companies of cavalry and
     a regiment from Bedford and some artillery good health prevails throughout the regiment
     generally and good spirits our Company is all well that started with us from Staunton Some few

     and Jake Cooked us some light bread this morning and we got some fresh highland Butter Bull
