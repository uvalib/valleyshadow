<p class="p10">Wednesday Sept 17th 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Shepherdstown</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10"> I received your letter of the 1<sup>st</sup> yesterday and I set you a good
     example by answering it promtly you complain of my not writing home often enough I acknowledge
     I do not but still I write as often as I can for the last three weeks we have been continually
     on the march night and day sometimes not seeing our wagons for
     four or five days then we had to live on the country people I saw Asher and Mike yesterday they
     were both looking very well said they had not heard from home for some
     time. I dont think Maryland will go with the south I think more
     than two thirds of the people are Union any<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/garb7b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/garb7b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     how they <i>[deleted: are]</i> were in the part I was in it is
     true as we passed along we would meet a Secessionist family here
     and there but they were scarce. I never want to go back again. I would like to go through Pennsylvania but I don't want to stop in
      Maryland five minutes longer than I can help. Has Capt Eskridge
     got to Staunton yet I wrote home by the boy that drove his wagon. Tell Pa he owes me a letter
     so does sister Kate for that knife I sent her give my love to Ma, Pa, Kate, and sister Elen and
     write soon to your Brother</p>
