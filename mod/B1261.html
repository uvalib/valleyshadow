<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: V. W. Curtis to Orlando
                    Brown, July 17, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Curtis details the organization and division of his Military District in
                    Virginia. He designates Staunton to be the Sub-District headquarters for Augusta
                    and four surrounding counties. Curtis instructs Brown to designate men to serve
                    as Bureau superintendents for districts that correspond to the Military
                    organization to avoid conflicts and lack of personnel.</p>

                        </p>
<p class="p10">Colonel,</p>
<p class="p10">I have divided my District into five Sub-Districts as follows--</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton<br>Augusta, Higland, Bath, Rockbridge &amp; Alleghany Counties.</p>
<p class="p10">Lynchburg<br>Nelson, Amherst, Appomattox, Bedford,
                    and Campbell Counties.</p>
<p class="p10">Danville<br>Pittsylvania, Henry, Patrick &amp; Franklin Counties</p>
<p class="p10">New River<br>Botetourt, Craig, Roanoke, Montgomery, Floyd, Pulaski &amp;
                    Giles Counties</p>
<p class="p10">Holston<br>Carroll, Wythe, Tazewell, Smyth, Grayson, Washington, Russell, Buchanan,
                    Wise, Lee, and Scott Counties</p>
<p class="p10">and respectfully request that you send Officers of your Bureau to have charge of
                    Freedmens affairs in each of the Sub Districts, the one in charge of the Sub
                    District of Lynchburg to be appointed by you Chief
                    Superintendent of the entire district, to whom you will send send all your
                    orders and who alone will report direct to you all matters relating to your
                    Bureau in my District.</p>
<p class="p10">Should you do this, I am confident the duties can be well performed and no
                    clashing with the Military Authorities as I would know what orders you gave, and
                    could send instructions to the Sub District
                    Commanders to cooperate with the Sub Superintendents in that District in carrying out your isntructions.</p>
<p class="p10">I will detail a Sergeant and a sufficient number of men for each <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>County to report direct to and be under the orders of the Sub Superintendent of your Bureau in the various Sub Districts.</p>
<p class="p10">I cannot at present detail Officers for the duty of Sub Superintendents and if I did they would, I believe be
                    quite incompetent to discharge the duties required in a proper manner.</p>
<p class="p10">You can obtain Assistant Quartermasters and
                        <i>[unclear: C.S.s]</i> who will remain permanently on duty while officers
                    connected with troops are so frequently relieved and changed that they take and
                    have less interest than is required in matters as important as are those of your
                    Bureau.</p>
<p class="p10">Please telegraph me what action you take in this matter. I think you will have to
                    alter the limits of your Sub Division of the Shenandoah Valley to correspond
                    with those of the Department else you will have great
                    difficulty in arranging work for a man under <i>[illeg.]</i>
