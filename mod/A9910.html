<p class="p10">Dear Frank.</p>
<p class="p10">I was taken down with fever at New Market about the middle of August and sent to
                    Staunton for treatment. Two weeks ago I was sufficiently recovered to come to
                    this place. I am now well and will return to duty in a few days. Mary is with
                    us. Her health is still very delicate. She read your letter of July 28<sup>th</sup> &amp; answered it at once. This week I received your letter of July 14<sup>th</sup>. I am endevouring to carry out your request but doubt my ability to
                    accomplish anything. I have written to General Wise
                    invoking his aid &amp; hope it will be more potent than my efforts. Some of
                    your friends have been killed since your capture, though I believe none with
                    whom you were very intimate. Colonel Lang &amp;
                    Thornhill were killed below Winchester week before last. Poor Lang we shall miss
                    him greatly. George &amp; Jimmy &amp; George
                    McPhail well at last accounts. The 18<sup>th</sup> won the
                    distinction of a special report from the Division Commander a few days ago for
                    gallantry. I would say more if it were not contraband. Ma was to see me in
                    Staunton. All were well at home. I effect to see them next week. I have laid
                    aside a Salem letter for you which I suppose will "keep" till you get back.</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel Massie of the Institute is here &amp; sends
                    his regards to you. His brother Rodes is a prisoner. If at Johnson Island make
                    his acquaintance. I shall endeavour to get Mary to winter in South Carolina or Georgia for
                    her health.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my kindest regards to Ginnevan, Ervin, Warden, Makely, Re<i>[illeg.]</i>,
                        Captain Imboden &amp; all other friends with
                    you. I spend many an hour thinking of you all and hope ere long a general
                    exchange may restore you to your friends. Mary writes in love to you. Russie,
                    Frank, &amp; Jennie are all at school at Mr McPhail's.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John.</i></p>
