<h4>Augusta County: George Schreckhise to James M.
                    Schreckhise, March 5, 1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Schreckhise writes to his son about news from home, including complaints about
                    religious dissenters who avoid enlisting, although he also encourages his son
                    not to enlist quite yet.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">Don't
                    volunteer as yet there are
                    too many
                    loafers yet.</p>
<p class="p10">I now sit down to answer
                    your
                    favor of the 25 and was glad to hear from you that you were
                    well thank god we are all well at
                        present and all the friends as far as I know of I was at uncle L. Colins yesterday
                    and of course if any of the
                        friends
                    would
                    have
                    been sick I would of heard it and none of our boys
                    were
                    killed in the battle near
                    Winchester. They
                    were all in it but escaped.
                        Their
                    captain was mortally
                    wounded and a few of the
                    company killed a young Whitmore and a young Harris a son of Michael Witmore
                    the bricklayer that lives
                    near Zion. Things in here
                    looks
                    squally the Yankees are at
                        Edinburg 5 miles below Woodstock and General Jackson is at Mt.
                        Jackson and I suppose
                    they
                    will
                    soon have a big battle there is
                    a great deal of fear that the
                        Yankees
                    will get the Valley the
                        <i>[unclear: cendre]</i> part of the community and the Tories think so and I fear we have too many of that <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>part
                        among ours. There was a
                        great
                    many run off but were
                    caught and taken to richmond
                    and our legislators let the <i>[unclear: 
                        Dunkers
                    ]</i> and quakers and <i>[unclear: Manest]</i>
                    off by paying a fine of 500 and
                        two
                    percent
                    of
                    their property exclusive for their other tax but the law didn't take well with the people at large. it
                    is an unjust law Son. 28 or 30 of the 79 that were
                    taken
                    volunteered. the Dunkers as a general thing are cowards and Tories. They
                    ought not to be allowed to have
                        any property or to live in a country if they
                    won't
                    support the laws. There is a
                        great
                    excitement in here god only knows
                    what the end will be. I still hope and pray we will
                    ultimately
                    will
                    succeed. I still have faith
                    in our cause. I would
                    leave if it were not for mother
                    if I found that they
                    would get up here but as it is I will stand my ground. we have a plenty of wheat
                    and flour and meat on hand and
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>thank god the finest prospect for another crop of wheat I ever
                    saw. I sowed 23 pounds of oats and have plowed
                    all my corn ground although the
                    most of the people are backward with their plowing it has been
                    so much rain. It's
                    been
                    raining
                    nearly all the time it rained
                    last night and this morning and looks like it will
                    rain all day the roads are almost
                    impassable the report is that our men are on their way in from the Allegheny and will be in Staunton today or tomorrow and are going down
                    the Valley if so I will
                    see Daniel he is well or was a
                        few days ago I heard from him. Uncle
                    Bob got your letter and I got
                    your minutes of you <i>[unclear: Senit]</i>. I will send you ours with this letter for it may be the last chance as I don't
                    know but I still hope not. I
                        will
                    write to you soon if <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I find there is danger of
                    the Yankees
                    getting to Staunton. I still
                    look unto god for protection he is our refuge in trouble and in
                    all times. I have nothing new to write. Uncle John is at <i>[unclear: Ed]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Shepar]</i> he is going to the war it is pretty
                    well
                    thinned out now since the
                        militia have left Jackson. Bushang preached for us last Sunday he is in here now tending to
                    his mother but will
                    leave
                    soon again. I think he is rather much Yankee he is
                    rather in faver of not withdrawing from the north in
                        General
                    Senate. I have not much faith
                    in him but maybe I judge
                    wrong he takes the same grounds
                    that the Dunkers do the fruit is very
                    backward in here there is no
                        bloom as yet neither
                    peaches or apples but the peaches I think will
                    bloom in another
                    week. There has been a good many
                    deaths about Waynesboro
                    a good deal of sickness not so
                    much about here.</p>
