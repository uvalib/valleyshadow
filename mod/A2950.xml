                </opener>

                <p>Your very welcome missive by the hand of Annie, could not have been otherwise
                    perused than with some mental effect. I always feel sad, when I think of those
                    who <hi rend="underline">once</hi> were <hi rend="underline">our brother</hi>
                    associates; but they are gone, &amp; their graves, we can not but think, are
                    the monuments of living spirits, whose bodies have assumed originality. There is
                    a time for sadness &amp; a time for pleasure; &amp; of the former, we
                    ought to be <pb n="2"/>submissive as possible, knowing that it proceeds from
                    afflictions, bereavements, &amp;c. inflicted for our benefit.</p>

                <p>I have often wished, Midie, that I was a good <hi rend="underline"
                    >Christian</hi>, not that I could only be better contented here on earth, but
                    that I might be triumphant of Life in death; but why yearn, when there is a <hi
                        rend="underline">way</hi> of inheritance?</p>

                <p>Your advice is wholesome; &amp; is the the path of duty; but how many, like
                    myself, know, &amp; do not (no <add hand="h1" place="inline">re</add>ference
                    to you.)</p>

                <p>I suppose the inclemency of the weather, prevented, or made it unpleasant for
                    your singing; my fears of such on Friday changed my intentions: as I have been
                    partially an invalid. Was inde<add hand="h1" place="inline">e</add>d very sorry
                    to hear of the misforutnte of Miss McC. - learned she was badly hurt. I indeed
                    sympathize with her, although knowing that she is in good hands, &amp; will
                    be kindly wa<add hand="h1" place="inline">i</add>ted upon. <pb n="3"/>So Billie
                    is a changed boy - in what respect? fallen from the standard of moral rectitude
                    &amp; integrity, or withdrawn from the precedents to conjugal relations?
                    Excuse inquisitiveness; ha! 'tis all in fun with me. I imagine misplaced
                    affection, with marriage, would be more than miserable; how many half loved
                    marriages take place, in that one or the other commit themselves by word or
                    writ. You say you have much to tell me; as I do not now know when I shall see
                    you, you must write me. As this day adds another year of my life &amp; about
                    the Anniversary of the surrender, so I feel in a bad mood for writing, have no
                    news, more than peace is declared, War at an end, poverty reigns, &amp; new
                    spring goods in abudnance at A. H. Come over &amp; see the latest agonies.
                    My true &amp;c. E.A.S. sends love to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, (my <hi
                        rend="underline">highly</hi> appreciated) she is recovering from a very bad
                    cold; she knows not to whom <add hand="h1" place="inline">I'm writing</add> but
                    suspects, &amp; said give the above: - truly private, all this, Midie, I
                    wish. <pb n="4"/>As there is a meeting of the Overseers tomorrow, may send up
                    this to Mr. Fauber, to give ot your Pa.</p>

                <p>Let me know if you can when is the last of your singing, as I want to go over, if
                    possible. Jno. Wright &amp; Sisters were well, when last heard from. Well
                    did you get any April fools? I was fortunate this year; <abbr expan="received"
                        >rec'd</abbr> no chips for dinner.</p>

                <p>Do you send any Valentines these times? Saw a very nice one not long since, that
                    had been sent to a fellow; in hand-write, resembling yours so much, that it in
                    my mind, was your identical. I however did not tell the fellow that I knew; as
                    telling him, would be telling on self. ha! ha!!</p>

                <p><orig reg="He">Hee</orig> appeared very anxious to find out even if he was
                    playing ignorance. I think you &amp; J.S.S. got the thing up. Tried at first
                    to lay the blame on me; but he made nothing.</p>

                <p>Love to all &amp; much for yourself.</p>
