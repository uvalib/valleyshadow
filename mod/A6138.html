<p class="p10">Camp Alleghany</p>
<p class="p10">Dear wife</p>
<p class="p10"> I seat myself to inform am still enjoying good health and wishing when this may reach you it will find
     you enjoying the same blessing that our god has bestowed upon me. I
     received your letter yesterday evening which was dated the 2nd. I
     was glad to hear that you all was well and hearty but i was sorry to
      hear that you was disappointed in my [not] coming home but I thought
     it best to tell you the truth. I don't see
     any chance of a well man to get away from here
     without
     running off and I don't like to do that
     without a good cause but if sickness get in our family I will strain all the nerves I have I
     will raise the blockades and come home let the consequences be what it may or will try but if
     it is so that I don't get home you must trust in providence. I think
     you will have some neighbors that will give you and you need not be uneasy about me volunteering before i
     see you and the children thats one thing certain. concerning the barger business I have written
     to you the first of October so I thought you knew that we owed [owed] him. there has been
     several letters I sent that I received no answers. I sent some money
     to you with J. Skeles [Skyles] when he was here last $21 it was. I
     sent 2 other letters one by mail one by F.J. Sheats. write whether you
     received them or not. we have had some two or three very cold
     weather snowing and sleating raining as usual. Smith Jones wants some
     20 bushels of corn. he said they would pay the money down when they take it away but i think it
     best for to get the money first as you know him as well as I do. if you
     have the corn to spare
     write me and if he pays me i will write to you
     for he said he would pay when we draw again. it is due us now but its uncertain when we get it.</p>
<p class="p10">So no more at present but remain yours until separated by death</p>
