<p class="p10">Dear Sister,</p>
<p class="p10">As William Bratton has got a furlough for
     a few days, I will write you a few lines. We got to stay in camp to day for the first time for
     several weeks. I had the pleasure of looking at the yankee camp on yesterday.</p>
<p class="p10"> We were sent out on a foraging
     expedition and I was sent up on a little mountain to stand picket
     while the wagon were <i>[unclear: loadening]</i>. We could see the yankees riding about the camp very plainly with a glass. They have a large force down
     in Culpeper. Six yankeescame over on
     yesterday and gave themselves up to our men. Jacksons whole army moved forward on yesterday.
     There will be a large battle down here on a few days if Jackson whips the yankees out here it wont be a great while until there will
     be peace made. It is reported that the yankees are all leaving be
     low <i>[illeg.]</i>. They are all dying down there.</p>
<p class="p10">Jackson has a large force here. He has Generals Hills and
     Longstreets divisions. I think Jackson will give Pope a good grubbing. Wm A. Bratton is very
     glad to go home. He has been trying to go <i>[deleted: to go home]</i> for some time. Tell
     Miss Harriet Cleek that William has been dreaming about her for some months. I hope he will be
     satisfied when he gets home for he has been uneasy about his cattle. Geroge Cleek sends his
     best respects to you and says when ever he gets a furlough you may
     hear of him on the Cow Pasture below Williamsville.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my best respects to Harriet Cleek and all the Young Ladies on Jacksons river. I won't
     have time to write a long letter to you this time for I have to go on camp duty tonight, and
     the time for the bugle to sound is near at hand. I expect that we will move in a few days some
      where else.</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse bad writing and mistakes.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Wise, Com. F 17 Bat. Virginia Cav.</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. In the morning. I had a cold night of it last nght. I heard that
      the yankees were falling back. Lieutenant
      McGuffin has resigned and gone home on account of his health. I want you to make me a cheese
      and send it to me a piece of cheese would not eat bad. We get plenty of
      bread and mead and that is all we get. We can have some stewed apples
      occasionally when we can get them. If there is plenty of apples you can make apple butter.
      This is a fine country down here it looks like old Augusta. The wheat crops and corn crops are
      very fine in this county. Culpeper is a fine county as far as I
      have been. Give my best respects to Father &amp;c. You must write by mail the company has
      been getting letters by mail. I have nothing more of interest to write you this time. Yours
      As, John Wise Com. F 17th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. Mary E. Wise,
       Wilson Va.
