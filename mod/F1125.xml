                <p>Rosenbery expects to be paid shortly. He mentions working on a new building, and

                    <salute>Dear Father-</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>This morning I seat myself to inform you that I am well. Hoping that these few
                    lines may find you all enjoying good health. There is nothing particular going
                    on here at present.</p>
                <p>The weather is very cold. I signed the pay roll yesterday afternoon. I expect to
                    get some money today.</p>
                <p>If I do get <orig reg="paid">paide</orig> I will send you all I have to spare. I
                    will not have much after I pay here what I owe. The 15th of March our next pay
                    day comes then I will have 26 dollars more due me.</p>
                <p>I am very anxious about my watch. I would like to have it as soon as possible as
                    I need it very much.</p>
                <p>A few moments ago I was informed that the <orig reg="paymaster">pay master</orig>
                    is in Our Corps. There is still hopes of being <orig reg="paid">paide</orig>.</p>
                <p>I should have been working at Division Headquarters. Well, we have the building
                    finished except making a lot of benches. The building is 40 by 60 feet. It is
                    calculated for a lecture room.</p>
                <p>I think that it is very doubtful of us getting home in 9 months without the war
                    comes to a close.</p>
                <p>The talk is of us going to <orig reg="Tennessee">Tenasee</orig> but I can't see
                    it.</p>
                <p>Dear Father-I have just received 26 dollars. In this letter I will enclose five
                    dollars for you. If I can I will send more the other payment. I only kept 3
                    dolalrs-well, it went so long before I got paid that I had to borrow some money.</p>
                <p>Now, till I pay up the old score I <abbr expan="shall not">shan't</abbr> have
                    much left but if I can I will send you some more in the next letter. The 15th of
                    March there will be 26 dollars due me.</p>
                <p>I will then send you more then. If I am <orig reg="paid">paide</orig> according
                    to promise, I will send you 20 dollars. I must have some money here as it is
                    very good to buy bread.</p>
                <p>With no more at <orig reg="present">presents</orig> but send my watch as soon as
                    you can.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>So farewell for this time.<lb/> Your son,</salute>
                    <signed>Franklin Rosenbery</signed>
                    <seg type="postscript">Write soon.<lb/> Just as I was about to fold up this
                        letter, Dear Step Mother, your letter of the 14th was handed to me.<lb/> The
                        postage stamps came all right. In my next letter I think I can send some
                        more money. No more at present but thankful for the stamps and so
                        forth.<lb/> Yours Truly,<lb/>
