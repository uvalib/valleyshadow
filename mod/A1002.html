<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">This very disagreeable Sunday morning I will drop you a few lines I am well as <i>[deleted: ]</i> &amp; arrived here The next morning at 8 o'clock &amp; had quite a time of it too I
     guess you have heard of it before now so I need not try to tell you I saw Jake
     <i>[unclear: Hanaire]</i> &amp; saw Ellen Wilson at Fishersville sober enough to <i>[unclear: 
      recognize
     ]</i> them Hen I have got enough of the foot Cavalry I <i>[unclear: don't]</i> think it
     would be just to tell you how I do like it &amp; therefore I will put it off &amp; say
     nothing about it but I <u>Think</u> I will play quits with Old Jeff
     &amp; get a <i>[illeg.]</i> if I have to go in <i>[unclear: next]</i> so deep That I will
     never get out I have never so much
     <i>[unclear: dissatisfied]</i> since I have been in the service Hen
     you may think me home sick but I am, not but at the same time I acknowledge I love home just as
     well as Man ever loved home. We have sent two of our men to the Hospital since we have been here. Bob Love, &amp; Cameron Bob is
     very ill I think it doubtful if he ever gets well he is out of
     his head <i>[illeg.]</i> the diptherea. Our camp is two miles
     this side of Salem on the pike leading up the valley &amp; we have our water to carry 700
     yards the Nearest &amp; Crick water at that. Well I must close for the present hoping that this may reach you in due time &amp; find you all enjoying good health &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jos.A. Wilson</i></p>
