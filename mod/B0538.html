<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, November 6, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How files a brief report on the need for medical services among poor blacks in
                    Staunton and Lexington, and suggests how doctors may be employed to meet the
                    medical needs of the communities.</p>

<p class="p10">November 6th 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">In relation to medicines and medical treatment for the destitute freedmen in the
                    district I have the honor to report that there are yet comparatively few cases
                    requiring such <i>[deleted: support]</i> assistance, but where they do occur
                    it is difficult to meet them, as I am without definite instructions upon the
                    subject and do not feel authorized to pay for single visits or make contracts by
                    the month.</p>
<p class="p10">I understand from Dr. ----- who visited Staunton in September by order of Dr.
                        <i>[unclear: Lamenter]</i> that contracts would probably be made with local
                    physicians and so I have remained in expectancy.</p>
<p class="p10">In Staunton and in Lexington the services of physicians have been needed and
                    given, and I have directed that moderate bills may be made out and sent to me to
                    be forwarded for approval.</p>
<p class="p10">No other instances have been reported to me, and I respectfully suggest that the
                    method might be adopted with advantage until it shall be found too expensive or
                    liable to abuse.</p>
