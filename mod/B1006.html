<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to R. S.
                    Lacey, November 30, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook observes, in his monthly report on Bureau Affairs, that the freedmen in
                    Augusta County have no faith in the Civil Courts to grant them justice when they
                    seek redress against their employers. Cook suggests bringing back the Freedmen's
                    Courts and enforcing them vigorously.</p>

<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following Report of Bureau Affairs in this
                        Sub-District for the month of November 1866</p>
<p class="p10">The condition of the Freedpeople is very unpromising I have had a large number of
                    complaints from them to the effect that their employers refuse to pay them, and
                    when they find that their only redress is through the Civil Courts they prefer
                    to let the debts go, as they have no confidence in being able to obtain redress
                    through that channel, and even when they try that method the Circuit Court is
                    much behind in its trials, and while waiting they might starve; besides they
                    would find it a very difficult thing to obtain work were it known that they had
                    instituted <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>suit</p>
<p class="p10">The only way I can see to stop this systematic imposition on the part of
                    employers, is to re-establish "Freedmen's Court" and support it with suitable
                    military power for a time; such a course vigorously pursued for even one month would be very beneficial to the Freedpeople.
                    It would convince the whites generally, as well as the Courts that they
                    Freedpeople have rights which white men are to respect.</p>
<p class="p10">Most cases of refusal to settle with Freedpeople are flagrant attempts to
                    defraud.</p>
