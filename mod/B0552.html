<p class="p10">December 21st 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th in
                    Reference to Requisitions, and in reply I have respectfully to state that I have
                    not construed the order referred to in the manner which I now see is implied.</p>
<p class="p10">Respecting the requisitions already approved I have to communicate the
                    information that stores can probably be most readily obtained from the Depot at
                    Harpers Ferry, as I understand there is an accumulation of Quartermaster Property there under the care of Brevet Major Geo A. Flagg Assistant Quartermaster (from whom the transportation
                    can certainly be best procurred) and I think he can better furnish the wood
                    which I thought to get delivered at the offices of the several Assistant Superintendents and have it paid for
                    in <i>[unclear: Form 12]</i> by Maj. Flagg, who would then issue it to me. I
                    have therefore respectfully to request that the approved requisitions may be
                    forwarded to me in order that I may attempt in this way to obtain the much
                    needed stores.</p>
