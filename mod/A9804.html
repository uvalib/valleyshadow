<p class="p10">Feb 28 67</p>
<p class="p10">Louisville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">You will receive by the enclosed entrail from editorials of the Louisville
                    Journal* Feb 27 that a very important deliberative assembly will meet in
                    Louisville May 7 1867 We have already sufficient assurance of the presence of
                    the leading men of the Northern Democracy who adhered to their principles during
                    the last six dark years. The leading men of the South will have the opportunity
                    in the convention of receiving that cooperation with the Northern Democracy
                    which is now our only hope.</p>
<p class="p10">We address <u>you</u> especially on the subject because we
                    especially desire your presence. Your philosophic and statesmanlike views
                    heretofore expressed indicate you especially as one of those whose presence
                    would be most desirable on such an occasion. We hope that you can promise your
                    attendance, and will also recommend the attendance of others <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>from
                    Virginia whose ability and discretion would render them valuable members of such
                    a convention -- a convention which may be more important with <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    than any similar convention which has been assembled in this country.</p>

<p class="p10">NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, May 7, 1867 [editorial attached to letter]</p>
<p class="p10">The Democracy of Kentucky have issued the call for a National Democratic
                    Convention to be held in this city on the first Tuesday of May (the 7th), 1867.
                    Though we questioned the expediency of of thus initiating the movement, we shall
                    gladly do what we can to promote its success. The following are the resolutions
                    of the State Convention of the 22d, in which the object and plan are distinctly
                    stated:</p>
<p class="p10">RESOLUTION</p>
<p class="p10">Whreas, the Democracy of Louisville have proposed the meeting at Louisville in
                    May next, of a National Democratic Convention, for the purpose of consulting
                    upon the imperiled condition of our country, and have invited the calling of
                    such a convention by the Democratic State Convention now assembled, and have
                    pledged the hospitality of Louisville to such a National Convention.</p>
<p class="p10">And whereas, the Democratic State Conventions of Ohio, Connecticut, and New
                    Hampshire, and the National Democratic Association of Washington, as well as
                    many leading Democrats, have responded favorably to said proposition for a
                    Convention, therefore</p>
<p class="p10">Resolved, That we, the Democracy of Kentucky, in convention assembled, do hereby
                    invite the Democracy of all the States to meet at Louisville on the first
                    Tuesday (the 7th) in May, 1867, for the purpose of consulting upon the
                    conditions of our country, and the restoration of constitutional liberty, in a
                    general convention of delegates from each State equal in number to their
                    Senatorial and Representative Congressional delegations.</p>
<p class="p10">Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed by the chairman of this
                    convention for the purpose of corresponding with the Democracy of other States
                    and making arrangments for the proposed convention.</p>
<p class="p10">Under these resolutions the delegates from Kentucky (one from each Congressional
                    District) will be selected by the people of the district, in accordance with a
                    resolution of the convention, and two for the State at large will be appointed
                    by the Central Committee.</p>
<p class="p10">The committee of correspondence and arrangements , appointed under this
                    resolution by the president of the convention, consists of Dr. J. R. Buchanan,
                    Littleton Cooke, David Meriwether, Jefferson Brown, Wm. B. Hamilton, Boyd
                    Winchester, and W. N. Haldeman.</p>
<p class="p10">The convention proposed is not one of those imposing demonstration of the masses
                    which appeal to popular enthusiasm, but a deliberative assembly of
                    representative men, in which the statesmanship of the the whole country shall
                    combine its wisdom and and moral power to determine not only what is best in the
                    abstract, but what is practically the wisest and most judicious course to be
                    pursued by the friends of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="p10">The plan of such a convention was originated here by Dr. Buchanan, whose energy
                    and success in orginating and carrying through Democratic conventions are well
                    known. It was upon his motivation and the arguments by which he supported it
                    that the resolutions were adopted by the State Convention; in which movement he
                    was supported by Col. Churchill, of the Central Committee. Dr. Buchanan was very
                    properly appointed Chairman of the commitee of arrangements and correspondence.</p>
<p class="p10">We do not by alluding to the origin of the convention movement intend to intimate
                    that it is in any degree a personal affair, but rather to give assurance that it
                    will be vigilantly attended to and judiciously conducted by its friends in
                    Louisville. The proposition was unanimously adopted by the Louisville Democracy,
                    and was earnestly sustained and adopted in the convention. It was regarded (as
                    Dr. Buchanan expressed it) as the one thing needful at this time -- the
                    essentially necessary measure to bring about unity of design and concert of
                    action between the Northern and Southern Democracy, without which unity there
                    can be but little hope of restoring constitutional government.</p>
<p class="p10">We shall expect to see in Louisville next May an assembly of the very highest
                    character for patriotism and ability. The deliberations and determinations of
                    such an assembly will carry with them a moral power and influence which have
                    seldom belonged to any purely deliberative assembly. Its deliberations and
                    consultations should be ample and thorough. It should give days and weeks, if
                    necessary, for thorough discussion, and for the deliberate action of tis
                    committees, and it should not adjourn without appointing permanent committees
                    for the promotion of its great objects.</p>
<p class="p10">With high regard -- Very respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jos R Buchanan<br>
                        Chair
                        Committee</i></p>
