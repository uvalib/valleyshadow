<p class="p10">March 24, 1865.</p>
<p class="p10">HUMMELSTOWN</p>
<p class="p10">EDITOR TELEGRAPH--</p>
<p class="p10">I notice in your paper of this date a statement of the death of soldiers out of
                    the 107th regiment P.V., who died at Salisbury, N.C., which is but a partial
                    list of the dead, who came to an untimely death by starvation, and cold. I was
                    one of the number, and the statement given below is correct:</p>
<p class="p10">On the 19th day of August last we were captured at the Weldon railroad, 23 in
                    number, of which the following died: Serg. Jno. Ellinger, Samuel Ecker, John
                    Still, William Reedy, David Sonnon, Jacob Clay, John Steley, Samuel Nagle,
                    Sylvester Herman, John Sherwechte, George Black, William Miller, Jessie Breinard
                    and William Bretz. Corporal James Kennedy died on the way home and was buried at
                    Fort Monroe. Thomas Dunphee and William Huett enlisted in the rebel army. Every
                    week the rebel enrolling officers would visit the quarter and promise plenty of
                    ration and clothing to the famishing men if they would enlist in their service.
                    This offer induced some to enlist to avoid starvation and with the hope of
                    escaping into our lines at a future day. The following are the names of those
                    returned: Serg. David Lesley, John Steckley, William M'Dennis, Jacob Ecker,
                    Samuel Reinhart and William Maher. In your account you have William Maher
                    reported dead, which is incorrect; he returned with us, but I have not seen him
                    since he left the boat.</p>
<p class="p10">Of our bad treatment while in the hands of the rebels it is useless, for me to
                    recapitulate. I have seen a number of accounts since my return and none of which
                    is an exaggeration. </p>
<p class="p10">I am, very respectfully yours, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>SAMUEL REINHART Co. I, 107th reg. P.V. </i></p>
