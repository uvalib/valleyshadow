<p class="p10">February 27, 1860,</p>
<p class="p10">Mercersburg,</p>
<p class="p10">Honorable Simon Cameron<br>Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Being Editor and Proprietor of a Newspaper published at this place and being
                    desirous of hoisting your name at the head of my columns, but from the fact that
                    I have not got my office paid for yet, and the individuals from whom I purchased
                    are enemys of yours I am fearful that by raising <i>[deleted: your]</i> at
                    the head of my paper your name they may insist upon my paying for the paper at
                    once, which I could not do, at this time, and perhaps put it to Sheriff's Sale.
                    What I wish to Say to you is this that if I could raise $600 for about five
                    years, I would then come out fearlessly and boldly, and strongly urge your
                    claims upon the Chicago Convention. I do not mean that I will not pay any of the
                    money until the end of the five years, but will pay it off as fast as possible-
                    I have already been notified that if I come out for you that I will have to pay
                    the money for the office--It is useless to go into a long statement of facts as
                    they really are, but I will leave the matter with you-</p>
<p class="p10">I would refer you to M. A. Mish, C. Meish, A.K. McClure, Colonel Jas. C. Austin, from whom you can get any information desired.
                    I would here state that I will give the office as Security for the payment of
                    the money</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>John A. Hysson</u>
                    </i></p>
