<p class="p10">March 30<sup>th</sup> 65</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta CountyVirginia</p>
<p class="p10">Reverend H Brown</p>
<p class="p10">Sir I take this opportunity of thanking you for the excellent selection of tracts
                    you sent me I have read many of them and think them excellent, The soldiers
                    appear glad to get them I hope they will be read by many and be the means of
                    doing good I always request those to whom I give tracts
                    to give them to others when they have read them, I have some of them yet perhaps
                    as many as I may be able to distribute for a month that will depend very much on
                    the movements of the army near us. I again ask the favor of another bundle when it may be convenient for you to send them.
                    I send you $400 which I place at your disposal to be used in the way you think
                    will do most good</p>
<p class="p10">There is one thing I must tell you. Some of our returned prisoners complain of
                    the treatment they meet with in Richmond They say they
                    came there destitute of money and could procure nothing to eat without it, If
                    this is true it is discouraging to our soldiers
                    who have suffered <i>[added: so]</i> much in Yankee prisons
                    to meet with such neglect at home I suppose Government
                    has made provision for our prisoners But it may be through some neglect some are
                    left to suffer If you are situated so near the Landing as to have an opportunity
                    of observing our prisoners and see such please relieve them We are now looking
                    for some of our Providence and Shemariah boys T Smiley H Wright of Beard F
                    Meatcheon If you should see any of the above named destitute please furnish them
                    with the means of procuring such things as they
                    need If you have not funds in your hands at the time they may come and you
                    expend anything for their comfort Let me know and I
                    will refund it. I do not wish you to keep this money waiting to see if they will
                    need it But use it in any way <i>[added: you]</i> wish for
                    doing good Brother sends $100 which he places at your disposal to be used in the
                    way you think will do most good Nothing more</p>
<p class="p10">But remain your true friend</p>
