                        >oclock</orig> in the evening after marching 12 miles, we left camp Brady on

                    east of Williamsport and 2 1/4 miles off the <orig reg="Virginia"
                    >Verginia</orig> shore and 19 miles <orig reg="off">of</orig>

                    as far as we can learn the enemy has left <abbr expan="Harper's">H.</abbr> Ferry
                    and <orig reg="destroyed">distroyed</orig>

                    <orig reg="before">befor</orig> they left. I think we will lay here now until we
                    get <orig reg="further">futher</orig> orders from head quarters as our
                    destination was <abbr expan="Harper's">H.</abbr> Ferry. the row of troops that
                    left Camp Lee and <orig reg="neighboring">nabering</orig> camps was at least 7
                    miles long. we had 6 rifled cannon in our <orig reg="Brigade">Briggade</orig>.
                    There is <unclear>any</unclear> amount of Infantry Cavalry
                    <unclear>&amp;co.</unclear> on the road. we did not go through Hagerstown. a
                    good many of our men gave out <orig reg="today">to day</orig>. it was <orig
                        reg="very">verry</orig> hot. I got at least 4 miles ahead of the <orig
                        reg="brigade">briggade</orig>. we had 1000 <orig reg="cavalry"
                    >cavelry</orig> along with us and 11 regiments. the people in Maryland are very
                    clever they only charge 3 cts for a small <orig reg="piece">peice</orig> of
                    bread. but you can see nothing but the<pb n="2"/> Stars &amp; Stripes.
                    yesterday I <orig reg="saw">seene</orig> that captain that would not give up at
                    fort Sumter and six of his men. he looks like a determined man. each of our men
                    has 40 rounds of <unclear>
                        <orig reg="cartridges">cattiges</orig>
                    </unclear>. <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig> a scouting party will leave for
                        <orig reg="Virginia">Verginia</orig>. The other day J.V. Schriver was with
                    us in Camp Brady. we left the camp 2 hours after he left. I could easily march
                    20 miles a day, and not mind it. the scouts have very strict orders. there is a
                    report circulated that we will now be sent to Washington or Alexandria. our men
                    are all well but tired. we are only 6 miles from Hagerstown. if we get different
                    orders we will march to our left through it on to Frederick.</p>

                <p>Sunday Morning June <hi rend="super">the</hi> 17, 1861. There is a very <orig
                        reg="heavy">heavi</orig> thunder gust coming up. it almost seems like night.
                    we are encamped right aside of the <unclear>Canococheaarge</unclear> creek. the
                    same <orig reg="one">on</orig> that was at Camp Brady. every day we go in <orig
                        reg="swimming">swiming</orig>. there is nothing new here of any importance.
                    as <orig reg="soon">soone</orig> as we move our quarters I will write. if we go
                    to Washington we will take the cars from Hagerstown. as for news about the war
                    you know more about it than we, as we do not get to see any papers, or any thing
                    else but troops.</p>
