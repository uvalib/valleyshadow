<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: William Cithrow to John
                    W. Jordan, May 21, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Responding to Jordan's request for a school report, Cithrow describes the
                    situation in the area around Waynesboro. He writes that although he taught a
                    Sabbath school for blacks, his resources were stretched too thin to keep it
                    going. He also comments on the level of interest in setting up a proper school
                    for blacks among the black and white communities in the area.</p>

                    Mr.John W Jordan

<p class="p10">May 21 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Waynesboro</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">The monthly report for colored
                    School don't apply to this place, there being no day or
                    night School here. I conducted a colored Sabbath school in the village for one year or more, ending
                    at <i>[unclear: X]</i> May but having a white school on my hands found my
                    duties too heavy &amp; was reluctantly constrained to suspend it for the
                    time. The work was an interesting one &amp; about 15 white teachers engaged
                    in it. Number of pupils might be set down at from 40 to
                    90, average about 50. I am met almost daily by the former pupils with the
                    question when is the school to begin again? The Negro's never have had a school
                    here, except this Sunday school. I request[ed] about 4
                    to 500 primary &amp; other books from the <i>[unclear: tract]</i> society
                    &amp; other sources, for the use of the school, during its existence the
                        colored people did nothing
                    scarcely toward keeping it up. Those who might have served as teachers seemed to take little interest in
                    &amp; had to depend on white teachers alone. I think a school here could be
                    a good enterprise - a day school, the whites have no prejudice that I know of
                    against day schools. I know they look with <i>[unclear: approbation]</i> on
                    Sabbath schools as most of <i>[added: our]</i> young people
                    &amp; some old, took a hand as teachers from time to time.</p>
