                <p>Your letter of yesterday Dear <abbr expan="Edward">Edwd.</abbr> brought me the
                    sad news I expected to hear, &amp; now all I can do is to mourn with you all
                    over the departure of one so justly esteemed &amp; beloved--"not lost, only
                    gone before" What an inexpressible source of consolation it must be to you now,
                    to reflect that your untiring, cheerful &amp; affectionate attentions to
                    your Father were such a comfort to him in his declining years, when sickness
                    &amp; suffering deprived him of every other enjoyment. Neither you nor I,
                    perhaps, can at all realize, how highly he did appreciate your affection-- none
                    but a parent can understand it. But it is enough <pb n="2"/> for you to <hi
                        rend="underline">know</hi> it, &amp; it was manifested to you, to the
                    last. You know, he was not very demonstrative in his feelings, but I always
                    thought there was a depth of affection there, that few saw &amp; understood.
                    I am very anxious to hear how your Mother has borne this great trial, but hope,
                    she is as usual, as you said nothing to the contrary. I would have written to
                    the girls, but do not think it necessary, as I can say nothing more to them,
                    than I do to you, &amp; this will do for all. From bitter experience, I can
                    &amp; do most truly sympathize with you in the loss of such a Father. Mine
                    was the light &amp; joy of my life, &amp; the older I grow, the more I
                    mourn his loss, &amp; cannot even yet, dwell upon the subject with
                    composure. God has smitten, &amp; he alone can heal - to Him, I commend you
                    all. Lizzie Law is not with you, I suppose, as you did not mention her. I have
                    been better for a week past, &amp; free from fever - only waiting now for
                    settled weather to venture out a little. <pb n="3"/>I heard from Georgetown
                    yesterday. All are well. I do not want to appear unreasonable but I will be
                    greatly obliged if one of you could write me very soon, if only a few lines. I
                    shall be so anxious about Aunt, until I do hear &amp; indeed about yourself,
                    fearing the effects of so much fatigue &amp; anxiety. Nannie is suffering
                    greatly from her ears -- I sent your letter to the <abbr expan="Colonel's"
                        >Col.'s</abbr> last evening &amp; Mrs M P said she would keep it as some
                    of the family were in the country. Mr. Tyler is not very well -- he joins me in
                    love &amp; sympathy for you all.</p>
