<p class="p10">Dear Father </p>
<p class="p10">I take the present opportunity to let you know that I am enjoying perfect good
                    health hoping these few lines may find you and all the rest enjoying similar
                    blessings</p>
<p class="p10">Further I let you know that we had a narrow escape but I got safe out of the
                    scrape. We were attacked by the Rebels about 6 miles on the other side of the
                    Occaquan River and had to retreat and<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> we retreated back across the river and we saw
                    that their force was too strong and we were driven back
                    about 14 miles to this side of the River and they camped about 8 miles from
                    where we did this morning However they took another course and went towards
                    Fairfax so we are safe at present. But about half of our company is missing The
                    rebel force was about 8000 men infantry Cavalry and Artillery and our force was only 500 cavalry and I don't believe
                    that we brought back 250 men<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I seen a horse fall that was shot dead
                    under the man but I did not see what become of the man as I went on in such a
                    rate that I could not see how it went and about Cyrus Engle I think he is safe
                    also as he was seen retreating about <i>[illeg.]</i> miles this side of where
                    we are now I think probably that he is at Alexandria about 6 miles farther ahead
                    than where we are which would make him still safer I hope to see him one of
                    these days This is all I can write about<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> these matters at present so
                    no more at present Hoping to hear from you soon I am your most dutiful son, etc. </p>

<p class="p10">N B-- Give all of my respects to my
                        inquiring friends and you will oblige your Son. <br> P Boyer </p>
