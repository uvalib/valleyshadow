<p class="p10">Dear friend, </p>
<p class="p10">I hope you will forgive my leaving your neighborhood
                    so suddenly but I did not think I was doing any duty to my family to be staying
                    at home. I was at home last week but I only had
                    twenty-four hours to spend at home I would have gladly spent partly that time
                    with you if could have made it <i>[illeg.]</i>. I sent your ring to you by our
                    mutual friend Maggie Smiley but I supose you have got it by this time I would
                    have left it if you had not told me that it was not yours.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall be happy to hear from you if you will do me the honor of writing to me.
                    Address Company A 101<sup>st</sup> Reg <sup>#</sup>1 -
                    Harrisburg Pa <u>write</u>
                    <u>soon </u></p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Lucius P. Mox </i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Miss Jane <i>[illeg.]</i>
