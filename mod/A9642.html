<h4>Augusta: William Brand to Kate Armentrout, April 6,
                    1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William tells Kate about recent casualties in his company and the re-organization
                    of the company under new officers. He also says that, while things look "gloomy"
                    at the present time, the soldiers in his regiment are in good spirits and ready
                    to fight the enemy. He is less impressed with the militia.</p>

<p class="p10">April 6th 1862</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[illeg.]</i>Three Miles this
                                side<br>Camped on Ruge Hill</p>
<p class="p10">Friend Kate</p>
<p class="p10">It has been some time since I received your kind
                    letter and would have answered it sooner if we had have been camped at any one place long enough to write it.</p>
<p class="p10">My health is very good &amp; hope this may find you enjoying the same
                    blessing. There are no news of importance to write. Our
                    Company <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> reorganized to day for the War; our Commissioned officers
                    are as follows, Captain
                    Jason W Newton, Lieutenant
                    Charles W Grills 2nd Lieutenant
                    <i>[unclear: Churgus]</i> Grills &amp; <i>[unclear: 2nd 2]</i> David F
                    Eachord. We have a very large Company. I hope that our
                    Army may soon be able to give the enemy a death blow. I
                    suppose you have heard all the particulars of the battle of the 23 I was in six feet of Gray when
                    he fell he was shot in the head and never moved after
                    he was shot. Lieutenant Willson <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> was some
                    three our four yards behind me. I miss him a great deal
                    he always was a great friend of mine he was a brave and
                    honorable man &amp; died fighting for his liberty, every thing looks gloomy at present but the
                    soldiers seem willing and ready to fight them at any time that we may be ordered
                        towards them.</p>
<p class="p10">The enemy are in <i>[unclear: Edingburg]</i> six miles
                    below Mount Jackson. The Militia look like they are already whipped all they think about is
                        <i>[unclear: running]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Samuel Lightner has volunteered in our Company he has some resemblance of his late Brother J.P. Our Regiment
                    numbers near eight hundred it will not take a very large
                    draft to fill it <i>[deleted: out]</i> up. I would like very much to come
                    home for a week or two but there is no chance for
                    furloughs at present. Your Brothers are both well I
                    think Jacob likes camp life very well. Nothing more at present write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain friend &amp; well wisher,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>WFB</i></p>
