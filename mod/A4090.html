<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We are off again, this morning -- March to the river today &amp; there we go I know not
     where save that we are keeping the Yankee nation in perpetual ferment -- We yesterday got the
     Yankee papers of the 2<u>
      <sup>nd</sup>
     </u> in which they say that our Cavalry confiscated $100000, of the people of Chambersburg,
     which they would not, or could not pay &amp; he carried out his threat (Gen. McCausland)
     &amp; burned the town, destroying all the public buildings &amp; some <i>[illeg.]</i>
     dwellings The people of Pa. are terribly frightened &amp; the Governor takes any men that
     will come -- regardless of time or circumstances and issue arms to them -- Mosby also crossed
     the river below Harper's Ferry &amp; made a demonstration towards Frederick &amp; made
     the Yanks move away everything they had -- they thought 30,000 men were coming again to go
     where they please -- They say they lost 5000 men in attempting to keep the salient they blew up
     at Petersburg &amp; were quite glowing over the result, advertising that they accomplished
     nothing -- &amp; suffered great loss -- they say the colored troops were very<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>badly used up -- They had 9 tons of powder in their mine &amp; had been a month
     excavating it -- I sent my box up by J. Parkins &amp; it may be some days before it comes
     -- We are going &amp; I must close -- Love &amp; blessings for you all -- </p>
