<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham
                    Rosenbery (father) and probably Mary Jane Snider (stepmother), December 28, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery responds to news from home, explains that his faith in God allows him
                    to get through army life, and describes in detail a soldier's food rations. He
                    observes that the veteran soldiers receive provisions in the mail, in addition
                    to their rations. Rosenbery sees the rations as part of his pay from "Uncle
                    Sam."</p>

<p class="p10">December 28 anno Domini
                        1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensville, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father and Step Mother---</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself to inform you that I received your letter of 23rd.
                    Yesterday the postage stamp and letter paper came safe to hand. This is some of
                    the paper.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I am glad and thankful to the Lord that Father is getting better and sorry
                    to hear that William is sick. I hope and trust to God that he will get well
                    again.</p>
<p class="p10">I, this morning, do thank God that through His Goodness and mercy that I am still
                    enjoying good health both in soul and body. Hoping that through the goodness and
                    mercies of God that these few imperfect lines may find you all enjoying the same
                    blessings.</p>
<p class="p10">No doubt you think I am a hard hearted chap that I can be so contented away from
                    home. It is not the good living-it is not the comfortable place of writing-it is
                    not the comfort of standing on post when it is raining or snowing-2 hours on-and
                    4 hours off. It is not the soft bed that is made of white oak poles, but it is
                    simply this having a hope in God that reaches beyond
                    the grave, it is said in the words of God, that if we have no hope in this life
                    we are of all men most miserable-so as long as I enjoy that Love of God which I
                    profess.</p>
<p class="p10">Thanks be to God, my soul shall be fed with Heavenly
                    Food. Then I am satisfied with a few hardtack and cold water. We have more than that. This
                    is our rations-for a day but it does not satisfy my appetite.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, this day's ration for one man-ten hardtack-1
                    1/2 pound beef-3 tablespoons of coffee and about 3 tablespoons of sugar. Then we
                    have a change sometimes. We draw 2 potatoes-2 onions-a few beans-a small portion
                    of rice and then a portion of pork.</p>
<p class="p10">We do not get this all in one day. This is a change. Then we get a small loaf of
                    bread. The first I mentioned is a days rations. They say it will be plenty after
                    awhile. But I can't see the point.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, to give you an idea the size of the hardtack
                    and bread. Sometimes we have a chance to buy something at the Brigade Commissary or at the settlers by paying a good price
                    for it. Butter is 60 cents per pound Cheese 40 cents
                    per pound Eggs 60 cents per dozen. Onions -3 cents for
                    one.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, as I mentioned above I will tell you what I consumed at one meal. But I was
                    hungry and I was hungry and I was determined to have a dinner. I ate 3 hard
                    tack-1 loaf of bread-12 sweet cakes-1/2 pound of cheese
                    and a few apples. That time I felt as though I had my dinner. I do not mention
                    these things. Some complains of our rations.</p>
<p class="p10">This is a truth a man is always hungry but hunger is a good cook. But the old
                    soldiers say that we conscripts will get used to it.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I don't want this to cause you any uneasiness as I think no man ever
                    starved in the Army yet. The Old Soldiers-since we are in winter quarters-get
                    boxes of provisions sent to them.</p>
<p class="p10">But I shant have anything sent to me until I need it.
                    Uncle Sam owes me a living and I will try and have it. No doubt there is a great
                    many people that complains: But why should a living complains. Well, I must soon
                    close for this time.</p>
