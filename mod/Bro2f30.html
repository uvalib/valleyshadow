<p class="p10">
Dear Ma,
</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you have received the letter sent<br>
off on yesterday.  When I left home I thought perhaps<br>
I would have returned before this; but instead of that<br>
we are getting further away and I hope gaining an important victory for the Confederacy.  Our division of<br>
the army was pretty quiet on Saturday and Sunday, but<br>
a pretty hard battle occurred Sunday evening, to<br>
our right, on the York River Railroad about eight<br>
miles below Richmond.
General Hill's
division was the<br>
principal one engaged. Early this morning all<br>
Jackson's troops crossed the
Chickahominy
and all<br>
the army are following up the enemy; for I should<br>
have stated that he was again whipped on<br>
yesterday. We crossed the battle field <i>[deleted: on]</i> this morning! There were many dead and for miles the country <i>[deleted: wa]</i>
is strewn with knapsacks blankets overcoats and various other articles.
Squads of prisoners<br>
have been coming in all day and probably five or six<br>
hundred have been captured.  I saw <i>[deleted: five]</i> about three<br>
hundred <i>[added: captured]</i> horses and mules this morning. The enemy<br>
have crossed a stream fourteen miles below Richmond<br>
and blown up the bridge, and heavy cannonading<br>
has been going on this evening across the stream.<br>
Time is important for them in order to get<br>
commisary stores out of the way. If it were not for

his Gunboats McClelland might find some
difficulty in finding a
place of rest on Virginia's soil.<a href="#n1">[1]</a><br>
We haven't seen our wagons for five days and have<br>
lived principally on hard bread and haven't
been<br>
particular about clean sheets or the abundance of<br>
our covering. It is now about sundown and I<br>
will stop; but probably add somthing more before I<br>
mail it.
</p>
<p class="p10">

I have just heard that
Captain Newly
will leave the<br>
army in the morning and <i>[added: will]</i> write a few lines more<br>
and give it to him to mail. Four of our boys have fallen out
<i>[added: of ranks]</i> complaining; Strickler
<a href="#n2">[2]</a>, Two
Mynes<a href="#n3">[3]</a>
and Meade<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
<i>[added: also Tom White
<a href="#n5">[5]</a>
]</i> but I
hope they won't be much unwell.<br>
I suppose you all are engaged in harvesting.  Crops<br>
are rather light in this part of the country. <i>[unclear: S]</i><br>
leaving Gordonsville we have passed through a<br>
miserably poor country; sometimes passing for<br>
five miles through flat piney woods.

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> Charles describes the events surrounding the battle
at Gaines's Mill, June 26-27, 1862, one of the battles of
the Seven Days' Campaign. The Stonewall Brigade had been
traveling from the Shenandoah Valley to Richmond. En route, they came to
Gaines's Mill and joined the battle on June 27. The 4th Virginia
Infantry was
the center regiment in the brigade's line of battle. Near the end of the
day, the 4th captured Federal General John F. Reynolds. On June 30, the
date of this letter, the Stonewall Brigade crossed the Chickahominy
River and marched towards White Oak Swamp. However, they were unable to
help Generals Longstreet and Hill in the battle of Frayser's Farm. On
July 1, the day after Charles penned this letter, the 4th Virginia
Infantry was engaged
in the Battle of Malvern Hill, the final battle of the Seven Days.
(Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 15-16, Wallace, 32-35).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> Givens Brown Strickler (1840-1913) was a student at
Washington College when he joined the 4th Virginia Infantry, Company I
in June of 1861.  He was promoted to Corporal at the end of the month
and then to First Sergeant in September of 1861. His rise in the company
continued when he was elected Second Lieutenant in April and then
finally elected Captain on August 30, 1862, two months after Charles's
present letter. Strickler was captured at Gettysburg (July 3, 1863) and
remained in captivity at Johnson's Island Prison until March 14, 1865.
After the war, he served as pastor of a Presbyterian Church in Atlanta
and as a professor at the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond. In
addition, Strickler was rector of the Board of Trustees of Washington
and Lee University. He died in 1913 (Bean, 150, Robertson, <i>Fourth
Virginia Infantry</i>,75).  </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> "Two Mynes" may refer to Henry (1843-1901) and John
Myers (1841-1915) soldiers in Company I. Henry had been a student at
Washington College. He was promoted to Corporal in September of 1861.
Both brothers were transferred to the First Virginia Calvalry on
September 20, 1862, fulfilling their wish to leave the 4th Virginia
Infantry, as Charles
indicates in this letter (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>,
65).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> Everard Meade (1843-?) was a student at Washington
College when he joined the 4th Virginia Infantry, Co. I in 1861.
He was wounded at Groveton
on August 28, 1862 and at Sharpsburg on September 17, 1862. Meade was
captured in October of 1863 and exchanged at Fort McHenry in April of
1864, at which time he was assigned to work on the ordnance train.
Meade was present for the surrender at Appomattox in 1865 (Robertson,
<i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 64).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> Thomas Spottswood White (1845-?) was born in
Charlottesville, VA. He joined the 4th Virginia Infantry, Co. I on March
12, 1862. He was transferred to the 1st Virginia Calvary on February 4, 1863,
several months after the Myers (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia
Infantry</i>, 80).</p>
