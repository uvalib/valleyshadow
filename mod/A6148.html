<p class="p10">it is with my hearts pleasure I seat myself once more to answer your most kind &amp; affectionate letter which found me in
     good health with the exception of a bad Cold I thought you had gotten killed or forgotten the
     name of the post office or something else had taken place when you didn't write for so long I thought perhaps you had gotten
     tired of your correspondence with me I will have to excuse you as you were at home with your
      <i>[unclear: duck]</i> James I feel very sorry to think you are so much troubled about your
     Pa perhaps you are Just out of humor with him as I am with mine
     when he won't let me have my way you stated in your letter that you
      did not enjoy yourself as you expected for thinking of me I don't expect you thought of me half as often as I did of you &amp; I
     could neither see you nor hear from you James we have been very busy
     making molasses for some time I Just wish you Could have been here we had a taffy stewing one
      night
     there was a Couple of our soldiers <i>[deleted: boys at]</i> home
     &amp; some of the neighbors Came in &amp; we had a fine
     time boiling molasses &amp; <i>[unclear: stewing]</i> taffy I
     got a letter from brother William the other day he expects to get home about Christmas
     &amp; if he does I want you to try &amp; be here if you Can &amp; we will try
     &amp; have a party &amp; taffy stewing bring your Cousin along I want to see him Hil
     got a letter from him the other day &amp; you never saw a girl worse greened in your life
     she wanted to see mine &amp; I would not let her see it &amp; she tormented me almost
     to death when she got hers but I never let on you must give my love to Cousin Monroe &amp;
     receive a due portion yourself Cousin Jim if I had an opportunity I would send you something
     good to eat but I don't suppose I will have a chance soon well Jim I
      haven't anything that would interest you at this time you must write
     often when you are in Camp I think it long to hear from you James you must send me your portrait I've almost forgotten what you look like it has been so long
     since I saw you perhaps it will get lost if you would well I must
     Close asking you to excuse bad writing &amp; spelling &amp; look over all mistakes<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
