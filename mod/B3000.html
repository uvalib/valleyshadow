<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to A. F. Terry,
     September 15, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How informs General A. F. Terry of his plans to travel with General Ayers through parts of
     western Virginia. He gives instructions for Frederick Tukey in his absence.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
     
      General Terry
     
    </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">September 15th 1865</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I met General Ayers here last evening. He is making a tour of his
     District and will go over into Page, Warren &amp; Clark counties.
     As I determined to accompany him instead of going straight to Winchester, where I shall now
     arrive in Tuesday. The opportunity is a good one for observing the condition of the Freedmen in
     these <i>[unclear: rebellious]</i> counties, and I hope to persuade the General to send troops there, though he has but four (4) companies of Infantry and 2 of Cavalry in his Command.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Tell]</i> Mr Tukey to look up that woman who stole the "body". "Marian"
     something. Mr <i>[unclear: Sipee]</i> will perhaps know where she lives. She wished him to come to me yesterday morning to be sent to jail, but evidently doesn't want to
     go. Had she come I should have scolded her and let her off, but as it is, I wished the Provost Marshall to put her in for three (3) days. Tell Mr. Tukey also to take
     possession of Mr Campbells <i>[unclear: house]</i> as abandoned property and make such
     disposition of it as he should judge best <i>[unclear: collecting]</i> rents due, giving
     notices to quit, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">Also to see that the man who maltreated the Freedmen at the -- Furnace got their desserts at the hands of the Provost Marshall. Take the
     <i>[unclear: census]</i> in hand and copy the census of Staunton first, in the <i>[unclear: proper
      blanks]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W Storer How Capt<br><i>[illeg.]</i></i></p>
