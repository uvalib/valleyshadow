<p class="p10">Friday Morning March 13<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Moss Neck Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">Your good little letter, along with Nelly's first effort, a very good one too, came last
     night &amp; I was very glad to hear from you and as you think it would add to your comfort
     to hear from me oftener I cannot refuse to take a few moments from toil to indulge in the more
     agreeable duty <u>of</u> thinking <u>of</u>, and writing
      <u>to</u> the loved ones at home -- I wrote Sunday and sent you $10 -- and
     I will enclose $2. this time &amp; must draw my pay and send you a larger sum at once, by
     some one -- I think you have a check, have you not? I don't remember. I
     never heard anything of the trouble between Capt. S. &amp; Dr. H. -- I am sorry for it --
     What was done. I will write to Nelly in a few days -- We are still here, but may move soon --
     My store holds out well -- enough for a month more at least. Mr. Phillips sent me 500 soups --
     I told you of them they are very nice -- but not of red -page two- pepper &amp;c -- it only
     takes 30 minutes to prepare them. I hope he will remember the seeds -- I will try &amp;
     remind him some way -- before long -- We finished the apple butter last night &amp; you
     would have laughed to have seen Boswell scrape the dish -- he says it
     was as good as preserves. We have a joke on him from last year, a man where we staid said he "ate preserves like it was apple butter", so he has the name
     of Preserves now &amp; then -- Yesterday finished a map to accompany the Report of the
     battle of Winchester, which the Gen. pronounced "beautifully
     executed", &amp; Col. Faulkner "remarkably accurate".</p>
<p class="p10"> The mail goes soon -- I will write more very soon -- Write me soon, good letters, they are
     if short &amp; excuse <u>this</u> short one -- I am very well, thank
     God.</p>
<p class="p10">Kisses &amp; love for all at home </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
