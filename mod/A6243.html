<p class="p10">Buffalo Va,</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">I have your welcome &amp; dear letter of Tuesday which I have read with
                    thankful happines. I missed you so much last Sabbath my love. I expect Ada
                    &amp; John Noon thought me unsociable I felt lonely in heart &amp; Soul
                    &amp; could not talk much to them. The day though a
                    holy one seemed long to me without you who I love to be with. Yes my dear pa has
                    been called away again &amp; left us alone in the Mountains <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> for
                    how long I know not We are doubly lonely when he is absent. he wanted me to go
                    with him as far as Gordonsville, but I thought of you my love &amp; Ma was
                    not willing for me to leave home.</p>
<p class="p10">Cousin Gordon Beale wrote that he was coming over to spend his Christmas with us
                    if he comes I have thought of going home with him after the holidays I would
                    rather be at home Christmas &amp; have you here than
                    anywhere on Earth. I want you to come my love
                    &amp; stay all week then you can hunt with Ham &amp; cousin Gordon. You
                    must come I am going to remain at home just to have the dear pleasure of being
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> with you who I love more than all
                    others. papa will be at home if he lives &amp; we shall have a happy time.
                    You will come will you not my love I am so anxious for you to spend your
                    Christmas with us if you live I shall be very happy with you here &amp; do
                    all I can to make you happy. My love you do not know how anxious I am for papa
                    to move from this lonely place. I suppose we shall know where we will locate
                    when he returns from Baltimore I hope he will go to Staunton. Pa expects to send
                    Hamie to school very soon it may be to New York. Ada writes that she is not
                    going to <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> wait any longer than Spring before
                    she is married. Tell her I am surprised to hear it as I did not know she was
                    really loving anyone at this time. I wish I could see
                    you my love it seems long since you were here last. I am sorry you
                        <i>[unclear: cannot]</i> come Saturday evening it will be so long until
                    Sunday Morning &amp; then you will have such a little while to stay can't you stay with us Sunday night? I wish you could my
                    love &amp; I do hope from my heart that we will soon live near so I can see
                    you often. I love to be with you who I love with all the deep devotion of my
                    heart &amp; soul. I love you more &amp; more every day of my life
                    &amp; ever shall while I live with faithful devotion. You are dearer to my
                    heart &amp; memory than all on Earth. Yes I do
                    indeed love you only &amp; love to think of you when absent &amp; read
                    your dear welcome letters. Come Sunday my heart says come I want to see you more
                        than I can tell &amp; love you more than I can ever express in words. All send love. I send a
                    loving kiss to you. God bless you &amp; let you come my only love.</p>
