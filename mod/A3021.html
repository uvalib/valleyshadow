<p class="p10">Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10"> I take the privilege of writing you a few lines this morning as I am going up to
                    the mountain today. I have not heard from you for some
                    time &amp; have come to the conclusion that you have forgotten me but I hope
                        <i>[deleted: you]</i>this is a mistake I have seen hard times since I
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> last wrote you. we had a hard march the other day to
                    Shepards Town about twelve miles from this place. we were in a terrible hail
                    storm. I thought we would certainly be killed. but an overruling providence was over us. I had the pleasure of meeting
                        Doctor Baggs last evening at
                    twilight I was very much surprised &amp; agreeably <i>[unclear: too]</i>.
                    Sam is here but I have not <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>seen him yet.</p>
<p class="p10"> I wish I had time to write you a long letter but I must stop for the present.
                    may heaven bless <u>you.</u> &amp; may <u>I</u> be permitted to <i>[unclear: return]</i> again and
                    have the pleasure of seeing once more <u>the</u>
                    <u>object</u> of my affections. Lieutenant Mc<i>[unclear: Harry]</i> is going home this morning on a
                    furlough. If you want to hear all about the <i>[unclear: Ferry]</i> just go
                    over to his house as soon as you get this &amp; you'll hear all.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>Tony Pastor</u>
                    </i></p>
