    <p>Yours of the 15<hi rend="super">th</hi> came yesterday, the first glad messenger I have <abbr
      expan="received">rec'd</abbr> for a long time &amp; right welcome it was -- delighted with
     the tidings that you felt cheered up -- had been visiting some &amp;c &amp;c and also
     with the news from Allie -- I have written you all the news up to date -- wrote to you only day
     before yesterday, from Shepherdstown -- yesterday we came back here to our old camp -- Anderson
     came back towards Winchester &amp; today the Yankee cavalry has been demonstrating all
     along our front &amp; our cavalry has fallen back some, but we have remained quietly in
     camp &amp; there has been preaching, for the first time in a good while -- I have never
     known a more active campaign, but is the only kind to protect us from the movements of the
     Yankees -- we must keep them busy all the time or their roving dispositions will cause them to
     annoy us.</p>
    <p> Henry K. Cochran was drunk &amp; remained <pb n="2"/> behind at Chambersburg to ransom
     houses for "greenbacks" &amp; was killed by some of the Yankees or citizens, no one knows
     which -- Some of our men behaved very badly, but I wrote to you about that before Allie has
     found it as I expected -- I have seen enough of Northern society in our visits to <abbr
      expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> &amp; <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> to satisfy me that
     any one holding Southern sentiments there would be uncomfortable -- The boys &amp;c. serve
     her as they used to me -- I distinctly remember a chill I once had in Aug. riding from Great
     Bend to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, that nearly froze me. It is strange she did not get my letter -- I
     enclosed it in one to Nancy &amp; she ought to have <orig reg="known">know</orig> the
     address. I am not surprised at the turn her affair with Capt. Stenett has taken -- absence has,
     as usual, sweetened love &amp; he has found an aching void no one else can fill -- I am
     glad of it on account of both parties &amp; will write to Allie the first time I have a
     chance to come to Martinsburg or Shepherdstown &amp; from there she can easily get <pb
      n="3"/> up the Valley -- we go to those places every week or so &amp; they change hands
     regularly every fortnight, this offering great facilities for coming or going -- I found an old
     acquaintance at Sheperdstown, the Rev. Miller, of the Lutheran <abbr expan="Church">Ch.</abbr>
     who formerly preached in Mt. Crawford &amp; she can come to his house I think there will be
     no trouble about her getting through, I am really delighted at the faithfulness they show
     &amp; think it augers well for their future -- I am glad too to have relations marry
     &amp; live near us &amp; help to make home circles I will write for her sister to come
     with her, but not unless her sentiments accord with Allie's for without that she would be as
     uncomfortable <orig reg="here">her</orig> as Allie is there. William is well &amp; doing
     well, is an excellent boy -- I ate come corn yesterday that did not agree with me &amp;
     have been under the weather today, but feel better this evening -- it is the first time I have
     been at all unwell. I bought you a pound &amp; a half of tea which I will send you by the
     first chance -- I <abbr expan="could">cd.</abbr>
     <pb n="4"/> only find black tea -- but will try &amp; get other during the summer -- I paid
     $25. Confederate for the 1 1/2 lbs -- I think I will get you some nice <orig reg="flannel"
      >flannell</orig> next time we go to Shepherdstown -- I have heard where there is some -- I see
     by a recent order that all the detailed farmers are <hi rend="underline">obliged</hi> to <hi
      rend="underline">sell</hi> all their surplus to soldiers families at the government price or
     be put into the Army -- So I hope you will have no difficulty in procuring supplies -- Did my
     letter with the ribbons &amp;c come to hand -- I send you a few stamps &amp; envelopes
     I have but few stamps on hand -- It is quite cool -- wish I could have a bedfellow to help me
     to keep warm -- How do the children like the books &amp; you the bonnet stuff? -- I lately
     saw some children's &amp; ladies hats made of corn shucks -- &amp; trimmed with the
     same wrought into a band of rosettes &amp;c -- they were very pretty Write often -- Good
     bye my sweet one &amp; may the Lord bless you all --. </p>
