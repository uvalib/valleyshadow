<p class="p10">February 27<sup>th</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Ewell</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to drop you a line to let you know that I am
     well <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[unclear: usual]</i> I received yours mailed <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> hear that you were well and hope this may find you
     still enjoy the same blessing my health has improved since I last
      wrote you, the Doctor has never told me what he thought was the matter
     with me I believe it was all caused by the diarrhea. Dear Giney I
     have no news to write you today we have had orders to send off our extra
     baggage I did not send any thing but the
      Jug that you sent with molasses in if it is
     not lost it will come to W<sup>m</sup> Dunlaps we may have to move from here soon and we may not there is no telling how it may be.</p>
<p class="p10">I was told this morning that Baylor will be
     here this evening with a box for me this I did not expect if he gets
      here before the mail leaves I <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[unclear: tell]</i> you all about it if it <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> hope we may not move <i>[unclear: before]</i>
     we can use it. if we do I will sell it out the
     best I can.</p>
<p class="p10">there is talk of this Brigade being turned to cavalry by the
     request of the men I do not know how it will be
     yet the papers have been sent up to General Lee. General Gordon has
      been assigned to command of the valley he
     wants us mounted and assigned to his command. I am afraid this will fail but wish it may not if
     I must fight I would rather fight in the valley than anywhere
     else
     especially if they let us ride the men have<i>[illeg.]</i> to
      <i>[unclear: move]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> that is the most of them will furnish their own horses for my part I would as leave my horse would carry me
     as to be left exposed to be stolen at home. if it should turn out as
     they talk I <i>[unclear: will]</i> let you know as soon as I am sure
     of it. I must stop for the present will wait to see if Baylor comes this evening Well I must
     finish my letter for the mail Baylor has not come yet I will write
     soon again and let you know about the box Tell
     Nealy I am much
     obliged to her for her letter will answer it soon will direct this as you wish but think it will take a day
     or two longer before you get it though I may be mistaken you must excuse
     me for not writing more this time will try and do better next
      <i>[unclear: time]</i>
    </p>
<p class="p10">Well Baylor has come he came last night he brought two letters for
     me one from you and one from Pa the boxes have not come from the railroad yet suppose they will
     be in today well Giney I <i>[unclear: must]</i> stop for this time or miss the mail</p>
<p class="p10">so nothing more but<br> Remain your affectionate<br> husband until death</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John P. Dull</i></p>
