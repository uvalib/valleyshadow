<p class="p10">Dear affectionate companion</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself to drop you a few lines. this will inform you that i
     am well and hope that when this comes to hand it may find you enjoying the Same blessing i received. i
     received the letter yours of the 23rd yesterday and was happy to hear
     from you all and that you was all in good health but am sorry that you are so through other. i
      hope that this may find you all right. I know
     when one gets to studying they don't feel so
     well for i have had the trial of it more than once. this appears to me to be a hard way of
      living the way things goes
     nowadays but then i think there is a
     better day a coming and that cheers me up [a]gain and i look forward
     to the future and hope this cruel war will soon come to an end and so
     we can return to our homes and have the pleasure of sitting around
     our own fireside with our wives and children. i think often of the times that is past and
     gone and think of the times that is now. what a change of affairs in a few years. it is enough to make one shudder to think of it. [part of the letter is missing or illegible at this point]
     Doctor Robson was down here a few days ago and
     he told me that some of the neighbors was or had reported John
     had for to be old enough for service but David Kyle said he would do
     all he could to keep him with you and the Doctor said he would do all he could in our behalf. i did or don't think John Rolston is eighteen yet but i sort of forgot his age but if
     he is eighteen they can't keep him out of
     service i am afraid. You stated in your last letter that some of the
      neighbors thought that there was a
     chance for me to be exempted as a farmer. the sooner you attend to it the better it will be. i
      haven't much chance to do anything of that kind here and you could do more with it than i could here. there is nothing like trying. you wish to know what i
     think about our chance about the times of war. it is a hard question but i don't think that our chance looks as gloomy as it did some months ago. the soldiers is is pretty good spirits now to what they was some time ago. those people that goes to the yanks i judge they are of
     northern sentiments or ought to be. if they think they are right i
      won't stop them if i had the chance. for my part i don't
     feel like going there myself as yet i think if
     the South [torn away]</p>
