<p class="p10">Oct 15<sup>th</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Fredericksburg Va</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sister Kate</p>
<p class="p10">Your very kind long looked for &amp; ever welcome letter of the 11<sup>th</sup> just reached me safely about 8 o'clock last night. I was truly delighted to hear from you. I felt
                    exceedingly anxious about you when I wrote to you in September I was by no means
                    sure that my letter would ever reach you. Consequently I labored under many fears
                    &amp; doubts as to whether I should ever hear from <i>[added: you]</i> again or not &amp; to be deprived of a
                    correspondence with so dear a friend as I claim you to be would be truly hard to
                    bear with. Ah! my dear Kate I am sure you can form no idea how much I missed the
                    pleasures of your dear sweet letters during our long silence. I was truly
                    deprived of a pleasure beyond the comprehension of many but now that our
                    correspondence has commenced again I feel perfectly delightful I hope that
                    nothing may happen to <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>prevent a regular correspondence as long as we
                    continue to be such devoted friends. I am satisfied that marriage on my part
                    will never make me forget my dear sweet sister Kate as for my dear little friend
                    Lou she is well aware that you &amp; I are devoted friends &amp;
                    correspondents &amp; I know her well enough to be perfectly satisfied that
                    one of her kind &amp; gentle nature will, or does highly appreciate your
                    true &amp; unselfish friendship for sure, but as for marrying, indeed my
                    friend that is something that I certainly don't expect
                    to do soon my present situation will not admit of any thing of the sort. Were I to get married now I don't
                    think that I would be doing any lady justice in consequece of my embarrassed
                    situation in life. I <i>[added: am]</i> fully determined
                    never to marry any one until I feel capable of placeing the object of my
                    affections in a parallel condition to her present one
                    or better it if possible. Therefore I fear it will be a <u>long long</u> time before I can realize any thing of the kind. Well enough
                    on that subject <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I am truly glad to hear that your dear brother
                    &amp; friend Willis are safe at home after the great fall of our poor old
                    Confederacy. It is truly a great blessing that they were
                    spared to return to their homes &amp; loved ones. I assure you that I have
                    really enoyed peace &amp; quietude since the close of the war not
                    withstanding that it did not end in accordance with my desire &amp; at first
                    I was truly thunderstruck, but when I considered that the grief of one could not
                    possibly do any good I concluded I would try to enjoy peace &amp; the sweets
                    of home once more &amp; try to thank God that it was no worse &amp; that
                    a few of us were spared to tell the tale. You see from the steading of my letter
                    that I have left old Westmoreland for a season
                    &amp; am at this time staying at this place where I expect to be for several
                    weeks. Will try to keep you posted as to when I shall
                    remove from here so that your letters may always be properly directed so they
                    may reach me safely. You must write to me as often as you
                    can your letters are such a great comfort &amp; satisfaction to me. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>You must remember me kindly to your Pa &amp; Ma &amp; sisters
                    &amp; all enquiring friends if there be any, but of course I don't expect there are any from the fact that I have no
                    acquaintances in that section of the County. With much love for your dear self
                    believe dear Kate to be as ever</p>
<p class="p10">your ever affectionate &amp; truly devoted brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Robert</i></p>
<p class="p10">write soon &amp; direct to Fredericksburg Va
                            <br>yours R. <br>Oct 23<sup>d</sup> This letter was written the 15<sup>th</sup> but not
                        mailed until til today. No
                        changes have taken place I am well &amp; truly hope this may reach you
                        &amp; find you the same <br>my love to all, <br>yours fondly Robt</p>
