<p class="p10">October 19<sup>th</sup>1862<br> Three o'clock A.M.</p>
<p class="p10"> Chambersburg Franklin County
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Daughter Ellen</p>
<p class="p10">In your mother's letter of the 9<sup>th</sup>
                    instant she tells me that you are sick. she did not
                    tell me how long you had been so. but among other things said that you were
                    comfortable and furthermore that the worst of it was over. I was sorry to hear
                    that my Ellen was sick but it was a great comfort to be told in the same letter
                    that you were getting along well. I am sitting up with the wounded men of my
                    ward. and will write a few lines to interest you while you are laying in bed or
                    setting up in a chair as the case may be, but I hope you may be about the room
                    and still better if possible. My health is very good with the exception of a
                    headache that I had yesterday and the day before but it is now nearly over---My
                    patients are doing very well, there is nineteen of them, three <i>[deleted: of
                        them]</i> very badly wounded, <i>[unclear: ]</i> one was shot in the shoulder and
                    the ball is somewhere in him now his arm is infected
                    the whole length and it has been lanced above the
                    elbow for the second time it discharges very freely and is very painful. the man's brother was
                    here from <i>[unclear: Ind']</i> the other day to see him and stayed about a week Number two is
                    shot in the leg near the body, the wound is not very painful but he has a
                    difficulty on his lungs which I think he will hardly survive.--Number three is wounded in the leg just above the knee,
                    the bone was fractured, it is very<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    painful and I should not be surprised if in a week
                    or two his leg was amputated. All of the rest are quite comfortable and are able
                    the most of them to get about the room, and some of them
                        get out of doors, but of the nineteen in my ward seventeen are shot in the legs. I had twenty-two three went away the other day they were
                    also shot in the legs. I have two men to help me do the work, and I am what they
                    call in Hospitals <u>Ward Master</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">A young man in another part of the house had his leg cut off yesterday I saw the
                        operation it was the third case of the kind
                    that I have seen since the great battle of Wednesday
                    September 17<sup>th</sup> which I shall
                    remember as long as I live.-- The people of Chambersburg are very kind to our
                    wounded Soldiers they bring in a great many nice things such as grapes which
                    grow in abundance and are very sweet. Jellies of various kinds chicken broth,
                    milk toast, dry toast and many other things which it is unnecessary to mention.
                    The names of some of the ladies that are so kind to our soldiers are Mrs
                    McCellan, Nixon, Brown, Wright, Armstrong, McDowell, Wollace, Burnett &amp;
                    Reed. Chambersburg is a very pretty town of about four thousand inhabitant the
                    streets are paved and the sidewalks brick</p>
<p class="p10">The building that I am in was built for a College and
                    used as such until about the time that I came here I
                    think they will use it all winter for this purpose, and I think that I shall
                    stay here as long as they will let me if it is the remainder of my time with
                    Government.-- I hope this letter will Find you running about the yard. I have
                        thought of you many times since knowing that you
                    were sick I trust you are better by this time. write when you get well enough
                    but not too soon. I shall enclose a ten cent piece for you
                    to get something with love to all.--</p>
<p class="p10">From your Father</p>
