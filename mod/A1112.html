<h4>Augusta County: A. (?.) Gilkeson to Gilkeson's
                    brother (probably Hugh Gilkeson), September 21, 1858<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Gilkeson writes at length about his mother's death. He also tells of plans to
                    start a new hardware business in Staunton; and he offers his brother advice
                    about buying a slave.</p>

<p class="p10">September 21<sup>st</sup>/58</p>
<p class="p10">Brookfield</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">We received your letter on yesterday. I would have written to you a week or two
                    since, if I had known you would have expected another so soon. But I suppose
                    that David has given you the full particulars of our dear Mother's sickness and
                    death; and that you would not expect another letter from us before you would
                    write. David says he thought he had had been particular to state all the
                    circumstances; but there are many things which might occur to your mind which
                    would not occur to him, especially when writing at that particular time. I will
                    attempt the mournful task of giving you the full particulars. Some time in the
                    day on Tuesday, the 24<sup>th</sup> of August, I came down here and
                    found Mother in bed quite complaining. David said that she had retired the night
                    previous as well as usual, but <i>[added: in the
                    morning]</i> awoke quite unwell. I think she dressed herself that day, but laid
                    on the lounge all day. She retired to bed on Tuesday night and never left it
                    again. We wished to send for the Doctor the first day,
                    but she would not agree to it. On the following morning we sent for him,
                    notwithstanding she still objected. He pronounced her very sick, and said he
                    thought it was pneumonia. He visited her daily after that, and <i>[added: I]</i> think he still adhered to his first opinion as to the
                    nature of her disease. When she was first taken she threw <i>[added: up]</i> some blood and once or twice afterwards, but the
                    quantity at each time was inconsiderable. I think she gradually declined from
                    the first. I had very little hopes of her recovery after the first day; and, I
                    think, she was impressed with the belief from the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> first that she
                    would not recover, as she several times remarked to us that it was useless to
                    give her medicine. She suffered no severe pain during her sickness. The first
                    day or two she complained of pain in her breast and on side, but afterwards
                    always told us that she had no pain. There was evidently a constant uneasiness
                    in her chest, as she would often put her hand on her breast, even at the time
                    she was saying that she had no pain. We thought that we could see that she was
                    growing worse every day from the first. She did not rest well at night, yet it
                    was not deemed necessary to sit up with her, although someone laid on the lounge at her side for several nights previous to her
                    death. On Saturday we concluded that it would then be necessary to sit up with
                        <i>[added: her]</i> throughout the night, and on that
                    day Emma and I came down to stay until there would be a change. Doctor Watson (who you know has been practicing in partnership with Doctor Shelton for several years past) came to see her on Saturday
                    evening, and told us when he left, that if she continued to be so restless and
                    seemed as if she would not sleep that we must about 10 O'clock give her a few
                    drops of the elixir of opium. David sat up with her the first part of the night,
                    and I retired about 9 O'clock. At 10 she appeared so restless and uneasy that
                    David administered the opium according to directions. She soon fell into a sound
                    sleep. When I came down about 1 O'clock I found her sleeping very soundly; and I
                    felt fearful from that time that she would never again open her eyes in this
                    world. And, My Dear brother, my heart bleeds to say that my worst fears were
                    realized. At early dawn father and I made use of every effort that affection
                    could suggest or judgment could dictate to <i>[unclear: arouse]</i> her, but
                    our efforts were unavailing. After breakfast we sent for one of the Doctors: Shelton came, and, after inquiring what means we
                    had used and making<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> some more efforts himself, told us that human
                    skill could avail nothing. She slept on in this way, without changing her
                    position, until about half past four in the afternoon, when she calmly and
                    sweetly passed from this world to, as we hope and trust, a better and a happier
                    one. I am sorry I cannot tell you her last words. A short time before I retired
                    on Saturday night I was sitting by her side, when she asked me if it was Emma
                    who was coughing: she had, I think, heard someone
                    coughing in the adjoining room. These are the last words I remember to have
                    heard her utter. I think she made some remark to David about taking the opium;
                    and if so, they were her last words. I do not know know that she said anything during her sickness in reference to her
                    approaching end. But I do not wonder at that, as her mind has been very much of
                    a wreck ever since the severe spell of sickness she had three years ago. And, as
                    a matter of course, when she became sick her mind sympathized with her body, and
                    was proportionally weaker. Yet, I do not think her mind was as much affected by
                    her last sickness as by her sickness in 1855. Mother has never indeed been
                    herself since <i>[deleted: the]</i> the severe spell of sickness she had in
                    the beginning of the year 1850. We buried her by the side of your little
                    daughter, leaving room enough between the graves for another grave; thinking
                    that the ground would not be as likely to be occupied as if it had been left on
                    the other side of Mother's grave. You are mistaken in supposing Mother to have
                    been a few months older than Father. She was just one month younger. Father was
                    born on the 21<sup>st</sup> of February 1785, and Mother on the 20<sup>th</sup> of March of the same year. I can scarcely realize even
                    yet, that our dear Mother is no more. Mother, Dear Mother! Thou art gone: may
                    all thy family be re-united to thee in another and a better world. The thought
                    is truly distressing that the opium we administered for her relief should have,
                    in all likelihood,<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> hastened her death. But, there is some relief in
                    the thought that it, very likely, saved her some hours severe bodily suffering.
                    After death she wore the calmest and sweetest expression I ever saw. I have
                    thought for years that she could not be with us long; but O! I did not think
                    that I could feel her loss so much. Father bore up at first very well, but I
                    think, within the last few days, he seems to feel his loss more sensibly. He is
                    truly one of the best of men Oh! may he be spared to us yet a long time, with
                    his physical and mental facilities unimpaired. His health is very good at
                    present. He was at the springs when Mother was first taken sick, but returned
                    the next day. That was the time appointed for his return when he left home. He
                    has been troubled some this summer with the eruption in his face, but it has not
                    yet been near so bad as it has been at this season for several years past. His
                    eyesight is very much improved: can read with the assistance of spectacles
                    nearly as well as he ever could. You asked in a former letter what the Doctor charged for the operation: his charge was <u>$500.</u> We paid him $200, with the understanding that we
                    would pay him another hundred at a future day if <i>[unclear: we]</i> might see
                        <i>[unclear: proper]</i>. This was the compromise I don't think I could ever see <i>[unclear: proper]</i>, for I consider
                    him amply paid already. You will probably be surprised to learn that I have
                    changed my business. Mr Woods (who married cousin <i>[unclear: Lucy]</i>
                    Gilkeson) <i>[added: and I]</i> have bought out a hardware
                    store in Staunton. Mr Woods has been engaged in the shoe business there since
                    last spring. He sold out his shoe store, or rather put it in as part pay for the
                    hardware. We will move to Staunton in the course of two or three weeks: expect
                    to board for the present. We would have bought land but could not do so without
                    going in debt several thousand dollars, and were afraid to rent<i>[illeg.]</i>
                    for fear of the effect upon Father. You doubtless remember how uneasy he was
                    after purchasing the <i>[illeg.]</i> farm, &amp; <i>[unclear: 
                        though
                    ]</i> yearly payments there were not half as heavy as they would have been
                    if we had purchased now. And it was necessary that we should make some change,
                    as there were too many of us here to think. There is another hardware store in
                    Staunton. It is generally thought that we will do well. The stock cost a little
                    over $5000, and we will make an addition of another thousand soon.</p>
<p class="p10">You ask our opinion about selling some land and taking a mortgage on a negro
                    woman. We do not know what advice to give. I did not know that you had any more
                    land than you want. If you should take a mortgage on the woman, what would be
                    your situation if the woman were to die? or would you take a lien <i>[deleted: ]</i> the land besides? Another thing, I do not believe, as a general thing, that
                    it is desirable to own both husband and wife. I, however, do not pretend to
                    offer any advice, but just throw out these hints for what they are worth. Mr
                        <i>[unclear: Mogers]</i> and wife are here today.
                    He will start for home in the morning. I will send this letter by him, as you
                    will no doubt get it earlier than by mail. Do write as soon as you receive it.
                        Can't you come to Virginia
                    &amp; spend the winter with us? We would be so glad to see you. David
                    &amp; wife, I think, have declined going to Georgia this winter. Come if you
                    can, I think it would cheer Father up very much. And you know he [continued on
                    top of first page] is now getting quite old, &amp; <u>if</u> you do not get to see him soon you may never see him. It has now been a
                    lonely time since you were here, hence, we would all be delighted to see <i>[added: you]</i> and your children if you could bring
                    them.</p>
<p class="p10">All desire to be affectionaly remembered to you and your dear little ones.<br>
                    Do write soon and often. You know not how glad we are always to receive a letter
                    from you.</p>
