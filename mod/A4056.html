<p class="p10">Oct 19<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Brandy </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara</p>
<p class="p10">I just received your letter of the 13<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> telling me of the sad condition of poor Allie -- Heaven help her -- I am so sorry I was
     not at Home to cheer &amp; console her, it is such a blow to her &amp; to you -- alone
     as you both are -- I can only attribute it to the condition of his system, his nerves shattered
     by the rackings of his disease -- I do not want to think it anything else &amp; feel that
     as soon as he recovers from his prostration he must feel that he has cruelly wounded the
     feelings of one that confided so fully in him -- almost outraged them after desiring, almost
     insisting upon her remaining here -- I cannot bring myself to think he would act so meanly
     &amp; must lay all to the charge of his situation &amp; hope Allie will do so too
     &amp; cheer up &amp; await the return of health to him &amp; not by brooding over
     it impair her own I know the depth of her womanly love &amp; how it must prey upon her
     spirits, but she must lean upon that Almighty arm that changes not &amp; fear not, trusting
     that all will yet be well -- She need not fear want of any kind -- for we have told her that
     our home is hers &amp; she is as one of our own children &amp; I trust will so feel
     &amp; think. It is hard to have one's cherished desires crushed in
     a moment &amp; when we thought our joys almost complete to have them suddenly turned to
     sorrow but such is life -- such is the expereince of everyone &amp; it is sound philosophy
     &amp; true religion to meet the changes of life with resignation &amp; compassion when
     we are assured that we have fully done our duty -- so I bid you all cheer up &amp; hope for
     the "smiling face" behind the frowning providence. I am glad she was met so kindly by Rhett
     &amp; the others -- so was some sunshine to the stormy day -- I can also imagine the F. has
     been <i>[illeg.]</i> by some complaints of his poor old father<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>whose heart is
     unsanctified by religion has no joys of its own &amp; feels restless &amp; complaining
     &amp; these complaints to F in his condition have almost unhinged him &amp; hence his
     words &amp; manner -- so I think it may be &amp; a little time will restore him to
     himself -- Let us fondly hope so -- But I will say no more now -- though it presses sadly on my
     thoughts amid all this bustle of the moving of a mighty host. How full your feelings were my
     Dear your letter attests, for you mentioned nothing else save that you were well I have written
     to you 3 times &amp; sent you some money -- hope they have all come to hand -- I wrote to
     you last form Bristol we could not catch the Yanks to fight so we have destroyed the Railroad &amp; come back to Culpeper &amp; encamped -- I spent
     last night at Mrs. Wise's her daugthers were well &amp; had gotten along well, but were
     much surprised that their mother had not come over &amp; had only heard from her by the
     letter I brought over -- they are very anxious for their mother to send after the stock as they
     have no feed -- I wish you would tell Reed to send my butter over, our camp will be near Brandy
     at present -- he can find some one that is coming over to take charge of it &amp; we will
     pay expenses &amp; send him the amount as soon as we hear from it -- I think you had better
     buy a few bushels of potatoes of Mr. Geading -- I shall want a few bushels when we go into
     winter quarters -- I will send you $100 in a few days -- Hope you are <u>getting</u> along as comfortably as your situation will allow -- Much love and kisses for
     all the family - Good bye &amp; God blessyou all </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">Write soon to Brandy</p>
