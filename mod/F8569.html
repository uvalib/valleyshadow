<h4>Franklin County: Edward McPherson to [unknown],
                    October 18, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Edward McPherson responds to an incorrect rumor linking him in a conversation
                    with Judge Stephen Douglas. McPherson explains that he only overheard Douglas in
                    a conversation with someone else.</p>

<p class="p10">October 18/60-</p>
<p class="p10">Gettysburg Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir --</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of 16th inst., gave me the first information I received on the
                    subject to which it refers.-- It greatly surprised me to find my name connected
                    with an arraignment of Judge Douglas, and to observe the manner in which it has
                    occurred. I am very unwilling to be involved in the contest now going on between
                    rival interests in the Democratic party, but the publicity <i>[deleted: attached to the affair]</i> given it, &amp; your request, appear to
                    make it proper for me to <i>[deleted: write the delegate]</i> state a few
                    words of explanation.</p>
<p class="p10">I had a conversation with Alfred E. Lewis, Esq., on the <i>[deleted: street]</i> public square in Gettysburg, recently after my return from Washington in June. It was
                    casual, hurried &amp; brief. It was also unreserved, as is the intercourse
                    between personal friends--- It was <i>[added: also]</i> made
                    without the slightest idea that <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>it would
                    ever <i>[unclear: read]</i> the public <i>[added: &amp;
                        be used as a political lever]</i>.-- In that conversation I alluded to the
                    probabilities of W. <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> the people, to the <i>[unclear: ultimate]</i> possible
                    co-operation of some of the Douglas men, and to the preferences of Judge Douglas
                    himself.-- In this connection I made the remark
                    which he either misapprehended, or inaccurately remembered.-- This brings me to
                    the leading point.--</p>
<p class="p10">I never had a conversation with Judge Douglas on politics.-- At Senator Carr's party, <i>[added: however,]</i> on the Evening of May 18, I was standing in the
                    refreshment-room with friends, in the immediate vicinity of Judge Douglas who
                    was in Earnest &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> conversation with an officer of the
                    Army or Navy, whose name I do not know.-- I was <i>[added: first]</i> attracted by the <i>[illeg.]</i> of the Judge's manner <i>[deleted: and the]</i>. He was replying to a question concerning the <i>[added: then recent]</i> nomination of Mr. Lincoln <i>[deleted: then recent]</i>, whom the Judge <i>[added: referred to in compelling terms,]</i> &amp; the strength of whose
                    nomination he freely <i>[illeg.]</i>. The conversation soon turned on the
                    condition of the Senator's party, its rememberment of
                    Charleston, <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> &amp; its future.-- Among other points, was the
                    probability of the election going to the House -- Judge Douglas said with great
                    positiveness, that it never would go to the House, &amp; that, if necessary,
                    the NorthWest could be a <i>[unclear: writ]</i> to present it.-- The inference
                    I drew was that it would
                    <i>[added: ready]</i> be a writ <u>for
                        Lincoln</u>, as <i>[added: neither he nor any one else
                        could possibly hope to do or <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>]</i> he could not make it it a writ for any other
                    candidate.</p>
<p class="p10">At the same time, the Juge made some heated remarks about the Southern ultras,
                    whose course had deprived him of the nomination at Charleston, &amp; who
                    threatened to fight him to the bitter end. He said, &amp; repeated it with
                    emphasis and marked gesture, that he would rather see a
                    "Free Nigger" President than one of them.--</p>
<p class="p10">The Judge's remarks were not such as would easily be forgotten, &amp; they
                    impressed themselves upon my memory.-- I mentioned the incident to but few
                    persons, &amp; scarcely ever in detail.-- <i>[deleted: I alluded to it in
                        a general way to Mr. Lewis, as we of the <i>[illeg.]</i> that time, I have
                        had little doubt that there would be an election of
                        the people, or that <u>Abraham</u> Lincoln would be chosen.--]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I give it now, because it appears to be of some importance that I
                        should state <i>[deleted: precisely]</i>
                    <i>[added: (as you request)]</i> precisely the facts.--</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be</p>
<p class="p10">yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>Edward McPherson</u>
                    </i></p>
