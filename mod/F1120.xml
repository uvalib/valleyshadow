                <p>As I have not much time to write I will hurry and scribble a few lines to you. I
                    am well. Hoping that these few lines may find you enjoying the same blessing of
                    health.</p>
                <p>It is snowing today. I expect that we must move our camp tomorrow General Hancock
                    thinks that this is an unhealthy place.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned in my letter something about the 6th <orig reg="Corp">Corpe</orig>
                    suffering. The 6th supported the 3rd. It was the 3rd that suffered. They were on
                    our left. It was stated that 600 were killed and wounded and missing but out of
                    this number there was only 60 killed. I cannot tell how many wounded.</p>
                <p>Our line of battle was about 7 miles long at one time. I thought that the 2nd
                    Corps would have to fight but we got off quite lucky--We were laying as reserves
                    when our <orig reg="artillery">artilery</orig>
                    <orig reg="opened">oppened</orig> on the <abbr expan="rebel">reb</abbr>'s train.
                    We were that close that the smoke of the powder soon over-showered us.</p>
                <p>Some of the <abbr expan="rebel">Reb</abbr> shells came <orig reg="whistling"
                        >whisling</orig> that it made me dodge my head-the same as a sheep when the
                        <orig reg="flies">flys</orig> got bad.</p>
                <p>On Friday the 27th firing commenced. Along the skirmish line <orig reg="we"
                    >wer</orig> were <orig reg="back">bask</orig> as reserve. Firing was kept up
                    from 9 in the morning till in the evening.</p>
                <p>Saturday it was raining. We was in a miserable <orig reg="muddy">mudy</orig>
                    place in a line of battle. Then our men shelled <abbr expan="rebel">reb</abbr>'s
                    train. We laid down on Pine Brush for the night.</p>
                <p>The next morning we had to march without breakfast. We marched to the right of
                    our line. Monday night we slept on a hill in line of Battle, near <orig
                        reg="Orange">Organe</orig>. This was an awful cold night. We were <orig
                        reg="woken">waked</orig> up at 12 o'clock. We marched a short distance where
                    we were put in front on the picket line.</p>
                <p>On Monday Morning about 8 o'clock the <abbr expan="rebels">rebs</abbr>
                    <orig reg="opening">openen</orig> their <orig reg="pieces">peices</orig> of
                        <orig reg="Artillery">Artilery</orig> on us. Soon we got orders to lay down.</p>
                <p>Then we could hear the canons thunder. Their shells flew over us. At first I
                    thought if the shells would come hopping along they would <orig reg="tear"
                    >tare</orig> a person in two so I thought it safe to stand up. But they flew
                    over us so I felt <orig reg="safer">saffer</orig> to lay down. Shelling did not
                    last long.</p>
                <p>But I <orig reg="tell">teell</orig> you that I hated the sharp <orig
                        reg="shooters'">shooters</orig> bullets the worst. They would come
                    zip-zip-zip. So sneaking and they came pretty close. If ever I felt like hugging
                    the ground, I felt that way when I could hear a shell sailing over me. I felt as
                    though they were determined to kill if they could.</p>
                <p>We lay on that picket line 3 days and almost 3 nights. Then we fell back to our
                    old camp that night....all night and the next day all day.</p>
                <p>I have no time to write more. I have a book that I keep to mark such things in.
                    If I can see an opportunity I will give you a history of my travels.</p>
                <p>The mail will soon start out.</p>
