    <p>I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> yours of the 18<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     <unclear>inst</unclear> yesterday. I am sorry to tell you that your Brother John is no more. He
     was killed in the battle at Winchester, shot in the head I think, though I am not certain for I
     did not see him, though I was told by some one who professed to know, he lived but a very short
     time after he was struck. I would <orig reg="have">of</orig> written to you immediately but I
     did not have time, I wrote home, and told my wife to tell Mary to write to you about and let
     you know the worst, I have but little good news to tell you, we had another hard fight on the
     19th <unclear>inst</unclear>

     back which raised a perfect <orig reg="stampede">stampeed</orig>, we captured wagons, <orig
      reg="ambulances">ambulences</orig>, mules, horses, eighteen pieces of artillery &amp;
     about 1500 prisoners. Though fortune turned &amp; we lost all the artillery that we
     captured &amp; I believe as much more, lost ambulance, wagons, &amp; I don't know what
     all we did not losses, though we got the prisoners out by hard work &amp; had it not been
     that they were in front of the train we would of gotten more of it out of the way. We lost but
     very few prisoners &amp; an unusual small number of killed &amp; wounded. Though <abbr
      expan="Company">Co.</abbr> H lost - I think, its full share of in killed we took 11 men with
     myself <pb n="3"/> into the fight out of that number there were two killed &amp; one
     wounded. <abbr expan="Sergeant">Sergt</abbr> B.F. Hupp &amp; W.H. McClung were killed or I
     suppose McClung is dead my this time for he was shot in the head just above the right eye, the
     ball is in his head, he was <unclear>insencible</unclear> in fifteen minutes afterward that was
     about 9 O'clock in the morning, he was not dead at sundown but still insencible, &amp;
     seemed to be <orig reg="dying">dieing</orig>, Jacob Runkle was wounded in the right shoulder
