<p class="p10">I take this presentopportunity to
      write you a few lines to inform you that I am
     well and i hope these few lines may find you and all of my friends
     enjoying the same blessing I have not heard
     anything from you all since I was down
      there I should have liked very much to have
      gone down to spent a few days with you all
     while I was at home but I could not get the chance and home seemed to be the best place I got
     so vexed at some of the
     acquaintances
     <sup>in the neighborhood</sup> that I did not care about going to see any of the neighbors
     our Company was at home two months some of the
     people begrudged our
     furlough they said they knew what we were sent home for
     because they could not feed us in the army
     and said we had to come and eat off of us and that did not please my appetite but thank god I did not
     pester them you may bet on that I think you might have writtento me some<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
     ago I suppose you think I might have done the
     same but you know that it is against my profession to write much I have been
     here ever since the 6 of march and have not got but one letter and
     that was from Andy I have written home three
     or four times and to mary also I heard from Andy yesterday he is well I must bring
     my letter to a close

      prayers
