                <p>Old <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> is after me hard - he has thrown several members from me in
                        <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Phila</abbr>
                    <unclear>Sainesce</unclear> (Dauphin) Carey, <unclear>Bugner</unclear> are in
                    his interest. I have his tracks, and to day wrote him very frankly, that if his
                    personal interests were to be flung into the contest for Speaker I meant to
                    understand the case fully. I will soon have him understand that in such a fight
                    he may <hi rend="underline">possibly</hi> throw me, but that I will <hi
                        rend="underline">certainly</hi> fling him.</p>

                <p>I understand him; He <pb n="2"/>will fight as long as there is a fair prospect of
                    defeating me, when hope fades, he will fawn around all of us. If it only once
                    becomes understood that <hi rend="underline">he</hi> has a candidate for Speaker
                    to advance his Presidential aspirations. I can safely pledge you that <hi
                        rend="underline">that</hi> candidate can't be nominated.</p>

                <p>Among them they have flattered Patterson until he scarcely knows whether he is
                    for me or not. Can he control Wagonseller?</p>

                <p>My letter <orig reg="today">to day</orig> written to him will wake him up: It is
                    respectful and conciliatory but its determined to <unclear>no</unclear> he will
                        <pb n="3"/>fully comprehend. When I hear from him I will write you.</p>

                <p>I don't fear him. He may throw a few weak men into <unclear/>: but before the
                    session convenes he will be better understood, and even weak men will see him
                    for they are to be used &amp; cheated.</p>

                <p>Excepting to yourself <unclear>B-ger</unclear> &amp; a few others, I have
                    been non-committal on the Treasurer question. If circumstances can <unclear/> to
                    done me from my well settled choice, and I shall <unclear>informing</unclear>

                    to sustain you efficiently.</p>

                <p>I have a letter from <unclear>Nymuller</unclear>
                    <pb n="4"/>volunteering to for me, and asking me to go for you and to take care
                    of him. Doubting whether he is a safe man, I told him I would not pledge myself
                    for Treasurer, but offered him to you, stating that my position was perfectly
                    satisfactory to yourself.</p>
