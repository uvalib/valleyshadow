<p class="p10">My dear Sweet Sister</p>
<p class="p10">The ever dear white winged messenger from your hand of the 23<sup>d</sup> just came duly to hand yesterday which found me comparatively well &amp; truly glad to hear
                    from you. Tis useless for me to undertake to give you an idea of the pleasure it
                    affords me to receive a letter from you or to describe the feeling &amp; interest with which each &amp; every
                    line is carefully read. Would that I could be the recipient of such dear letters
                    every day but truly it is a pleasure that such a character as I do not deserve.
                    Well Christmas is over, it past very quietly with me I met with no gay crowds or
                    rather visited no place where there was merry making. Christmas day I went to
                    Church &amp; heard a very good &amp; appropriate sermon delivered by Doctor Duncan of this City in the afternoon I called on a friend for a Short time
                    &amp; at night went to Church again. Thus past the day making the fourth
                    Christmas Since the war all of which I have spent away from home. The only treat
                    I had during this Christmas week was the receipt of you Ever welcome letter
                    which was handed me yesterday about noon. I am just
                    learning how to appre<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>ciate such pleasures. It
                    was always very agreeable to me to correspond with my friend, but situated as I
                    am now makes it doubly so. Away from my home &amp;
                    among Entire strangers leaves me quite a lonely life, it is truly more
                    monotonous here than it was in all my Experiences in camp. tis true, I believe
                    that I have made many friends while here but I am
                    deprived of the social comforts that I enjoyed with my company for there, I have
                    a fond brother whose society has been the greatest source of my pleasure ever
                    since I have been old enough to duly appreciate a brothers love and were I
                    deprived of a correspondence with you <u>dear Kate</u> - dreary, &amp; almost comfortless, would be Every hour of my life. Just think what a
                    pleasure to have some dear loved one who, though separated from me by many
                    miles, still I have the pleasure of speaking with though it be through the
                    silent medium of the pen, tis truly gratifying believing as I do that I am
                    honored to night with this pleasure of writing to one who loves me with <u>a pure sisterly unselfish love</u> on whose word I may,
                    with impunity confide, believing that her pure heart knows no treachery, one
                    whom I love above all others of her sex, save her to whom I have given my heart
                    &amp; hand, with the promise <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>that the arm &amp; hand which
                    wields this pen shall shield her fragile form, through a life time that I hope
                    may be as pleasantly ahead as the few short hours are now in writing to my dear
                    Sister Kate.</p>
<p class="p10">You stated in your letter that you wished to know how many brothers &amp;
                    sisters I have. I have four brothers &amp; four sisters. There are nine of
                    us in all. My Father and Mother are both living. My Father is nearly 75 years
                    old. My Mother about 66. I am the youngest son living, I have one sister younger
                    than my self. She is the youngest child &amp; she is grown. Well Kate last
                    Tuesday the 20<sup>th</sup> one year ago we parted a day Ever to be
                    remembered by me. What wonderful changes has taken place
                    since that eventful day. Twas there &amp; then
                    that I <i>[deleted: gave]</i>
                    <i>[added: took]</i> the last fond looks upon one who has
                    made a lasting impression upon me though I never (at that time) Expected to see
                    or hear from you again but so forcibly was I impressed <i>[deleted: though
                    you]</i> and strangers as we were these lines presented them selves to me.
                    <br>"We met as perfect strangers, <br>"But when we came to part <br>"Love had
                    improved its image <br>"Upon my throbbing heart <br>And upon the impulse of
                    the moment I determined to write to you regardless of the result which I did
                    &amp; am proud <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>to say that I have never regretted it. I have
                    found that my ideas of physiognomy &amp; human nature in my slight
                    observation has served me justly. You have proved to be
                    the realization or rather the result of my course has been a realization of what
                    might have been termed a castle built in the air for you are all that I had
                    fancied you were in my silent musings <i>[illeg.]</i> simple language, <u>a pure hearted kind affectionate good girl</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Well dear Kate, I will not impose any longer on your patience, but will close my
                    uninteresting &amp; uninstructive letter. You must
                    remember me kindly to your dear parents &amp; your sisters. Say to your Sisters that I am glad to hear that they are so merry
                    hope you all spent a gay Christmas. I wish I could have been with you, tell miss
                    Molly that I did not get light but probably it was for the want of spirits.
                        Tell her not to leap too soon
                    - who knows but what Lou may give me a sacking - <i>[deleted: the Old Augusta]</i>
                    <i>[added: then Rose Dale]</i> might have increased charms
                    for me, goodbye dear Kate I hope miss Molly will
                    pardon me, for my bold suggestion. With my warmest
                    wishes for your welfare &amp; happiness,</p>
<p class="p10">I remain as ever <u>affectionately</u></p>
