<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando
                    Brown, May 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In his report, Jordan describes his efforts to mediate legal disputes between
                    whites and blacks in Augusta County in the hopes that it will "save much unkind
                    feeling between the races."</p>

<p class="p10">May 31st 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Par VI Circular No 10 from Head Quarters Assistant Commissioner
                    Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands Richmond Virginia March 12
                    1866 relating to the result of the operation of the "Order" restoring to the
                    "Civil Courts" jurisdiction over colored persons in the trial &amp;c of
                    criminal &amp; civil cases I have the honor to report as follows, viz.</p>
<p class="p10">There were but few cases in which colored persons appeared as parties to the
                    action brought before the Courts in my Division during this month. While I am
                    convinced that these Courts <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>cannot as a general thing be entrusted
                    with the class of cases alluded to yet this month I have no instances to report
                    wherein any injustice was inflicted upon a colored person by reason of prejudice
                    &amp;c neither has my attention been called to any complaint coming from a
                    colored person reflecting upon any authority vested with the power of regulating
                    or instituting proceedings in criminal or civil cases.</p>
<p class="p10">Every effort is made by me to bring about peaceable &amp; just adjudications
                    between all parties i.e. between white and colored and between the colored
                    themselves, thus preventing useless expense and unnecessary risks to the
                    freedmen -- This line of policy saves much unkind feeling between the races and
                    has evidently contributed <i>[unclear: vastly]</i> toward bringing them <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>to a more just comprehension of each other.</p>
<p class="p10">The Criminal Dockets bear evidence of a marked decrease in crime as among the
                    Freedmen and I hear of but few instances of theft and disturbances of the public
                    peace complained of as being perpetrated by this class.</p>
<p class="p10">I am General<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient
                        Servant</p>
