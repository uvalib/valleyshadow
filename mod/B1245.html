<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Emily Rodney to Orlando
                    Brown, April 2, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Emily Rodney writes to protest her being barred from preaching to the black
                    population of Staunton by Frederick Tukey and the Freedmen's Court. She writes
                    that the people should be free to worship as they choose, and complains that she
                    was not given a proper hearing. The attached endorsement by Tukey states his
                    side of the case, in which he argues that Miss Rodney was undermining the unity
                    of the community.</p>

<p class="p10">April 2d 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Last fall about 1st September I was sent on a Mission
                    by our church to Staunton Virginia to look after the
                    Spiritual interest of My People. I found them without any shepherd and
                    worshipping in the abasement of the Church South. I read our discipline to them
                    and almost all of them voted to join our Church numbering about 500; and the
                    list enclosed of 139 names are those who agreed to contribute towards building a
                        African Methodist Episcopal Church. </p>
<p class="p10">Reverend W. D. Harris by authority from Bishop Payne
                    sent <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>a Preacher (Reverend Mat. Marshal to
                    preach for them, who went up and labored with the people very acceptably for 3
                    or four weeks and the people were willing to unite with our church and were
                    anxious to do so. But Mr. Tukey advised him to let them remain where they were
                    until Spring so Mr. Marshal complied with Mr Tukeys wishes and left them but
                    during the winter the Washington Conference sends a man there who receives Mr.
                    Tukeys cooperation and a portion of the members join the Washington Conference
                    Church we have nothing against their having all the members who desire to belong
                    there but we do ask as in the the name <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>of Justice and Religious
                    Liberty that the people be allowed to worship God according to the dictates of
                    their consciences and that they be allowed to join the Church of their first
                    Choice, and that your humble servant be allowed to preach and hold meetings with
                    the people in the usual orderly and peaceful Manner. I was sent for by the
                    people, I went and found them divided and in a very unsettled and dissatisfied
                    state, I labored for Union, and love, and peace among them. By false accusations
                    I was summoned to appear before Mr. Tukey who advised me to desist from
                    preaching until some money was raised for the preacher of the Washington Conference Church. I complied until he went
                    away <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I commenced holding my meetings again far away from their place
                    of Meeting and Mr. Tukey summoned me before him, to a trial. I took witnesses
                    along with me but he heard the testimony and statements of my enemies and
                    refused to hear any statement of facts from my friends or witnesses and then
                    decided that I should not hold any <u>more</u>
                    <u>meetings</u>
                    <u>in Staunton</u> and that I should stop <u>preaching</u> there. I told him that I should appeal to
                    you from his decision. He stated that he believed me to be a lady and that my
                    motives were pure. I now respectfully but earnestly ask that I be allowed to
                    continue to hold meetings in a lawful way in Staunton. The people are determined
                    to join the African Methodist Episcopal Church and
                    have sent for a Minister to come and organize them into a church according to
                    agreement last fall.</p>
<p class="p10">Most respectfully submitted</p>
