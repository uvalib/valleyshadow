<p class="p10">Sunday June 28th 1863.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Pa,</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to Nannie the day after the battle of Winchester, but it is very
                    uncertain whether you even received the letter or not and I know you are all
                    very anxious to hear from me. After leaving Winchester out division went to
                    Sharpsburg &amp; remained there about 3 days on the old battlefield, From
                    there we marched on through Hagerstown which is a pretty little town in Maryland
                    &amp; contains some good Southern men. The day we left Hagerstown we crossed
                    the Pennsylvania line &amp; since then we have been marching constantly
                    &amp; through the finest country I even laid my eyes on, inhabited by the
                    hardest looking set of people -- <u>abolition Dutch</u>. We
                    have passed through such a number of little towns that I cant recollect the
                    names of half of them but the principle ones were Chambersburg &amp;
                    Shippensburg. The former is a place of about 10,000 inhabitants, all <u>Dutch</u> &amp; the meanest looking white people I
                    ever saw. They were scared nearly to death at the bare idea of having the rebel
                    army among them &amp; evidently expected to be burnt alive. I had a
                    discussion with an old Dutchman on the right of secession &amp; War matters
                    generally, the day I was in Chambersburg. I also had a warm debate with a
                    regular abolition woman. I wouldn't say that everything I wished to the woman
                    but if I didn't abuse that old Dutchman, then I am one myself. General Lee has issued positive orders against
                    individual plundering &amp; burning, but tells the Quarter Masters to pitch right into everything they see that is needful for
                    the Army. At Chambersburg the Quarter Masters emptied
                    every store in the place and our men are living luxuriously. We bought
                    everything we wanted at our own price in the town, &amp; the country is full
                    of everything good to eat. We get as much Butter, Lard &amp; Molasses as we
                    want, &amp; vegetables to. Yesterday evening we arrived at our present Camp,
                    which is three miles from Carlisle. I could have gotten a pass to go in there
                    this morning but it was Sunday &amp; I wanted to remain in Camp today
                    &amp; write some letters. The greatest consternation prevails all through
                    Yankee-dom &amp; they are busy sending on the "Milish" to meet us at
                    Harrisburg. We will leave here, I <u>think</u>, tomorrow,
                    &amp; Harrisburg is only 18 miles distant. It will be rare fun fighting the
                    "Milish". Old Hooker is perfectly at a loss what to do. He cant bring his army
                    up here &amp; he doesn't know what to do with it where he is. I dont know
                    what General Lee's plans are, of course, but it is
                    generally hoped &amp; believed that after taking Harrisburg, he will sweep
                    down the Susquehanna on Baltimore &amp; Washington, having destroyed their
                    great line of communication North. Our army is in fine spirits &amp; a
                    straggler is something that you never see now. This corps, I believe, can whip
                    all the Militia in the United States. We have splendid Horses for our Artillery,
                    an abundance of forage for them &amp; the men draw rations of everything. I
                    just wish you could see all the crops here. Pa, I never saw such wheat &amp;
                    corn in my life. Every man has a little bit of a <u>dwelling</u> house &amp; a magnificent barn, probably about 80 or 90 feet
                    long. We can hardly ever get the Richmond papers now. If we are successful in
                    this move up here &amp; also in the Southwest I think there will be hopes of
                    an early peace.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard a word from Home since I left Fredericksburg &amp; you may
                    imagine how anxious I am to hear from you. I wrote to Uncle George at
                    Sharpsburg. Send you letters to Uncle George &amp; ask him to get Mr. Wall
                    at the Adjutant General's office to send them by
                    courier. Cousin Wattie has promised to forward any letters which I wish to send
                    back. I shall take this over to him this evening. I have not seen him within the
                    last few days. Did Nannie receive the letter containing his picture? There is
                    nothing worth writing &amp; I must now close. Write immediately &amp;
                    give me all the news. Give my best love to Mama, Sister, Bec &amp; Dinkie
                    &amp; kiss Jack for me. Give my love to Uncle Watt &amp; to Aunt Mary
                    &amp; Wattie when you see them. Dont be uneasy because you dont hear from
                    me. I will write as often as possible. Goodbye.</p>
<p class="p10">Your
                        affectionate son</p>
