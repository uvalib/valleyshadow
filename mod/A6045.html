<p class="p10">Wednesday Eve</p>
<p class="p10">Moffetts Creek</p>
<p class="p10">
      <u>Dear Cousin Thomas</u>
     </p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you will be much surprised to receive a letter from me,
     but I have waited so long to hear from you &amp; have as yet waited in vain <i>[deleted: and]</i> I concluded I would write first I intended writing to you last week but it was
     reported here that the Southern Guards had left the Ferry so I concluded to wait awhile yet.
     Charlie &amp; Annie received letters from Harpers Ferry by Mr
      <i>[unclear: Ceaig]</i> but I did not. it was a sad disappointment to me. <u>but the renewal of Hope gave me Consolation</u> We are all very well also
     the neighbors are well I saw your people all at church Sunday they were all well. Your Aunts
     &amp; Uncle are all well<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley17b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley17b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      your Uncle has not been at church this spring yet but he was so
     well last Sunday that Cousins Annie &amp; Ellen were both at church</p>
<p class="p10">There seems to be nothing new or uncommon occurring in the neighborhood &amp; don't have much excitement about war now we have not become <i>[unclear: ]</i> to so
     many of our men leaving &amp; don't think we can as our loss has
     been great in comparison with the losses other neighborhoods have met with. Cousin Tom I must
     tell you of the Secession Flag that was hoisted in the important place of New Port. We had a
     delightful time had a nice crowd of <i>[unclear: geats]</i> all the way to two or three
     Lincolnites (as we call the Union men) but the Speeches delivered were by far more entertaining
     than anything else. When I tell you the Speaker or speakers you
     certainly will laugh. Mr Echard the self important man was the first had his written down
     &amp; read it off. I could not help laughing. Mr Jim Callison made a
     short speech it was<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley17c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley17c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     very good and a very appropriate one</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Echard is not married yet but is still flying around with the ladies but goes to other
     parts when he wishes to wait on them. I believe he is afraid of the girls around here. I
     suppose you have heard that Bill Anderson started away with the troop and went as far as
     Staunton and was taken sick. I expect he wanted some excuse to get back home anyhow. I tell you I don't believe in cowardice. (in time of
     war no way.) and we have too much of that great evil about here. If I
     were a man I would have gone long before this and would now be serving my country. I would like
     to visit you all &amp; see how you are getting along I suppose you have a nice time when
     cooking time comes. If you all ever return I have no doubt but you will be considered great
     &amp; learned men I guess every girl would fight for a Soldier &amp; me with the rest
     as I think they would be useful at all times</p>
<p class="p10">I heard the other day that John Beard was<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley17d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley17d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      walking along and saw a pretty girl &amp; made a misstep and
     rolled down on the bank of the River thats a fine fate but I am glad
     you all have some pretty girls to look at. Where do you all stay now in a house or where I hope
     you will have your Tents in a few days more. We all sewed in New Port last weeks for several
     days in order to get them done we made four there and five or six in Middlebrook but they
      <i>[unclear: had]</i> sewing <i>[illeg.]</i> and we didn't there is
     a great quantity of sewing in them your female friends would do everything in the world for you could it afford you the least pleasure or comfort in the
     world. I suppose you all don't care about coming home on furlow. We
     would all be very glad to see any of you. &amp; nothing gives me more pleasure than to
      receive a letter from any of you Soldiers. Ma &amp; Pa came
     home from NewPort a few moments ago &amp; told us Mr Grove &amp; Captain Hite were going to start with your Tents tomorrow &amp; we concluded to write
     and send our letters with him &amp; you would be sure to receive
     them. I asked John M<sup>c</sup>Kerry to speak to you &amp; some more of my
     acquaintances to have their Likenesses taken together with their uniforms for me. If you have
     them taken I will be under many obligations to you. Did you receive
     the Secession Badge I sent you if I could have had time I would have made more but Lieutenant M<sup>c</sup> did not say anything about it until a
     day or so before he left &amp; we had to go to church that day Has Lieutenant M<sup>c</sup> been in any better spirits since he went back. I
     thought he looked badly and<br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley17.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley17.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      looked very badly but I did not wonder at it when he seen his Men
     looking so badly &amp; so much distressed about them his situation is certainly a
     deplorable one Cousin Tom we have some great times here with the Union Men. we were raising
     money for our flag &amp; asked Mr Billie Beard but he would not give us one cent you I
     suppose are aware of the fact that he is a strong <u>Unionist</u>. I must
     stop writing as it is late. Give my best love to all my acquaintances Ma Annie &amp; all
     the rest of the family send much love to you. Please excuse bad writing etc.
     etc. as I have been in a hurry. </p>
<p class="p10">Please write soon &amp; believe me as ever your true cousin</p>
