                <p>I saw Tip Griffin yesterday who told me that you were very uneasy about me. I got
                    to the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> Saturday the 9 and would have <orig
                        reg="written">writen</orig> yesterday but the mail was carried off before I
                        <orig reg="knew">new</orig> it. I wrote to you once from Columbia and again
                    at Ashland. Tell Ma I am a better hand to take care of my self than she thought.
                    I flanked the Yankees until I got across the James <abbr expan="River">R.</abbr>
                    and please don't be so uneasy about me in the future.</p>

                <p>
                    <unclear>Col</unclear> M &amp; Judge say that they think it best for me to
                    join the Wise Troop for three very good reasons. 1 that <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr> Steptoe is willing to take me in his mess. 2 you can get
                    nearly twice as much for your <orig reg="horse">hors</orig> to eat as a general
                    thing in a small Company than you can in a large &amp; when they issue corn
                    you get a bag for each company and if the company is small you get as much more.
                    3 and best reason you will fare better in that line <orig reg="yourself">your
                        self</orig>. You can buy any thing you want from the government at their
                    price with his consent.</p>

                <p>The mail is about to leave and I must close. Love to all the family &amp;
                    Cousin Kate. Direct your letter to <orig reg="Orange">Orang</orig>
