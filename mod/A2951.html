<p class="p10">May 18<sup>th</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Seeds farm Westmoreland Co Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sister Kate</p>
<p class="p10">You very kind and ever dear letter of the 5<sup>th</sup> of April was
                    duly received which found <i>[added: me]</i> quite well &amp; truly glad to hear from you. I
                    reckon you think very strange of me for not replying sooner but when I tell you
                    the reason I know you will forgive me. About 5 or 6 weeks ago my eyes became so
                    very weak that I could not possibly see to read of wrote consequently I could
                    not answer your letter, &amp; even now, it is with the greatest difficulty
                    imaginable that I can barely make out to write I am reduced to the painful necessity of wearing glasses. It is truly a sad misfortune for ones
                    eyesight <i>[added: to be]</i> so seriously impaired as is
                    the case with me at this time, but I hope by the constant use of green glasses
                    to have my sight restored. My Brother once <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>suffered with the same
                        misfortune but regained his sight by wearing
                    glasses. I hope I may be equally fortunate.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Sweet Sister (Oh! how I love to call you Sister) you must not expect a long
                    or interesting letter this time for it is very painful to my eyes while I am writing &amp; besides I can't see the lines on the paper consequently my writing
                    will be very crooked &amp; imperfect <i>[added: all]</i>
                    of which I hope you will excuse. I am really sorry that I cant write so as to
                    interest you for your <u>dear sweet letters</u> are always so
                    truly interesting to me, I wish my mind was more expansive, or that I was
                    capable of producing language that when transmitted to paper would fully unbosom my self to you. That I could tell you in
                    impressive language how dear you are to me &amp; how <i>[deleted: much]</i> I appreciate your friendship. Had I the
                    intellect of a Byron &amp; could <i>[added: wield]</i>
                    the pen of a Novelist then might I give you some idea of my <u>profound</u> admiration <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>of your inestimable worth as a <u>lady</u> a <u>Christian</u> a <u>true noble</u>
                    &amp; <u>constant</u> friend one whose love I regard as a
                    boon too sacred to be bestowed upon one so insignificant as my worthless self. I cannot use figurative
                    language therefore Dear Kate, can only say I believe you are good &amp; in
                    simple language say, I love you &amp; am devoted to you more than any friend
                    under the same circumstances. It is truly greivious to <i>[deleted: my]</i>
                    me Dear Sister that I am so situated that I can't visit
                    you. I know of nothing that would afford me so much pleasure as to be convenient
                    so I could enjoy your society often, but if ever I am blessed with means
                    &amp; opportunity, rest assured I will certainly visit you.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Sister Kate, I have no news to communicate that would
                    be interesting to you times are exceedingly dull &amp; money scarcer than I
                    ever knew it before. Farming is the principal order
                    of the day, though crops are looking <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>very badly in consequence of the
                    cold wet season, fears are entertained that crops will be very short this year
                    as the weather keeps so unnaturally cool. The health of the people is generally good in this community. I am in better health
                    than I have been for six months. My brother enjoys fine health. My father's
                    family is well himself excepted. He is quite old very
                    infirm &amp; constantly complaining.</p>
<p class="p10">You must remember me kindly to your father &amp; family, with much love for
                    your self</p>
<p class="p10">I remain as ever your fond friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Robt. B. Spillman</i></p>
<p class="p10">Write Soon</p>
