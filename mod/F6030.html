<p class="p10">October 23<sup>rd</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Academy Hospital<br> Chambersburg
                            Pennsylvania
                        </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Daughter Ellen</p>
<p class="p10">I was agreeably surprised this afternoon to receive a
                    letter from you dated the 20<sup>th</sup>
                    instant. I was right glad I can assure you to know that you were able to write. I had written a
                    letter to you but did not send it for I wished to get my pay and send some money
                    with it but I will write and send the two letters then send the money when I get
                    it I received a letter from Charles this forenoon
                    and have answered it. he told me about getting a box from home. He said that he
                    had caught a rabbit and had saved the fur for Frank. He tells me that he likes where he lives first-rate I am glad of
                    that hope he will stay all winter You say in your letter that you would like<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to have me tell you how I liked the people of Chambersburg well I
                    like them well thus far although I have had but very
                    little to do with them, but I judge of them by their acts. They are so kind to
                    the Soldiers that we cannot help but think at any
                    rate that they may be very good people. For instance a Mrs Brown sends one of
                    the soldiers his meals regular and has for more than two weeks probably will as
                    long as he stays. Mrs. McCellan brings in a great many things to eat. she most
                    always comes into my ward. there are others who are very much interested in the
                        welfare of our soldiers. the names of some of
                    them I mentioned in the other letter. I think that I should like to live in
                    Chambersburg if I had my folks with me. I think that the population of the town
                    is between six and seven thousand that is about the number that there is in
                    Marlboro is it not? The streets all run at right angles and are lighted with gas
                    in the night. The town takes its name from the man who founded it whose name was
                    Chambers. There are three papers printed in town. I directed one to mother the
                    other day over<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> in it you will find an account of the rebel raid into Pennsylvania
                    written by Colonel McClure. I will send another soon
                    perhaps they will be interesting for you to read---</p>
<p class="p10">from your Father</p>
