<p class="p10">January 13th, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp of 126th Regt. Penn. Vols.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">The <u>Rev. John Ault, Chaplain</u> of the 126th Regiment   Pennsylvania Volunteers having applied
                    for a certificate on which to <i>[illeg.]</i>nd an application for leave of
                    absence. I certify that I have carefully examined this officer and find him
                    unable to attend to the duties of his profession on account of a severe attack
                    of Influenza. He also suffers from Rheumatism, is much debilitated and entirely
                    unfit for duty. I further it as my opinion that removal from camp is necessary
                    in order for present permanent activity. He grows weaker daily. I therefore most
                    respectfully urge that he be granted a leave of absence for three weeks as I do
                    not believe that he will be able in a less period to resume the duties of his
                    office.</p>
