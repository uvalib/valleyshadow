<h4>Augusta County: Mary Anna Sibert to David H. Evans,
                    October 7, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Sibert confesses that she has sinned by thinking of Evans more frequently than
                    she has thought of God. She writes that her most earnest prayer is that God will
                    moderate her affections but closes the letter by urging Evans to pay her a visit
                    as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="p10">Mr. David H. Evans</p>
<p class="p10">I have just finished a heavy day's work &amp; the closing of Monday finds me
                    seated alone to answer your dear letter of Friday. I was so happy to hear from
                    you thankful to know you were well. How much I wish I could see you this
                    evening. I cannot wait until Saturday arrives with
                    calm patience I am wanting the day to come &amp; hurrying time for it seems
                    it does not pass swiftly enough to bring you near me. I was so glad &amp;
                    thankful when I read that you were coming this week for I do want to see your
                    dear face more than I can tell you or than you can ever believe<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for I
                    love you so truly &amp; entirely with all the deep devotion of my heart
                    &amp; nature that I am only happy &amp; contented when you are with me.
                    Oh I do indeed love you more &amp; more every hour of my life. I feel that I
                    am sinning by giving to you the love of both <u>heart</u>
                    &amp; <u>soul</u> I sin because I think more of you than of my God which makes you my Idol. I know this should
                    not be &amp; my most earnest prayer is that God will moderate my affection
                    so it will receive His holy blessings &amp; smiles. I fear in God's jealous
                    anger that He might take you from me for loving you more than I do "my father who art in Heaven." I will with His<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Divine aid love you in a way pleasing to Him then He will love &amp; bless
                    us both as nothing in this world can do but God</p>
