                <p>Your favor came to hand by M<hi rend="super">
                        <hi rend="underline">r</hi>
                    </hi> H- the money also came but I have not counted it but suppose it is <orig
                        reg="alright">allright</orig>. I have had so much to do tonight that I could
                    not get to look at it I stayed up last night until <orig reg="3 A.M.">3am</orig>
                    waiting for the train and am quite sleepy now but must write you a few lines.
                    Freddy has written you fully, and leaves me but little to say to you. I am
                    trying to get ready to come down again &amp; hope to be able to stay longer
                    next time</p>

                <p>We are well &amp; Freddy is getting fat eats <orig reg="hearty">harty</orig>.
                    he enjoys himself here very much. all seem pleased with him, and make much of
                    him</p>

                <p>I only wish that you were all <pb n="2"/> here with us. And I really begin to
                    feel that it would be best for you to move up I <orig reg="can't">can<hi
                            rend="underline">t</hi></orig> think of you being there doing your own
                    work. this is too hard for me to stand and I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> see
                    how you are to do much better there being no servants there to be had</p>

                <p>And for you to leave there now I fear our property would be more or less <orig
                        reg="destroyed">distroyed</orig>, &amp; again I feel as if this must be
                    the last campaign of the war &amp; then we may <add hand="h1" place="inline"

                    come</p>

                <p>There is <orig reg="an">a</orig> Irish girl Just come here a few days ago who was
                    formerly a chambermaid in the house, who wants a situation here I will see her
                    she may be willing to go down &amp; live with you <pb n="3"/> if she will go
                    she may be a good girl and suit you If she will go I will try &amp; get M
                    Harris to take her down with him for fear I may not get down for some days and
                    might be too late. she is used to work and may do well but <orig reg="don't"
                        >dont</orig> be too free with her as she may not stand familiarity. if she
                    come let her sleep in one of the rooms on porch or in small room at head of
                    stairs. If I fail in getting her to go I will try &amp; get some one to come
