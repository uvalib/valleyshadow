<p class="p10">May 22<sup>nd</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Hd Qrs Ramseur's Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 9th May was received last night. I
                    hasten to reply.</p>
<p class="p10">First let me express great satisfaction your Statement of facts affords me. I was
                    slow in believing that the veterans once commanded by our beloved and the
                    departed Hero, the Immortal Jackson, could or would ever falter in the discharge
                    of their duty. </p>
<p class="p10">I will briefly state the the occurrences of Sunday May 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    in order that you may understand <u>why</u> I reported to
                        Major General R.E. <i>[unclear: Rodes]</i>
                    that I had passed over <i>[unclear: Jones']</i>
                    Brigade and a <u>part</u> of General Paxton's. Having been in the advance Friday and
                        Saturday our Division was placed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> line on Sunday. Soon I was ordered to advance to the
                    support of our 2nd line. Arriving at the enemy's first line of breast works at a
                        <i>[unclear: dary]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: crisis]</i>. I found behind this line a large body of troops 3
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> sometimes 6 deep. I immediately halted my Brigade &amp; told these troops the order was to
                    advance. Directed them to move forward, that I would support them. Not a man
                    moved. I then inquired what troops were there.
                    Several men answered "I belong to the Stonewall Brigade" I asked for General Paxton, whom I knew
                    as a brave man and true. They could not tell me where he was but stated he had
                    moved to the Right. I then moved on to the right, asked again about 75 or 100
                        yards from the men I had just questioned. As above,
                    what troops they were lying in my front. I was answered "We belong to the
                    Stonewall Brigade" I hastened on to the right. About
                    fifty yards further to the right <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>when I
                    found an Officer in Majors uniform. In answer to my questions he told me that he
                    belonged to Jones Brigade that General Jones was not there and that Colonel
                    <i>[unclear: Garnett]</i>
                    Commander of the Brigade
                    had been killed. The troops on his right were those of Jones' Brigade. These troops I urged to go forward. They did
                    not move. The crisis was <i>[illeg.]</i>. A general advance of the whole line I
                    knew had been ordered. Therefore I ordered my Brigade
                    forward over those of General Jones' and <i>[added: over those who told me that they were of the
                        Stonewall Brigade.]</i> and my officers &amp;
                    men have been under the impression that they ran over Paxton and Jones Brigades.
                    I am happy to correct an impression which does injustice to the Brigade called
                    after the Immortal "Stonewall", which I will do most cheerfully by having your
                    letter published to <i>[unclear: the very]</i> troops at Dress Parade.</p>
<p class="p10">The number of men who said they belonged to the Stonewall Brigade I do not know. I take it they were rather lost from their regiments &amp; were skulkers or were other than
                    they represented themselves to be.</p>
<p class="p10">I have sent to all that I have always deprecated all miserable jealousies between
                    troops from Sister States <i>[unclear: contending]</i> for a common and
                    glorious cause and this matter has been spoken of by me with caution and regret.
                    In order to explain any terrible loss more than 1/2 of the force carried into
                    action I conceived it to be my duty to report to Major General Rodes that though frequently sent for <i>[added: after my Brigade advanced to come
                        to my assistance]</i>, and twice by myself ordered forward, the troops <i>[added: I had passed over]</i> refused to drive the enemy
                    from a gap on my right flank, from which position he was pouring a destructive
                        <i>[unclear: enfilading]</i> fire into my line by which I lost most of my
                    men.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Col Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. D. Ramseur <br>Brig Genl</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I would have received
                        your letter earlier had I not been absent on account of my wounds. I
                        returned on the 20th. S.D.R.</p>
