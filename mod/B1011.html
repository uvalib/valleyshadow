<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Garrick Mallery, May 1, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's first report as the Bureau's Agent in Staunton mentions job
                    opportunities with the railroads, but he also notes that he has neither clothing
                    nor food to give to the poor. Jackson reiterates Tukey's request for funds for a
                    physician.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 1<sup>s</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular 6 S. 1866 (Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands) I have the honor to report a condition of Bureau
                    affairs in this Sub District That in Highland County
                    the <u>general</u> feeling towards Freedmen is unfriendly but
                    they avoid all controversy and are gradually migrating to adjacent counties
                    wherever they find opportunity to better their condition.</p>
<p class="p10">In Augusta County employment is readily procured at fair
                    wages, $8 to $12 per month for men, with rations, which taking into account the
                    cheaper price of Corn Meal &amp; Bacon is equal to higher rates paid in
                    Eastern Virginia
                    <i>[unclear: Mess.]</i> Mason Railroad contractors
                    wish to employ 100 or more laboring men at $1 per day <i>[added: without rations]</i> or $16 per month &amp; Rations,
                        15pounds Bacon, 3pounds
                    Coffee, 6pounds Sugar, 75 pounds Corn Meal, &amp; 1 Pound Salt, also free passage to the works,
                    between Jackson River and Covington, if they remain one month or upward. Mess.
                    Mann <i>[unclear: &amp;br]</i> refer to Governor
                    F. H. Pierpont &amp; others for Wood Choppers $15 per month is offered and
                    such labor is in demand.</p>
<p class="p10">The condition of the Aged, Sick &amp; very young both White and Colored is
                    however distressing and I <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>regret to find myself without Food or
                    Clothing to relieve the many deserving applicants, especially of those living in
                    Staunton. Mr. Bunch, Overseer of the Poor has inadequate means at his command it
                    is true but he lacks any sympathy whatever and I have been <i>[added: compelled]</i> rather sharply to insist upon relief for old
                    and sick colored women.</p>
<p class="p10">Referring to my predecessor's Report under date April 1<sup>st</sup>
                    1867 I would most respectfully call your attention to the need for providing
                    some Medical attendance for the very poor in this place. At Staunton is the
                    focus for seven (7) important Turnpike roads, hence there is always a floating
                    population who have here neither home or friend, and if sickness overtakes them
                    are helpless.</p>
<p class="p10">Dr. S. C. Harris of this town has to my knowledge since my arrival here, and as I
                    learn previously, not only given his professional services, but medicine without
                    pay. His own circumstances are very straitened and though he freely donates the
                    past he cannot go further unassisted. I therefore on behalf of many sufferers,
                    some sick of typhoid fever, ask an appropriation of twenty-five ($25) per month for Dr. S. C. Harris if he will continue
                    to prescribe and furnish medicine for destitute colored person at Staunton. If a
                    small amount of Food can be issued it will alleviate much distress.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully submitted<br>Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i><u>Thomas P.
                        Jackson</u><br>Agent</i></p>
