<p class="p10">I was very much pleased to get a letter from you &amp; hope you will write
                    another soon. You wrote that Mother &amp; yourself Lucy Bell and Jimmie were
                    all well. </p>
<p class="p10">Pa is very well &amp; would like to hear your speech. There is a little boy
                    about as big as you here he is on a horse every day riding around.</p>
<p class="p10">Have you got your drum yet. If you study now like a good boy you will have a fine
                    chance to play on it when school is out. Josey be good to your Mother and your
                    brother and sisters &amp; then you will be good to yourself. God will love
                    you &amp; Pa &amp; Mother &amp; all of us will love you more than
                    ever. May God bless my little children &amp; keep them from all evil to
                    himself.</p>
