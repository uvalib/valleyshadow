                <p>Your letter was received several days ago but this is the first opportunity I
                    have had of answering it. </p>

                <p>We are stationed here between two batteries for the purpose of defending either
                    in case of attack. We are now upon the extreme <orig reg="boundary"
                    >boundery</orig> of the Southern Confederacy with nothing to divide us from the
                    Black Republican despotism but the broad waters of the Potomac. How I wish that
                    we were on the other side and in full march upon Washington. We are in camp at
                    this place constantly expecting an attack. We have thrown out two picket on the
                    river with instructions to fire into man or vessel which refuses to answer hail.
                    I was stationed in one of the pickets last night about 1 O'clock the <orig
                        reg="sentinel">sentinell</orig> called us up on account of a <orig
                        reg="suspicious">suspissious</orig> craft which was <orig reg="entering"
                        >enterring</orig> a small creek near us. We were in the highest state of
                    exultation at the idea of a fight <orig reg="at last">atlast</orig>. I still
                    suffer from my foot but I hope that it will be well soon. We suffer some
                    inconvenience of course as what soldiers do not. But so long as my arm or my<pb
                        n="2"/>life is necessary it is at the service of my country.</p>

                <p>I gave all of my valuable papers to Annie to take care of. And feel confident
                    that they are perfectly safe.</p>

                <p>Hoping all are well I remain your affectionate son</p>

                        fight in five minutes. It now appears that it was an attack upon Alexandria.
