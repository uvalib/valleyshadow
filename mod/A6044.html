<p class="p10">Saturday</p>
<p class="p10">Moffets Creek</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin</p>
<p class="p10">I will make one more attempt to answer the welcome epistle I received from you several months ago I am ashamed that it has been so long neglected
     but as this is my third attempt I hope you will forgive me this time and I'll endeavor to be more punctual hereafter. How have you
     been standing Camp Life since your visit at home wish you could have stayed longer we all feel
     so lonesome since so many of you have been at home and gone we have Captain M<sup>c</sup>Kerry to visit now. Annie and I spent the evening with him
     Thursday<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley16b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley16b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      did not find him in very good spirits looks badly was not
     suffering much from his wound but he certainly has suffered from the appearance of his wound
     now it looks very badly indeed he says he never has felt weak until after he was moved home but
     stood the trip home very well I think if Annie Buck would come down it would raise his spirits
     very much don't think he will be able to go up soon for he has only
     set-up a few minute since he came home has no use of his leg at all think he is discouraged about that which is the source of
     his being so low spirited</p>
<p class="p10">I have not spoken to Billie Fulton since he came home got sight of him at church last Sunday
     but that was all I was surprised to know that he would come<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley16c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley16c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     home under such circumstances I don't know
     whether the wealthy Mr Echard is at home now or not he never calls
     here. &amp; I know very little about him I understood you all elected a Lieutenant but did not hold his office long suppose he felt a little
     cheap when he had to give his office up but I imagine he would have had you all under arrest
     before this time from what I have heard if he had <i>[illeg.]</i> been your Lieutenant yet. How is Cousin Jimmie M<sup>c</sup> getting
     along heard from <i>[illeg.]</i> some of your Company this week that
     he had been writing letters for six days and as I have received
     none from him I imagine he intends slighting me as usual. I have heard from several of the boys
     this week all speak of having a Chaplain and preaching<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley16d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley16d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      or prayer meeting every night don't think
      worthwhile to tell his name where he is from what denomination
     he is of or anything about him these questions have been asked me by several persons but have
     so far been unable to answer any of them how has Mr John Beard been getting along since he returned to camp suppose he has written to his <u>Dear</u>
     <i>[unclear: 
      <u>Denizen</u>
     ]</i> several times since he left guess he must have taken it very hard as I know he had
     been crying all the way from there down here but don't blame him. You
     must all come home to Presbytery the 4th of September and bring
     Cousin Lane <i>[unclear: Caerose]</i> with you think he might afford to come home to see his
     old man(as he calls Captain M<sup>c</sup>) then if not
     before that time Mr Junkin preaches in Newport tomorrow week hope Mr Harris will not be there
     as I don't want to hear him preach anymore
     for I know he is a real Yankee</p>
<p class="p10"> We have no Bible Class tomorrow as Mr Junkin expects to be absent
     and I am glad for we have an unmerciful hard and long lesson think we ought to have two weeks
     at it I must bring this epistle to a close as it is out of news my best
     love to Cousins Jimmie Buck Samuel Carson and all any other acquaintances receiving a large share for yourself I bid you adieu hoping you will write Soon &amp; I will follow your example</p>
<p class="p10">I remain as ever your true friend and Cousin</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Hannah<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley16d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley16d.gif"></center></a><br><br></i></p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse mistakes bad writing
      &amp;c all send much love to you all</p>
