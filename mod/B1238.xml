                <p>Dews asks for remuneration for the services he has performed for the Bureau in

                    magistrate on the Freedmen's Courts, but attached endorsements to his letter
                    indicate that he received very little money in fees from the court, and was paid

                <p>I have the honor to respectfully request your attention to the following
                    statement and request: Since the first of January of this year, I have been
                    serving as agent on the part of the Freedmen, in the Bureau <abbr
                        expan="Refugees, Freedmen">R.F.</abbr> &amp; <abbr expan="Abandoned"
                    >A.</abbr> Lands, in this town. I consented to serve at the request of the <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr>, when it was not at all
                    probable that another person could have been induced to occupy the position,
                    owing to the noted disloyalty of the Citizens, and the prejudice existing
                    against the <orig reg="existence">existance</orig> of the Bureau. I am a poor
                    man and owing to the prejudice against me, on account of my known loyalty to the
                    Government, and my connection with the Bureau, I have but exceedingly limited
                    means to support myself.</p>

                <p>Therefore I respectfully ask that you will use your influence and power, as Chief
                    of the Bureau, with the view to accord to me remuneration, however moderate, for
                    the service I have rendered to the Freedmen; every one of whom would cheerfully
                    endorse this application if it was deemed necessary, and I do further assure you
                    I should not have made this application but for my pecuniary embarrasment, as I
                    served without expectation of pecuniary reward.</p>

                <p>I am a returned refugee, an unconditional loyal man, and a Virginian. With
                    reference to this application, allow me to refer you to Mr. F.S. Tukey, <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> at this place.</p>
