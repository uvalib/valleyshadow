<h4>Augusta County: Diary of Harvey Bear (1862-1863)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About Harvey Bear:<br></b>Harvey Bear lived near Churchville in Augusta County during
the war. Along with his slaves and family members, Bear
cultivated his land, practicing mixed agriculture and raising
livestock for sale and consumption. In his diary, Bear
chronicled his transactions nearby in his community and
surrounding towns and further away in Richmond, sometimes for
cash and sometimes for exchange. Shorter entries reveal Bear's
involvement in agricultural organizations, religious
activities, and local politics. Though Bear primarily
described the work of a wealthy farmer and his laborers during
the war, he also provided glimpses into the lives of his own
family members and those of his friends and neighbors. Brief
references to the war include the movement of troops,
interactions with military officers, supplying the Confederate
army, and the actions of the local militia.</p>
