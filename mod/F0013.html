<p class="p11"><b>
                    Cynthia Potter
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dec. 10 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Casey </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cynthia </p>
<p class="p10">Mary's letter informing me of your sickness came safely
                    to hand &amp; I felt very glad that you got along so well with your fine
                    boy. I do not know what name to give him now. After I get home &amp; see him
                    I can find out a name for him. Take good care of him till I see him. I am glad
                    too that you have such good neighbors so that you had all necessary care in your
                    sickness. </p>
<p class="p10">My duties in the hospital are to give out the medicine
                    the Surgeon prescribed. The sick call is at eight o'clock in the morning when all the sick in the companies come up to the
                    hospital with their sore toes, sore shins, sore heads, bad colds, rheumatisms
                    about 30 or 40 every morning come to get medicine &amp; it takes the Doctor about 2 or 3 hours examining their ailments
                    &amp; prescribing the medicine for them which I have to put up for each one.
                    Some are sick in their tent. The doctor visits &amp; prescribes for them so
                    they are coming in all through the day for medicine &amp; some of us have to
                    be on hand to give it out. We have 10 patients in our hospital who have to have
                    their medicine &amp; my duty is to see that they get it at the right times
                    &amp; to see that the nurses do their duty keeping the hospital &amp;
                    patients clean &amp; properly warmed &amp; also to see that the patients
                    each one gets his proper diet so one of us have to overlook the cooks to get
                    what is suitable for the patients cooked. <i>[deleted: One poor soldier will
                        probably]</i> So you see I am kept very close in the hospital. This
                    afternoon the other hospital steward Dr. Casey &amp; myself rode out for a
                    couple hours. We visited some of the forts handy. Fort Lincoln is in sight only
                    1/4 of a mile from our camp.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Cynthia I would very much like to have been there with you. I have felt
                    uneasy for some time but now since it is over &amp; you are doing well that
                    care has been lightened &amp; I pray God that he may continue your health
                    that you may train up those children in the fear of the Lord &amp; I would
                    pray that your health that we may meet again &amp; enjoy each others society
                    &amp; have that pleasure in our children we have enjoyed.</p>
<p class="p10">Josey must be a good boy to his little brother &amp; nurse him for me
                    &amp; I know Lucy &amp; Bell will like the boy they have got. Bell be a
                    good girl &amp; Lucy must be good to her sister Bell as well as her little
                    brother. Well Mary I feel proud of the compliment the old doctor paid you. You
                    are deserving it. May God bless you Mary &amp; enable you to grow in grace,
                    to adorn the Christian character &amp; to have your
                    hope in heaven. Well Cynthia let us all still put our trust in that Almighty
                    power that has kept us all in the hollow of his hand &amp; we will be happy.
                    No more at present but remain</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband </p>
