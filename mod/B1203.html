<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to J. A.
                    Bates, May 23, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook reports no current cases of need in his district, but writes that since he
                    only just assumed command of Augusta and Highland Counties, he is not entirely
                    sure that none exist.</p>

                    Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands<br>Officer of Assistant Superintendent Sub-District "D"
                    Captain Ja's A Bates<br>Acting Assistant Adjutant General
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 23d, 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Augusta County</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with directions this day received from Brevet Major W. S. How Superintendent Sixth District, Virginia I have the honor to forward report required by
                    Circular No. 18 Current Series, direct.</p>
<p class="p10">Although I have given publicity to the Order I have as yet received no notice
                    that there are any cases of necessity in this District. I think probable that by
                    the 1st of June some such cases will be reported to me from Rockingham County if no others, having only assumed Command of the
                    Counties of Augusta and Highland on the 20th inst. and the order not having been
                    previously acted upon in those Counties I cannot speak from certainty in regards
                    to their reception.</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be Captain<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Geo. T. Cook<br>1st Lieutenant and Assistant Superintendent</i></p>
