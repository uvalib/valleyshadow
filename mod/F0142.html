<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I am now on the Mississippi a short distance above the fort
      guarding a boat loaded with cotton which is
     under arrest we have been here on the boat about two weeks but think we
     will be released in a fe days and then i think we will go on a march to
      intercept
     <i>[unclear: hood]</i> he is retreating from nashville some saying he is coming to memphis i
     wish he would there was twenty five thousand calvary &amp; infantry left here last week i
     think they went toward nashville to day is a fine day but thursday <i>[illeg.]</i> pretty cold
     this morning i seen a little ice floating down the river is raising fast lots of wood &amp;
     all kind of things floating down there is a good all of shouting going on out towards the lines but don't know what it is for
     yesterday they hung a man by the name of <i>[unclear: M<sup>c</sup> Klaves]</i> he
     was a spy they hung him in the fort about 4 o'clock there is nothing
     of any consequence going on there is an alarm gun firing now to call the militia together i
      suppose we are going to have something
     to do pretty soon from where i now write the guns <i>[unclear: pound]</i> the fort shakes me i
     can hardly write they have some very large guns and when they go off it is awful i wish i was up at the <i>[unclear: tunel]</i> setting loops i would feel
     better satisfied then at present you did not mention if you had any
      loops<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> set up rail road this fall all down at kunkels &amp; forge i always liked
     it better up rail road i seen a good many rabbits and squirrels today
     in market they ask 50 cts apiece for rabbits the same for squirrels deer meat 25 pr lb every thing high here apples
     are 10 apiece or two
     small ones for ten cts cabbage 25 pr lb it
     cost me 75 per week you only get a small piece for 25 they are now
     shelling the rebs across from where we are we can see them plain from here. the shells hum when
     they cross but can't see them if it was night we could see them i must
     now close as i must relieve the man that has been on guard we get new
     recruits last<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
     Tuesday they where all drafted men &amp; substitutes they think
     it rather rough but can't be helped</p>
<p class="p10">No more at this time but</p>
<p class="p10">Ever remain your true Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jacob Miller </i></p>
<p class="p10">Answer this soon and a merry Christmas or a happy New year as it will be
      New year before you get this </p>
