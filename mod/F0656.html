<p class="p10">we have had a very hard march yesterday (sunday). we were marched at a forced march all forenoon towards the <i>[deleted: long]</i> chain bridge and the general impression was that we were going
                    into Maryland but a dinnertime we stopped got our dinner rested a little and
                    marched back this far again. we marched as fast back as we did forward. about
                    half the regiment were lying along the road. our
                    company numbered 42 men but I think they are all here now. some of the men threw
                    their blankets away and last night someone
                    borrowed my blanket while I was at preaching. he
                    brought it back this morning. I lay down on part of Bruces
                    <i>[unclear: gum]</i> blanket and put my<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> over coat on it was wet
                    with dew this morning. the wagons have not come up yet and the impression is
                    that we will go on. John Orth said tell pap to send his
                    money on to Washington and if he gets any more soon send it too. we have a
                    battery of 8 pieces in our brigade and some cavalry I have not seen the cavalry
                    yet but it is a splendid battery. you need not fear that the
                    <i>[unclear: rebels]</i> will ever get in to washington this way it is one
                    continuous chain of forts and entrenchments. I did not <i>[unclear: leave]</i>
                    the ranks yesterday some of the men filled their canteens with water in the
                    stream where there were dead horses. I saw horses with
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>

<p class="p10"><i>S. </i></p>
<p class="p10">write as soon and tell me about the rebels in Maryland
                        and the way the people feel about it the troops are moving over as fast as
                        they can. </p>
