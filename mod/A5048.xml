                    marching to do since we come over here that I haven't had time to do anything. I
                    suppose you have heard all about the fighting in the papers, better than I can
                    tell you, it beat all the fights that I ever was in. I could stand in place and
                    count fifty dead yankees without moving out of my tracks some of them wasn't
                        <orig reg="buried">burried</orig> for five <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> days and some
                    wasn't <orig reg="buried">burried</orig> at all I don't believe. The Battle
                    field was a horrible sight. To hear the wounded and <orig reg="dying"

                    take them away. We <orig reg="laid">layed</orig>
                    <orig reg="right">rite</orig> in amongst the dead &amp; wounded in the field
                    that night it was the dreadfulest night I ever spent. <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr> W H Randolph was killed dead and John Bowers &amp; James
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> also was killed dead. <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr>
                    W H McKinney was wounded after the fight was over by accident. We was left

                    couldn't give you a full account of it for it would take one too long. <abbr

                    there is over here we are camped about five miles from Gordonsville. we have a

                    - we come up on the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> C.H. <pb n="4"/> and marched from there
                    here. we had a fine shower of rain yesterday morning I must close as it is

                    all the news for I am always glad to hear from you. Give my <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> all
                    inquiring friends and take a portion yourself. Direct your letter to
