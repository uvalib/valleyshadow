    <p>As I have a good opportunity of sending a letter by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr>
     Wright who is going home on furlough I will improve it by writing you a few lines to let you
     know that I am well &amp; hope you all may be enjoying the same kind blessing I have not
     much news to write except that <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> is quiet<pb n="2" entity="Smiley50b" pid="uva-lib:503238"/>
      We are in camp yet at the same place we have been since the first
     of August. The Seasons has been good here plenty of rain to keep the ground in good order. The
     last few nights have been very cool almost cold enough for frost.</p>
    <p><orig reg="Yesterday">Yest day</orig> passed off very well here we had no drills. nothing at
     all was done but what was <orig reg="necessary">nescessary</orig> Reverend M<hi rend="super"

     our regiment as he is almost <orig reg="universally"

    <p><orig reg="Everything">Every thing</orig> wears a more cheerful look now than when we came to
     this side of the mountain. Our army is filling up rapidly We have over fifty men in our company
     which is more than we had when we started to Pennsylvania. <orig reg="Everybody">Every
     body</orig> is in good spirits they think that should <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>
     <unclear/> Meade advance we will be enough for him although he had the best of us in the battle
     of Gettysburg<pb n="4" entity="Smiley50d" pid="uva-lib:503240"/>
      I send by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Wright an <orig
      reg="overshirt">Over shirt</orig> and pair of drawers and a book which he has promised to
     leave at your house or Uncle James's As he is nearly ready to start I must close by asking you
