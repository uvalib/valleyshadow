<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">Received your letter yesterday &amp; now hasten to answer it &amp; give you the
     desired information as far as I know myself. The loss of the South in Sundays battle is
     reported to have been 500 killed &amp; 800 wounded whilst the North admit a loss of 5,000
     but it is estimated at 10,000 by the south. All their cannon was taken except two pieces 67 in
     all amongst them the Sherman battery which is said to be the most
     famous battery in the United States Besides there is no estimate to be made of the amount of
     small arms taken a great many besides those belonging to the slain. they just loosed their belt
     and cast away their arms knapsack haversack &amp; all in their retreat. Old Scott's
     carriage is said to have been taken all his plans &amp; dispatches &amp; his epauletts.
     They had not the least expectation of a defeat &amp; their plan was after taking that place
     to feast one day and then to go on and take Richmond. We have got back enough of provisions men
     amp;c now to pay for what was taken from us in Western Virginia. The
     prisoners were let off on parole &amp; have gone home but I think it
     was scarcely worthwhile going home. Pa hailed a man the other
     day and gave him his dinner that was in the fight at Laurel Hill and was taken prisoner The
     company were from Halifax County and going home on parole. He said they
     were kindly treated by McClellan. He appeared to be very near give
     out. Pa having come from Beards and wanting to write some has left very little for me to tell
     Sib Strain brought home a Charly Bell, on Wednesday he had his arm &amp; shoulder shot
      off though he did not die until after he started with him. Strain
     started back yesterday he was not in the battle he could not find his company &amp; was
     only a spectator to the bloody work. Johnston's men it is said
     fought until 11 oclock and were about being flanked &amp; his men
     being exhausted were about to give way when Beauregard came to his
     assistance &amp; afterward Davis when they charged for them. They could not stand the cold
     steel and ran. It is reported that we came very near getting Seward as for Scott it is not
     known what became of him The militia are still at Staunton some of them have been at home
     several times though. It is raining today &amp; pa &amp; ma have

      gone to Uncle Jim's They wanted to see Arehart before he starts He expects to start
     tomorrow I reckon he is afraid to stay longer also George Clemmer and his father they expected
     to go to the Junction but Uncle J intended telling them of what you wrote so I dont know what
     they will do. You are very silent about your spell of sickness You must be afraid to tell how
     bad you were for we heard from Bil Arehart that you were very bad. Pa wants to know why you
     dont tell more particularly about it, you put almost too good a face on
     the measles quite a light disorder I suppose you think. We started a
     letter Tuesday to Winchester I reckon you can get it there if you want it there was a good deal
     of it for Tish &amp; me both wrote</p>
<p class="p10">Nothing more but remain your affectionate sister</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mary A Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">Thomas M. Smiley my Dear Son<br> I have just been to William Beards hearing a letter from Samuel written on tuesday after the Battle at the
      Junction he Says there is not a man of the Southern Guards killed or
      wounded but Captain Williams who was Slightly wounded with a Splinter threw against him by a cannon ball Striking a fence or Some timber and Struck
      him across the face but so Slightly that he is Still able to be
      with his Company Johnsons Army Suffered very much especially the Virginia Regiment Baxter Ott is killed and Several others from Augusta &amp; Rockbridge all
      of whom I do not remember I have heard from President Davis dispatch both to Congress &amp; his wife Stating the number killed
      &amp; wounded South 500 killed 800 wounded and the North a great many prisoners the killed not known but they piled on top of one another in
      front and were Strewed over the ground thick for ten miles we took it is
      Said sixty-seven cannon with the great Sherman Battery and
      thousands of Small arms of every
      description and provisions enough to
      last the whole Southern army for Sometime and camp instruments
      of all kinds but I have taken up so much of the paper I will close by remaining your Father
       etc. Wm Smiley </p>
