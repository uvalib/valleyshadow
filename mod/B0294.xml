                </opener>

                <p><orig reg="Through">Thro'</orig> Mr. Paul I learned this morning of the <hi
                        rend="underline">dupes</hi> of some scoundrel who swindled them each to the
                    tune of $1.50 and caused them to collect about your office, yesterday in
                    expectation of receiving each 50 acres of land. I refer to the negroes to day I
                    had occasion to ride up near to Augusta <unclear>
                        <abbr expan="Station">Stn.</abbr>
                    </unclear> &amp; ascertained the impostor was along there by
                    <unclear>Alx</unclear> Huffman on Thursday or Friday last &amp; engaged a
                    negro Reid &amp; his son George to go up, with others. My informant learned
                    that he perhaps collected more than a dollar &amp; half <pb n="2"/>each of
                    these two boys &amp; that he also proposed to tell them some kind of bonds
                    or series he called 8 percent bonds. He was in the neighborhood of <abbr
                        expan="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Crawford some days before, playing the same game
                    &amp; avoided our village, passing back of it, near the mountain, where he
                    would be less likely interupted &amp; find more pliable dupes. He stirred up
                    several of those in Old <unclear>John</unclear> Strother, his one or two sons
                    &amp; perhaps a son in law. Strother belonged to the <hi rend="underline"
                        >old</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">issue</hi>, as the negroes call those originally free, yet
                    this scoundrel succeeded in getting his fee out of each.</p>

                <p>It is a matter of great regret Sir, such a villian could not be caught &amp;
                        <orig reg="brought">brot</orig> to <unclear>condign</unclear> punishment.</p>

                <p>I could not find out his <pb n="3"/>name or whither he was riding. He left the
                    home of the negro Reid, saying he expected to be at Churchville on Saturday.</p>

                <p>At one time I thought it good policy to insert a card in our county papers,
                    putting the public on their guard, in relation to him, but it may be the better
                    plan to keep quiet but put some persons in each neighborhood on the alert, by
                    which means he may be caught.</p>

                <p>Mr Paul remarked to me you was anxious for his arrest, in which feeling I
                    heartily sympathize.</p>
