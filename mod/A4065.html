<p class="p10">Dec. 6<u>
        <sup>th</sup>
      </u> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">"Morton House" -- Orange Co. Va --</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear One:</p>
<p class="p10">This is Sunday night &amp; though I have written to you this week &amp; have nothing
     of interest to communicate, I cannot forgo my custom of having a chat with you at this time
     regularly -- It is said the enemy has removed his infantry across the Rappahanock into Fauquier
     Co -- only keeping his cavalry in Culpeper -- his trains of wagons to his calvalry pass down to
     their camps in full view of our infantry camps -- &amp; yesterday some of our men went over
     yesterday &amp; had a skirmish with them. Some think Gen. Lee may go over to attack Meade,
     but I hope not, it is too late in the season, &amp; we might find ourselves in the midst of
     a winter storm &amp; suffer much. Today has been quite cold, sharp wind -- I have spent the
     day at home, reading &amp; talking. Read Doddridge's Life, my Bible &amp;c. Mr. Lacy
     preached in one of the Brigades not far from here -- He is a good talker &amp; has now
     formed one of my mess &amp; consequently I see much of him -- he always has something good
     to tell &amp; whiles away much of the tedium of the men -- society, camp life &amp;c.
     Everyone longs for the conclusion of the war &amp; a return to their homes, yet no one
     talks of giving but until our liberties are obtained -- come what may. A few days ago, while we
     were in the <i>[unclear: near ch]</i> I found Washington Reeves
     &amp; Lil. Stout marching back from where they<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> had been as a guard &amp;
     they told me they had not had any rations for a day &amp; a half -- so I invited them to
     come and spend the night with me, as our camp was near -- &amp; I had a big supper prepared
     and you may believe they did it justice, it would have done you good to see the hungry fellows
     eat -- they slept in my tent &amp; breakfasted with me &amp; then went to camp -- very
     grateful for my hospitality -- they are both good soldiers - Reeves an excellent one &amp;
     very neat -- Lil retains much of his former self, but has been improved by the duties &amp;
     labors of a common soldier -- Our men endured much hard labor unrepiningly during our late
     movement - - in fact I do not thing the world ever saw a nobler &amp; more unselfish set of
     men than the Army of Northern Va -- I shall apply for my furlough some time about the 20<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> &amp; intend to ask for 20 days. I much hope that Richard will come up before I get
     home -- I know Garber is very loth to part with him, but he promised me that he might come when
     he got his fall work done -- But some way will be provided I trust, for the Lord has been very
     gracious to us in these days of trial &amp; suffering &amp; let us humbly acknowledge
     his mercy &amp; strive to obey in all things his most holy commandments -- Kiss my little
     daughters for me, may the Lord make them good &amp; amiable, abounding in modesty &amp;
     all Christian graces -- May the Lord bless &amp; keep you all -- My loved ones -- </p>
<p class="p10">Ever sincerly your husband</p>
