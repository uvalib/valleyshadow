<p class="p10">June 16, 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Riley <i>[deleted: Hanover]</i></p>
<p class="p10"> </p>
<p class="p10">We arrived here today about 5 o'clock in the evening after marching 12 miles, we left camp Brady on
                        Wednesday afternoon and marched through Greenecastle and camped 3 miles south of it <i>[added: called Camp Lee]</i>. We are now encamped 2 miles
                    east of Williamsport and 2 1/4 miles off the Virginia shore and 19 miles off
                    Harper's Ferry. I saw
                    Charles <i>[unclear: 
                        Stine
                    ]</i> in Greenecastle his family is all well.
                    as far as we can learn the enemy has left Harper's Ferry
                    and destroyed
                    everything
                    before they left. I think we will lay here now until we
                    get further orders from head quarters as our
                    destination was Harper's Ferry. the row of troops that
                    left Camp Lee and neighboring camps was at least 7
                    miles long. we had 6 rifled cannon in our Brigade.
                    There is <i>[unclear: any]</i> amount of Infantry Cavalry
                    <i>[unclear: &amp;co.]</i> on the road. we did not go through Hagerstown. a
                    good many of our men gave out today. it was very hot. I got at least 4 miles ahead of the brigade. we had 1000 cavalry along with us and 11 regiments. the people in Maryland are very
                    clever they only charge 3 cts for a small piece of
                    bread. but you can see nothing but the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Stars &amp; Stripes.
                    yesterday I saw that captain that would not give up at
                    fort Sumter and six of his men. he looks like a determined man. each of our men
                    has 40 rounds of <i>[unclear: 
                        cartridges
                    ]</i>. tonight a scouting party will leave for
                        Virginia. The other day J.V. Schriver was with
                    us in Camp Brady. we left the camp 2 hours after he left. I could easily march
                    20 miles a day, and not mind it. the scouts have very strict orders. there is a
                    report circulated that we will now be sent to Washington or Alexandria. our men
                    are all well but tired. we are only 6 miles from Hagerstown. if we get different
                    orders we will march to our left through it on to Frederick.</p>
<p class="p10">Sunday Morning June <sup>the</sup> 17, 1861. There is a very heavy thunder gust coming up. it almost seems like night.
                    we are encamped right aside of the <i>[unclear: Canococheaarge]</i> creek. the
                    same one that was at Camp Brady. every day we go in swimming. there is nothing new here of any importance.
                    as soon as we move our quarters I will write. if we go
                    to Washington we will take the cars from Hagerstown. as for news about the war
                    you know more about it than we, as we do not get to see any papers, or any thing
                    else but troops.</p>
