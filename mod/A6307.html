<h4>Augusta County: David H. Evans to Mary Anna Sibert,
                    June 23, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Evans expresses frustration at Sibert's continual doubting of his love for her,
                    and explains that if he is sometimes "silent" on visits it does not mean that he
                    does not love her. He hopes they will "understand each other better in the
                    future," reassures her of his love for her, and discusses plans for a future
                    visit.</p>
