                <p>I received your letter on Tuesday evening and was glad to hear that you were well
                    &amp; I hope when these few lines reach you may still be enjoying good
                    health. I would have written yesterday but there was no one to take the letter
                    to the Post Office, as there was no one at home but myself <orig reg="until"
                        >untill</orig> it was too late. Alex is staying with us now he came down the
                    same day you left so we are doing better than we expected. We heard some very
                    bad news yesterday heard that Mr Hupp was killed last Wednesday shot just below
                    the eye and never knew what hurt him. Becca and Sister were over last Friday
                    night Becca is going down to Churchville next week for the cloth and wants me to
                    go down to Aunt Sallies she will have a buggy and thinks it will be a good <orig
                        reg="opportunity">oppertunity</orig> for me. I expect to go over to the
                    meeting <orig reg="tomorrow">tomorow</orig> or next day. next time you write let
                    me know <pb n="2"/>whether Davis is there or not &amp; how he is getting
                    along. There was two burials at New Providence last Sabbath Miss Eliza Beard and
                    Mr Culton's child. We are all well. when you write again direct to Greenville as
                    I expect to be over at Pa's. I believe I have told all the news. As Mag is
                    waiting I will have to close. I hope you will get home soon. May God watch over
                    and protect you is the prayer of your devoted Wife</p>
