</h4>

                    families. He also described his trip from Fairfax to Winchester, which

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">November 15th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camped Near Winchester Virginia</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Dearest</u> Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter a few
                    days since. and it was with pleasure to me to open it &amp; peruse over its
                    contents. It was with sorrow that I read of the death of Miss Kate Hall
                    &amp; Miss Sarah M<sup>c</sup>Cadden but our loss is their eternal gain. Miss Kate was my most intimate friend
                    while I lived in Greenville. I saw a piece in the Newspaper Composed about Miss
                    Kate I Judged that Mr. Monroe was its author, it was a
                    very good piece. Your Brother John has been sick for three or four days
                    &amp; has gone to the hospital in Winchester. I hope
                    he may soon recover his former health. I think he is taking the fever. Your
                    Cousin Abe has been complaining for some time past, but looks hearty at present. Brother John has returned from the hospital, he
                    was sent to Richmond, I was very glad to see him as I couldn't hear from him he had the Typhoid fever &amp; looks
                    quite thin yet he has not reported for duty yet. I got a pass to go to
                    Winchester the other day every thing is very <i>[deleted: ]</i> The town <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> is not crowded like it was in the spring.</p>
<p class="p10">I will try &amp; give you a short account of our march to the Valley. Our
                    Company was on picket that morning had very little or
                    nothing to eat; we received orders about ten o'clock A.M. to pack up &amp; march to camp a
                    distance of two miles when we got there
                    every thing was packed up &amp; ready to march. We
                    had to carry our blankets &amp; overcoats. The
                        regiment was formed at half past twelve
                    &amp; took up the line of march at one o'clock. We
                    got to Manassas about five o'clock &amp; rested there a while, then marched to the Junction &amp; loaded our baggage on the cars. We didn't
                    get started before nine we were packed in the cars like
                    cattle we had no seats but the baggage, and those on
                    top of the cars were
                    exposed to the cold &amp; Sam one of Captain Roberts men fell off the
                    cars &amp; was bruised so that he died next
                    morning it was said that he was drunk &amp; walked off
                    the top of the cars, we got to Strasburg about
                    daylight unloaded our baggage cooked of our breakfasts
                    &amp; started for Winchester it rained hard all day. I do believe that one
                        fourth of the regiment
                    were drunk we had gotten in about three quarters of a
                    mile of Winchester when we received orders to turn
                    round &amp; go a mile &amp; camp <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; officers
                    refused to obey <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the order, the Colonel swore he would be obeyed
                    &amp; drew his sword &amp; ordered his Brother
                    to forward his Company, but
                    he would not move so the Colonel ordered him under arrest &amp; told Sims to take the Command of the Company &amp; the Lieutenant refused to
                    obey the order. Captain Harman then went out and
                    talked to the Colonel he had understood that we had to
                    go back to Newtown a distance of five miles. As soon as he learned better he
                    ordered his company to move
                    off, &amp; the regiment
                    followed. I was smartly excited at the time of the fracas the Colonel struck one of Harmens men,
                    with his sword a great many of
                    the men were getting out cartridges others fixing their bayonets. I expected nothing but a big row as the Colonel is not loved by any of his men. I know you are
                    tired of this uninteresting letter. My health
                    has been very good till late. I have had the head ache with chills &amp;
                    fevers. I hope though it may soon wear
                    off. I hope these
                    few lines may find you enjoying health &amp;
                    happiness. Excuse me for not writing sooner &amp; I will try and do better
                    next time. You said you wanted to know if I needed
                    any socks I have three or four good pair but would receive a pair from your hand with the greatest pleasure. I wrote to your Pa about
                        <i>[unclear: a pair]</i> of pants.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all inquiring friends. Nothing
                    more at present.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon to your true &amp; humble
                        friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F.B.</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. So goodbye. My mess are
                        calling me to supper &amp; you may know the night is coming on.</p>
