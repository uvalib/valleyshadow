                <p>I have the honor to report that I have made a tour through the greater portion of
                    my District, which is yet unorganized owing to my inability to procure officers,
                    and the lack of troops in the several counties.</p>

                <p>I have stationed civilians as <abbr expan="Assisstant">Assist</abbr>
                    Superintendents at the principle points, Winchester, Staunton, and Lexington,
                    and have thus been enabled to <unclear>convey</unclear> the impression
                    throughout this region that the freedmen are being cared for, and that they may
                    not be ill-treated with impunity.</p>

                <p>The freedmen are generally at work but whether or not for their former masters
                    cannot be determined in the absence of census returns. The feelings of the
                    former masters are now <unclear>adverse</unclear> to the interests of the
                    Freedmen whose newly acquired rights they are not disposed to respect although
                    they verbally acknowledge their freedmen as "free persons of color."</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>If left to themselves by the withdrawal of the military, the former masters would
                    generally resume the old mastership, and the condition of the freedmen
                        <unclear>becomes</unclear> worse than when they were slaves.</p>

                <p>The freedmen in this Shenandoah Valley, as a class, are superior to those of the
                    James River region, have a brighter appearance, quicker movements, and more
                    readily appreciate their new relations and responsibilities. Nearly all of them
                    have gone to work, the larger number under definite contracts or agreements,
                    which will terminate in December - "Christmas" of this year. The selection of
                    this time for the ending of contracts appears to be owing, first, to the fact
                    that the freedmen have been accustomed to look forward to that time as a period
                    when work ceases, and have but rarely been able to look beyond that time, and,
                    second, because the employers would then be able to dispense with the services
                    of many of them, having very little work to do in the succeeding three months,
                    coupled with a malicious desire to <unclear>throw</unclear> them on their own
                    resources in mid Winter, or compel their friends the Yankees to support them.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>It appears to me that these charitable designs may best be met by giving them,
                    the Whites, to understand that <hi rend="underline">they</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">must</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">support</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">their</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">paupers</hi>. A simple and just measure that would at once
                    put a stop to "cabin burning", "sending 'em to the yankees" and other similar
                    characteristic proceedings of our Southern brothers.</p>

                <p>If some such step be not taken there will be a large number of dependents to be
                    supported this winter. As yet there have been very few cases of helpless ones in
                    this District but they are beginning to come in and will increase until about
                    Christmas when a great number will be thrown out of work and home.</p>

                <p>When our troops occupied this place, Staunton there were barrack hospitals and
                    other buildings which would have been ample for the shelter of the destitute in
                    this portion of the District, but they have been demolished and the lumber used
                    or sold so that there is nothing left available for the use of the Bureau, nor
                    is there a vacant building of any description to be obtained in or near the city</p>

                <pb n="4"/>

                <p>Throughout this District the same characteristics are noticeable. There are no
                    vacant houses, no abandoned lands. The people generally remained at their homes
                    and raised subsistence for the rebel army. The few who left speedily returning
                    at the close of hostilities. There are no sources of <unclear>revenue</unclear>
                    that I have been able to discover.</p>

                <p>The collection of <unclear>b---</unclear> could not be prosecuted for want of
                    men, - they were at work - of wagons, more could be had - of
                    <unclear>b---</unclear>, - they had been gathered; the Sheridan Mine at the
                    lower end of the valley completely <unclear>---ted</unclear>. Necessary funds
                    must, then, be procured from without the District.</p>

                <p>Rations have been issued to but a very small number of twelve (12) and no
                    estimate can now be made of the number to be supplied, and if that number shall
                    not be considerably increased there would seem to be no
                    <unclear>interference</unclear> with the ordinary supplies for the troops, and
                    no issuing officers <unclear>necessary</unclear>.</p>

                <pb n="5"/>

                <p>No demands have as yet been made for medical attendance, but there will be
                    frequent requests when the cold damp weather of this season in this climate
                    shall set in and at this moment I am inclined to the employment of a local
                    physician when suitable persons can be found, as they may be presumed to be
                    familiar with both the patients and the diseases of the place.</p>

                <p>The establishment of schools is ardently desired by the freedmen all over the
                    District, and the difficulties in the procurement of School rooms, Teachers,
                    Books, and everything else will, I hope, be speedily overcome as the time for
                    beginning to shed light upon darkness is close at hand.</p>
