     <salute>Dear Aunt</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I take my pen in hand to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well and enjoying
     myself very well at this time and I hope when these few lines reach you they may find you all
     enjoying the same blessing I have not received any answer to the last letter I wrote you some
     four weeks ago which makes me think that it has not arrived at its proper place; there was so
     many different ones carried letters to the post office that there was a great many of them
     never got to the office. I heard of Uncle John's death through letters from home and it
     surprised me greatly as I had not heard of his being dangerously ill: but we have good reason
     to believe that out loss is his eternal gain. We are now camped near Winchester in a flat piece
     of woods mud about shoe mouth deep; that is wherever it is tramped any: this week has been very
     rainy, and now it is <unclear>spitting</unclear> snow and very cold our tents are a great
     protection from the cold, and wind, but still not as much as could be desired; during the storm
     of last friday two weeks there was not more than a dozen tents left standing in the whole
     regiment the wind was so strong it carried them off
     
      <pb n="3"  entity="Smiley34b" pid="uva-lib:503195"/>
      as fast as they could be put <orig reg="up">upp</orig>. you ought to be here to see us
     cooking; making bread, and pies &amp; we get bakers bread sometimes which comes in very
     good; we get plenty of sugar, and coffee, and beef of the very best sort. butter is selling at
     from 25 to 50,<abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> a pound in Winchester, that is of a good quality;
     eggs is 25<abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> a dozen, cabbage is selling at from 10 to 15,<abbr
      expan="cents">cts</abbr> a head according to quality, apples 25,<abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr>
     a dozen, and <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> else in proportion yesterday was fast
     day and I suppose was as well kept in the camp as it was at home. an order was issued that
     there should be no drilling and no other duty except that which could not be <orig
      reg="dispensed">dispenced</orig> with and we certainly did not eat much because they have it
     in their power to withdraw out rations and keep it from us there was preaching here by some
     strange preacher but I did not hear him as I had just come off guard, and was wet, and cold;
     but I believe he preached a very good sermon. We are expecting to move away from this camp but
     I do not know whether it is to town or not we expect to take winter quarters in Winchester but
     I do not know how soon we Will get them. I must now draw my miserable scroll to a close; as it
     is getting late.</p>
