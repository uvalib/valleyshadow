<p class="p10">Washington Court House, Fayette

<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of 9th inst. was received
                    N. Johnson. Left some money in bank when he left here, be also left his wife
                    poor and helpless, and our authorities ordered me to use the money for her
                    benefit, which I did. There is about $19.00 yet in my hands, in currency,
                    &amp; the note on Alex. Anderson, not paid, I think it can be collected. I
                    think Johnson acted badly towards, his wife, he sold
                    everything he could, from her &amp; left her destitute, I advised him not to
                    go to Virginia, but stay with his wife, I think he was slightly deranged, when
                    he left.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours &amp;c</p>
