                    Bureau Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands<br>Headquarters Sixth District Virginia
                    Mr. J. H. McKenzie<br>Assistant Superintendent Winchester, Virginia
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 7th 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your letters of July 31st &amp; Augt 1st were received during my absence from
                    this place. No passes can be required of the blacks which are not required of
                    the whites.</p>
<p class="p10">You say there are many destitute persons dependent on the government for support.
                    See that none are supported who can take care of themselves, and that only parts
                    of the rations are issued to such as can nearly subist themselves.</p>
<p class="p10">In settling disputes, hear both sides, and decide the matter -- causing each
                    party to endorse the decision. If either refuse, refer the case to the Provost
                    Marshall, and if possible be present at the trial.</p>
<p class="p10">In the case you mention, <u>if the facts are as stated</u>,
                    the guilty ones should be punished for Larceny by the Provost Courts or Civil
                    Authorities, if a fair hearing can be had before them.</p>
<p class="p10">If a freedman violates a contract he forfeits his wages, or such portion of them
                    as are deemed just taking into consideration the damages resulting to the
                    employer. If he cannot pay, there again his wages may be attached for the
                    benefit of the former employer. If the employer violates a contract he must pay
                    wages and damages.</p>
<p class="p10">You can reprimand but not punish or imprison for debt, a breach of contract</p>
<p class="p10">I send such copies of orders as I have received, with blanks and will furnish
                    blank books when obtained.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, Sir<br>Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. Storer How, Captain and Assistant Quartermaster<br>Superintendent 6th
                            District Virginia</i></p>
