<p class="p10">Nov 20<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near New market</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure that I take this opportunity to drop you a
      few lines to let you know how I am at this time
     thank the Lord I enjoy good health have been
     well ever since left home except a cold I have had right bad cold for some time other ways I have beenhearty hoping this may find you all well. I hoped to have gotten a letter
     from you before now but have not I wrote you the ninth of this month
     Suppose you did not get it Since that time we have had a hard march down
     the valley
     we
     were near winchester expected to have a fight but it turned out otherwise
     we are now in Camp where we was when I last
      wrote my feet became very sore on the march
     but are now well again, this is rainy wet weather
     here this is the Sabbath day things are quite still here today. and now Dear Giney I
     will tell you that I was quite surprised yesterday I walked out from Camp a few hundred yards about the middle of the day came back and what did I See why our
      old blue <i>[unclear: Box]</i>
     sitting on the wood pile this was very
     unexpected to me. but with a grateful heart I received it <i>[unclear: and now]</i> I return you my grateful thanks for your kindness it came in good time for I was hungry<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I invited Several of my Company to eat with me they said that the woman that made that Butter and Bread knew how to do it You have no idea how such things are appreciated in camp the men found that I had butter they would have take
     all I had in a short time if I would have let them You sent more butter than I thought I could use so I Spared one of the role. Sold two
     pound of it and loaned the rest out thought it would come good sometime. I let the men have it at 7 Dollars per pound it was selling
     at ten Dollars in camp but I thought it was
      too
     much for Soldiers to pay I found my overcoat
     alright I had written you not to send it
     for a while but suppose you did not get it in time since it is here I will keep it it is very good in camp but not
     on the march because it is heavy to carry. I looked in every
     pocket for a letter but could not find any
     Miller told me that there was some potatoes at Summerdeen for me but
     he had so much load he could not haul them, I am very glad to get as much as I did hoping to hear from you soon I will close my Prayer is that the Lord will bless you and take care of you all and save us all in
     heaven at last</p>
<p class="p10">as your ever affectionate<br> Husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jno P. Dull</i></p>
<p class="p10">I send Box by the wagon <i>[illeg.]</i>
      crock is in Clemmers
      Bose</p>
