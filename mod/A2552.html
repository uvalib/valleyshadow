<p class="p10">Sunday P.M. Aug. 28<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Head Quarters V.D. Bunker's Hill Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 15<sup>th</sup> came yesterday, the first glad messenger I have received for a long time &amp; right welcome it was -- delighted with
     the tidings that you felt cheered up -- had been visiting some &amp;c &amp;c and also
     with the news from Allie -- I have written you all the news up to date -- wrote to you only day
     before yesterday, from Shepherdstown -- yesterday we came back here to our old camp -- Anderson
     came back towards Winchester &amp; today the Yankee cavalry has been demonstrating all
     along our front &amp; our cavalry has fallen back some, but we have remained quietly in
     camp &amp; there has been preaching, for the first time in a good while -- I have never
     known a more active campaign, but is the only kind to protect us from the movements of the
     Yankees -- we must keep them busy all the time or their roving dispositions will cause them to
     annoy us.</p>
<p class="p10"> Henry K. Cochran was drunk &amp; remained <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> behind at Chambersburg to ransom
     houses for "greenbacks" &amp; was killed by some of the Yankees or citizens, no one knows
     which -- Some of our men behaved very badly, but I wrote to you about that before Allie has
     found it as I expected -- I have seen enough of Northern society in our visits to Pennsylvania &amp; Maryland to satisfy me that
     any one holding Southern sentiments there would be uncomfortable -- The boys &amp;c. serve
     her as they used to me -- I distinctly remember a chill I once had in Aug. riding from Great
     Bend to <i>[illeg.]</i>, that nearly froze me. It is strange she did not get my letter -- I
     enclosed it in one to Nancy &amp; she ought to have known the
     address. I am not surprised at the turn her affair with Capt. Stenett has taken -- absence has,
     as usual, sweetened love &amp; he has found an aching void no one else can fill -- I am
     glad of it on account of both parties &amp; will write to Allie the first time I have a
     chance to come to Martinsburg or Shepherdstown &amp; from there she can easily get <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> up the Valley -- we go to those places every week or so &amp; they change hands
     regularly every fortnight, this offering great facilities for coming or going -- I found an old
     acquaintance at Sheperdstown, the Rev. Miller, of the Lutheran Church
     who formerly preached in Mt. Crawford &amp; she can come to his house I think there will be
     no trouble about her getting through, I am really delighted at the faithfulness they show
     &amp; think it augers well for their future -- I am glad too to have relations marry
     &amp; live near us &amp; help to make home circles I will write for her sister to come
     with her, but not unless her sentiments accord with Allie's for without that she would be as
     uncomfortable here as Allie is there. William is well &amp; doing
     well, is an excellent boy -- I ate come corn yesterday that did not agree with me &amp;
     have been under the weather today, but feel better this evening -- it is the first time I have
     been at all unwell. I bought you a pound &amp; a half of tea which I will send you by the
     first chance -- I could
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> only find black tea -- but will try &amp; get other during the summer -- I paid
     $25. Confederate for the 1 1/2 lbs -- I think I will get you some nice flannel next time we go to Shepherdstown -- I have heard where there is some -- I see
     by a recent order that all the detailed farmers are <u>obliged</u> to <u>sell</u> all their surplus to soldiers families at the government price or
     be put into the Army -- So I hope you will have no difficulty in procuring supplies -- Did my
     letter with the ribbons &amp;c come to hand -- I send you a few stamps &amp; envelopes
     I have but few stamps on hand -- It is quite cool -- wish I could have a bedfellow to help me
     to keep warm -- How do the children like the books &amp; you the bonnet stuff? -- I lately
     saw some children's &amp; ladies hats made of corn shucks -- &amp; trimmed with the
     same wrought into a band of rosettes &amp;c -- they were very pretty Write often -- Good
     bye my sweet one &amp; may the Lord bless you all --. </p>
