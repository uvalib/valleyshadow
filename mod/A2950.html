<h4>Augusta: Angus to Amanda C. Armentrout, April 8,
                    1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Angus writes to Kate about his sadness when he thinks of those who died in the
                    war. He then inquires as to how her Billie (William Brand) has changed, poking
                    fun at her anxiousness regarding a beau.</p>

                </b></p>

<p class="p10">April 8<sup>th</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Arbor Hill<br>Augusta County<br>Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Midie</p>
<p class="p10">Your very welcome missive by the hand of Annie, could not have been otherwise
                    perused than with some mental effect. I always feel sad, when I think of those
                    who <u>once</u> were <u>our brother</u>
                    associates; but they are gone, &amp; their graves, we can not but think, are
                    the monuments of living spirits, whose bodies have assumed originality. There is
                    a time for sadness &amp; a time for pleasure; &amp; of the former, we
                    ought to be <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>submissive as possible, knowing that it proceeds from
                    afflictions, bereavements, &amp;c. inflicted for our benefit.</p>
<p class="p10">I have often wished, Midie, that I was a good <u>Christian</u>, not that I could only be better contented here on earth, but
                    that I might be triumphant of Life in death; but why yearn, when there is a <u>way</u> of inheritance?</p>
<p class="p10">Your advice is wholesome; &amp; is the the path of duty; but how many, like
                    myself, know, &amp; do not (no <i>[added: re]</i>ference
                    to you.)</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose the inclemency of the weather, prevented, or made it unpleasant for
                    your singing; my fears of such on Friday changed my intentions: as I have been
                    partially an invalid. Was inde<i>[added: e]</i>d very sorry
                    to hear of the misforutnte of Miss McC. - learned she was badly hurt. I indeed
                    sympathize with her, although knowing that she is in good hands, &amp; will
                    be kindly wa<i>[added: i]</i>ted upon. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>So Billie
                    is a changed boy - in what respect? fallen from the standard of moral rectitude
                    &amp; integrity, or withdrawn from the precedents to conjugal relations?
                    Excuse inquisitiveness; ha! 'tis all in fun with me. I imagine misplaced
                    affection, with marriage, would be more than miserable; how many half loved
                    marriages take place, in that one or the other commit themselves by word or
                    writ. You say you have much to tell me; as I do not now know when I shall see
                    you, you must write me. As this day adds another year of my life &amp; about
                    the Anniversary of the surrender, so I feel in a bad mood for writing, have no
                    news, more than peace is declared, War at an end, poverty reigns, &amp; new
                    spring goods in abudnance at A. H. Come over &amp; see the latest agonies.
                    My true &amp;c. E.A.S. sends love to <u>you</u>, (my <u>highly</u> appreciated) she is recovering from a very bad
                    cold; she knows not to whom <i>[added: I'm writing]</i> but
                    suspects, &amp; said give the above: - truly private, all this, Midie, I
                    wish. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>As there is a meeting of the Overseers tomorrow, may send up
                    this to Mr. Fauber, to give ot your Pa.</p>
<p class="p10">Let me know if you can when is the last of your singing, as I want to go over, if
                    possible. Jno. Wright &amp; Sisters were well, when last heard from. Well
                    did you get any April fools? I was fortunate this year; received no chips for dinner.</p>
<p class="p10">Do you send any Valentines these times? Saw a very nice one not long since, that
                    had been sent to a fellow; in hand-write, resembling yours so much, that it in
                    my mind, was your identical. I however did not tell the fellow that I knew; as
                    telling him, would be telling on self. ha! ha!!</p>
<p class="p10">He appeared very anxious to find out even if he was
                    playing ignorance. I think you &amp; J.S.S. got the thing up. Tried at first
                    to lay the blame on me; but he made nothing.</p>
<p class="p10">Love to all &amp; much for yourself.</p>
<p class="p10">Your true Friend</p>
