<p class="p10">My Dear Sara --</p>
<p class="p10">We have had another day of fighting and now, at 5 A.M. today, it has begun again. The enemy
     made an attack yesterday at 5 A. M all along our lines, sending up four solid lines against our
     front -- but we repulsed them handsomely, with tremendous loss to them &amp; not much to us
     except in officers -- it is thought we killed &amp; wounded ten times as many of them as
     they did of us -- we drove off all their attacks on our line every where &amp; were masters
     of the position -- We captured 2 Brigadiers just at dark, one of them Seymour that commanded at
      <i>[unclear: Aluster]</i> &amp; they were here last night. Col. Warren of the 10<sup>th</sup> was killed - Capt. Wilson, Daniel Wilson's <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>son, was wounded in the leg -- not a very bad one -- . Col. Thompson Brown was killed
     -- our loss in privates quite small -- Longstreet gave them a good dose on our night surge
     think the Yankees are leaving -- but I think not, for they have a large army -- have soaked it up from every direction &amp; have staked all on the issue of
     this battle -- they burned Orange Court   House a few days ago -- the
     scoundrels -- Gen. Lee led a gallant charge yesterday -- he praises the counduct of our Corps
     much -- we have our Army closed up &amp; can make a fine fight with God's blessing -- Many
     of our men have not been engaged yet. Love and Kisses for you
     &amp; the children &amp; may God bless you -- write to me -- in haste </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
