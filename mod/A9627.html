<p class="p10">Dear Sister,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[illeg.]</i>we were on picket about two <i>[illeg.]</i> in the <i>[unclear: morning]</i> we suppose the object of the
                    picket was to stop stragglers for the tenth Regiment came across upon the same road consequently
                    the enemy could not leave unexpected. We left Rude's Hill the 11<sup>th</sup> &amp; camped near the Spring. Abe, Hunter, John &amp; I
                        stopped
                    all night at Aunt's She was
                    very much distressed at the thought of the advance of the enemy the people in
                    general were rioting about in the utmost confusion not knowing their personal
                    fate if they stayed nor the fate of their property if they left. Uncle
                    Cyrus sold some cattle in town &amp; on his return,
                    he &amp; his three sons met the Brigade they had their horses &amp;
                    equipments <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>expecting to join their company at Richmond they certainly
                    had but little time to escape for the enemy's cavalry
                    were at the Spring the next morning. Ashby killed several in Mr. Lincon's
                    wheat-field it is said Cousin John &amp; Albert
                    took dinner at home the next day. They say the enemy did not disturb any citizen
                    but took several horses.</p>
<p class="p10">The Brigade was strongly averse to leaving the <i>[deleted: leaving]</i> the valley out of the fifth Regiment about 170 men deserted. Three or Four of our company.</p>
<p class="p10">It is the general belief that we will return to the valley as we are being
                    reinforced some here &amp; reported that troops are being transported to
                    Staunton. Last night Colonel Hearmon brought action to the Regiment
                    &amp; departed for home Colonel Baylor takes
                    command being elected yesterday evening. Captain
                    <i>[unclear: Hunk]</i> of Winchester was elected Lieutenant
                    Colonel &amp; Captain
                    Williams Major. Lieutenant Rosse's time having expired
                    he expects to return home in a few days says he will take <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>letters for
                    the company. I went to tell cousin George of the
                    opportunity of sending a letter home but found he was on guard John Fauber told me to tell Sue he is well
                    &amp; would like to write home. It was rumored in camp that the enemy was in
                    Staunton a few days ago but that was false for General Jackson from Alleghany
                    was at head quarters and reported that he was holding his position.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr <i>[unclear: Glenn]</i> &amp; Mr Shelly are well this morning &amp;
                    appeared to be very well satisfied. I do not wish
                    any thing at present &amp; not until we are
                    located for I have just as much as I can attend to, Uncle Cyrus buried another
                    son lately his name I have forgotten. Mary is very poorly yet &amp; doubtful
                    whether she will recover. Give my love to all I am very well contented &amp;
                    think as little of home as possible. I have a vial of
                        powder I will try to send to Pa by Lieutenant.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your affectionate brother,</p>
