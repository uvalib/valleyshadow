<p class="p10">Fisher's Hill Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara --</p>
<p class="p10">I got to camp yesterday -- came as far as Big Spring on Monday &amp; yesterday came here
     where I found the Army after the severe battle of Monday. The first I heard of the battle was
     at New Market &amp; a few minutes afterwards I met the body of poor Gen Rodes, borne by his
     staff to his afflicted wife -- We have never suffered a greater loss save in the Great Jackson
     -- Rodes was the best Division Commander in the Army of Northern Virginia -- &amp; was worthy of &amp; capable for any position in it -- Saturday
     Gordon's Division went to Martinsburg, with Jackson's Cavalry &amp; drove the Yankees out
     &amp; burned a bridge they had built for the R. R. &amp; then came back to Bunker's
     Hill -- Monday the enemy came on &amp; attacked Rodes &amp; Ramseur at Winchester, the
     fight beginning at 3 A. M. It was fought stubbornly by them -- Rodes being killed during the
     fight &amp; we gained some advantages -- held our position &amp; the day was going well
     with us -- Gordon got back about noon &amp; formed the left of the line near Martinsburg Rd
     -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>our right reached across to the Berryville road -- but about 4 P.M. the enemy
     massed his cavalry on our left &amp; they made a splendid charge &amp; our cavalry
     broke &amp; ran away -- creating a stampede -- the Yanks did not pursue them but turned the
     flank of our infantry -- Gordon's Division &amp; got in its rear &amp; came down on it
     &amp; took about 1000 prisoners -- but not without loss the infantry forming &amp;
     firing on them -- that put an end to the fight &amp; we fell back to Newtown -- losing 3
     pieces of artillery -- but no wagons or anything else -- All agree that but for the conduct of
     our cavalry we would have won a complete victory notwithstanding the fact that Sheridan had
     been very largely reinforced &amp; Grant himself was there at least we know he was there
     the day before. Everything is here now in good order &amp; the enemy has halted near
     Strasburg -- I saw Maj. Newton -- he is wounded in the foot -- Col. <i>[unclear: Frank]</i>
     was mortally wounded -- Gen. Godwin was killed &amp; Gen. York lost an arm. We captured
     over 300 Yankees -- I was quite tired when I got here last night - I shall have to send my coat
     home to have it made -- have it lined all through -- I shall see today who of our neighbors is
     wounded or missing -- Gen. Early had 2 horses killed under him &amp; Col. Pendleton made a
     narrow escape -- Goodbye -- Write soon -- &amp; May God bless you all -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
