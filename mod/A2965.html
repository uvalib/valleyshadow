<p class="p10">Dearest Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind &amp; interesting letter
                    this morning and being on a reserved post I hasten
                    to reply My health is very good &amp; hope this may find you enjoying the
                    same. Every thing is quiet along the lines our foes are
                    quietly watching us from the north side of the Rapidan every thing would betoken a friendly appearance if our Officers would
                    allow us to traffic with the Yankees, a great many of
                    our boys bought tobacco for the purpose of trading
                    for coffee; with all the yankee notions that might be brought forward for the
                    exchange of the great southern weed <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>your cousin Jimmie V has been
                    complaining for some time he looks badly I came across him the other day in the
                    woods lying down when I first came upon him I felt like kneeling down beside him
                    &amp; raising him in my arms I stopped for about a
                    minute &amp; looked at him &amp; then called him by name I asked him how
                    he felt. He said about as usual was just sunning him self a little you need not be in the least
                    uneasy about Jake no doubt he will write to say as he is
                    left in camp well Kate Jake made me blush the other day by asking where I was he was looking at me at the same time. Abe
                    answering told him I was writing to his sis. Jake then said he suspicioned that
                    then all the boys commenced laughing you may well know it
                    was very hard to keep from blushing all the boys tease me a great deal more since I come back than they
                    ever did before but I never mind them. I often tell them <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>you said you
                    had a great deal of company since my return I am glad
                    for I know you can always enjoy your self when in gay company I suppose you have
                    been wondering
                    where I got my red ink. Our post is near a patch of
                    Poakroads berries of which Brother John made the ink
                    that I am now using I hope it may last longer than the marks of a lead pencil. I
                    told John that Hettie sent her love to him he blushed and replied that he would
                        have to return the compliment There is none but <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; myself in this post.
                        We have a gay time John says he will not believe that
                    H sent her respects to him unless I will let him read the letter he says he
                        knows that Hettie is too
                    backward to send her love to any one and says the blame must rest on you I
                    obliged him a great deal about the blush on his cheek telling him that it was a
                    hidden disease. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I was in hopes that Charles was at home by this time
                    I hope while he is an exile that he may be tamed I have never heard from sister
                    since I returned to camp I am very anxious to hear
                    from her I will write again to be sure that she may hear from me. oh Kate I have
                    no news &amp; how am I to interest you you said
                    you had paid Kate a visit &amp; that you ware rather fearful that Tom will not come; I hope he will for if he disappoints her She will take
                    it very hard if she should be so fortunate as to get married I hope you may be
                        there &amp; enjoy yourselves to the greatest advantage I think Mr Lee will hardly let me off this time as I had such a
                    long stay this summer. My toe is getting so that I can stand the
                    <i>[unclear: truss]</i> very well The boys are mostly in fine spirits Jake is
                    not very well this morning but I think its nothing more
                    than a slight bilious attack &amp; will be well in a day or <i>[added: two]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>they just remind me of my duty to write to your cous; John B to get
                    that ring finished &amp; return it to you Miss Kate Shields will probably think that her ring is gone We have prayer meeting one
                    night and preaching the next I believe the boys generally
                    like our new chaplain the Rev. Mr. See. I think he is a good man &amp; a
                    noble Preacher hope his efforts may be crowned with success <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>your
                    cous, He sends his respects to you oh yes Jim Campbell told me to tell you that
                    he was going to strut in that Confederate
                    uniform that he is going to get of him I must bring
                    this to a close by asking an interest in your prayers write soon as I am always
                        anxious to hear from you I remain yours truly as
                    ever.</p>
