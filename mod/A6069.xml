    <p>I received your letter yesterday dated the thirty first &amp; now hasten to answer it. I
     am well with the exception of a cold which is nothing new. There is no news of importance
     except that there was a slight stir in camp yesterday in consequence of a rumored advance of
     the enemy but it appears to have subsided now General Stuart has made another dash around the
     enemy &amp; returned without the loss of a man. He captured five hundred
     
      <pb n="2"  entity="Smiley39b" pid="uva-lib:503208"/>
      prisoners, two hundred wagons, and destroyed five days rations for the Yankees.
     Christmas &amp; New Years day passed off quietly with us. We had a great variety on the
     table for our christmas dinner<del hand="h1">s</del> the breakfast consisted of <orig
      reg="beef">beeff</orig> steak &amp; bread, dinner was bread &amp; Roast Beef,
     &amp; supper out of what was left <del hand="h1">for</del> at breakfast. To give you an
     idea of what we have to pay for little extras I will mention the price of a few articles.
     Apples are selling at from $1.50 to two dollars a dozen, Ginger Bread 3 cakes for a dollar,
     Butter two dollars a pound, sausage 1.50 per pound, dried apple pies that are baked in camp
     bring 75 <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> and a dollar &amp; <orig reg="everything">every
      thing</orig> else is in proportion. There was but few of the men that could afford to get
     drunk this

      Christmas as Whiskey is selling at fifteen dollars a quart. During the last year we lost
     out of our brigade 1220 men in killed &amp; wounded no mention being made of those that
     died from disease the loss in our regiment was 400 almost <orig reg="one-third">one
     third</orig> of the whole amount We marched over 1500 miles encountering the snows &amp;
     ice of Winter in the mountains of Morgan and hampshire. The miasma of summer in the swamps of
     Henrico &amp; Hanover Our bridgade numbers but 1200 muskets at the beginning of the present
     year. If I can obtain a copy of the order I will send it to you which contains a history of the
     past years campaign in few words. We are now fixed <orig reg="up">upp</orig>
