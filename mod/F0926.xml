                <p>I write you concerning the exemption of the <orig reg="refugees">reffugees</orig>
                    &amp; deserters from the Rebel army. I think it worse than barbarism that
                    the government have made no provision for us poor union men of the south in the
                    conscription act. We have left property and all and come here for protection
                    because we would not fight against the best government God ever gave to man. I
                    need not detail to you the sufferings we have endured you have read enough of
                    them. You know our fate if taken prisoners and 8 out of every 111 get taken
                    during a campaign we have gotten to a land of liberty with our wives &amp;
                    little ones with nothing for them to live on only what we can make for them and
                    why the congress has overlooked us I cannot imagine; no government has ever
                    forced men who come for protection into the army where there is no show for
                    their lives at all and I cannot believe the government I love is going to do it.
                    I am satisfied the matter has been overlooked. I hope you will take some part
                    for us poor suffering men &amp; families and you will cause joy among us <pb
                        n="2"/> I know all it wants is for some one to introduce it in the house. I
                    am satisfied their will not be a vote against our exemption only by copperheads.
                    if their was not plenty of men here we would not think as hard of but the
                    government cant begin to use the men here if the war should last 20 years and
                    why in the name of humanity justice &amp; right their has been no provision
                    for us in the conscription act I cannot for my life see.</p>



                <p>I deem it unnecessary for me to write more your great mind can comprehend the
                    whole subject. By complying with the above you will do us poor men and act of
                    justice that will be reciprocated some future day.</p>
