<p class="p10">Monday May 13th 1865 </p>
<p class="p10">Chapel Point Md</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Jennie </p>
<p class="p10">I received two letters from on Saturday evening one they were dated Apr 28<sup>th</sup> and May 2<sup>nd</sup> they were sent to Pleasant Valley and consequently I
     did not get them for so long I was beginning to fear that there was something wrong that I did
     not hear from you but it is all right now for I know you are well and still love as ever you
     have. Jennie your letters are very interesting more so since you have
     begun to recover than they were some time ago.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to hear that you have concluded to pay a visit to my old home, I consider it a very pleasant place and I expect
     to be<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> there myself in a few more days for it is reported that we will leave here
     this week perhaps tomorrow to join our Regiment at Washington and then we will all be sent to
      <u>Harrisburg</u> to be discharged and sent home.</p>
<p class="p10">I was somewhat surprised to hear that my "prodigal brother" has come
     home - it is a pretty time now for him to talk of going to the army when this war is over. It
     speaks well for his bravery but if he will go I hope he may have a fine time.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather is very pleasant but the boys are getting very tired of camp they all want to get
     home and enjoy the peace they have paid so dearly for I am sure they
     will be the happiest days of my life when I get out of this miserable camp and tiresome service
     Jennie I expect to spend some pleasant days in this world yet before I leave it</p>
<p class="p10">Jennie you must excuse me for this awkward letter for it is almost impossible to write here
     subject to the torment of these contrary boys. Geo. Stoufer is living with my brother and
     myself - he knows who I am writing to and he has told me his version of your history from the
     time you were a little girl at school but he does not know <u>all</u> of
     your history and I mean to let him wait till he gets home before he learns the rest. Now dear
     Jennie I hope you will excuse me for not writing more this time if I have an opportunity I will
     write you a good long one some day and if not we will have the more to talk about when I get
     home. I shall be anxious to hear from you soon again. </p>
<p class="p10">Very Affectionately Yours, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Lucius Mox<br>Co. I, 17<sup>th</sup> Pa Cav Camp Remount<br>Chapel Point Md. </i></p>
