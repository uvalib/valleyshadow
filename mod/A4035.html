<p class="p10">Battle Field of Chancellorsville</p>
<p class="p10">My DearWife:</p>
<p class="p10">The Yankees have just gotten over the river again -- after 4 days fighting one of the most
     severe &amp; bloody battles of the war in which our loss has been very heavy as could have
     been expected -- while the enemy's has been much greater &amp; he has been completely
     beaten -- in his own chosen &amp; fortified position his forces routed &amp;
     demoralized &amp; the boasted "fighting Joe" taught that human efforts are unavailing when
     in a wrong cause -- I am thankful to the Almighty that he has spared my life through the many
     dangers of these horrible days -- while we have to mourn the loss of so many loved ones -- our
     hero General lost one arm &amp; had a ball shot through his other hand, and he is lost to
     our country for a considerable time -- but is doing well &amp; I hope will soon be out
     again -- but my tent mate -- my amiable friend Boswell is no more -- he fell, struck in the
     heart, by two balls &amp; I buried him on Sunday evening, as the moon rose, in a soldier's
     grave -- with many tears &amp; a feeling prayer by Mr. Lacy -- poor Boswell --</p>
<p class="p10"> The battle took place some 10 miles above Fredericksburg -- We turned the enemy's flank &amp; took them in the rear before they knew it
     &amp; fell on them with great force -- our loss all told has been some 8 or 10,000 --
     &amp; the enemy's not less than 15000 &amp; we have taken 5
     or 6,000 prisoners Gen. Paxton was killed &amp; J. Addison Bell -- what an affliction for
     his poor mother &amp; father -- They seem to lose a son in every battle -- they enemy's
     raid did not do much harm &amp; our Railroad is again in order --
     Hooker made a speech here before the battle &amp; told his men <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>that he had Lee
     surrounded, had cut off his communication &amp; he had but one day's rations &amp; must surrender or starve -- but we did neither -- We have had a
     severe time, fought in the dense woods &amp; could not do much in the way of pursuing the
     enemy -- but had to drive them by inches as it were. Hooker had 5 Army Corps, over 100000 men
     -- I have been up day &amp; night, a good share of the time &amp; am not in a condition
     to write much -- but will write soon -- </p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye &amp; God bless you all </p>
