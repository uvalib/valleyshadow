                    and expected troop movements in the near future. He mentions how eager his

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 13th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camped Near Winchester</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind and most welcomed letter by the
                        Captain. I was most happy to hear from you all my
                    health is very good, and when this comes to hand I hope you may be enjoying the
                    same; the health of our company is inproving smartly for the last two or three
                    days and I hope before long we may all have good health and <i>[added: ever]</i> after. Your friend Jimmie V. is enjoying good
                    health he is on duty to day. John sends his love to you he just now came here and laughed at me for keeping my hand over the
                        writing. I will have to stop writing at this time Saturday.</p>
<p class="p10">This is the 15th day of July. I had to stop writing the other day for to go on
                    battalion drill and it was my time to go on guard duty for Twenty four hours and
                    this morning we were drilling and again I have a few moments of leisure time I
                    will write. I have not had the opportunity of seeing Mr JPL yet we are often
                    parted here for some times two or three weeks. I do not
                    feel like writing this evening and therefore you must excuse me if I may write a short
                    letter. I suppose you all have heard a correct account of the skirmish of the 2nd of this
                    month there was but little loss on our side. The report
                    is here that we killed from Two fifty to three Hundred
                    of the Yankees.</p>
<p class="p10">That is the statement of one of Pattersons aides if all
                        Johnston's force here
                    fights like the 5th regiment did on the memorable
                        second we will soon whip all the Yankees back
                    into Maryland that is all that would escape the wiry arm of the South. We just
                    now received orders to draw three days' rations and cook one day's it is said
                    that the enemy is marching against us it may be so but
                    it is certainly to their
                    loss, for our force now nearly equals
                    theirs and we have the most artillery
                    on our side we have some twenty stationed pieces and some
                    five or six flying Batteries and all commanded by
                    as brave as the bravest all the Southern troops are as eager to fight seemingly
                    as they are to eat.</p>
<p class="p10">It seems to me that we'll soon whip our enemies if our officers Just
                    let us have a trial at them. I got acquainted with a gentleman by the name of
                    Brand he is from with a lieutenant in the Wytheville company he said he never saw any one of the name of Brand
                    before that was not relations he seemed to be very glad to see me and on parting
                    invited me up to see him he is a doctor lately from
                    Richmond &amp; I think he resembles Cousin Joseph Brand some what I think he
                    is about twenty eight years old from his looks. I shall call on him some of
                    these evenings before long. Cousin Abe is writing
                    close to me we have a hard way to write here. I have not
                    had time to have my likeness taken yet but if ever I get
                        where I can possibly
                    have it taken I will do so. I hope it may not be long until peace may be made between the Confederate States and the
                    corrupted north the drums are loudly beating now and some of our regiments have taken up the march
                    towards our enemies. They are within twelve miles of us and it may not be long until death may step between us but if so I hope
                    not for ever.</p>
<p class="p10">I'll put my trust in the God of battles for he is able and willing to save those
                    that put their trust in him. I recieved a letter from
                    Miss <i>[unclear: Matit]</i> she told me in her letter that you were up there to see her it is
                    useless for me to write any more at present. I will
                        enclose a piece of
                    poetry for you.</p>
<p class="p10">I Dreamed of thee<br>Thy head was on my shoulder leaning<br>Thy hand in mine was gently
                    pressed<br>Thine eyes so soft and full of meaning<br>Were bent on me and I was blessed<br>No word
                    was spoken all was feeling<br>The silent transport of the heart<br>The tear
                    that over thy Cheek was stealing<br>Then told what
                    could never impart<br>And could this be a mere
                    delusion<br>Could fancy all so real seem<br>Are fancy's scenes but wild confusion<br>And can it be I did but dream of
                        thee<br>I'm sure I felt thy forehead
                    pressing<br>The very breath stole o'er my cheek<br>I'm sure I saw those eyes
                    confessing<br>What tongue could never never speak<br>Oh no tis gone and never
                    never<br>For me such waking joy may be<br>But I could sleep would sleep for
                    ever<br>Could I thus dream of thee</p>
<p class="p10">I remain yours &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F.B.</i></p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>Remember me this simple boon I only ask of
                        thee<br>Its speaks more than thousand worlds can tell<br>More of
                        affections wealth conveys;<br>When kindred hearts responsive swell<br>Than
                        breaths in passions wildest tone<br>Remember me when thou shalt
