<p class="p10">  
  January 7 1863  
 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Falmouth, Virginia  
 </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to write you   
 <br>  
   
 a few to let you know that I  
 am well and get <br>  
 along well.  There is not   
 sign of a move at <br>  
 this time.  The  
 weather here has been fine.  <br>  
 Yesterday   
 there was some rain but did not  
   
   
 last long.    
 <br>  
 I received John letter a few Days ago   
 I thought  
 <br>  
  I was  
 not  
 going to get any word from home   
 <br>  
 and was much pleased to   
 hear and  
 was<br>  
 much obliged to John for <i>[deleted: for]</i> the stamp and   
 <br>  
 sheet of paper I  
  can't neither  
 paper or stamp <br>  
   
 here and I want you to write and send them   
 <br>  
 to me occasionally  
  I can buy paper at 2 cents   
 <br>  
 a sheet I think I can't  
 stand them prices well   
 <br>  
 There was some talk a few days ago of our  
 <br>  
 being  
 sent back to Washington   
   
 but I think   
   
 <br>  
 there is nothing of   
 it. If we are  
 moved  it will <br>  
 be towards the river. It takes a good Deal   
 <br>  
 of figuring to live here as the  
 feed is hard   
 <br>  
 to eat but by taking care  
  in the cooking   
 <br>  
 we still make it go down.  
 <br>  
 If I had some

 of the apples that are at home I would have   
 <br>  
 some fine  
 dishes of sauce and apple   
 fritters. I   
 <br>  
 have been very hungry since I have been here  
 <br>  
 by time but I think I will be able to   
 see it  
 <br>  
  through   
 as there is but about 3 &amp; 1/2 months   
 <br>  
 <i>[unclear:  illeg.]</i> has just been here and say I   
 <br>  
 shall tell you he is well but <i>[unclear:  times are   
 tough]</i>  
   
 <br>  
 and sends his respects to all. It is  
   
  a good thing   
 <br>  
 the health of the  
 company is good. There has  
 <br>  
 been <i>[unclear: some]</i> of those  
 sent to the hospital  
 <br>  
 that have been sent on <i>[unclear: here are going at]</i>  
   
 <br>  
 convalesant camp at Alexandria. I hope  
   
 <br>  
 they will stay there  
 as the hardships is hard   
 <br>  
   
   
 to get through and there are   
 more in the company   
 <br> <i>[unclear: that wants to go home]</i>.  
 <br>  
   
  I suppose you have been  
 enjoying yourself fine  
 <br>  
 but if there   
 is no more snow there   
 than there is  
 <br>  
 here the sleigh won't   
 mount too much. This  
 Regiment  
 <br>  
 is very much cut Down at present. There  
 is but <i>[unclear: 315]</i>  
 <br>  
 men in it.  My   
 paper is most full and I must stop.  
 <br>  
 I got some Tobacco seed   
 when I was out in picket  
 <br>  
 the other Day I will send it in this and I want you  
   
       
   
  
 <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitDon2c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitDon2c.gif"></center></a><br><br>  
 
   
 tents which are some protection but the<br> weather has been   
 fine. I think I  
 never <br>  
 saw such good weather this time of  
 year. There was some talk  
 that  
 in camp that this Brigade   
 <br>  
 would be sent back but there has   
 <br>  
 been nothing said the last few days so I don't think  
 <br>  
 there is much in   
 it. I <i>[unclear: wish]</i>  
 we would go back  
 <br>  
 a piece for there would be some chance  
 <br>  
 to buy something to   
 eat. There is no chance  
 to get  
 <br>  
 any thing here neither   
 paper nor postage stamps  
 <br>  
 as you will see this is written on an old piece  
 <br>  
 of copy book that was picked up <i>[unclear: [illeg.] main]</i>  
 <br>  
 and if I have to mail this and leave you the   
 <br>  
 postage to pay you must excuse me   
 or else   
 <br>  
 I <i>[unclear: [illeg.]]</i>  
 <i>[unclear: change our position]</i>   
 There  
 <br>  
 is several that I would like to write to if I had  
 <br>  
 the paper. There   
 is no sutlers supplies alowed  
 <br>  
 to be shipped   
 as the armies is so large that it requires  
 <br>  
 all the transportation the government can raise to  
 <br>  
 bring up supplies. There  
  is not much chance for  
 <br>  
 a forward move from here as the Rebels seem to  
 <br>  
 be very well   
 Situated on the other side of the

 the Rappahannock   
   
 is but a Small river some   
 <br>  
 places it is so   
 shallow that it  
 is easily   
 forded. The pickets talk to each other from the banks   
 <br>  
 of the stream.  There  
  is no firing amongst the   
 <br>  
 pickets but a few evenings they  
 were Driven in   
 <br>  
 which put the officers on their guard. I  
  think I will stop  
 <br>  
 writing about the   
 army and tell you that what part  
 <br>  
 of Virginia <i>[added: I]</i>   
 have seen it looks awful   
 hard it is   
 <br>  
 nothing but a lot of hill and the   
 poorest land I have   
 <br>  
 most ever seen. There is a  
 great deal of this scrubby   
 <br>  
 Pine and cedar grows here most all the farms   
 <br>  
 are vacated the inhabitants gone   
 south with the   
 <br>  
 exception of some few Negros that are  
 scattered about   
 <br>  
 I wish I <i>[deleted: who]</i> could have been at home to have   
 <br>  
 attended singing the  
 last three evenings as they have   
 <br>  
 been fine and I suppose you had a good  
 time.  
 <br> I want you to write to me and give me all   
 <br>  
 the news   
 and let me know how the singing is    
 <i>[deleted: going]</i><br>  
 getting along    
 I wrote to David Early some time ago <br>  
 have  
 not heard from him   
 yet. My paper is most full. My best Respects to  
 your  
 Parents and all that inquire   
 <br>  
 and I Remain   
 </p>
<p class="p10">yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thad Donely</i></p>
<p class="p10">Excuse   
 all mistake as it is the best I can do  
 under  
 <br>  
 the circumstances. Don't forget to give me a whole sheet  
 <br>  
 full of news
