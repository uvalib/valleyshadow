<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    May 29, 1852<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure writes that he will be starting a new paper and that Andrew Curtin may
                    run for office.</p>

<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel-</p>
<p class="p10">I cannot now say just when I will visit you; but it is one of the things to be
                    done, and I mean to steal the first favorable opportunity for it.</p>
<p class="p10">I will be busy for a few weeks now; but will see you either Monday or Tuesday on
                    my way to Philadelphia. I have been <u>brain-wasting</u> and in order to cure
                    it have just bought out the old Repository &amp; will announce myself
                    conducting it. I have a good business <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>partner, and will have only the
                    Editing &amp; a general supervision of the business. It will <i>[deleted: ]</i> no more labor than is necessary to a health existence; and I will try
                    &amp; make it a paper to which our friends can look with some assurance and
                    satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p10">It looks very much as if Curtin would run. He sent me some confidential messages
                    by General Crawford a few days ago which looked very
                    much that way. Indeed. I am satisfied that he at least <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>does not
                    discourage it positively. Well, if so I will follow his fortunes as of old; but
                    the act of nomination must not be mine.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly thine</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AKMcClure</i></p>

                        Honorable Eli Slifer
