<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando
                    Brown, July 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In his report, Jordan notes the high demand for labor and the opportunities for
                    employment for the blacks of Augusta County. He also discusses in some detail
                    the political attitudes of whites in the county.</p>

<p class="p10">July 31<sup>st</sup> 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular Number VI from HeadQuarters
                        Assistant Commissioner
                    Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands Richmond Virginia
                    January 29th 1866 I have the honor to submit the
                    following "Report" showing the condition of Freedmen's affairs in my Division at
                    this date.</p>
<p class="p10">The Freedmen are generally employed at fair wages and appear to be contented and
                    have no difficulty in obtaining employment the demand for laborers being far in
                    excess of the supply and every inducement is offered not only in honorable
                    steady employment but at fair <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and remunerative wages and I am
                    grateful to be able to state that close observation on my part has resulted in
                    the conviction that every colored man in my field of operations who is inclined
                    to labor is taking advantage of the opportunities offered him and is doing as
                    well if not better than the laboring class of whites are here.</p>
<p class="p10">The policy persisted on by me of having their difficulties adjudicated in my
                    office has had an excellent effect and has in no little degree contributed to
                    the promotion of more kindly feeling between the races.</p>
<p class="p10">Intemperance does not prevail to any great extent among this class in fact since
                    my assignment to duty at this post I have seen but two colored person under the
                    influence of <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>liquor and those were both from the country and happened
                    here during one of the Circus Exhibitions.</p>
<p class="p10">The Schools have all been temporarily closed but it is expected they will be
                    re-opened about the 1st of September</p>
<p class="p10">The Crops are turning out splendidly - demonstrating clearly the fact that the
                    Agricultural interests of this portion of the country have been advanced by the
                    change in the labor system.</p>
<p class="p10">I am still of the opinion that the necessity for the continuance of the Bureau
                    still exists and although there are a few men here who under <u>existing</u> circumstances claim to be the colored mans
                    friend etc. yet I am convinced that much of the
                    kind feeling cherished toward the race by these people is attributable to the
                    moral effect of the presence of Government officers <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br><i>[unclear: Withdraw]</i> the Bureau which now is the counselor &amp;
                    protector of the Freedmen and it would not be long before his condition would be
                    as deplorable, if not more so than when he was in Slavery.</p>
<p class="p10">It cannot be successfully concealed that there is still cherished a most bitter
                    feeling against the colored man on the part of his old masters and as they have
                    no other means or source through which to vent their spleen against the Federal
                        Government the presumption naturally arises that
                    were the old slave owners at liberty to carry out their inclinations the colored
                    man (in view of the white mans hatred of the Government and the negro) would
                    have a serious time of it. This is evident from the enthusiasm at the nomination
                    of <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>of Seymour &amp; Blair. Not because of any particular
                    admiration they have for these candidates or any special love they cherish for
                    the democratic party but simply &amp; only by reason of the fact that the
                    Republican party is the friend of the colored race, and the supporter and
                    defender of the Federal Government. So strong is this
                    conviction fixed in my mind that I believe the mass of the Southern whites would
                    indentify themselves with any party or any people if by doing so they could
                    destroy the Republic and thus accomplish by chicanery or political villainry
                    what they failed to consummate by the sword.</p>
<p class="p10">I am General<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient
                        Servant</p>
