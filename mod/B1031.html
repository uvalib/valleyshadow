<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Roswell Waldo to Orlando
                    Brown, December 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In Waldo's last report on Augusta and Highland counties, he relates the
                    increasing problems between whites and blacks once the Bureau's impending
                    closure was made public. He writes that those who have always opposed the Bureau
                    are beginning to show "their true colors." His report also mentions the high
                    levels of poverty during the winter season.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 31, 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">General:</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular Number 6, dated Head Quarters
                        Assistant Commmissioner Richmond Virginia
                    January 29. 1866, I have the honor to submit the
                    following report of Bureau Affairs in 4th Division (Comprising Highland and
                    Augusta Counties) 9th Sub-District
                    Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">When it became generally known that the Bureau would close its operations on 1<sup>st</sup> January, many of those who have always exhibited or
                        <i>[unclear: courted]</i> a vindictive spirit toward the same began showing
                    their true colors, and much of the spirit of four years ago is again manifesting
                    itself. It is true these words apply more particularly to the uneducated, yet
                    there are those whose intelligence and wisdom in
                    connection with <i>[added: their]</i> experience should have
                    made them good Citizens, that vie with each other in the exhibition of their
                    animosity.</p>
<p class="p10">Much difficulty has been experienced <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>in the collection of claims for
                    the freedmen this month on account of the demonstration of this feeling, and on
                    several occasions, it was only with great effort that <i>[added: I]</i> succeeded in maintaining the respect of the office,
                    and impressed upon their unwilling minds that the Bureau closes no sooner than
                        January 1<sup>st</sup> 1869. ---- The
                    freedmen seem to dread the future already and many complain of their fear and
                    anxiety, not on account of any bodily injury, but for the proneness on the part
                    of their former employers to delay or <i>[added: their]</i>
                    refusal to settle their accounts.</p>
<p class="p10">I find large numbers, both in town and country who are suffering for want of
                    clothing and but for the timely arrival of relief through this office, much
                    misery would have been experienced before the dawning of Spring. All Clothing
                    sent to this office for distribution has been issued yet many were not served
                    who were really in need of it.</p>
<p class="p10">The School at Staunton is in a prosperous condition &amp; is daily increasing
                    in numbers. Thoese in the Country continue backward on account of the scarcity
                    of good material for teachers.</p>
<p class="p10">Concerning Intemperance, there seems to be no observable change among the
                    freedmen. Opinions expressed in previous reports on this subject can remain
                    unmodified.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Roswell Waldo<br>Assistant Sub Assistant Commissioner</i></p>
