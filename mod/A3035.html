<p class="p10">June 15th 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Weyers Cave</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Annie</p>
<p class="p10"> Yours of the 12<sup>th</sup> has come to hand. And believe me it
                         was read with delight - as it was the first, &amp; the only one, that I
                         have received from any source, since Brother was down, so you may well
                         imagine how eager I was to get some news, especially from one who I believe
                         to be a friend if nothing more. I have little <i>[illeg.]</i> news of
                         importance to write you at present. I believe I gave you all the
                         particulars of<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> our late fights in my last letter. We are
                         encamped within a few hundred yards of the Cave at present, have been here
                         for several days. I often think of the time we were at this place,
                         &amp; of the appearance that some of our crowd presented on their way
                         from the hotel. Alas;
                         one of our crowd is no more, he has gone the way of all the living. But we
                         trust our loss has been his gain. Doctor Thompson
                         &amp; Lady were with us yesterday &amp; today, preached for us at
                         the Artiller Camp on yesterday, had a good<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Sermon. Today he listened to Doctor Dabney who preached in our Regiment.
                         Joining with him in prayer he left for home this evening &amp; can
                         doubtless give you a full history of camp life.</p>
<p class="p10">I walked out this evening to see some of my friends &amp; accidentally
                         happened on Mrs Brownlee &amp; Cousin Pitt they were at the 25 Regiment I saw John Mines Tom McClure &amp;
                         several other of our old neighbors. they all well - Samuel Lightner started for home this evening he <i>[added: looks]</i> very badly indeed.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Well I must close for the present, as <i>[added: I]</i>
                         know you are tired of such stuff. If you all care
                              anything about us poor soldiers, just
                         pick yourselves up &amp; come down We will take great pleasure in
                         handing you around. We may stay here for some time yet, &amp; we may
                         leave any time. Old Jack only gives us a moment's warning. My love to all &amp; receive the same.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Tony Pastor</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Mc is in bed &amp; I must go too, good
                              night pleasant dreams<br> T.P.</p>
