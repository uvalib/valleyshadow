<p class="p11"><b>
     Miss Mary A. Heirs.<br> Quincy.<br>Illinois<br> Haste! Oh! Haste!
    </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sabbath Eve, 2
       <u>'o'clock</u><br> September, 15<sup>th</sup> 1861.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Staunton</u></p>
<p class="p10">My darling Cousin:</p>
<p class="p10">It is with the most exquisite pleasure that I once more endeavor to pen you a few lines;
     although there is a probability that you may never see these
     lines. But I have an opportunity to send a letter <u>North</u> by a
     gentleman who has been working here for some time, but is going home, &amp; I sincerely
     hope he may be permitted to mail this letter to you.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mollie, there has been many sad changes since last I wrote you, my heart aches as I
     think of them, but I try to submit without murmuring, for I can not but feel that it is the
     Lord's will, that our once prosperous &amp; happy nation must be divided; and where peace
     &amp; happiness, once Shed their smile to gladden the hearts of
     the people, now <u>civil war</u> is devastating our land. It is very sad to
     think of, but you know, dear cousin, as well, perhaps better than I do, the state of our
     beloved country. But do not let us despair, we are in the hands of a merciful God, &amp; he
     will surely work all things to-gether for our good, &amp; his own glory. His ways are
     mysterious.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose, dear Mollie, that you have not heard from Cousin Will since the war commenced. He
     is in Virginia, at Norfolk, a city about two hundred miles from here, I have not heard from him
     for some time, the last I heard of him, he was well.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>There has been no fighting where
     he is yet, &amp; I hope there will be none. I wish I could see him, nothing would afford me
     more happiness. He has promised to come as soon as he can.</p>
<p class="p10">I know where Will is, and can hear from him some time; But <u>where</u>
     <u>is</u>
     <u>cousin</u>
     <u>Tom?</u> Oh! how unhappy I have been about him
     since I received his last letter, which was in May. If I could feel sure of his safety I would
     be <u>so </u>happy. I know wherever he is,
     &amp; in whatever circumstance he may be placed, there is One
     who ever watches over him, when human friends are of no avail I have looked at his picture
     many, <u>many </u>times, since I heard from him, and read his letters again
     &amp; again, while tears of anguish flowed from my eyes, as I thought of the probability of never hearing from you all again. But I hope, dear
     Mary that there is a brighter day ahead, &amp; the time may soon come when our
     correspondence will recommence not to be stopped by any national calamity. I wish you had sent
     me <u>your</u> picture I hope someday to see it,
     &amp; not your shadow merely, but your own dear self. What a happy day that <u>would</u> be!</p>
<p class="p10">Tell dear Aunt not to be unhappy because Cousins Will &amp; Tom are in opposite parties.
     Tell her, cousin Mollie, that I would try to console her but I know not how. I can only pray
     for her Her situation is one of peculiar Sadness, &amp; I would
     that it were in my power to administer to her consolation, but I cannot I am too weak &amp; ignorant, I fear, to comfort her, but I pray the Lord<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
     may console her in her affliction. He is able &amp; willing to
     comfort her. There has been some changes in our family since last I wrote. Sister was married
     the <u>Fourth of July</u>. She married Mr. Williams believe I wrote something about him to you or cousin Tom.
     He would say, "she did remarkably well." He is not <u>very</u> wealthy, but
     he is an honest &amp; industrious man, esteemed by all. I know they would send you some
     message or perhaps write, if they had known that I intended to write to
     you, but I did not know it myself until nearly eleven o'clock to-night, &amp; as their home
     is some distance from mine I could not go to see them. I will send their love to you (all)
      anyhow. Unfortunately mother is away from home to-night also. Give
     her love to Auntie &amp; tell that she often talks about her.</p>
<p class="p10">I must stop for it is getting late, &amp; I am afraid I will
     not wake in time to send this down. Excuse me, dearest Cousin, I intended to write you a long
     letter, but time will not permit it now. Give my love to Cousin Tom, and tell I often think of
     him &amp; long for the time when he can write to me again, I miss his and your letters more
     than I do any of my other correspondence I would give anything to
     receive one of your'<i>[deleted: s]</i> or his' long &amp; interesting letters.
     Remember, dear Mary, if I should never hear from you again, I shall ever feel the tenderest
     affection for you, &amp; deepest solitude for your happiness.
     All send much love, Do not forget to give my love &amp; a kiss to your youngest brother. If
     it is in your power, dear Mollie, write to me. A letter from you would<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> give me more
     happiness than I could express.</p>
<p class="p10">You wrote to me once about being a Christian. Do you still love Christ &amp; his cause? Are you striving to please
     him? You have my prayers in your behalf.</p>
<p class="p10">Good bye dearest Mary, if- if I never hear from or see you while living, I hope to meet you
     with the redeemed &amp; blessed above. Tears are blinding me, I am compelled to stop<br>
     Remember me in your petitions, cousin.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, and ever shall be Your fond &amp; loving cousin</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sue.</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> Henry sends his love, and says that he is sorry that your
      picture did not come. Write to me if possible. <u>Good</u>
      <u>bye</u>!<br> Monday Morning 6 o'clock.</p>
