                <p>I should have written you sooner in regard to that suit, but have been waiting to
                    find out something satisfactory.</p>

                    </hi> when it is know that many of the stockholders have not paid for their
                    stock except by their notes renewable at 12 percent &amp; are getting about
                    15 percent dividends. I can hear of no such order as the one said to have been
                    given by <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Wilson, Bank inspector. That suits
                    should be brought on all <unclear>protested</unclear> notes at once: - he merely

                    advise his colleagues in opposition to them only as delegate counel not to send
