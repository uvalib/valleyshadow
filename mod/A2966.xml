                    &amp; that we may soon go in to winter quarters We have had a <orig
                        reg="right">rite</orig> severe campaign for the last two weeks I think we
                    will <orig reg="move">moove</orig> to some camp today we had orders last night
                        <pb n="2"/>to <orig reg="move">moove</orig> this morning at nine oclock you
                    must <orig reg="pardon">parden</orig> me for not writing soon while on the march
                        <orig reg="there">thare</orig> was little or no chance to send letters back
                    and I was always so tired after the days march that I felt more like lying down
                    than writing I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> yours of the 6 on the 8th
                    was truly glad to hear from you oh how I wished that I could come home for a
                        <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> days to see your Cousin and my friend united in
                    holy wedlock but alas I had to serve my country first; then wait on my friends;
                    since writing the above we have <orig reg="moved">mooved</orig> our camp near
                    five miles. The boys are generally busy now policing &amp; putting up bunks
                    we are <orig reg="camped">campt</orig> two miles south of Brandy Station I think
                    we will stay <orig reg="here">hear</orig>
                    <pb n="3"/>for some time we have a very nice camp; but the water is not very
                    good. You asked me questions in you first letter I neglected answering, hope it
                    is not <orig reg="too">to</orig> late now. I mess with my old messmates Trotter,
                    Abny, Grever, Hatten Britton &amp; two Ruebushes, they all say it will not
                    do to <orig reg="break">brake</orig> up our mess while the war lasts hope that
                    may not be long. Tom is well he was unwell for a week or two. This march has
                    improved <orig reg="his">is</orig> health greatly John has been unwell for a day
                    or two but is getting something better Hunter is very unwell I think he is <orig
                        reg="threatened">theatend</orig> with the fever. Capt is right unwell I
                    think he was sent to some private house today Jake is getting quite well again
                    he got along better through the campaign <del hand="h1">better</del> than I
                    expected he would The boys will all recruit up now I hope. <pb n="4"/>I suppose
                    your cous Kate is married before this Oh how much I would like to have been
                        <orig reg="there">thare</orig> I know I could have had my own fun I wish
                    them much hapiness through this changing <orig reg="world">wourld</orig> of
                    ours. I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> a letter from John B dated the 8th
                    he did not now what day it would come off I <orig reg="herad">hurd</orig> that
                    John was to be a waiter. I was surprised to hear of your cous Fannie getting
                    married. Mr Baker is from Winchester is he not; I had thought that Capt Burke
                    was waiting on her if so I suppose she gave him the slide. I will not have room
                    or time to give you any of the <orig reg="particulars">perticulars</orig> of the
                    campaign as I have to do my part in policing our quarters; oh I wish I could be
                    with you for a while to tell you of the many pleasant dreams I have had about
                    you last nights in <orig reg="particular">perticular</orig> Oh I hope the time
