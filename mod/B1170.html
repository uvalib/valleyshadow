<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Frederick S. Tukey to W.
                    Storer How, January 31, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Tukey's monthly report summarizes the condition of blacks in Augusta County. In
                    the report he discusses the practice of making employment contracts, the
                    "flourishing" state of schools, and attacks against the Bureau in the newspaper,
                    The Valley Virginian. Tukey also gives the details of the Walton case, in which
                    Walton refused to abide by a court decision against him. Tukey recommends that
                    he be arrested and sent to Richmond to demonstrate that laws and court decisions
                    will be enforced.</p>

<p class="p10">
                        Captain
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following Report of Bureau affairs in this Sub-District.</p>
<p class="p10">Since I made my last Report the troops have all been withdrawn from this Sub-District, thereby giving us the opportunity to make the experiment as to whether the
                    operation of the Bureau could be successfully carried on without them, or not,
                    and I am free to say that the Civil Authorities thus far have done everything in
                    their power to prevent the interruption of our schools or the operations of the
                    Bureau. Yet I am not prepared to say by this that no troops are needed but I
                    believe a very small number, for the purpose of making arrests, when necessary,
                    would ensure the complete success of the Bureau in its
                    operations. It sometimes happens, and there are several cases of the kind on
                    hand now, that men refuse to appear here when summoned, that they refuse to
                    come, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and treat the summons with contempt. There is also occasionally
                    a case in which persons refuse to comply with decisions of the Court, and in
                    such cases as these I am completely powerless with any troops. One case in
                    particular which I desire to call your attention to is that of E.P. Walton, who
                    was tried by the Court for a violation of Contract which he acknowledges to have
                    been made with a freedman, and by which he brought complainant from Kentucky
                    during the war under the promise of returning her to her parents whenever she
                    desired it. The Court heard all the testimony in, and carefully weighed the
                    case, and unanimously rendered the following verdict: Said Walton to be allowed
                    thirty Days in which to furnish necessary funds to defray the womans expenses
                    back to her parents. The time expired on the 15th of January, 1866, and he has
                    failed to comply, or give any explanation why. Now, unless the decisions of the
                    Court can be enforced it is all a farce, and might as well be discontinued. What
                    I would recommend in the case is this: That you
                    immediately write to Richmond giving a statement of the facts, and request a
                    guard to be sent here at once to arrest said Walton and take him to Richmond and
                    compel <i>[added: him]</i> to comply with the decision of
                    the Court. Our Court here is composed of myself and two as respectable Citizens
                    as there is in town. One of them is a middle aged man, the other an aged man and
                    neither of them disposed to <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>do any injustice to their fellow
                    citizens, and there was no disagreement in their opinions in the decision of
                    this case, and they, like myself, feel that it should be enforced at once.</p>
<p class="p10">The freedmen, generally speaking, behave well and are entering into Contracts by
                    the year with monthly payments; true that few of the Contracts are made at this
                    office, but I am inclined to think that this is owing to the Charge that is made
                    for them here and the prejudice of the Whites to coming here. Many of them,
                    however, make their own contracts and bring them here for approval, which I do,
                    if properly made, without any charge.</p>
<p class="p10">Our schools here are in a very flourishing condition, and, we think, second to
                    none in the state. This, I think, is owing to the efficiency of the teachers,
                    and to them the credit belongs, and I think we are all gaining ground every Day
                    in the estimation of the respectable citizens of the place.</p>
<p class="p10">I had a long conversation yesterday with the Editor of the "Valley Virginian" who
                    has <i>[added: been]</i> continually throwing flings,
                    through the Columns of his paper, at the Bureau, in which I told him that I had
                    never seen any thing of the kind in the other papers issued here, and that such
                    flings were calculated to excite the populace against the Bureau, and lead them
                    to some overt acts for which he would be responsible, and he has promised to
                    desist from such communications. If he does not, I shall again call your
                    attention <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>to the subject and recommend
                    that he be notified by Major General Terry that
                    such things will not be allowed. This, I think, is due to the better portion of
                    the Citizens here, and I have no doubt they would be glad to have it done.</p>
<p class="p10">With reference to Highland County, I cannot say anything which would be based
                    upon actual knowledge, but as the number of colored people there is very small
                    indeed, and as I have heard no reports to the contrary, I am inclined to think
                    that matters are moving along quietly there.</p>
<p class="p10">No rations have been issued this month, neither have we had any enlisted men
                    detailed to this office; consequently there is no report to make upon either of
                    these subjects. And hoping, now, that the points referred to in this Report,
                    especially the one relating to Walton, will claim your attention.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, Captain, with much Respect,<br>Your
                            obedient
                        Servant</p>
