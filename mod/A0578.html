<p class="p10">March 19<sup>th</sup> 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter was received several days ago but I have not before had time to write
                    or at least not an opportunity of writing. As to time I have no business to
                    employ my time and think it more than likely that we will do nothing this year.
                        Everything is at an almost perfect
                    stagnation. What few manufacturers that have ventured into the business at all
                    have done so on much reduced force and on much crippled
                    resources. One of them has actually failed already
                    and others contemplate changing from manufacturing to steming. Paul was advised
                    several days ago by H.A. Wise not to engage in any sort of business as yet as he
                    thought that pecuniary affairs would receive even a greater blow than any which
                    has yet convulsed the country.</p>
<p class="p10">I again reiterate my prediction that the eastern part of the state will <i>[deleted: raise]</i> rise in revolt against the western and will yet
                    achieve its independence even though the rivers run in blood. My own wish is
                    that the revolution may be bloodless but that depends upon the western section
                    of the state.</p>
<p class="p10">I contemplate going south on account of my business there and I may if I find
                    that I like and that I can make money take up my permanent abode in a more
                    congenial clime.</p>
<p class="p10">I have talked with Mr. Dickenson about a settlement.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> He says that the estate can be readily settled and that it is now and has been since you were
                    down here in the hands of commissioners. After that is settled I contemplate
                    going south and not before. I can not come up now as this will occupy my time
                    until it is entirely settled up.</p>
<p class="p10">All are well. Hoping that all are well I remain as ever truly and affectionately
                    your son.</p>
<p class="p10"> </p>
<p class="p10"><i>John H. Cochran </i></p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to Mr. McChesney to Mr. A. McChesney and his wife to
                        all kind friends. </p>
