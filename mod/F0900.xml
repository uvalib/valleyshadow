                <p>I can set in my tent and see the steeples in Petersburg. See them very plain. We
                    have moved about 5 miles from the camp that we was at when I wrote to you
                    before. There was a man shot in our regiment. He was shot by one of his own men.
                    He was on picket and he went to relieve him and he halted him and he did not
                    stop. Nothing more at present but write and write as soon as you get this
                    letter.</p>
