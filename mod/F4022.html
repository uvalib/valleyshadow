<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    August 19, 1859
        <br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure writes to Slifer about the upcoming election and his campaign
                schedule.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 19th</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">D Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I will be nominated on Tuesday next by the Conference by acclamation, but there
                    is a terrible struggle before me. It looks now as if <i>[unclear: Hill]</i>
                    will be my competitor. If so we will have a jolly time, and a <u>doubtful</u> contest. Nothing but Herculean efforts will
                    save the district. It is naturally against me, and with Hill there will be a
                    most desperate effort made to elect him. He is very timid about entering the
                    race, but I think that if the party will give a cordial nomination <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>he
                    will stand the fight. Myers of Adams, is still in earnest &amp; his county
                    is entitled to it, but it is not improbable that he will be shuffled off by some
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 5<sup>th</sup> I will open the campaign &amp; it will
                    continue mightily until the Election, <i>[unclear: Covey]</i> will be with me
                    the first week, or most of it. McMichael will spend several days with me in
                    Adams.</p>
<p class="p10">Say to <i>[unclear: Kunhel]</i> that he must make his arrangements to be with me
                    on <u>the 3<sup>d</sup> 4<sup>th</sup>
                            5<sup>th</sup> &amp; 6<sup>th</sup> of
                        October.</u> That is the time he can serve me best, and he will be thrown
                    into <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>our <i>[unclear: leanest]</i> districts, where he will have
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> meetings. Tell him that the time I have named must be mine.</p>
<p class="p10">I will be in Adams from the 26<sup>th</sup> of September until the 5<sup>th</sup> of October. If he can be
                    with me at any time there, I shall be glad, but to Frankling he <u>must come</u>. </p>
<p class="p10">I have send a check on <i>[unclear: Bombeger]</i> as you suggest. When I go down
                    I will make satisfactory arrangements about it.</p>
<p class="p10">We will have a most earnest campaign, and will <u>deserve</u>
                    a brilliant success. I hope to realize it.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours </p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Colonel Eli Slifer
                    </p>
