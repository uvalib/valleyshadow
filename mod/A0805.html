<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I have just finished a letter for Addie and told her it was getting dark that I must hurry but Cousin is not ready for me to go so I thought I would write you a few lines as I ought to have done long ago. I suppose you
     have heard all about the fight how many of our men were lost I did no we were fighting until next morning while the fight was going I was having a very nice time. Lieut. Welch and myself had gone
     out to get something to eat and we stopped at Mr. Twimans <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/garb5b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/garb5b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      it was about four o'clock when we stopped
     they asked us to have dinner we told them we would they had Corn and
     tomatoes prepared for us ice water fine milk with ice and the butter
      <i>[illeg.]</i> bread, ham, and lamb were delightful and to
     top it all off we had two of the nicest young ladies to talk you ever
     saw. Dear Father it is getting to dark to write you must excuse this short letter only on that
     account I will write you a longer one next time give my love to ma and the girls and write soon
     to your son</p>
