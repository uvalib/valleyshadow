<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I was glad to hear from you again, I was afraid we would be deprived of hearing from our
     friends but we still have the pleasure. Brother Sam has taken his family to the north somewhere, we have not heard from him since he left. Frank is living
     in the neighborhood, though none of us live like we use to do, you would not know us, our <u>room</u> serves us for a parlor, kitchen &amp; hall. Though we are
     contented, or at least try to be. There is some talk of this war being the beginning<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/Smiley68b.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/Smiley68b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      of the Millennium. There is a book
     which Speaks very strongly of it. And has bible reference to prove everything it says. If I had the book I would send it to you. They say there is "false
     christ" to arise and they think that Louis Napoleon is the antichrist, that he will
      <i>[unclear: conquer]</i> all nations and reign three years, then Christ will reign one
     thousand years. We have company and cannot write so I must close </p>
<p class="p10">I remain as ever Your Friend</p>
