<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">There has just been referred to me for information, a letter of George T. Cook, Lieutenant &amp; Assistant Superintendent at Staunton, asking for information from
     the Quartermaster General as to the disposition made of and the action taken on some papers
     forwarded by Frederick S. Tukey, in April or May last, viz. Claim of
     Doctor J. W. Shelton of Augusta County for one Horse seized or stolen
     by a U.S. Soldier. <i>[illeg.]</i> This letter on being forwarded to General
     Orlando Brown Acting Assistant Adjutant General was returned with endorsement stating that these papers were returned to Mr.
     Shelton through W.S. How Brevet Major
     &amp; Superintendent at Winchester on the 9th of April last,
     informing him that the Quartermaster General could not assist him.
      Lieutenant Cook reforwarded his letter stating that the papers seem
     to have been reforwarded by Mr. Tukey since which time nothing has been heard from them. This
     was referred to me as stated <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> at the outset. <i>[unclear: It seems]</i> the matter
     appears on <i>[deleted: rec]</i> this office.</p>
<p class="p10">Can you give me any information concerning it?</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient
      Servant
     </p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.H. Remington<br>Captain &amp; Brevet Major Veterans' Reserve Corps
      <br>Superintendent 9th District
