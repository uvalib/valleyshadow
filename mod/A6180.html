<h4>Augusta County: David H. Evans to Mary Anna Sibert,
                    February 4, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Evans writes Sibert to say he was very sick and was prevented from writing on
                    Tuesday, but has recovered. He discusses opinions of her beauty, his love for
                    her, her possible visit to Staunton in the spring, and his upcoming weekend
                    visit.</p>
