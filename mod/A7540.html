                    with Magnus last Saturday he was very anxious for me
                    to go with him and I was anxious to go myself but Business prevented me. Magnus told me that
                    he was teasing you about Sending 25 <i>[illeg.]</i> up in your last letter he
                        said that he made you believe that I let him read your letter. there
                    is not a living mortal Ever read your letters but
                        myself I said to Ella I
                    did not know what Rennie sent me 25 <i>[illeg.]</i> for<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>She said that she supposed Rennie Sent for more Buttons
                    &amp; that you had forgotten to mention it in
                    your letter. I hope you did not believe Magnus when he
                    told you that he read your letter for no one has ever read your letters but
