<p class="p10">Friday April 4<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Locust Grove -- Rev. Mr. Rude's</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I today received yours of the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April
     and the first letter you wrote me about Nelly's sickness -- it is strange that it was so long
     on the road. We are still 3 miles above Mt. Jackson, and the enemy is still at Edenburg,
     fighting with Ashby, or rather keeping out of his way. There is not much prospect of a fight,
     though it is hard to tell what a day may bring forth -- We have reports of all sorts of things
     happening around us, but put little credit in anything. I saw a Philadelphia paper of the 28<sup>th</sup> ult. today, it had in an exaggerated and inflated account of the fight of
     the 23<sup>rd </sup> inst, claiming a capture of 200 wagons when we did not lose
     one. The draft for filling up the Volunteer companies was made today -- A list of the men was
     made and a number fixed to each, then a lot of pieces of paper with the numbers on was thrown
     into a hat and the pieces picked out one by one, and whoever is placed
     opposite a number drawn he is drafted in.</p>
<p class="p10"> Nelly's sweet little violet dropped out of my letter as I opened it, and I was happy to
     think my little daughter was reviving &amp; getting new life again just as the sweet
     flowers are opening under the influence of the vernal sun. My little daughter must be very
     thankful to her God that her life is spared, and we will join her in thanking him &amp;
     hope she may live long to be a blessing to her parents &amp; to her friends. The birds are
     singing very sweetly here, and I suppose they are singing at Loch Willow and Pa would like to
     sit out on the porch with the little girls &amp; Ma &amp; hear them sing rather than be
     where he has to see and hear so much of men killing and being killed, doing all the damage they
     can to one another, burning up bridges &amp;c &amp;c. O how I wish war would cease, and
     that we might all have peace in the enjoyment of our rights and liberties, but those rights we
     must have, cost what it may -- I am very well indeed, stay in the house here and eat with the
     staff &amp; Gen --. Mr. Rude is a very nice man -- he is a retired Lutheran preacher -- a
     Dane -- he married <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> the widow Steenbergen who was a Caperton, a 2<sup>nd</sup> cousin of Mrs. Pinkerton. She is a very fine lady, and he is so obliging and kind --
     we have very pleasant times, at times. The Adjutant General is a
     son of the Rev. Col. Pendleton, and is a very fine young man -- a gentleman every way, then the
     medical director, Dr. McGuire is a very smart fellow &amp; gives us entertaining medical
     predictions at evening sittings. Gen Jackson does not say much, he is quite deaf -- he spends
     most of his time in his room by himself, except when in the saddle -- he is very pleasant
     though and I like him much.</p>
<p class="p10"> I have been drawing all day so you will excuse me for not writing more. I will drop a note
     to Powell about the sugar. I send you some stamps enclosed. I am glad the friends are so kind
     to you and that Anna is still well &amp; I do hope she may be spared from sickness -- Mr.
     Rude says that greasing them is a speedy and safe cure.</p>
<p class="p10"> My love to all and Kisses for the children</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye &amp; Heaven bless you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
