<p class="p10">April 29/61</p>
<p class="p10">Greenville</p>
<p class="p10">My dear John</p>
<p class="p10">I feel it is to be a great pleasure to be permitted to write to you. I hope you
                    are well <u>my</u>
                    <u>Dear</u>
                    <u>John</u>, &amp; will be a <u>brave
                        boy John</u>. I have no news just waiting to hear all I can from you all.
                        <u>Uncle Temp</u> got your letter. We are so glad to hear
                    from you write often as you can. John do you get enough to eat &amp; is it
                    fit to eat, how I wish I could send you something <u>nice</u>. I saw Sallie <i>[unclear: Harope]</i> yesterday she said I must
                    remember her to you, I didn't think she had so much feeling. We both cried when
                    we talked of you. <u>John</u> you dont know how much <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> we all think about you all &amp; I dont suppose you ever think
                    of us but we will excuse you - I know you have something of more importance.
                    John had you heard John Eagan was married, Lizzie Marrit told me she had gotten
                    a paper with his marriage. John what do you think is to become of us at Home. I
                    think we are in as much danger as those who have gone to war. But John we will
                    trust in Providence for protection.</p>
<p class="p10">John little did I think when I saw you last it was to be the last for a long time
                    &amp; perhaps forever but I will not think so for I know I will see you
                    again but <u>John</u> if we never meet on <u>Earth</u> may we meet in <u>Heaven</u>.
                    We are both <i>[unclear: liable]</i> to <u>Death</u>
                    &amp; may we prepare to meet again <u>my dear Cousin</u>.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>John</u>, <u>Cousin</u>
                    <u>Pollie</u> has just <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> come in to see us, they
                    are all well. <u>Aunt Ann</u> is a good deal excited, Cousin
                    Pollie send her love &amp; says take good care of yourself says she would
                    like to send you something good to eat, eggs &amp; <u>Ham</u>. <u>Aunt</u>
                    <u>Ann</u> is always talking about you &amp; <u>Charlie</u>. <u>Rush</u> has not gotten
                    Home yet but is expected soon. John I will write as often as I can I have just
                    read a letter from George Fitch he told us all the particulars. I must make my
                    letter shorter as I want to write to Charlie &amp; some more of my friends.</p>
<p class="p10">John all send love to you, I havent time to write all the messages. Eslie says
                    she hopes all will soon be over &amp; you will be at Home with us again.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>John</u> my sincere prayer is for your safe return take
                    good care of yourself &amp; believe me <i>[illeg.]</i> your ever loving
                    smile soon</p>
