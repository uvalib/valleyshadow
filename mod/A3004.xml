                <p>The letter notes that Carson has written quite frequently to Annie, in contrast
                    to her recent protests. The letter also describes a recent clash with Union
                    cavalry at Culpepper and goes on to describe camp life near Montpelier, the old
                    home of James Madison.</p>

                <p>Your thrice welcome letter is to hand, &amp;; believe me, it was read with an
                    unusual degree of interest, it being the first I have received since my
                    departure. You have no idea how anxiously &amp;; how attentively I listened
                    to each mail as it was called over from day to day, to see if any letter had
                    come for me, but <orig reg="until">untill</orig> today was doomed to
                    disappointment.<lb/>You said in your letter you "had well nigh come to the
                    conclusion that I had forogtten any promise. Now I don't think you ought to
                    entertain such a thought for one moment. I have always endeavored to fulfill <hi
                        rend="underline">all</hi> my promises as far as possible, particularly in
                        <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">case</hi>. I wrote you immediately after my "skedadling"
                    from Yankeedom. I wrote you aldo from Banksville after our army fell back to
                    Martinsburg &amp; also on the march from the valley to this place, making in
                    all three letters <pb n="2"/>since I left, &amp; yet you think I have
                    forgotten my promise? But enough of that for the present.</p>
                <p>I have no news of importance to write you at present - everything is quiet at
                    this time. Longstreet &amp; Hill are camped near Culpepper. it was reported
                    in camp yesterday that they were falling back in the direction of this place.
                    there was a big cavalry fight at Culpepper last saturday between three brigades
                    of the yankees &amp; one of ours. The yankees also had some infantry. Our
                    men fell back slowly about four miles <orig reg="until">untill</orig> some of
                    our infantry went up to their assistance our men then drove <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">them</add> back. Our loss was about one hundred, that of the
                    enemy much greater. Our camp for the present is about 2 miles from Orange <del
                        hand="h1"/> &amp; within one mile of Montpelier the birth place <del
                        hand="h1"/> of James Madison. I have not paid the place a visit as yet,
                        <orig reg="owing">oweing</orig> to the fact that I have been quite unwell
                        <pb n="3"/>since our arrival at this camp, however I am happy to say that I
                    feel much better this evening. Frank <unclear>McCutchan</unclear> has been in
                    guard there for several days, keeping the soldiers from destroying things around
                    the house. There is an old fellow by the name of <unclear>Carson</unclear>
                    living there I think probably I can "ring in on that ticket." Our "fancy
                    officers" had quite a nice time the other night there; had a big Ball, plenty of
                    women &amp; other luxuries to numerous to mention. Was very sorry my rank
                    would not <unclear>provence</unclear> for me a bid, but guess it was best for me
                    as it was.</p>
                <p>You requested me to give you all the information I could in regard to John Meck
                    All I can learn is that he was left at our hospital in Gettysburg under the care
                    of Dr Sayers of our Brigade. Gade Plunket was left as a nurse - his company say
                    he was doing well when they left him - I deepy sympathize with the family.<pb
                        n="4"/>Well I presume you are getting tired of this uninteresting letter, so
                    I will close for the present, trusting that you will look over all mistakes, and
                    especially bad writing, as I am very much out of fit.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Yours as ever</salute>

                    <seg type="postscript">P.S. Give my love to Chris. Tell her I would like to see
                        her so much, have something very funny to tell her "about something" I heard
                        from your quarter. Please remember me affectionately to friend <del
                            hand="h1"/> &amp; Lady. Also to all the rest of the fair ones. Tell
                        Demaris I trust the <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> will soon be released
                        so that she may again have the pleasure of beholding his sweet face.<lb/>
                        NB. I trust you will do with this sheet as you requested me to do with
