<p class="p10">December 18<sup>th</sup> 1858</p>
<p class="p10">Waynesboro</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Dear
                        John
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 15<sup>th</sup> came to hand yesterday, and found me in a
                    sad fix for lifting our note. I saw (<u>Our Brother</u>!) D S
                    Bell today, and he permitted me to renew it, which was
                    a godsend indeed, for I never in <u>all</u> my life have been
                    so hard up. We are all in the habit of always complaining of hard times, but
                    without exaggeration I have never seen anything like it here. I have been
                    particularly unfortunate in obtaining means to meet the demands upon me. I have
                    not been able to get a Dollar from Imboden or Samuel
                    Steele, and my hope of the fund in Kinneys <i>[added: hands]</i> upon which I chiefly relied, were dashed by his giving a Deed to
                    his creditors a week since, thereby tying up this fund, and probably causing me
                    serious loss in the end. <i>[unclear: His]</i> official Bond is not regarded as
                    covering his receipts for any other year than 52 -- which does not embrace my
                    fund. I could not induce Baldwin to conclude a settlement with him, &amp; I
                    employed Imboden to prepare for <u>me</u> a notice for Kinney
                    during the last days of the court, which notice Brought the Deed.</p>
<p class="p10">After pretty heavy settlements on his wife in Lieu of Dowry, he next embraces all
                    his indebtedness as Receiver, the amount of which no
                    one seems to know. His assets are considerable, but whether they will cover his indebtedness as Receiver
                    I have no means of ascertaining. Imboden thinks I will lose considerably. But I
                    am rather disposed to think that I will some day come out. This affair has
                    caused a great deal of "squirming" about Staunton, &amp; it is thought that
                    a considerable amount of this fund will be found in hands that will find it
                    inconvenient to fork over.</p>
<p class="p10">Why have you not been over. I have looked for you for the last month. Your
                    Fathers treatment of you I think is outrageous, but entirely in Keeping with all I have ever known of him. The Almighty
                    Dollar is the power that governs all his actions. I am sorry that so serious a
                    rupture has occurred between you, but under the circumstances it was inevitable.</p>
<p class="p10">The most important &amp; funniest piece of news I have to communicate is that
                    our sister Elizabeth is <u>going</u> to marry Colonel Bell. As winter approaches her "rheumatism" increases, and she has come to the
                    conclusion that matrimony is the only remedy for her stiff Legs &amp; other
                    infirmities <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>and I have concluded that the wonders of the world will
                    never cease. Sarah, &amp; myself have had some hearty laughs over this
                    affair and wish you could be here to join us. I have not heard the particulars,
                    but have ascertained that it will certainly be during the next month.*</p>
<p class="p10">I am sorry you did not get over to see Meg. She is looking remarkable well, and
                    Prettier than in her younger days. her visit was not a very pleasant one to her, in consequence of the operation on her little
                    Boy, which gave her a great deal of anxiety
                    &amp; trouble. It was successful however, &amp; he goes home greatly
                    improved. Jno. Imboden has courted Miss M<u>c</u>Phail,
                    &amp; will marry her, I understand, early in March. He has been gone all
                    week on a visit to her. We are all about as usual and would like very much to
                    see you all come over soon. Sarah joins with me in much love to yourself
                    &amp; Liz. Write me soon and Believe me as ever</p>
<p class="p10">yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C. Alexander</i></p>
<p class="p10">I wish to hire a <u>cheap</u> hand for
                        next year would prefer a man some 45 or 50 years old, steady and trusty,
                        that would work without overseeing If you know of such a one write me.</p>
