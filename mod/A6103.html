<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I have been tossed to and fro, here and there, until I have lost all I had, and necessity
     compels me to ask you for money let the amount be great or small, I am on my own farm again,
     but I have no plow, no cow, hog, sheep or anything, but just the
     farm, and no person but Calvin to do anything on the farm, and you
     know he is young and an inexperience hand, but if I could get started to live again I think he
     can make a living. If you can possibly send me some money just what you can let me have, it
     will be doing me a great favor, for I never truly knew what it was to
     want before. Everything in the produce line is very high<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/Smiley73b.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/Smiley73b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      corn $8,00 per <i>[illeg.]</i> flour $8.00 per hundred potatoes
     $1.50 to $6.00 per bushel, bacon is cheaper now than it has been, it is rating from .14 to .16,
     cent per pound. I would like for you to write soon if you please, Remember me kindly to your family. I remain as ever </p>
