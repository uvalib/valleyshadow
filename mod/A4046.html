     property &amp; 3/4 of a ream 3 bundles of note paper, sell to Mr. Cowan 2 bundles, they are
     worth $20 each I suppose keep one, the broken one, for your own use, I owe Mr. Cowan some
     &amp; wish to pay him &amp; Dr. Young $10 -- that he paid for binding for me - pay him
     from the proceeds -- you can judge what is mine &amp; what public -- have all cared for -- <br>
     <u>1 Long box</u> of Maps and Drawing paper<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>have it taken care of
     --<br> 1 Mess Box and Contents -- One Comfort, in it, jars, tin &amp;c &amp;c<br> 1
     Stove Pipe<br> 1 Tent Fly }Have them put away --<br> 1 A Tent, new, }<br> 2 Knapsacks which

     you can use the tick I do not want it -- My jacket's in my carpet bag, you can use it for Allen
     -- <br> 1 Shade &amp; 1 pick --<br> If my bundle did not reach home before it will go by
     my wagon &amp; you will get that the -- driver will get it in Winchester -- I also send a
     bottle of <i>[unclear: Copperas]</i> -- a fine article -- I write to you about the indigo --
     You can send to Mrs. John Harman for it --. I have been so busy
     assorting &amp; fixing that I have not much <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Writing humor in me -- If you make me some shirts make them <u>"long tailed"</u> Write
     how the goods suit &amp; how much there is of them so I may know if it is necessary to buy
     more if opportunity offers -- We passed safely over the river, with but little loss -- less
     than we inflicted on the enemy that pursued -- and are now encamped near Darkesville &amp;
     Bunker's Hill -- the enemy's cavalry making some demonstrations near
     the river, all else quiet -- Our wagon train is so large as to impede greatly the movements of
     the army &amp; by reducing it we promote the efficiency of the army &amp; we are all
     ready to do any thing to promote that -- I hope you are all getting along <u>comfortably</u>, pleasantly I cannot expect, in the gloom of the present -- the seemingly
      thick<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>darkness that envelopes us -- but I do not despair in the least -- &amp;
     only look upon it as the darkness before the dawn -- looking for the Republic to come brightly
     out of all its tribulations -- it is no time to think of coming home, else I would apply for
     permission &amp; try &amp; come -- Wait in patience my Love, for the days of peace must
     come -- write to me often &amp; tell me if there is anything I can do to lighten the burden
     of your cares &amp; add to the comfort of my loved ones at home -- " O! had I the wings of
     a dove, how soon would I fly away &amp; come to you -- I have no news to write -- so be of
     good cheer -- heartily thank God for his many mercies &amp; implore the continuance of his
     favor -- My kisses for my dear children -- and love &amp; prayers for you all Write soon -- </p>
