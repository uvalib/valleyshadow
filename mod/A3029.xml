                <p> I embrace this my earliest opportunity of answering your <hi rend="underline"
                        >very</hi> welcome, &amp; interesting letter, which I received before
                    leaving Centerville - We left there on friday about 2 oclock &amp; arrived
                    at the Junction about <orig reg="sunset">sun set</orig> - We then <orig
                        reg="transferred">transfered</orig> our baggage to the cars &amp; took
                    the same for Strawsburg, where we arrived <unclear>Sun</unclear>day, <del
                        hand="h1"/> he D<del rend="none" hand="h1"/> was any thing else, but a pleasant one;
                    from the fact that we<pb n="2"/> were so much crowded. I for one lay on the top
                    of the cars &amp; slept, but was nearly frozen all the time. <orig
                        reg="Everything">Every thing</orig> passed off very agreeably, considering -
                    no accident occuring save one - &amp; that was truly sad. One of <abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Roberts men fell off the top of the cars
                    &amp; got nearly killed. he lived about 2 hours after they got him on the
                    train. He was an Irishman by the name of OBryan, the rest of the Irish belonging
                    to the company <unclear>after</unclear> we got to Strawsburg got as "tight" as
                    they could get. (This you know is part of their<pb n="3"/> religion, or their
                    rule at least - which they strictly adhere to) Well, I <orig reg="can't"
                    >cant</orig> say now, how long we will remain at this place or whether we will
                    go into winter quarters - this will depend entirely on the movements of the
                    enemy. It was reported before we left Centerville, that the <hi rend="underline"
                        >Yankees</hi> were advancing toward this place. That there was a number of
                    them in Martinsburg &amp; <unclear>Romney</unclear>. Also Shepards Town. But
                    this has turned out to be false; except at Romney. There are about 5000 at that
                    place &amp; are busily engaged fortifying.<pb n="4"/></p>
                <p>I am <hi rend="underline">glad</hi> to inform you that I am not as corpulent as
                    you heard, but still remain about the same - but not near so good looking as the
                    Gentleman you spoke of. Lieut M<hi rend="super">c</hi> says he <del hand="h1"
                        >would</del> certainly would like to kiss <hi rend="underline">that</hi>
                    lady &amp; you too. he sends his best love to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>
                    &amp; all the <unclear>girls</unclear>. Mr Miller has recovered. Says he was
                    in the same fix but you can return my <hi rend="underline">love</hi> good
                    wishes, &amp; To Maggie &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> tell them I would like to
                    see <hi rend="underline">them</hi> so much, also all the rest. Excuse this short
                    letter, nothing more at present but remain yours as ever</p>
