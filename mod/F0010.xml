                </opener>

                <p>Your letter of Oct 31st came safely to hand &amp; I was glad to hear that you
                    are all well. I am still in the enjoyment of good health. Yesterday morning it
                    commenced snowing &amp; continued until late at night making 3 or 4 inches
                    on snow on the ground. We lifted the floor of our tent &amp; built a fire so
                    had a comfortable time of it. This morning our <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg</abbr>
                    had orders to move about 2 miles the other side of Harrisburg on a hill to take
                    up winter quarters, but on account of the rough weather we will not go until
                    next week. I got your paper &amp; was pleased to read the news. Mr. Clutter
                    got here this morning &amp; <orig reg="brought">brot</orig> that jar of
                    ointment. The time is passing much more pleasantly since I am getting a letter
                    every week from you. The days do not appear so long &amp; lonesome. Your
                    letters carry my mind back home &amp; what you write of yourself Mary
                    &amp; the children doing I think I see you &amp; hear you do. I think I
                    can see the children carrying their walnuts down to the house &amp; Bell
                    laughing &amp; talking when they come in with them &amp; then looking
                    for the mail to come in the last of the week &amp; feel sure of a letter
                    from you is a pleasure which keeps the time from being long &amp; lonesome
                    on my hands. Tomorrow is the Sabbath &amp; I would like to keep it with you
                    in the peace &amp; quiet of our home instructing the children in the ways of
                    holiness but this duty comes to you &amp; my prayer is that God will give
                    you grace for the performance of it. The vows rest on us both &amp; I hope
                    to be spared to return to assist you &amp; uphold you in the performance of
                    all duties &amp; to enjoy myself again in the bosom of my family. I must go
                    on here in the performance of my duty &amp; leave the issue to the Disposer
                    of all events. I wrote in my last of a box to be sent to the West Finley boys.
                    You can send me what you think best but I would like to have some of your good
                    butter on hard crackers.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>No more at present but I remain your loving &amp; affectionate
                        husband</salute>

                    <seg type="postscript">Write my name on what your send me. My love to all the
                        children &amp; all friends<lb/> Kind sister Mary<lb/> Your letter came
                        with <orig reg="Cynthia's">Cynthias</orig> &amp; I was glad to know that
                        you were well. I have not heard from home since you left. I sent them a
                        letter by Tom Marshall. I thought it would be some time in getting to them
                        &amp; have not got an answer yet. For the present time there is no
                        change in my position. I would like to better it but all gifts come from the
                        hand of Him who knows what is best for us &amp; I will use all lawful
                        means &amp; leave all in the hands of the Disposer of all events, my
                        petition &amp; endeavor to say thy will be done. We have no particular
                        news other more than what I wrote to Cynthia. Your affectionate brother
                        <lb/> S.M. Potter</seg>
