        <sup>th</sup>
       </u> 1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you briefly the day we got here, to Morton Hall &amp; have heard form you twice
     since, so I must write a few lines again, though but 3 days since I
     wrote. You have heard before this that my butter came safely to hand &amp; very soon - I do
     not think it could hve stopped at Gordonsville Mr. R. must have been mistaken - we enjoy the
     butter much &amp; I hope Mr. R. will continue his good offices in our behalf &amp; get
     us some more for you to keep till this is gone, also some nice dried apples or peaches -- Up to
     the 7<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> you do not speak of getting the $40. I sent you by Mrs. Wise. I am very fearful your
     exhaustive labors have been too much for you -- I was in hopes you would have had Richard to
     aid you by this time -- I did not think your company would stay so long
     -- I am glad Allie has got a good place in Staunton, but am sorry, truly sorry, her fond dream
     of happiness has been dashed to the ground -- but perhaps it is all for the best God grant it
     may be. I hope she will be benefitted by the surgeon of the Blind Institution -- She must not task her eyes to teach -- if she finds her eyes too weak she
     must not teach -- I do not wish her to --. Do not try to do so much My Dear -- I shall get you
     a woman at Christmas -- I hope Richard intends to come up - it is about the time when he would
     come up to see you. Does Mr. Walker go to the army this winter? Lt. Smith intends to become a
     chaplain next year -- he intends to leave us about the 1<u>
      <sup>st</sup>
     </u> of Dec. I suppose we shall have another fight here -- Gen. Lee is full of it, to wipe out
     the advantage Meade has gained &amp; teach <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>him a lesson -- O that we may gain a
     substantial victory here yet this year -- I hope the forces sent may check Averill -- of course
     they will do all they can to make diversions in favor of Meade -- but I think we have force
     enough for any emergency that may occur. I thought I would have a chance before this to send
     you some more money -- &amp; I shall soon find a chance then you can pay James Henry the
     Butcher claims -- &amp;c &amp;c -- I want to pay up as many of his claims as I can --
     &amp; get square with my account. It has turned quite cold - and threatens snow -- We are
     in a house &amp; do very well, but it sets quite hard on the soldiers. I cannot spare Lt.
     Koemer any heavy paper as I want what I have -- I think - if I have any to spare when I come at
     Christmas he shall have it. Get my pants made if you can - - I shall need them when winter sets
     in. I am truly grateful to our neighbors for their kindness to you &amp; hope I may have it
     in my power to repay them -- the enemy is on one side of the Rapidan &amp; we on the other
     -- most of them are encamped near Brandy - Good night -- my love to all &amp; kisses
     &amp; may our Heavenly Father bless &amp; keep you is the prayer of </p>
<p class="p10">your devoted husband</p>
