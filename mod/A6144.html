<p class="p10">Dear and affectionate wife,</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this morning to try and answer your welcome letter that I 
 just received a few minutes ago.  I had been looking for it some day past, 
 but it did not come to hand until this morning.  It found me in good 
 health and I was glad to hear from you and all was receiving the same 
 blessing of health but I feel somewhat vexed since I read your letter to 
 think of some things that is about reenlisting.  I have not reenlisted nor 
 do I ever intend to under the present circumstances.  If I have to stay in 
 service you can mark Jesse one that has not re-enlisted if you believe 
 what I write unless my mind changes very much from what it is now and what 
 it has been for some time past.  Accordance with the late law that has 
 been <i>[illeg.]</i> for some time-between the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> ages of 18 and 45 
 will have to be in service for the war.  It makes no difference whether I 
 want to or not unless they can get a detail of some kind <i>[illeg.]</i> any 
 honorable detail that I can get, for I don't think 
 that duty would be any harder than it was on me.  So if you have a chance 
 you need not be uneasy but what I will except of it <i>[illeg.]</i> so I hope 
 that you may meet with success in what you have 
 undertaken and I hope that this will satisfy you about re-enlisting and it 
 may give you comfort and happiness to you, it don't do for a person to believe all they hear nowadays. 
 Furloughing is still a going on.  There is two ahead 
 of mine yet so I am still in hopes of getting one before long, we can have 
 the pleasure of talking in place of writing it.  it would give me so much 
 more comfort.  I have not heard anything about 
 giving up in Virginia.  It may be so, but I don't 
 believe that they are going to do it, for I think if they give up Virginia 
 this cruel war will be over soon.  I don't know what will be best for to do if John leaves. 
 If you can [get] someone to crop it would be 
 less trouble to you and if I should be so lucky as to get off-I would 
 rather do it myself, so i leave that with you to decide.  I judge there is 
 no chance of hiring anyone to work with any 
 certainty.  As they take what little you do raise - it won't pay you for to pay a big price for hiring.  How 
 old is John and how long can he stay before he would have to go in 
 service?  Does he want to go?  There is some boys that goes in service 
 sooner than they need, but I don't know how it is 
 with him.  If you have a chance and can if you would move some of your 
 corn out of the crib someplace else.  They would not bother you so much. 
 It is right in the way.  it shows too plain.  Try to keep enough to do 
 you.  If you can hide it.  Don't think it will be 
 any harm in doing so.  So must come to a close -</p>
