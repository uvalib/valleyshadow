<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to Rosenbery,
                    John Abraham (father) and probably Mary Jane Snider (Franklin's stepmother),
                    October 16, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Writing from a Philadelphia hospital, Rosenbery discusses his possibilities for a
                    discharge or a furlough (he hopes in time for the presidential election) and his
                    imminent transfer to work in the Printing Office. As in earlier letters, he
                    requests his repaired watch from home.</p>

<p class="p10">October 16, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">West Philadelphia<br> Satterlee Hospital Ward 0</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father and Stepmother.</p>
<p class="p10">With shame I must confess that I have been very negligent in my correspondence...Heretofore. But I will make an
                        apology in this wise, living on the expectation
                    of getting to the State Election, but it was promise and no performance and
                    another reason was this-that when
                    Stepmother wrote I had no paper to write nor no
                    money to get paper.</p>
<p class="p10">I would have liked to accommodated
                    Stepmother very much in buying the things that
                    she requested me in her letter but counting the price and expressage and the
                    risk of getting the things lost, I thought it president to send the money.</p>
<p class="p10">As I think by counting all, that it will be fully as cheap to get things at home.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope that you will forgive me for being so negligent by way of writing.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father. I, being so often deceived about getting
                    home, I shall make no rash promises when I get home. Tomorrow I expect to be
                    transferred into the Printing Office. I shall never be able to do Field Service.
                    It may be that I will get my discharge this winter. I cannot tell but my 16
                    dollars per month here this winter is more than I could make at home. Then I
                    will have a warm place to stay and not much to do.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father-I would like if you would express my watch to this hospital. As there
                    is a express office here it will not cost much to express it and I think that it
                    will come with perfect safety.</p>
<p class="p10">I cannot tell when I will get a furlough to come home. It may be I will get a furlough
                    some time this winter.</p>
<p class="p10">The talk is that we will all get home to the Presidential Election but that was
                    the talk that we would get home to the State Election but it was in vain.</p>
<p class="p10">In this letter I enclose you 20 dollars-you will see that my family is cared for.
                    In my next letter I will send you some more money. Let me know as soon as you
                    get this money so that I will not be uneasy in it getting lost.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard from Brother Abraham and Ashway for some time. I am hoping that these few lines may find
                    you all well. Write soon. You will soon hear from me again.</p>
<p class="p10">Your son till death--</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery<br> Satterlee Hospital Ward 0<br> West
                        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</i></p>
<p class="p10">Give my respect to all.<br> Send my watch as soon as you can.<br>
                        Franklin Rosenbery</p>
