                <p>John Z. H. Rawlings describes a recent trip to Staunton in this letter to
                    Alexander Brown, a fellow student at the University of Virginia. During his
                    visit, Rawlings accidentally jumped out of a window at a party and injured his
                    leg. In addition to staying at the Cochran residence, Rawlings spent time at
                    Variety Springs with a hotel keeper he calls Mr. Burrell but who appears in the
                    Census as Charles Burress. Rawlings closes his letter by commanding his friend
                    to attend the Democratic Convention.</p>

                <p>As I am confined to the house all the time, except before breakfast and after
                    sundown, by <abbr expan="Doctors">Drs</abbr> Davis &amp; Randolph, I'll
                    occupy myself in writing to you.</p>

                <p>I went over to <orig reg="Staunton">Stanton</orig> soon after you left here, and
                    stayed with Mr Burrell a while, riding about in Augusta, we<del hand="h1"
                    >s</del> stayed at Mr Jimmy Cochran's where George was <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">1 night</add>, there was a crowd of Girls there playing on
                    the piano, right up by the door; I was by the window, and wanted to get <orig
                        reg="outdoors">out doors</orig> where the men w<del hand="h1">as</del><add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">ere</add>, without going by the girls, I thought we
                    were on the first floor, so I jumped out of the window, but when I got to the
                    ground I found out I had jumped two stories and <pb n="2"/> hurt my leg so I
                    could hardly walk. I went to another party, at Mr. Christians', where they
                    played Blind-Billy-Buff and blindfolded me most every time. I went to Variety
                    Springs where I saw <del hand="h1">M</del> a lady looked like Miss Polly
                    Goodman's grandmother.</p>

                <p>I stayed about three weeks in and about Staunton, when my health grew so bad that
                    I had to come home and put myself under the <orig reg="doctors'">Doctors</orig>
                    charge.</p>

                <p>I have to bathe my feet in some sort of acid every night; it is so strong that I
                    got a little on my finder the other day and it has ate all the skin off</p>

                <p>I have to take medicine three times a day. Billy Abell has gone to Dubique, Iowa.
                    Frank Meade has gone to Clarke and there <orig reg="ain't">aint</orig> but four
                    boys in town Malcolm, Jimmy Davis, Jimmy Rawlings, and Otho Reyne.</p>

                <p>Ten of the old boys and the two Slinks are going to Berkley.</p>
