<p class="p10">My Dear --</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday we had a terrific battle from 4 AM to 3 P. M. the
     hardest of the war the enemy under cover of a dense fog came in our line at 4 AM &amp;
     broke it &amp; captured 20 pieces of Artillery -- we drove them
     back &amp; fought them all day -- repulsed every attack &amp; are still masters of our
     position -- We lost heavily in Killed wounded &amp; prisoners but are still in good
     condition &amp; they have done the best they could -- two of the Bell boys were killed --
     Gen. Wilkes had his arm broken &amp; Gen. Johnson was captured -- the result of the dense
     fog which<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>covered the first attack of at least 30000 men on
     one point -- we gained every advantage after that &amp; have great cause for gratitude as Grant threw his whole force upon our corps -- We drove them away
     &amp; a mile from our right -- Grant tried to break our center. It rained nearly all day
     but the fight was continued -- One of Rodes' staff &amp; one of Early's was killed -- Mrs.
     Wise's son was well last night -- I came by his battery after the fight -- <i>[unclear: I
     am]</i> well <i>[illeg.]</i> haste </p>
