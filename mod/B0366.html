<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">November 7th 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Meechum's River River,</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I hereby certify that Robert White, and <i>[unclear: Derinda]</i> Catherine
                    White, have this day appeared before me, and at their joint request, I make the
                    following statement.</p>
<p class="p10">1st That they mutually desire to abandon the relations they have hitherto borne
                    towards each other, as man and wife.</p>
<p class="p10">2nd That whilst they were never married according to the forms of law, yet they
                    wish to protest, that they were lawfully (in a moral sense) man and wife;
                    having, at the date of their union, followed the set forms of marriage usual
                    among their class.</p>
<p class="p10">3rd That each one has no charge to bring against the other as to any acts
                    heretofore committed by either, but desire to part, only to secure the mutual
                    benefit of both.</p>
<p class="p10">4th They desire this separation to be ratified, or consented to, by the legally
                    constituted authorities, and at the same time, that proper settlement be made of
                    any differences as to accounts, which may exist between them.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Wm J. Points, Regimental Officer</i></p>
<p class="p10"><u>Addendum</u> - 5th These two
                        parties have mutually agreed that there is no pecuniary or money claim
                        pending between them.<br>Wm J. Points, Regimental Officer</p>
