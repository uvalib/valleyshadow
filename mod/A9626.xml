                </opener>

                <p>I have been promising you a letter for more than a <hi rend="underline"
                    >fortnight</hi>, but have neglected writing until this late period, though
                    doubtless it will be quite unexpected to you even now as it is almost entirely
                    unwonted for <add hand="h1" place="inline">those</add> at home to introduce a
                    correspondence with an absent friend; but you know as hard times increase, all
                    precedent customs as well as general formality diminishes &amp; as I deem my
                    "own <hi rend="underline">dear self</hi>" a miss of self-competence sufficient
                    to be governed by momentary impulses I will preface a fashion which I anticipate
                    will remain unimitated <pb n="2"/>though hope not depreciated, if it be a breach
                    of former civility or etiquette if you please. Well, Kate I scarcely know what
                    to communicate first; as I am aware you hear <hi rend="underline">directly</hi>
                    from the neighborhood <del hand="h1">that</del> so frequently that you receive
                    the news almost as early as myself; suppose from what I have learned that your
                    fruition has been dazzling in the zenith of its magnificence during your visit
                    up to the present time; &amp; presume it will not cease to continue as long
                    as parties, are the fashion &amp; Valley Rangers, with plenty of "Tobacco"
                    are the Chorus in your "<hi rend="underline">Town</hi>"; <hi rend="underline"
                    >Oh</hi>! I have a great desire to hear from you. There has no material cha<add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">n</add>ge occurred within the limits of our
                    vicinity since you left us, we still experience the alternations of joys
                    &amp; <orig reg="griefs">greifs</orig> which we have been accustomed to
                    almost daily since the war commenced; we, in accordance <pb n="3"/>with the
                    dictates of the Sacred writings rejoice in time of victory &amp; grieve when
                    conquered. Suppose you <add hand="h1" place="inline">have</add> heard the
                    particulars attending our friend John Lightner's sickness &amp; death; he
                    died wishing us all to meet him in heaven, which should be our unwearied
                    endeavor &amp; consequently our final end. You had my heart-felt sympathy
                    upon hearing the melancholy news; but this Providence like theirs should be
                    weighed with the balance of humiliation, as the loss of one is the gain of
                    another.</p>

                <p>Fast Day was generally observed in the neighborhood, preaching at St. Johns
                    &amp; Bethel but none in Greenville or at Calvary. I met with your sister
                    Lizzie, &amp; Jacob at St. Js. that day, we all thought Mr Crawford did
                    admirably on the occasion; but I believe some had the presumption to say it was
                    nothing but a perfect abolition sermon; so much for diversity of opinion.
                    Captain Newton came home yesterday, suppose he has reenlisted, your brother <pb
                        n="4"/>John has recovered from the mumps I believe. From what I can learn
                    the defeats which our forces were compelled to experience have not discouraged
                    our men; as the spirit of reenlisting is <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                    >still</add> prevailing to a great extent. Well Kate, as my last page is
                    generally appropriated to messages of others which are sometimes prerequisite to
                    a conclusion, I <del hand="h1">will</del> now give place. Sister Lizzie with
                    Miss Evaline are spending the day with us; Miss Evaline sends her love,
                    &amp; says take great care of <hi rend="underline">Moses in the
                    bulrushes</hi>; sister Sue says to captivate <hi rend="underline">him</hi>
                    thoroughly bring <hi rend="underline">him</hi> up with you, &amp; make a
                    great big wedding for she is almost sick to be at <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >a</add> wedding; just such a one as you &amp; <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">Moses</add> the brother to Jesse would make. Sister Mary
                    sends love &amp; wishes you much success in the <hi rend="underline"
                        >beau-line</hi> she says tell you that she is afraid the South will be
                    subjugated since- "The man who did his country save, Lies cold and silent in his
                    grave."</p>

                <p>Mother says tell you Rockingham is the place "for the right sort" so dive down,
                    make a sure grab, &amp; bring up by the locks a most precious Pearl one of
                    dazzling splendor &amp; none to equal.</p>

                <p>Sue &amp; <unclear>Mag</unclear> join me in love. Please excuse all
                    imperfections &amp; honor me with <hi rend="underline">a response very soon
