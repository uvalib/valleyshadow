<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">Your came to hand this evening and the contents were noticed very closely. I
                    suppose Green &amp; his darling will go down to Strasburg to live I wish him
                    a happy time Mollie I will most certainly comply with your request that of not
                    answering <i>[deleted: your]</i> her letter, I am not anxious to answer her
                    letter if I get one from you. I must differ with you about
                    <i>[unclear: Lollie]</i> thinking anything of me I
                        am<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> sure she does not but we will soon see. I know you had a nice
                    time out at W.G. you could not help it for I know it is a nice place to visit, I
                    think <i>[unclear: Pet]</i> has abandoned the thought of writing to me or is
                    too much taken with <i>[unclear: Dr]</i> so <i>[unclear: he]</i> can't find
                    any time you would like me home saturday. I may be there and if I had money
                    enough I think I would come sooner. I am sure Ma will let us come and if she
                    does look for us on Saturday. you must write Wednesday night and get her to add
                    a note and the money for us to come home, use your
                    influence for us once try and persuade her to let us come don't forget to write at the time above mentioned whether we come or not for we don't want to
                    start on friday until we get <i>[deleted: an]</i>
                    <i>[added: 
                        definite
                    ]</i> answer,</p>
