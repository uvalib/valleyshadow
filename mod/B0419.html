<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, July 3, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson recounts the story of Patience Spencer, whose children were taken by a
                    slave trader in 1861. According to Jackson, she desperately wants to find them,
                    and he forwards what few details he has in the hopes of locating them.</p>

<p class="p10">Patience Spencer (colored) seeks her two children James
                    Thomas (15 years) and Melissa Ann Maria Spencer (11 years) The children were
                    taken from her at Samuel Spencer's 5 miles from Amherst Court House Amherst County
                    Virginia by John Mitchell a slave trader who then lived
                    at Lynchburg and who sold them at Richmond, Virginia in
                    July 1861. Who bought them or where they were taken to she never could learn,
                    but thinks perhaps John Mitchell or Landon Talieferro who lives at New Glasgow,
                    Amherst County
                    Virginia may know. The poor woman it appears hid herself
                    in the woods with her children to escape the sale but hunger compelled her to
                    let her children return to the house for food, when they were seized and carried
                    off. Her information is I fear too indefinite for discovery but she <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>she is so earnestly desirous of regaining them that I respectfully forward her
                    request in the hope some clue may be obtained from Mitchell or Talieferro.</p>
