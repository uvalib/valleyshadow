<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I I Drop you a few lines to let you know how we are getting along I have no Doubt you have already heard of the Battle we had Down here we had quite a lively
                    time of I can tell you The Enemy have A largely
                    superior force to ours some times During the fight They
                    had at least 5 To one against us nothing but The providence of God saved us our
                    loss in killed and wounded will from what I can learn Reach from 15 hundred To
                    Two Thousand our killed
                    probably will Reach 4 or 5 hundred The enemy's loss is frightful They have been Burying
                        theirevery Day since The fight and They <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> A great many laying on The Bloody field yet
                    and <i>[added: in]</i> Their flight they Even tore one another to Death. The panic
                    was such that <i>[added: They]</i> could not carry off any of Their splendid Equipments. They all fell
                    into our hands. we captured about sixty splendid cannon
                    and ammunition Enough to last through an active
                    campaign Their Rout was complete They left wagons and everything and Traveled off as fast as Their legs could carry them
                    Our cavalry pursuing them for fifteen miles and
                    only left off pursuing When tired of slaughter Their Dead men laying in heaps on
                    the field of Battle - it will certainly Teach Them A lesson That <i>[added: They]</i> will not soon forget: They cannot Trample upon us
                    with impunity</p>
