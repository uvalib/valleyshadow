<p class="p10">Aug 11th 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Mollie</p>
<p class="p10">Your dear and welcome letter of the 6th came safely to hand and was read with
                    much pleasure I was Very sorry to disappoint you last
                    Saturday but you were not more disappointed than
                    myself I won't disappoint you
                    next Saturday if I live I will come. Dr. Arthur will come with me. Magnus and
                    Ella will start Sunday Morning for Augusta Springs they want us to meet them
                        there I told them we would meet them there Early in the morning. They want to get there
                    about Eight o'clock and I
                    would like <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to get there at the same hour.</p>
<p class="p10">That is if you have no other engagement that will
                    prevent you from going which I hope you have not we will all have a nice time
                    and enjoy our selves much better at the Springs than we would at camp meeting. I was somewhat Surprised when
                    I read your letter to find that Mr Pemberton had made arrangement to take you to camp meeting
                    he ought to have Known that you would not have gone with him. I told Ella about it you ought to have heard what she said I can't tell you what she did say but it
                    was not very complementary to Mr Pemberton. The
                    Idea of Jimie Pemberton wanting to take you anywhere
                    I never heard of such impertinence in my life</p>
<p class="p10">Magnus said he would liked to have seen him Escorting you
                    round at the Spring. I told him that he would never see him as your Escort at
                    the Spring or any place Else. My love I love you with all the devotedness of my
                    heart &amp; soul I know no other love than yours as
                    long as I live no other love could give me so much happiness as your precious
                    love. I Saw your friend Mr Estell in our city last week he was looking well and
                    as Spry as Ever. Ella &amp; family are all well Send love to you all I send
                    love to your Ma &amp; Pa Hamie &amp; all my friends in MountMnt Solon I hope you will get to pay <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Staunton a
                    visit before you move but I don't think you will get here until you move. I
                    send a loving Kiss to you and all the love of my heart. I will be down Saturday
                    if I live</p>
<p class="p10">I love you with all my heart &amp; Soul God Bless you Goodbye</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
