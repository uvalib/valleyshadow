<p class="p10">Camp Tip Top, Pocohontas County, VA </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir </p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to write a few lines to inform you how we are getting
                    along we had rather serious times here a few days past on the llth a squad of
                    our men went down to Greenbriar river on scout camped near the river that night
                    next morning they seen about 17 Yankees coming down the river our men ambushed
                    until they come within shot of them fired on them killed about seven of them the
                    rest run one run behind a tree and commenced firing a pistol at our men he was
                    commanded to surrender by Major Ross he would not Major ordered our men to
                    charge on him he undertook to run when Lieutenant Woodel fired and killed him no
                    sooner had he fired when he spied about one thousand Yankees coming double quick
                    after them our men had to take up the mountain through the brushes the Yankees
                    fired after our men but hurt no one our men all reached camp safe that evening
                    on the 13th - a big day here -Yankees fired on our pickets about - o'clock we
                    were . . .</p>
<p class="p10">[Six lines of page torn from bottom of page.]</p>
<p class="p10">. . . line of battle marched round side of the hill and returned the fire they
                    fought about half an hour there until the Yankees fell back in the woods our men
                    then retreated back in order to get the Yankees out of the woods they come out
                    around above our men some in the field and some in the woods our men drove them
                    back again &amp; took after them and made them retreat doublequick the way
                    they come the 12th Georgia 31st regiment and two battalions were in this fight
                    the fight lasted about one hour and a half our men fought manfully the Yankees
                    had the advantage in this fight had the upper side of the hill we had less men
                    and whipped them out About the time this fight was nearly over About two
                    thousand come up the greenbank road next to our fortifications Some come within
                    20 yards of us in the brush and timber that had been chopped down and fired on
                    us about this time Captain <i>[unclear: Andes]</i> rode round there and was
                    killed he was cheering us up I suppose the Yankees did not know that we had
                    fortifications there else they would not have come so close they were very bold
                    our men commenced firing on the Yankees the Yankees got behind old brush and
                    logs stumps so our men had no - - - good chance on them when they would stick
                    their heads - - - and up to fire . . .</p>
<p class="p10">[Six lines of page torn from bottom of page.]</p>
<p class="p10">. . . Captain Miller fired his Artillery in the first fight a few times which
                    made the Yankees scatter considerably he did not fire very often he did not have
                    a chance the enemy being mostly in the woods he fired on some cavalry that were
                    coming up the Greenbriar river railroad which done considerable execution which
                    made them retreat after that awhile another body of men and an ambulance come up
                    the Greenbriar road he fired on them made them scatter then they raised a white
                    flag and he ceased firing on them they were coming after their dead and wounded
                    they took all their dead and wounded they could with them and hid a good many
                    about in the woods during this time the Yankees were firing on us in the
                    fortifications he threw some balls and some grape amongst them they commenced
                    retreating then pretty soon they doublequicked it back the way they came Miller
                    than threw some shell after them which made them scamper like the plague the
                    fight lasted about five hours in the entrenchment and the fight on the hill in
                    the field and woods about one hour and a half the Yankees had no artillery with
                    them none in our Company was hurt two out of our regiment were wounded they were
                    on picket one man by the name of Welch was shot through the leg he had it taken
                    off above the knee the others name is Baskins shot through the thigh and a man
                    by the name of Abel has been missing they think he was taken prisoner none in
                    the trenches were killed one Georgian was wounded on the cheek but not very bad
                    they come in the trenches after the first fight was over about seventy of the
                    men in the first open field fight were missing killed and wounded our men took
                    three or four prisoners in the first fight and it is supposed that the Yankees
                    got a couple of our men as to how many Yankees were killed is a hard matter to
                    tell as they hauled a great many off our men buried about thirty Yankees and
                    still finding them about in the woods it is thought about double the number of
                    Yankees were killed then of our men four of Captain Millers Artillery were
                    wounded and one killed the Yankees could get range on his cannon when he fired
                    on them at the trenches with their long ranged guns five or six struck the
                    cannon this is all I know about the fight I believe Jacob Harvey is tolerable
                    smart. we had beautiful weather here for about a week I heard that Mother was
                    complaining again tell her not to be uneasy about me I am well and fare very
                    well we expect to leave here pretty soon we had orders to pack up our extra
                    baggage and they have hauled nearly all the flour away from here where we will
                    go I cant tell we expect to come in towards Staunton Nothing more at present but
                    remain your affectionate Brother </p>
