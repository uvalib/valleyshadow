<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Simon
                    Cameron, April 1x, 18xx<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure gives Cameron the lay of the political landscape on the formation of the
                    Republican party committee.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 15</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear General</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor is at <i>[unclear: law]</i>, Like you I am amazed at the
                        <i>[unclear: emlarassments thenn afar]</i> us in the formation of the
                    committee. It is unaccountable indeed that men, so far forget themselves as to
                        <i>[unclear: initiative]</i> for places on the Committee, &amp; it is
                    scarcely <i>[unclear: re-conceivable]</i> with a proper sense of duty to the
                    party.</p>
<p class="p10">I am fully satisfied that<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>two mistakes have been made--first in not
                        <i>[unclear: passing]</i> the committee at once, and record as Jno
                    &amp; Carter not first saying to Pollack make a fair &amp; proper
                    committee to <i>[unclear: smt]</i> the interests &amp; the <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    of the party, But it is too late for that now, and you will both be consumed
                    most unjustly in any event. I am willing to take any any responsibility in the
                    matter that is proper,</p>
<p class="p10">I do not know that Mann desires to be on the Committee; but looking solely to the
                    harmony of action in this State, I thought it a<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>matter of <i>[deleted: ]</i> to put him on at least I feared that his omission would be
                    charged to you, and upon you the state of his retaliation would fall, I hope
                    still that he will be added; and I would <u>add</u> Slocum
                    &amp; let the two Lancaster <u>Editors</u> remain as one
                    cannot be taken &amp; the other left. </p>
<p class="p10">What I have recently feared is an inharmonious committee, and I could not take
                    charge of the campaign with such. Whatever <i>[unclear: men]</i> are committed,
                    no matter upon whom the responsibility <u>should</u> fall, it
                    always falls squarely upon the Chairman; and no man<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>can live long
                    enough to survive the suspicion of losing this election by bad management.</p>
<p class="p10">Things look well. The 4th district of Philadelphia
                    <i>[unclear: suits]</i> you exactly. and I judge that the 5th is also right,
                    though the telegraph goes to their second choice, Pennsylvania must have no second choice until the Convention demands it of
                    the <i>[unclear: would]</i> accomplish anything.</p>
<p class="p10">I can be in Washington but not, I think, until after the Philadelphia Election I will go there about the 18th or
                    20 &amp; remain until it is <i>[unclear: over]</i> After that I can be with
                    you at any time &amp; place, Command me.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alexander KMcClure </i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable
                            Simon Cameron
                    </p>
