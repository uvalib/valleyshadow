<p class="p10">February the 12th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Port Royal Carolina CountyVirginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear companion</p>
<p class="p10">i seat myself to inform you that i am well at present and hope that this may find you enjoying the same
     blessing that god has bestowed upon me. i had a few days ago a pain in the small of my back
     that i could scarcely get up when i was down but i have got about well again. i have not much news to write of importance but i will scratch some down at a venture. the
     majority of the people down this way from what they can learn they
     say there is great prospect of peace and some say that there will be peace before the first day of may but for my part i dont
     think that peace will be so soon as that. if it only would prove to be
     so i should be very glad. o i don't know how i
     should feel if peace would be so we all could go home and get shut of this war but i still live in hopes that i may return home and find you and all
     in good spirits and in health. don't
     forget to keep the stock out of the orchard this spring if you can.
     that will be the dependent for hay next summer. the new ground field
     if kept up would make a right smart hay too but it will be hard to keep
     the things out. the fence is bad. write how the feed will hold out thinks you and grain whether the corn will keep the hogs. pick out your seed corn
      before it get too scarce. i started a
     letter last sunday to you by mail. the weather is very pretty
     here now-has been for several days. try and get some person to help John to sowthe
     cloverseed that understand it so they can show him how to do it. a half a bushel will be enough
     on each field if the timothy ain't
     frozen out since i left home. </p>
<p class="p10">no more at present but remain your
      affectionate husband until
      separated by death.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jesse Rolston</i></p>
<p class="p10">don't
      forget to write<br>
      I shall try and send as many as you Mary C.
       Rolston
     </p>
