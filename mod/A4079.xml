    <p>I wrote you a few lines day before yesterday, immediately after our desperate battle
     &amp; hope they reached you -- we have not had any fight since then -- only a little
     skirmishing -- the enemy has fallen back from our left &amp; we drove him back on our
     right, he is still lying between us &amp; the river -- not daring to attack &amp;
     unwilling to retreat -- his losses have been great -- as we find many dead in the lines he has
     abandoned -- many more than we have lost -- Our loss has been far less than at Chancellorsville
     -- 3500 it is thought will cover all our losses since we started, &amp; we have captured
     some 4500 of the enemy -- saying nothing about the killed &amp; wounded -- the Yankee
     papers say <orig reg="they">the</orig> lost 20000 in the first fight -- if so they have lost
     50000 in all -- too large an estimate I suppose, but not much, for they made 8 or 10 attacks
     upon our breastworks, where our men were defended &amp; protected &amp; were repulsed
     with terrible slaughter we are cheered today by the news from the Valley -- but saddened,
     deeply saddened by the death of Gen. J. E. Stuart -- one of the noblest spirits in the
     Confederacy -- peace to his ashes, his memory is embalmed in the hearts of his countrymen --
     for he has done noble service for us -- he has gone to join our noble army of sainted heroes
     above, Jackson, Ashby &amp; hundred upon hundreds more -- Heaven console his wife &amp;
     defend her &amp; his babes -- how little I thought I witnessed their last farewell when I
     saw them part at Orange <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr> the day I first came back to
     camp. Gen. Daniels has died too, a noble North Carolinian -- Heaven has<pb n="2"/>been merciful
     to us in enabling us to keep back the past that came like an army of locusts, but what a
     sacrifice have we made to propitiate the favor -- I suppose we shall have to fight Grant again
     &amp; perhaps not far from here, but I have an abiding confidence in our ability to cope
     with him, by Divine assistance, -- his army has become demoralized by his repeated &amp;
     unsuccessful attacks, though he gained some temporary advantages &amp; took considerable
     artillery from us -- yet his men know that he has made no advance towards conquering our army
     &amp; that he has made no progress towards Richmond -- the time of many of them is out
     &amp; they are going home -- the larger portion of his veterans has been destroyed or
     captured --</p>
    <p> May 16<hi rend="super">th</hi> All quiet still this morning -- we are in the same position,
     the enemy has gone towards Fredericksburg -- we have had heavy rains every day &amp; it is
     very muddy -- I have no time to write more -- Love &amp; Kisses for you all &amp; may
     Heaven bless you -- Write often -- </p>
