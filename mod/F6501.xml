    <p>Dear daughter and friend your letter of Friday evening came to hand on yesterday evening and
     we were pleased to hear from you, and that you were all well. Lizzie also received a letter
     from David by the Same mail-the trials you have been experiencing this week were not altogether
     unknown to us. I had Seen and Spoken with Henry Strickler on his way home-from what he told me
     I thought it would cause you Some trouble,-when I look to myself I need not wonder at you or
     Amos to feel as <orig reg="though">tho</orig> a heavy burden was laid upon you-, viz Amos as
      <orig reg="though">tho</orig> the Care of Souls was required of him, or at his hands-with you
     it will appear as <orig reg="though">tho</orig> you Should have many lonely hours-perhaps days
     and nights to Spend <pb n="2"/>as the harvest is great and the <orig reg="faithful">faithfull</orig>
     <orig reg="laborers">labourers</orig> are few,-when we ponder over all these things and reason
     with ourselves, or with flesh and blood it Seems to be hard, and to the natural mind it is
     truly hard, when we consider the wages the true followers and Shepherds of Christs little flock
     have received through all times in this present life- When we read the history of Jonah-of
     Jeremiah-of Moses and many others of Gods messengers we can easily perceive that things all
     time, as at the present the faithful watchman on the walls of Jerusalem had but little glory to
     expect from the world-but my dear daughter and friend-when we look upon the other Side and view
     the promises held to those who are faithfull here in these Smaller matters-we Should console
     ourselves-for great Shall be their reward in heaven-that kind <pb n="3"/>Providence who tempers
     the winds to the <orig reg="Shorn">Showrn</orig> lamb and who provides for the young raven will
     also truly provide for his people-his chosen flock if we can but be resigned to his will
     &amp; have no choice of our own and could Say with Samuel Lord here am I. I trust when you
     look a round, you can See many that have troubles and trials also, and with which you would not
     like to exchange the Prophet in Speaking of these things Says our life here is Short and full
     of trouble. We are promised nothing else-a life of trial and Probation is the christians lot
     while here-I do not however wish to make the dark Side more dark to you. I would like to
     encourage you if I can and to look more to the bright Side-we are So apt to draw the picture
     too gloomy when we are or feel ourselves <orig reg="oppressed">oppresed</orig>-I could not help
     on <pb n="4"/>drawing Some Comparisons after reading your affectionate letter, on Friday last I
     was in town I saw A. Stouffer Stand in front of the Franklin Hotel preaching with all the
     powers of his lungs to the busy world and all who felt curiosity enough to Stop and listen-on
     Saturday I met him-he Said he was Six weeks from home-he was needed badly at home- Some of his
     children had dipthirea-but Said he I am needed worse out to preach-S.P. his brother is drafted
     and is on the Camp ground-the use he has made of his precious time thus far I think will not
     afford him money or friends to avoid it. how many Wives are there through our land who Spend
     hours and nights of watching for their husbands to come home-<orig reg="perhaps"
     >perhapse</orig> drunken-Cross and abusive-these are <unclear>Shared</unclear> Cases-in many as
     with Abraham it is a taken as a blessing when the husband is absent</p>

    <p>Monday Nov 3.</p>

    <p>As regards us we are tolerably well I have not been well myself for Some days-had Something
     of the Cholera Morbus-and do not feel right yet but am Still about-<unclear>Annie</unclear> we
     think is <orig reg="improving">improveing</orig> Some Slowly. Very Slowly-the rest are well we
     had preaching at our School house yesterday <orig reg="afternoon">after noon</orig> Jacob
     Lehman preached-I suppose you know that he is Confirmed in his Calling-remember us in your
     prayers that the Lord may enable us to hold out faithful to the end that we may be Strengthened
     from Above to be up under all trials both from within and without I feel that I have many-I
     feel too to do So for you My wish and prayer is that you and Amos may be <orig reg="fitted"
      >fited</orig> out to fulfil your Several Callings <pb n="6"/> to the <orig reg="honor"
     >honour</orig> and glory of God and as bright and Shining lights in the Kingdom of Heaven-that
     the Lord may bestow upon you Strength as your day is with fortitude to bear what may be laid
     upon you-believing that he will not lay more upon you than he will help to bear-Our prayer
     Should be that more <orig reg="laborers">labourers</orig> may be <orig reg="fitted"
     >fited</orig> out for the Lords Vineyard and as the field of <orig reg="labor">labour</orig> is
     increased I trust and hope this will be the Case So that your Earthly Social enjoyments may not
     be so near all fled as it may appear to you-but as my mixed up letter is already longer than I
     had intended and with all perhaps not much of Consolation I will close with an Affection</p>
