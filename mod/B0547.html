<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando

                    Colonel O. Brown<br>Assistant Commissioner<br>Richmond, Virginia
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 11th 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">In relation to the medical necessities of the Freedmen in this District, I have
                    the honor to report that there is an increasing demand for Medical treatment and
                    medicines, and I am at a loss how to meet it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have casually learned that Dr. DeLamater has telegraphed to Assistant Superintendents to ascertain the terms
                    upon which local physicians would treat the sick freedmen, but am not aware that
                    any of them have been directed to be employed.</p>
<p class="p10">I am of opinion that such is the best method to be adopted in the smaller places,
                    but think that at this place Winchester, one physician would be fully employed,
                    and I therefore request that a Surgeon or Assistant
                    Surgeon may be sent here with a months supply for a hundred (100) patients --
                    and with his assistance I may be able to meet what will soon become pressing
                    necessities among the Freedmen, for it appears to be evident that there will be
                    a considerable amount of sickness, among those who are supporting themselves but
                    with difficulty, and who are living in crowded or unhealthy places.</p>
<p class="p10">And in such places they must live for <i>[unclear: none]</i> others can be had,
                    and all their efforts are expended in procuring <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>present supplies of
                    fuel and food, and with no capital nor credit they cannot employ a Doctor, but
                    are dependant on his charity, which if he has any is sure to be
                        <i>[unclear: overtaken]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">I have therefore to respectfully ask attention to this statement, and suggest the
                    propriety of immediate action and instruction.</p>
<p class="p10">I am &amp;c</p>
