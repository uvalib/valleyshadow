<p class="p10">J. W. Stribling Esq<br>Baltimore:<br>Dear
                        Sir!</p>
<p class="p10">When I was in Richmond in December, I saw a specimen of "Smith's Patent Breech
                    Loading Rifle" at Governor Wises office, and was so
                    much pleased with it, that I requested the Governor to arm my Company with it.
                    He promised to do so provided the Legislature placed means at his disposal for
                    the purchase of arms before his term of office expired. They failed to do
                    so--whether Governor Letcher will carry out Governor Wises liberal intentions I do not know. I think
                    it is the best arm for Calvary and Artillery I ever saw. I compared it with
                    "Maynards," "Colts Repeating Rife," the "Minnie Musket," &amp; "Halls
                    Carbine," and I deem it <u>vastly superior to any of them</u></p>
<p class="p10">We will have a meeting of officers of 9 volunteer Companies, at my office next
                    Saturday to form a Regiment. There are 3 Cavalry Companies &amp; my own
                    Artillery in the Number, all to be armed this winter. I want them to adopt
                    Smiths Rifle. But as it is not known here, I wish you to send me a specimen by
                    Express at my Cost &amp; Charges, state the price of it so that if I choose
                    I may keep it for myself &amp; remit you the amount; if I conclude not to
                    keep it, I will return it safe &amp; sound by Express to you in a week or
                    two. Send me a few Cartridge Cases &amp; Balls to<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>exhibit.</p>
<p class="p10">My Object is to get the officers to petition the Legislature to procure us this
                    weapon.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. D. Imboden</i></p>
