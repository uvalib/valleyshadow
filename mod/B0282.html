<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Abner Harrison to Thomas
                    P. Jackson, July 19, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Although now residing in Tennessee, Harrison writes to Jackson to find out
                    whether or not Jackson has the power to pursue a case in which Harrison was not
                    able to collect payment for some land he sold near Middlebrook before the war,
                    because he refused to accept Confederate money. His letter details the
                    circumstances of the matter, and asks for help, or at the very least, advice,
                    from Jackson.</p>

<p class="p10">Mr. Thomas P Jackson</p>
<p class="p10">I saw through the Rockingham register that you was the
                        p<i>[added: r]</i>esident of the board of registration
                    for Augusta County. I wish to know if I can not get assistance through the military power
                    to collect a honest debt
                    which is due me in Augusta County - I will explain the nature of the case as near as I can the money is due me for land sold
                    in fifty nine to Michael Carwell near Middlebrook I left my bonds in the pay of William
                    McChesney for to collect for me in the fall of sixty two
                    I wrote to McChesney to collect a payment which was due me at that time and send me a check for
                    the money he sent me a check for the money dated October the 23 1862 on the traders bank at Richmond when
                    the check came to hand I tried to sell the check for state money which would of
                    answered my purpose at that time but was not able to sell
                    it for any thing but Confederate money and was advised
                    not to go to Richmond to collect my money that if I went
                    there and refused to take Confederate money I would be
                    put in prison I have saw some of General
                    Schofield's orders published in the papers which I thought would reach my case order number
                    thirty-one <i>[unclear: sars]</i> for the purpose of <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>of giving
                    adequate protection to a person in their rights of person and property in case
                    where civil authorities m<i>[added: a]</i>y fail I have not tried the civil laws of
                        Virginia to make my money but from the best information that I have
                    had from there it will <i>[added: be]</i> a difficult matter to get justice in my case I had a
                    letter written to General
                    Schofield to know if he would
                    not take my case in hand but have not received any answer
                    from him I do not know whether you have the power to act in my case or not but thought you could inform me
                    whether it would be the duty of the General to take my
                    case in hand or not if your business should call you to the town of Middlebrook you can find out all about my general character up to the time I left that portion of the county the check with lawful interest
                    up to this time wich would <i>[deleted: would]</i> be nothing more than justice to me would amount to abo<i>[added: u]</i>t $12.00 I have
                    written all I believe that is necessary at this time if you think my case comes under your notice
                    I will try to come Virginia my self and state the case to you in person if you
                    will be so kind as to answer my letter you will <i>[unclear:
