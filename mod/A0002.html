<h4>Augusta County: Jonathan M. Shipman to Kenton
                    Harper, June 11, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Lieut. Jonathan M. Shipman writes his Col Kenton Harper to complain that his
                    captain, Capt. O. H. Lumay, has been deficient in his duty to his company. Col
                    Kenton Harper dismisses the charges in a note at the end.</p>

<p class="p10">Shepherds Town</p>
<p class="p10">Col Kenton Harper<br>Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I regret the circumstances force me to take the step I now propose to do;
                    &amp; though I have heretofore had to look on with indifference; yet I have
                    noticed that the Capt. of my company (Capt. O. H. <i>[unclear: Lumay]</i>) the
                    Ready Rifles of Augusta County &amp; has been woefully deficient in his duty
                    to his company: but Sir; I now prefer this charge against him--</p>
<p class="p10">He left here today, and at the same time had a man
                    sick in his quarters, who could not help himself, without any thing to eat or
                    any one to see to his comfort in any way whatever, and I therefore petition you
                    to consider his case and give us any relief you can_</p>
<p class="p10">I am Sir Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. M. Shipman<br>Lieut. Ready Rifles</i></p>
<p class="p10">Inquired into-- Found the sick soldier had been left in
                        the care of a <i>[illeg.]</i> citizen of Shepherdstown. Now W
                            Boutier, the Captain states, was to see after him,
                        and from the known hospitality of the people of the plantation, an
                        experienced by the Regiment, I am satisfied, he would not
                        be allowed to suffer, if his <i>[illeg.]</i> was made known.<br><br>K H:
                        Col.</p>
