<p class="p10">May 10th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Spotsylvania Co. Virginia. Camp near Hamilton's Crossing</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father-</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to drop you a few to answer your few lines that I received from you
     this evening. I was glad to hear from you all and to hear that youw as well. I am well at
     present and hope when these few lines comes to hand they may find you all enjoying the same
     blessing of god a resting upon you.</p>
<p class="p10">You said that you heard that Gen. Jackson had a fight. It was not only him it was all of the
     troops. We had one of the hardest fights that we ever had since the war begun. General Jackson
     has lost one of his arms and <i>[unclear: has]</i> now got the pneumonia. He is not expected
     to live. He was shot by our own pickets. He got out side of our pickets after night and he come
     up in a gallop and they fired on him and wounded him and all of his guard but one. Our loss is
     said to be twenty thousand killed wounded and missing. I don't know what the
     <i>[unclear: loss,]</i> of the enemy was but it must be terrible. I have just heard that
     General Jackson was dead. If he is it is a great loss to the Southern confederacy.</p>
<p class="p10">You said that there was a petition wrote and sent to me or my officers. I have not heard
      nothing from it. I don't think I will need but you can get it and
     send it to me, for if the officers gets it it won't do me any good. William Offlighter and
     Hiram Coyner is in Richmond from what I can find out. They left the last day of April and I
     have not heard from them since.</p>
<p class="p10">If we stay here I wish you would come down and bring me something to eat for we don't get
     half enough and I can't stand it. If you do come you can bring something along and make more
     off of it <i>[unclear: than]</i> you can make any other way. You can get from 50 to 75 cents
     for a pie, and tobacco is very high. You can sell most anything at all, potatoes 50 cents per
     quart. Thread is very high and I have two overcoats and a good blanket I would like to send
     home. If I had them at home I wouldn't take less than 60 dollars for them. If you come and if
     we are at the same place you can come to Hamilton's Crossing, that is in
     two miles of our camp.</p>
<p class="p10">Joshua <i>[unclear: Robison]</i> and Adam Pannell sends their best respects to you all. I
     must close for this time. You will please excuse me for this. May god bless you all. Write
     soon.</p>

<p class="p10">May 11th 1863<br><br> Dear Wife-<br> I take this privilege this morning to drop you a few more lines. I received your
      kind letter yesterday after I had written home one to you. It found me well except the
      toothache it all but set me crazy. I commenced while I was writing to you and I had to quit
      writing for awhile but it has quit aching now. Give father and mother and Betty my love and
      tell him I would have written him a letter but I have not got the paper. Tell him to write to
      me. I must close. May god be with you all. I remain your affectionate husband until death
      separates us</p>
