<p class="p10">July 15 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">I received Sister Mary's letter of the 12th this
                    afternoon and take the earliest opportunity of replying. I had hoped to have
                    been at home ere this, but was unavoidably delayed. I endeavored today to make
                    arrangements to go up home on Monday next, but failed, as some half dozen
                    reports are yet to be made out for the war Department
                    &amp; I have them in shorthand - no one else can transcribe them. I shall
                    not be ordered away on business soon, and as quickly as I finish my work
                    &amp; can get leave of absence, I will be there. I sent a letter off
                    Wednesday evening, which you doubtless got today. Dr Brown tells me he expects
                    to go to Staunton on Monday. I may be able to get off Wednesday next; at least I
                    hope so. Yet I know that everything will remind me of <u>him</u> who loved me so, and to whom I had given my heart's last devotion. I
                    know that he alone of all others understood me, for I told and explained all to
                    him. He loved me as he loved no one else &amp; I was satisfied.
                    Conversations have passed between us which are as sacred as the grave in which
                    he sleeps. His words, his counsels and his blessings hang all around my way like
                    golden lamps which shall never go out, but light me on till I too shall sleep
                    and wake beside him. I know what he thought to do, even in our <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    boyhood days when he should come of mature age. Long, long ago when we lived on
                    Christian's creek, one night we were sleeping together in the trundle bed,
                    before we slept there had been some talk about sending him away to Winchester to
                    stay some time. I said that I could not bear that he should be sent away, and he
                    put his dear little arms around me and I clasped him and the tears flowed
                    freely. Since then we have lived in pleasantness together. Not an unkind word or
                    feeling ever passed between us in our lives, and either of us would have
                    suffered all for the other. May his grave never, never fade in my heart; and may
                    my life be as pure and gentle and my final rest as glorious as his.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been pained to hear of your feeble health yet hope that you will rally
                    shortly; the warm weather however is so exhausting, every thing so dry and
                    disease so prevalent. The internments in Hollywood cemetery average <u>eighteen daily from Typhoid fever alone</u>. Poor Mrs
                    Yancey died of it. Mr Yancey &amp; Mrs Hutcheson went up to his father's
                    this morning to carry the little girl 4 months old. It is so sad.</p>
<p class="p10">The news here is very exciting. It is said that the southerners in Baltimore rose
                    up and helped us to take possession of the city. All is excitement there and it
                    is said that secession flags wave from one end of Baltimore to the other-Nothing
                    from <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Washington City.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to hear that Mary Lou is better. It is strange to me that these
                    abscesses continue to form.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose Zeke was not taken off by the Yankees on their late visit as <i>[deleted: you]</i> nothing has been said about it in the letters from home.</p>
<p class="p10">I think I may have time to get a letter from home before I leave.</p>
<p class="p10">Much love to all. Cousin Lizzie sends love.</p>
<p class="p10">Affectionately your Son</p>
