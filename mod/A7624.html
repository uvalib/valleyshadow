</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife with news of a battle on The Rapidan river and
                    includes mention of casualties and wounded arriving in Staunton. He says most
                    regard it as the decisive battle of the war, and reports high spirits among the
                    Confederates. He also discusses matters at home, including the confiscation of
                    the mill by the Federals. He reports his health is recovering and discusses
                    running the hotel.</p>
