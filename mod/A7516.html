                    my last but it has not reached me yet I am sorry that I did not received it she must write again tell her I am anxious to hear from her. Edward returned on Saturday last did Very well on trip but nothing Extra.
                        Samuel is not married but will be soon this week
                    or next I suppose: I know nothing about when Edward will go off-- but I suppose soon<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>You must tell Elva not to fail to
                    answer my letter as nothing gives me more pleasure than to hear from her her
                    last was Very interesting You must be mistaken about her sending it! tell Mary-
                    Lizzie that little Mary has grown so much she would not know her she is now one
                    of the prettiest little babies in town. Tell her I
                    will say all the fun I can and think of her at the same time</p>
<p class="p10">Henry received the tobacco you speak of. I expect he
                    will start to Baltimore tomorrow he will go to buy stocks Our town is awful dull
                    at this time since the dedication it has been dull. We had a serious accident to
                        occur<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>to one of our citizens on Saturday last. John Chamberlain a <i>[unclear: turner]</i> who worked
                    at Waltons and a former member of My Company while fixing a roof in the Taylor
                    Hotel alley fell from the ladder and killed him-self almost Instantly he was
                    buried on Sunday he had a large funeral I was one of the Pall-Bearers. I notice
                    Billy Hordy occasionally with his "Blushing Bride"
                    I am glad to hear the cholera has subsided in Staunton. We have had no Diseases
                    of any kind this summer truly this is a healthy place.
                    You must write soon and tell Elva not to fail to answer my last. We are all well
                    I let you know when Samuel goes off It will be soon<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Write soon and when you send the Photograph
                    I will hand it to Sarah I would like to come at a Christmas but I cant do it I
