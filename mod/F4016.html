<p class="p11"><b>McClure &amp; Stoner,<br>Publishers<br>Franklin Repository
                    Office,<br>Chambersburg, Pennsylvania
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 13, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg, Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Please speak to Mr Espy and engage the best room she has for me this winter. Mrs
                    McClure will be with me most of the time, &amp; I will of course want the
                    best accomodations I can get. Would like a front room on the second floor if
                    possible. Please speak to Mrs Espy at once on the subject before her rooms are
                    taken. I do not care so much about the price as about making Mrs McClure comfortable.</p>
<p class="p10">We had a desperate <i>[unclear: cented]</i> in this county. We
                        <i>[unclear: Democrats]</i> stiffened up <i>[unclear: fearfully]</i>
                    within ten days before the election. They <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>thought they had a chance
                    to defeat me, &amp; they exhausted themselves to do it. I gained some 300 in
                    the county, and have a majority of about 70 in the district <i>[unclear: in the home
                        vote.]</i> I will have from 200 to 300 in the full vote.</p>
<p class="p10">I infer from the reports that <i>[illeg.]</i> is beaten in the home vote
                    &amp; Hains &amp; Hall also. I telegraphed Curtin to mark for me the
                    seat occupied by Cochran last winter &amp; if that was taken to mark the one
                    along side of it. <u>Please see that it is done.</u> If both
                    are taken mark a good seat for me <u>next to one of the
                        aisles.</u></p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
