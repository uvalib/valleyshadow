<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to Rosenbery,
                    John Abraham (father) and probably Elemina (mother)), April 9, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery anticipates the summer campaign. Later in the letter, he writes that he
                    continues to be in good health. As in earlier letters, he ponders the duration
                    of his remaining service, and he both professes his desire to perform his duty
                    as well as his longing for home and family. Facing the possibility of death,
                    Rosenbery finds comfort in his Christian faith.</p>

<p class="p10">April 9, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father and Mother:-</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself down to inform you that your letter of 27th March came
                    to hand a few days ago and also yesterday a letter dated 3 April.</p>
<p class="p10">I was glad to hear from you that you were well. I am well at present hoping that
                    these few lines may find you all enjoying the same blessings of health.</p>
<p class="p10">I have just came off of Camp Guard. We are kept pretty busy drilling. This
                    morning it is raining.</p>
<p class="p10">The Summer Campaign will soon commence. We are engaged digging up the Earth,
                    making breast works. This looks as though we will stand the rebels a fight here if they make an attack.
                    We has a good position. There is height here that we can plant our artillery on that we can give them an introduction to some of the
                    Yanks shells.</p>
<p class="p10">The time is coming that will tell if we conscripts must stay 9 months or three
                    years. The report is that we must report at Chambersburg on the 15th of May. I
                    can't tell but time will tell if it be correct.</p>
<p class="p10">I must say that I am very well contented here but as long as I have parents, wife
                    and children, I would rather be at home. I am glad that I can make myself so
                    content. Time passes very fast with me. Although soldiering is no fun but I must say with all the hardships and
                    exposures that I have endured since I am in the Service, I have never had my
                    health better. I have never yet reported to the doctor, not knowing how soon I
                    might. I was pretty sick the time that we advance to the Rapidan but it only
                    lasted a few days.</p>
<p class="p10">I think that the summer will end this rebellion; and
                    it may end me for all that I know. If it should, blessed by God, I have a bright
                    hope that reaches beyond the grave.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad in days that are gone by that I sought the Lord and found him to the
                    joy and comfort of my heart this morning. My heart rejoices for the peace of a
                    horrible conscience, yes, the peace that nothing but the love of a Savior can bestow on all the inhabitants of the Earth
                    that ever was told that Christ died for mankind can
                    have his peace, if they will only accept of it.</p>
<p class="p10">I thank God that the way of Salvation is so simple and so plain: repentance
                    become sorry for sin is repentance. Sorry because we have offended our best
                    friend. One that is able to save, faith simple taking Jesus at his word, believing that he will save us if we only believe on his name-giving him our hearts by prayer. We must take Him at His Word for He says -Him that
                    cometh to me I will never renounce-cast off. Jesus cannot lie and by putting of the Salvation of our Souls till a future day
                    will not make any fitter and life is uncertain. We can't count on the future.</p>
<p class="p10">So today is the time. Lord, help us to accept Thy
                    Salvation now. I must close.</p>
<p class="p10">If I never see you again-prepare to meet me in Heaven. Write now. I life in hope,
                    if God spares us we will soon meet again.</p>
<p class="p10">So farewell. God bless you all.</p>
