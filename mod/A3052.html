<h4>Augusta County: Samuel F. Carson to Virginia Miller,
                    April 10, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carson writes to Ms. Miller asking that she send food or clothing, though they
                    are not close, now that he has been told that authorities will allow it
                through.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Madam</p>
<p class="p10"> We have received instructions this morning from the Federal authorities that we
                    would be permitted to receive anything in the way of clothing or eatables that
                    may be sent us by our friends- whilst it is true I have but little acquaintance
                    with you I at the same time look upon you as a friend, and will be very thankful
                    for anything you may send. I arrived at this place on the 13th of March from
                    Hilton Head S.C. where six hundred of us had been confined since last August. I have heard nothing from home since my arrival
                    here, consequently can give you no news from that quarter. The two McCutchins
                    &amp; Henry Wright are still here. My respects to Mr. Miller.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Samuel F. Carson 1st Lieutenant
                        Company "D" 5th Virginia
                        Infantry<br>Division 34</i></p>
