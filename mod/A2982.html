<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved you most welcomed note this morning by Lizzie It found me something
                    better than I was last Sabbath. My toe is little or no better yet. I suffer a
                        great deal with it &amp; expect for it to be painful for a week
                    or two. dear Kate you wish me to come down &amp; more its my great desire to
                    come soon as I possibly can, I will have to improve very fast if <i>[deleted: to]</i> I get
                    down the last of the week for I am so weak at present that I cannot hop across
                    the room without assistance I hope by the last of the week I may be able to find
                    the way to my darlings side <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I had a great
                    notion to tell Lizzie that she might have let you come up today in her place.
                    But she might have told me better I am a thousand times better obliged to you
                    for the eatables you sent My appetite is something better than it was some days
                    past well L has come &amp; wants to go so I cannot write much more be in
                    good spirits I am so sad I cannot write any thing that will be of interest I will come down soon as I possibly can</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more but remain your true friend &amp; lover</p>
