<p class="p10">April /64</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Randolph</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">We returned from Picket next day after I wrote to you in deed we had a terrible time getting to Camp the mud was about six
                    inches deep while the rain and snow fall fast upon us
                    all day long from the river to our Camp is 12 long <u>miles</u> &amp; we are called to go on picket about every (20) days
                    &amp; it either snows or rains during the time we
                    are <i>[unclear: out]</i> I think we will very soon dispense with Picketting as
                    the winter is almost gone indeed I am anxious to have warm weather again although
                    soldiers have their best
                    time during the Winter season I have had an exquisite time this winter I shall
                    never forget Camp Randolph our Houses were very comfortably built &amp; to
                    take everything in consideration it was the most convenient Camp we have had<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Oh! we have lived high here,
                    our kind Friend at Home have kept us in the very best of provision while our duty except picket was quite light no one can
                    complain of having
                    done
                    too much hard duty this Winter I guess that you have read
                    an account of our Snowballing in the Spectator if
                    you have you may consider from that that our spirits are good all such fun we
                    have enjoyed this Winter you cannot imagine <i>[unclear: how]</i> pleasantly we
                    can pass off a winter you seldom see a <i>[unclear: day]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> fine spirits if you do you can easily
                    guess what caused it &amp; may say that fellow has been kicked By some Young Lady some of Imbodens deserters have cut him out and
                    as I am no Ladies Man and cannot love any one more than my dear Sister &amp;
                    Mother you may know that My spirits are always good
                    &amp; that I go with a well &amp; gay heart. Mary I wish you could see
                    Me I am as big &amp; fat as a Hog<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>If we should be so unfortunate as to run <i>[illeg.]</i> out of
                    rations I could live two week upon My own fat it is not
                    good living altogether that Makes Me fat but It is the dirt mixt with what we
                    eat Soldiers are awful dirty with their domestic affairs we generally use our
                    dirty clothes as dish rags &amp; for tea towels
                    when the Police officer comes around inspecting our
                        quarters we always stuff our dirty
                    clothes in the Flower Bag dont you think it a very
                    good idea. The <i>[illeg.]</i> have all <i>[unclear: played]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: out]</i> they <i>[unclear: have]</i> all
                    <i>[unclear: deserted]</i> for Imbodin <i>[illeg.]</i> when is Old Bill
                        <i>[unclear: Shumate]</i> Tell him to write to Me when you see him again I
                    would like to see him very much tell will I think Maggie &amp; him might
                    come down &amp; pay me a visit. Mary you remember what I stated in my last
                    letter to you about coming Home If I did not write <i>[unclear: before]</i> two
                    weeks that I would certainly be at home<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I am <i>[unclear: necssarley]</i>
                    compelled to write be fore the time
                    <i>[unclear: expires]</i> There fore you must look for me any more. I cannot
                    come home furloughs are only granted in extreme
                    cases you know that it is not important that I should come at this time although I am very anxious to see you General Lee only grants one furlough to every hundred
                    Men and you know as well as I do that there is <i>[unclear: plenty]</i> of Men
                    in the army whose families are suffereing for the want
                    of them <i>[illeg.]</i> do you think it would be kind in you to come home and
                    keep one of these Men from their homes when a man in our company that has been
                    home this winter. this man is a good soldier but a very poor man he received a letter from his wife the other day stating
                    that the man <i>[deleted: that]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: owned]</i> of the House she was living in threatened to turn her
