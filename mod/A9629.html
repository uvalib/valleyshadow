<p class="p10">April 25th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Harpers Ferry</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cate</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure that I can this morning seat my self to drop you a few lines.
                    My health is very good, &amp; spirits are good, &amp; hope that these
                        few lines come to hand you may be enjoying the same
                        unaccountable blessing.</p>
<p class="p10">We all arrived safely here last Monday. I know not how
                    long we will remain in Harpers
                    Ferry. Now I don't care for it
                    is a very dull place. The ladies look so sour that I
                    never speak to any of them. There are no beauties in
                    the burg. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> On our way to the burg the Ladies of every
                    village cheered us onward by their smiles &amp; waves. Miss Fannie Lincoln presented our company
                    with a secession Flag. I seen her but did not know her as we pushed on so past in our press wagons we had to travel all day last Sunday which
                    seemed very hard in old Jackson. I almost fell in love with a girl the way I
                    happened to get acquainted with her was I had broken
                    one of my straps that held my scabbard &amp; I just went &amp; asked her
                    to sew it for me if she pleased. She very kindly said she
                    would &amp; before the lady had finished it <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>a dozen of my fellow
                        soldiers had joined around me, the Ladies all
                    along the road seemed so pleasant that it it cheered us onward their
                    handkerchiefs
                    were continually waving
                    &amp; we generally gave them three loud cheers. There are so many rumors afloat that I can not
                    say what we may have to do. John is very well and
                        seemed to enjoy him self very well. I hope that if
                    it is Gods will that we may all arrive safely at home ere long.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cate I should like to express my self freely to
                    you. It was my intention to show you the hidden love that I always felt for you
                    the Saturday that you left Mr. Burkholders but I <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> was disappointed in my plans. And it may
                    be well for the love I have for you might have been blasted &amp; treated
                    with disregard, but oh Cate I shall ask one thing of thee
                    that is your prayers that I may with stand the wilds and temptations of the
                    devil, that I may <i>[illeg.]</i> upward &amp; onward &amp;
                    may <i>[deleted: ]</i> the heavenly city with all the blood washed throng that crowd the <i>[unclear: 
                        courts
                    ]</i> of the new Jerusalem. I must bring this uninteresting letter to a
                    close.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>William F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. please write soon direct your letter to Harpers
                        Ferry Virginia W.F.B.</p>
