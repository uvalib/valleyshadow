<p class="p10">Gettysburg,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">As I was not in town on the morning of your departure for Washington City, (and I
                    feel a just pride, as a Citizen of your hometown,
                    that it is honored with a Representative in the Halls of National Legislation.) by this means, <u>I express my
                        regards for your personal welfare</u>, adding the pleasure I would realize
                    in hearing of your distinguished mention among your <i>[unclear: compears]</i>
                    in the Congress of the U. S. Our acquaintance has not yet assumed the form of
                    personal friendship, nevertheless, as a Minister of the Gospel, my heart says
                    unto me, "wish him well, let your prayers, and benedictions be for him &amp;
                    upon him <i>[added: whilst]</i> in that Metropolis of
                    Government, and of sudden violence, and immorality, the Capitol of our Country."
                    Don't forget your God, in your devotion to your Country!</p>
<p class="p10">With great Respect, I am Yours <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
