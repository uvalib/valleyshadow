                <p>Waldo reports the condition of schools in Staunton and Waynesboro to McDonnell.
                    In this report, he clarifies some of the conflicts over school room use in both
                    towns. He finds it unfortunate that the community "would sooner prefer that
                    their children should remain uneducated rather than 'defile' their church by its
                    use for Educational purposes." Waldo also describes a sectarian conflict between
                    the black Methodist and Baptist congregations in Waynesboro over the use of a
                    building.</p>

                <p>I was about to address you on the subject of schools in my Division, when your
                    communication <add hand="h1" place="inline">of 19th inst.</add> relating thereto
                    was received. In reply, I have the honor to make the following statement viz:</p>

                <p>On the 21st of August ult., a communication was addressed to this office by Mr.
                    Jno. Scott of Naugatuck <abbr expan="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr> saying that the
                        <abbr expan="American">Am.</abbr> Missionary Association desired to send him
                    to Staunton as teacher, and requested to be informed as to what arrangements
                    could be made for School room, board &amp;c. <abbr expan="Colonel"
                    >Col.</abbr> Jordan, not having replied to this letter, as the records of the
                    office show, after calling a meeting of the colored citizens of Staunton, and
                    learning what they were able to do toward supporting a teacher, &amp;c I
                    replied to Mr. Scott informing him that the freedpeople would see that his board
                    was paid <pb n="2"/>and that the Basement of their Church was offered as a
                    school room &amp;c. No reply has yet been received to this Communication
                    although a full month has elapsed since sending it. Therefore, in accordance
                    with a recent verbal request of Miss E. James, <abbr expan="Agent">Agt.</abbr>
                    of <abbr expan="American Missionary Association">A.M.A.</abbr> now teaching at
                    Harrisonburg, I informed her that there were as yet no teachers for Staunton or
                    Waynesboro. What she will be able to do I cannot say, but if Mr. Brackett <abbr
                        expan="Superintendent">Supt</abbr> of Schools for the Valley can send
                    teachers without unnecessary delay, I would earnestly recommend it, as it would
                    be injurious to the school interests to wait longer for the action of the
                    Association.</p>

                <p>A large number will attend the school at this place this winter, therefore, the
                    basement of the Church, the only place yet offered for school purposes, is not
                    of sufficient capacity for the accomodation of the scholars, and it being
                        <unclear>illy</unclear> ventilated is not adapted for this purpose. The <hi
                        rend="underline">body</hi> of the Church could be used without material
                    injury and is more suitable for a school room for the wants of Staunton than any
                    other they could procure, but there seems to be an undefined and uncalled for
                    prejudice on the part of the many of the members against it. They do not seem to
                    consider their poverty stricken condition <pb n="3"/>and wish to adapt
                    themselves to circumstances, but would sooner prefer that their children should
                    remain uneducated rather than "defile" their church by its use for Educational
                    purposes. If this prejudice could be removed, and the room used, it would not a
                    little enhance the interests of the schools. I am using what influence I can
                    bring to bear to accomplish this end.</p>

                <p>Books must be procured for use of this school when, if competent teachers will be
                    sent, all the necessary preparations will have been made for the opening of the
                    same without further delay.</p>

                <p>In connection with this subject, I respectfully ask your attention to the
                    following statement relative to the condition &amp; progress of school
                    building at Waynesboro. viz:</p>

                <p>Toward the erection of the building referred to the Bureau expended $150.37 and
                    from all the information I can gather from the records of this office I am led
                    to infer <add hand="h1" place="inline">that</add> the authorities granting said
                    appropriation did so under the impression that the building was to be used for
                        <hi rend="underline">school</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">purposes</hi> regardless of any religious denomination.
                    This building is now under the control of the Methodist (colored) and managed by
                    Trustees of that <pb n="4"/>denomination, although I am informed that the
                    Baptist denomination, aided <add hand="h1" place="inline">as much</add>
                    pecuniarily in erecting the building, as their opponents, subscriptions having
                    been raised by the colored people regardless to sectarianism. The stand taken by
                    those who have control of the building is anything but encouraging toward the
                    prospect of opening a school for all, their aim being to make it a sectarian
                    concern. The Baptists have no such desire, and are without delay raising
                    subscriptions among themselves for the support of a teacher to take charge by
                    1st <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr> - hoping the Methodists will finally fall
                    in and help them out.</p>

                <p>It was reported to this office a few days ago by the former owner of the ground
                    on which this building was erected that there is yet due him for said land
                    $50.00 which must be immediately paid "or he would give them trouble"
                    &amp;c. I have notified the Church trustees regarding it, although they
                    acknowledge the debt they seem to be thoroughly frightened for consequence
                    thereof. If the Baptists will aid them in liquidating this indebtedness, I would
                    most respectfully recommend that orders be issued by the proper authorities,
                    granting the use of this building to each denomination on <pb n="5"/>alternate
                    Sabbaths, and that it be used during the usual scholastic year, for school
                    purposes without regard to any religious society, &amp;c.</p>

                <p>I am informed a teacher will be needed there by the 1st of November. Books also
                    necessary.</p>
