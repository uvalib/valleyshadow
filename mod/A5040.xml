                        >herd</orig> from him this morning but I hope he is better. I received your
                    letter last week. We hear the Cannons roaring here every day from near <unclear>
                        <orig reg="Alexandria">Alexander</orig>
                    </unclear> our troops drove them back off over Shooters hill the other morning
                    it is five miles from Washington. They can see the City plain from the hill.
                    They have got good range for the Cannons on the City from the hill. they are in
                    sight of each other all the time our forces are moving up on them every day. I
                    was out on the battle field last Friday it was a smart sight to see it just to
                    see how the houses how they are tore to <orig reg="pieces">peases</orig> that
                    they hardly stand up on the bank where Sherman Battery was taking they are fifty
                    horses dying on one <orig reg="acre">acher</orig> of ground and to see the dead
                    bodies <orig reg="lying">liing</orig> over the field some of them not <orig

                    of the ground with a little <orig reg="dirt">durt</orig> on them some are
                        <unclear>prised</unclear> up out of the <orig reg="dirt">durt</orig> and
                    they are setting up with their <pb n="2"/> clothe hanging around there
                        <unclear>carens</unclear> the rest is out drilling this morning I don't
                        <orig reg="have">haft</orig> to drill to day I was on guard yesterday. I
                    want you to send me my hat the first chance you get. I must stop writing for
                    this time for I have no more <orig reg="news">nuse</orig> to write. Bruce Kerr
