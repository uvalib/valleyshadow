<h4>Augusta: John P. Lightner[?] to unknown [fragment]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>This fragment of a letter seems to have been written by John P. Lightner to a
                    member of the Armentrout or Brand family before the war. The letter discusses
                    church affairs and the death of a brother.</p>

<p class="p10">the people around here were very liberal sending Clothing Provision and what
                    money they could get. Is Carter still with you. I haven't
                    forgotten what a time I use to have trying to boss
                    him around. I suppose he is a very handsome Chap, does
                    he still catch fish? How is Mrs Watson and the girls. Does Mr Strickler still
                    Preach at Tinkling. I remember how I did hate to go to that Church. I don't think the people are so high-minded and proud out here. I was at Waveland last Sabbath and I
                    liked it so well I went back that night, to the Presbyterian Church the preacher
                    reminded me a little of Mr. S. he spoke so much like him but I felt more at home
                    than I ever did at Tinkling we have been attending
                    meetings generaly there was a protracted meeting held at our <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> nearest
                    Church 2 weeks, &amp; there was only one joiner, the Methodist preacher will
                    hold his meeting in a few weeks. It is true my friend our dear Brother is no
                    more it was so hard for us to give him up he was such a dear good brother and
                    yet I can scarcely imagine he is no more, it was
                    such a sudden trial for us. We were looking for them the next week, but they had
                    set the day it just two weeks from the day he died, it was the 26<u>
                        <sup>th</sup>
                    </u> of October. he attended the Fair two days, and was complaining there. he went out to
                    Grandmas from there he went to Mr Bayleys &amp; took sick Doctor said he had Billious Fever he did not complain
                    only of weakness, he would tell Bechie he wasn't so
                    bad. she was with him, that was one consolation. they tell us he died without a
                        struggle.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope we will all be prepared when death comes to meet him in Heaven. We have
                    lost so many dear ones, but it was hardest for me to give him up. We have felt
                    so lonely and sad but the neighbors are so kind to us. They tell us if we go
                    back there we won't be satisfied but some there think we
                    had better go back but we are all very well satisfied.</p>
<p class="p10">We often talk and think we would love to be back there but think it best to stay
                    out here as we can get along very easily. I guess
                    Bechie will come out in the spring if she can get company. I can't wait I want to see her so badly. Well I will close. hope you
                    will write soon and give me all the news for I think of you all so much. Was
                    much obliged for that receipt &amp; money. I gave 50 of it to the Church.</p>
<p class="p10">from your true friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse this scribbled affair will try do better in the future. Kiss your four little ones
                        for me. My love to all inquiring, if any.</p>
