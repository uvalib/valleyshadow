<p class="p10">424 Wall Street,<br>Philadelphia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Father --</p>
<p class="p10">I quite expected to find some letter here on my return; but can find none. I
                    infer you are all pretty well, and a little lazy.-- I left Harrisburg on Saturday Evening,
                    &amp; spent Sunday in Lancaster coming to Philadelphia in this morning's early train Between Harrisburg &amp;
                    Lancaster, I had the company of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nathaniel
                    <i>[unclear: Ellmaker]</i> who are returning from Bedford, Miss Sarah
                        <i>[unclear: Mayer]</i> from Lewistown, &amp; Miss
                    <i>[unclear: Voorher]</i> with her, &amp; the two Miss
                    <i>[unclear: Muosers]</i> who had been to the Teacher's Convention at
                    Chambersburg. One of these ladies was <i>[illeg.]</i> bridesmaid at W. Runell's
                    wedding.-- We had a great deal to say, &amp; the time passed pleasantly.-- I
                    saw also in Harrisburg William
                    <i>[unclear: Herenton]</i>.-- He came from Bedford
                    on Thursday evening, &amp; was on his way to Chambersburg-- I presume to see
                    after an importunate debtor.--He looks tolerably well, only. His wife is
                    suffering from a gathering in her heart.-- I forgot to ask him for his parents
                    health, or his child's, as breakfast was announced soon after we commenced
                    talking.-- Tell Lizzie Law that W. Hoff has been markedly attentive to Miss
                    Hale, that Miss Hale has received his attention with marked pleasure, &amp;
                    that Mrs. E. thinks they are engaged. W. Hoff talks as if they were, &amp;
                    everything indicated that fact.-- Tell her, to write a sympathizing letter to
                    Mr. <i>[unclear: Horwitz]</i> -- I was much amused at Mrs. E.'s earnestness of
                    manner, &amp; her <i>[illeg.]</i> were certainly very strong.-- Very few of
                    our acquaintences re- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>mained at Bedford. Miss Walker of Cincinnati
                    left on Sunday, summoned home by news of her Father's extreme illness.-- Mrs.
                    Budd was still there, &amp; very <i>[unclear: gay]</i>.-- A gentleman was
                    with her, whom Mrs. E. was told to consider as her beau.-- She had forgotten his
                    name.-- I saw Mr. Stevens yesterday afternoon.- He had returned on Friday <i>[deleted: ]</i> from Chambersburg.-- He joined his <i>[unclear: case]</i>
                    there.-- At <i>[unclear: Hollisdayburg]</i>, the other side took a
                        <i>[unclear: non-suit]</i>, <u>after</u> the Jury had
                    come from their room and had agreed upon their verdict, but <u>before</u> the verdict was given to the Court. The other side, by some
                    means, heard that the verdict was against them.-- Today, Court opens in
                    Lancaster. Bachman's suit is one of the cases for trial. Mr Stevens, being one
                    of his counsel.-- Bachman has lost a great deal of <i>[unclear: flak]</i>,
                    since his trouble began, &amp; he looked badly.-- Judge Vondersmith came to
                        Philadelphia in the same train with me,
                    acccompanied by his bail. I don't know whether he will soon be tried.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Lizzie that as I was going down Chest. Street this morning in an omnibus, I
                    saw <i>[unclear: Wycke]</i> to Miss <i>[unclear: Ard]</i>, who was walking
                    with a companion.-</p>
<p class="p10">Simon Stevens told me he saw W. Mchaffey the early part of last week, in Philadelphia on his way to see his wife. I presume
                    from that, she has been ill; &amp; I feel quite anxious to know what
                    announcements have been made.-</p>
<p class="p10">Tomorrow there is to be a meeting of <i>[illeg.]</i> politicians here, to raise
                    money for the campaign.-- Mr. <i>[unclear: Judd]</i> is in town, &amp;
                    insists upon definite action.- In this, he is backed <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> up by us all.--
                    We have announced a series of meetings for W. Wilmot, which will give him
                    something to do from next week to the election.-- The time fixed for <i>[deleted: ]</i> September 30--is a very suitable period--</p>
<p class="p10">I write in haste.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        Edward
                    </i></p>
