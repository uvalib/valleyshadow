                <p> I have written to you twice &amp; as yet have received no answer. I have not
                    heard one word direct from home yet. I imagine some have been sent, but <orig
                        reg="owing">oweing</orig> to the <orig reg="deranged">diranged</orig> state
                    of mail affairs I have received none There is more confusion here at this time
                    than has been heretofore. <orig reg="owing">oweing</orig> to the fact, that our
                    commanders have all been superceded by an appointment from the
                        <unclear>convention</unclear> - or rather the Governor <orig reg="which"
                        >wich</orig> has caused considerable dissatisfaction among the soldiers
                    generally. I wish they would settle matters some way or other, &amp; let us
                    get back home for I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> see any good that we are doing
                    here now. It is thought that all our officers ranking from captains will be
                    superceded by this order of the Governor. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>
                    Harman Harper &amp; <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Baylor are all in
                    powerful stew about it &amp; I wouldn't be surprised if we all
                        c<unclear>eceede </unclear> &amp; go home<pb n="2"/></p>
                <p>I will not trouble you with a long letter from the fact that I have not got time
                    to write a long one, we are in fine spirits. I am unwell myself having caught a
                    cold. but I am considerably better this morning, &amp; hope that with care I
                    will be all right in <add hand="h1" place="inline">a</add> few days. Give my
                    love to all my friends &amp; tell them, I hope it will not be long before I
                    will have the pleasure of seeing them again. If however the fates have decried
                    otherwise I hope to be able to meet them in that better land "where the wicked
                    cease from trouble, &amp; the weary will be forever at rest"</p>
                <p>I see you are all forming home guards for the purpose of protecting our lady
                    friends that are behind. I hope that you all may find protection from the good
                    old citizens of Augusta - write me on the reception of this &amp; <del
                        hand="h1"/> me all the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp; how you are all getting
                    along. the boys bother me so that I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> write so I'll
                    git for the present<pb n="3"/> you <del hand="h1">must</del> keep all the boys
                    in good spirits. I suppose some of my friends are glad that I am gone, &amp;
                    hope that I may never return - as there are some who have not much love for me.
                    To them I hope you will give my best love.</p>
