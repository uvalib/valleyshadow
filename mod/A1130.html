<p class="p10">Dear Ma</p>
<p class="p10">I did not wish to weary you by another letter on the same subject, but I expected
                    a definite answer This morning out was much
                    disapointed. I hope we will get one by Friday's mail Ma I think we have just
                        cause to
                    leave this place the state of affairs in the country and some other things I
                        don't like about M<sup>r</sup> White
                    which are not worthwhile to be mentioned but I
                    will tell you when I come home As I said three have left and more expect to
                    leave, some three or four more will leave this week and those that are here are
                    mean as they can be and none of us like them. Now I hope you have fully
                    determined to let us come. And please send us money<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to come. Write on
                    Thursday, so it may come up on the train the same day and we will get it on
                    Friday. We don't want to start in the next session so please write by Thursday's
                    mail and let us come home</p>
