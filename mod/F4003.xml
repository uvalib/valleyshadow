                <p>McClure briefly describes his plan to increase local enlistment by allowing

                <p>I am fully persuaded that a <abbr expan="regiment">regt</abbr> could be raised
                    here very promptly by <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> McAllen if allowed to
                        <orig reg="rendezvous">rendesvouz</orig> here. The men
                    <unclear>would</unclear> be supported at the same cost as in Harrisburg
                    &amp; you could equip them. It is meant as an <hi rend="underline"
                    >honest</hi> effort to raise a <abbr expan="regiment">regt</abbr> &amp; not
                    to swindle as was the case under Steinbaugh, who is <unclear>now</unclear>
                    fortunately out of the way. Schell writes me that if McAllen should be allowed
                    to take charge of this, Bedford would give at least <hi rend="underline"
                    >four</hi> Companies &amp; I know that our <abbr expan="company">Co</abbr>
                    would give just as many. Our better military mean could not have any <pb n="2"
                    />thing to do with Steinbaugh and he did not take two hundred men out of our
                    county.</p>

                <p>McAllen does not want contracts of any kind, nor does any one about him.</p>

                <p>You may remember him as the man who was <unclear>authorized</unclear> by the
                        <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> to raise a Brigade here last spring, and
                    finally you had to reject his men when the Patterson registration was reduced.
                    He paid <unclear>all</unclear> $400 as I know to get the men off quietly and,
                    besides being well qualified to command a <abbr expan="regiment">regt</abbr> he
                    has the character to justify the promotion.</p>

                <p>I am satisfied that double the men if not five times the members could be had
                    here by knowing their Colonel and <pb n="3"/>getting ready at home, that could
                    be enlisted otherwise.</p>

                <p>It would not cost the State a cent, as there is a camp and all necessary
                    preparations.</p>

                <p>I write you with the request that you will take a favorable opportunity to bring
                    it before the Govenor, and get a definite asnwer sent me. I have no personal or
                    political interest in <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> McAllen, but
                        <unclear>case</unclear> this matter soley because I feel persuaded it would
                    be wise to adopt it.</p>

                <p>Please give me an early reply, and if acceptable, let Commissary <unclear/>
                    contract to supply at your regular rate paid at Camp <unclear>Cutiers</unclear>.</p>
