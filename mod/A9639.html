<p class="p10">Decmeber 29th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camped Near Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Ever Dear Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter on the 20th &amp; it was a
                    most welcome letter for our Regiment was on picket
                    where the banks of the Potomac &amp; occasion the enemy would
                    throw a bombshell as if feeling for our situation but <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    wasted
                    ammunition in vain but you may know that your
                    letter being received in such a <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    would make a lasting impression on my mind &amp; there I vowed before Almighty God that I would never play another card it was very seldom that I every played;
                    when I played it was for mere amusement but well I know
                        there was a better way to spend my time. This is
                    quite a lonesome day here, though a beautiful Sabbath morning every thing looks quiet but dull it is quite a
                    picture to look around on my <i>[unclear: mess]</i> some are Cooking some
                    eating some writing &amp; some sleeping. We had <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> for breakfast you would laugh if
                        <i>[unclear: you]</i> could see us cooking every
                    one <i>[unclear: must]</i> have something to say how such &amp; such a
                    thing ought to be done. <i>[illeg.]</i> H. Brownlee is here to day tis the <i>[unclear: first]</i> time I have seen him since
                        <i>[unclear: he]</i> went to Washington County he
                    looks very well. Tom is General Garnetts orderly.</p>
<p class="p10">What sort of a Christmas did you have mine was very dry it seemed to me like a
                    Sabbath it was <i>[illeg.]</i> beautiful day. I would like
                    <i>[unclear: very]</i> much to have been at home <i>[illeg.]</i> I know that I
                    could have had some pleasure. I will long remember the pleasant
                    holidays we had a turkey Christmas day for dinner
                    &amp; have had one since. There was an inspection
                    this morning a 9 o'clock A.M. we had a tolerable hard
                    trip to the Potomac a few weeks a go on it is hard to me
                    as I was not very well I had the yellow jaundice. I
                    was very near broke down it was useless to <i>[unclear: write]</i>
                    every
                    thing that happened <i>[illeg.]</i> it has been published in the news papers.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope John is getting well so <i>[unclear: he]</i> can enjoy him self. Through
                    the <i>[illeg.]</i> low days I assure you that I shall never think less of him
                    for telling on me for he is a man I greatly esteem. I
                    only wish that he would correct me of every fault that
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> have give my love to him if he is at home when this reaches
                        <i>[unclear: you]</i>. You can keep the socks until I return my health is very good, at present &amp; hope when these
                    few
                    uninteresting lines come to
                    <i>[unclear: hand]</i> you may be enjoying the same blessing. My Brothers are
                    both <i>[unclear: well]</i>. Your Cousin Abe was down here yesterday the most of the boys <i>[unclear: treat]</i> him coldly
                    because he had him self detailed to wait on the sick he spent to most of his
                    time with me. I heard that he started home yesterday I
                    hope that he may have a pleasant time. I must bring
                    this short letter to a <i>[unclear: close]</i>. I ask an interest all your <i>[unclear: prayers]</i> give my love to all
                    &amp; reserve <i>[illeg.]</i> respective portion for your <i>[illeg.]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon as I am always glad <i>[illeg.]</i> hear from nothing more.</p>
<p class="p10">write soon</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. <i>[illeg.]</i> New years' gift</p>
