<p class="p10">November 1<sup>st</sup> 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp on the march </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Bro </p>
<p class="p10">We are resting in a field in a small valley between the
                    mountains left our camp about two o'clock on the
                    thirtieth, marched through Sharpsburg and on about 8 miles (it is only guess
                    work) and stopped on the other side of the south mountain in a woods. it was an
                    excellent place to spend the night. we had leaves for a bed Spread our tents on
                    top and slept first rate were up and on the line by daybreak and moved on
                    through a place called pleasant valley and it was a
                    very beautiful place looked something like the
                    little cove we passed by dozens of deserted camps and one convalescent camp saw
                    some men with but one arm each out in the fields with a dog they seemed to be
                    enjoying themselves asked for N.Y. regiments. we
                    moved on and pretty fast too our knapsacks<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> pulling back all the time
                    I tell you the marching is nothing but carrying a load of about 50 pounds is as hard work as you ever tried on they don't feel so heavy at first but grow amazingly a lamb
                    when we start but an old sheep when we stop. we can have some Idea how horses
                    feel after pulling all day my shoulders are so sore I can hardly move them
                    without hurting. I will not get my boots now and it is about as well, as most of
                    the boys who got new boots have sore feet. I will try to get a pair of
                        <i>[unclear: good]</i> shoes when my boots are worn out they are far easier
                    to walk in than home made ones which are too narrow in the sole. I will try and
                    send this letter with some citizens who are here from greenecastle. but I must tell you of harpers ferry. we got there
                    about dinner time there was a train passing with some very heavy cannon on the
                    mountains and close together<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> and rise most perpendicular the Rail Road canal river and a road on each side of the
                    river take up the whole distance. the government property has been very much
                    Injured one building has a broad crack from foundation to the roof it was a
                    strong stone building. we saw dozens of car wheels the
                    bodies of which had been burnt and several cords of gun barrels which were destroyed there are workmen on the Rail    Road it is in running
                    order they have putup a Rail Road bridge of trussel work
                    across the River We crossed on a pontoon Bridge it was made of boats fixed
                    straight up and down the stream about fifteen or twenty feet apart and fastened
                    above and below with anchors then beams laid on the boats and planks laid across
                    them it makes a very nice bridge we marched through a
                        <i>[unclear: gap]</i> in the mountain and have stopped about five miles
                    south of Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p class="p10">We have not moved this morning yet and the report is that we are to be mustered
                    in for pay our officers are fixing up the pay rolls. Thom Creigh has been
                    transferred into the signal corps it is a very nice position but they have a
                        good deal of hard climbing to do as the signals
                    have to be at the highest points of mountains houses trees &amp; so on. Tell
                    mother I will answer her letter in a few days my shoulders are too sore to write
                    more.</p>
