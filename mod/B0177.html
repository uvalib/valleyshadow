</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>J. N. Gentry writes to the Staunton Bureau Agent (although he addressed the
                    letter to Frederick Tukey, Tukey had been replaced by Thomas Jackson in April
                    1867), to state what he knows about a case in which two men claim to be married
                    to the woman whom he employs.</p>

<p class="p10">New Hope</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Allen Rodes wishes me to write to you and state the circumstance concerning a
                    matter that he will apply to you on and it is as follows as you will see by his
                    papers in June 1866 he was Registered by Lieutenant
                    Hooks as married to Ann Davis and has been living with her ever since and before
                    as for some time as man and wife and on Sunday last a black man by the name of
                    John <i>[added: Cooper]</i> came to my house (I having
                    Allen's wife employed), and took his wife off claming her as his wife <i>[deleted: and]</i> he having had her before as his wife but left her some
                    six or seven years ago as I am informed and is now I understand claiming the
                    property that Allen has gathered up since his marriage and will apply to you for
                    an order for it and I think it nothing but fair that you should be informed on
                        both sides of the case before you act in the
                    matter. I can say for Allen, as fair as I have seen of
                    him he is a truthful honest man and will not state
                        anything to you but what is true.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
