<p class="p10">16th April</p>
<p class="p10">Poughkeepsie NY</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Parents and Family</p>
<p class="p10">I now seat myself to answer Emmas very kind and welcome letter which I received yesterday. and as usual was very glad to hear from you. Oh, what sad news we have
     had of late. I suppose there is great excitement about it at home Here every one that is loyal wears a black and white badge and streets are all hung with
     crape flags are flying at half mast a trimmed with black. I never
     heard anything that shocked me so much. some of the boys awoke me
     up early on Saturday morning and told me <u>Lincoln had been shot</u>. I scarcely knew what to do. Every one
     looked down and were sad the town was just<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> as Sunday. Our teachers told us to go
     home that they could not teach school and about nine oclock all the
     bells in the city were tolled. speaking to plainly to sorrowful voice of our people. How true
     all flesh is as grass etc.. this passage of scripture came to my
     mind very often the past two day this evening I was to the congregational church had a good
     sermon, upon the uncertainty of life. But why should we mourn Lincoln was only a man and his
     time had come his God was ready to give him, and we must all follow. My dear Sisters only prove
     steadfast and hold out for we know not at what hour the son of man cometh. I know full well I
     am not competant to give you advice but I know you often wonder how I
     feel toward you since you <i>[unclear: chan]</i>. I do<i>[deleted: n]</i> not see and
     cannot feel to follow you know, but as a brother<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I can only wish you well. You need
     not fear for me while here I have no temptations to do evil other than
     when at home. I do not know any new that I think would interest you. this evening it is
     reported here that Booth has been caught and the Sewards are yet living. today I was out in the county and collected some wild flowers, the first bloom of spring.
     I am getting along pretty well. I work pretty hard every evening until pretty late, but I feel very stout and a great deal better than when
     George left. I should like to correspond with SK Snively if you hear his adress "ie" his Brigade
     Division and Corps let me know it. Abners little one has a hard time
     how much better off it would be if it could leave this world. I suppose the drafted boys feel
     pretty easy now since the late order from Staunton<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I
     suppose Rush Senseny had a great party when he came home.<br> I am very glad to hear that
     Jennie has a colt I hope they can take good care of her. The lines you wrote me are very
     applicable and I often play some of the old songs we used to sing upon my flute for the boys
     here, and how attentive they are they to have
     friends at home and often sigh do they think of me at home. I must now conclude as it is very
     late give my love to the family and remember me to the enquiring friends tell Ella to be a good
     girl until I come home. I suppose Uncle Hoovers will not feel very
     well at home if they go on <i>[unclear: building]</i> directly.</p>
<p class="p10">So good night to you all and I remain very truly yours absent Bro</p>
