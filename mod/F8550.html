<p class="p10">October 1<sup>st</sup>, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Thorndale</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Edward-</p>
<p class="p10">I received your last letter a few days ago. It was my intention last week to
                    write an apology for the rather trifling letter I had sent you, for so it seemed
                    to me, after reading yours, but for a week past I have been suffering with a
                    boil <i>[deleted: i]</i>on my head, behind the left ear &amp; did not, of
                    course, feel very comfortable. Miss Ellen's remedies have proved effective, &amp; I hope it will entirely
                    disappear in a day or two. I am really heart sick at the state of things in your
                    church, yet, cannot but hope, that the great Head of the Church will overrule
                    even all these discouraging &amp; disheartening circumstances <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for
                    his own Glory, for the ultimate peace &amp; spiritual welfare of that
                    portion of his vineyard. I grieve over it the more, because of the pernicious
                    influence it must exert, over the young, &amp; those who are not professors
                    of religion, yourself especially, but it must be remembered that the
                    inconsistencies &amp; unholy tempers of professed Christians, <i>[deleted: is]</i> are not to be charged to religion, but either to their entire want
                    of it, or <i>[added: to]</i> a lamentable declension, into
                    which they have fallen. Yet it is to these, the world will look in forming their
                    judgement, forgetting, the one only perfect example set forth to us in the
                    Gospel, who will judge us, not by what others have done or failed to do, but by
                    that law, which requires us to "repent &amp; believe" each for himself. I do
                    believe that one of the greatest stumbling blocks in the way of the salvation of
                    men is, the inconsistencies of professing Christians, &amp; it is this
                    thought that affects my heart so deeply, &amp; I should sink in utter
                    depair, were it not for the blessed truth that the "Lord reigns" &amp; will
                        fulfill all his glorious promises concerning his
                    Church, <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>against which, all the powers of Earth &amp; Hell cannot
                    eventually prevail. I trust you know many, who by their walk &amp;
                    conversation, recommend the Religion of the Lord Jesus to you -- you must not
                    expect them to be perfect, but wherever you see a habitual aim to live as
                    becomes the gospel, follow them, <i>[deleted: in as]</i> so far as they
                    follow Christ &amp; manifest his spirit.</p>
<p class="p10">My letters from home this week say, it is not probable now, that we shall leave
                    Frederick this winter, the house will be completed but, <i>[deleted: has]</i>
                    plastering not dry enough to render it safe for us to venture in. I regret it
                    chiefly because we will not have you with us as we hoped. And I do think it will
                    be crying shame if you do not pay us a visit before going to Washington-- You
                    never stayed away so long before. I was thinking last
                    week you might ride over here to see me during my visit &amp; even yet, the
                    ladies will be very happy to see you &amp; for fear you may be <u>bashful</u>, we propose that you bring with you that
                    mysterious <u>one</u>, who knows them better than you do, to
                    introduce you -- perhaps it may be an old acquaintance of mine <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>and
                    then I shall be doubly pleased. I expect to leave here next Monday week for
                        Baltimore &amp; go with the wedding party as
                    far as the Junction-- then Reverend Mr Peck &amp;
                    myself go on to Baltimore &amp; they proceed to Niagara Falls. I almost envy
                    them that delightful trip, at this glorious season of the year. I hope when you
                    go under such interesting circumstances, you will choose the Fall or Spring
                    &amp; take me to matronize the party. I want to go now <i>[added: more]</i> than before. It gratifies me much to hear of the
                        favorable opinions given of your address All
                    here felt just so about it, but we could not express it in such flattering
                    language. Now do lay politics aside for a day at least, &amp; ride over
                    here; I want to see you &amp; introduce you to my Thorndale friends. But I
                    must stop or I shall tire you out, although I have not taken up all the points
                    in your last letter -- yet I must make one assertion before closing, that
                    bachelorism is your <u>sin</u> &amp; not your misfortune,
                    for you lords of the Creation are <u>prime movers</u> in the
                    affair, while we poor maidens dare only wait &amp; <u>wait
                        to be asked</u>. My love to all friends-</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>E</i></p>
<p class="p10">The borders will all leave
                        early next week &amp; we will have a quiet house -- I forgot to tell
                        you, Nannie had gone to Louisiana.</p>
