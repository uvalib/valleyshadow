    <p>I have been off on a <orig reg="reconnaissance">reconnaisance</orig> communication &amp;
     so have not written to you before since I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> your last very
     welcome letter -- I am glad you have gotten over the '<hi rend="underline">blues</hi>' as you
     say -- <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> let them get hold of you again -- they are poor comforters
     I reckon -- I never cultivate their acquaintance for that reason -- I got my bundle of things
     sent to Staunton -- hope it got through I sent it to the care of Maj. Bell -- There were 20 yds
     brown <unclear>fullned</unclear> cloth, 12 yds of Osnaburg -- 2 yds, wide gray cloth, 1 <abbr
      expan="pair">pr</abbr> garters &amp; 1 <abbr expan="pair">pr</abbr> shoes for you, 1 <abbr
      expan="pair">pr</abbr> for Nelly &amp; 1 <abbr expan="pair">pr</abbr> for Anna - - 1 lb of
     tea, 1 lb of Soda, pepper, a fine comb, a silk pocket <abbr expan="handkerchief">hdkf</abbr>,
     some cloth for sleeve lining, buttons, a box of patent thread a doz sps a spool of white thread
     -- some velvet tape to bind my coat &amp;c -- Take care of them till I come home &amp;
     make disposition of them -- Engage Miss Fisher to make me a suit of clothes before long -- I
     have not been able to find any shoes for Allen as yet, but hope I may yet find some - - Get a
     lot of candles made up if you can, <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> I do not see how you can
     are to get them or the materials for them. I cannot <unclear>find</unclear> my dress materials
     -- they are all picked up --</p>
    <p> We had a cavalry fight near Martinsburg, a few days ago, repulsed the enemy with much loss
     -- we lost some <pb n="2"/> Everything is quiet -- the enemy is in Harper's Ferry in force, but
     we picket to within 3 miles of there -- Old Abe paid the place a visit a few days ago and they
     went wild at the sight of their king -- We did not attempt to hold Harper's Ferry, we removed
     all our captures, burned the bridges &amp;c and then abandoned the place -- the enemy soon
     after occupied it -- The party that holds the Maryland Heights has the key to Harper's Ferry
     and so occupies it -- Our army is still not far from Winchester -- I am going back today, but
     am in hopes that I can come back up the Valley in a few days -- I was up as far as Woodstock.</p>
    <p> Mr <unclear>Bayley</unclear> was to carry up my bundle, I left it with Maj. Sam Yost at
     Winchester, where he is Quarter Master, and he promised to send it on --</p>
    <p> I have recovered from my attack of <orig reg="diarrhea">diarrhoea</orig> since I left camp
     &amp; have been riding about, and am as hearty as can be now - -</p>
    <p> Keep in good spirits my love &amp; hope for the best -- all will yet be right -- love to
     all &amp; kiss the babies </p>
