<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, February 29, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson gives details of a criminal case in which the jury returned a guilty
                    verdict despite the lack of evidence, and he also describes the effects of
                    excessive bail charges.</p>

<p class="p10">February 29 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular No. 10 Bureau Refugees Freedmen and Abandoned Lands
                    Series 1866 I have the honor to report that during the
                    month at both County and Hustings Courts several cases involving the rights of
                    Freedmen have been tried only one case of importance on the list, a charge of
                    attempted rape on the person of a colored girl by Thomas Harris <i>[added: colored]</i> and this was removed to the Circuit Court. On
                    the other cases the bench acted with strict impartiality but it was painfully
                    apparent that many freedmen had been held in confinement for want of bail, on
                    charges which were totally unsupported by evidence, and in one case, Commonwealth v. John Hughes for grant larceny, the jury
                    actually brought in a verdict of guilty, when the Corp. Attorney had charged
                    them there was no testimony against him. Hughes' counsel promptly moved for a
                    new trial, which the court granted, and the Corp. Attorney at once entered a nolle prosequi <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and Hughes was
                    discharged while the jury who had brought in a verdict of guilty were yet in
                    their seats.</p>
<p class="p10">I have appealed both to magistrates and the mayor against demanding excessive
                    bail from freedmen charged with trivial offences but they inform me the statute
                    gives them no discretion below amounts it is impossible for most of them <i>[added: (the Freedmen)]</i> to give. The consequence is
                    the jail is often crowded to the great cost of the county and demoralization of
                    those who have committed perhaps their first offence.</p>

                        servant</p>
