<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 8<sup>th</sup> 1860 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10"> Your letter was received this evening and I take this opportunity of answering
                    it.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to hear that Franks opinions upon political principles are undergoing a
                    change and hope that by the time he has a vote that like his brother he will be
                    an orthodox democrat.</p>
<p class="p10">As to the party to which I belong being disunionists it is a charge that cannot
                    be substantiated and I defy anyone to prove by our platform of principles or by
                    the record of either of our candidates that we are.</p>
<p class="p10">There are men in the party (of which I am one) who seeing that without a vigorous
                    effort we will be wrecked upon that shoal to which we have been slowly but
                    surely <i>[deleted: been]</i> drifting for years -- I mean <u>slavish</u>
                    <u>submission</u> to a mere numerical
                    majority. We hold to the principle among others that this government is not
                    solely the government of a majority but that the minority have rights that <u>must</u> be respected. To preserve these rights the
                    constitution was framed which puts such checks and restraints upon the dominant
                    power as the framers in their far seeing wisdom thought necessary.</p>
<p class="p10">But it is said that at this late day we have suddenly waked up to the idea that
                    we were not getting our rights in the Union and that the leaders of the party
                    were disposed to ruin the country for the sake of reopening the slave trade. The
                    last of these charges is a ridiculous absurdity
                    and could only been hatched in the brain of some unscrupulous opponent of the true States Rights Democracy. </p>
<p class="p10">Now as to the other question we have been battling against abolitionism in some form or other for many years. The abolition of
                    slavery has been agitated in congress ever since 1790 first came petitions in
                    that year for the abolition of the slave trade. Then petitions in 1805 for the
                    exclusion of slave property from the territories
                    Then in 1817 petitions against the slave trade between the middle and southern
                    states. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Then in 1831 petitions for the abolition of slavery in the
                    District of Columbia. In 1836 Calhoun declared that the agitation of this
                    question "would sunder the Union." "It was agitation here that they feared"
                    James Buchanan showed that the moment it was
                    abolished in the District that this Union would be dissolved. In 37 the contest
                    grew hot in the house of representatives and
                    there <i>[deleted: for the first time]</i> John Bell proved himself a
                    disunionist by helping to keep open an agitation which Statesmen like Calhoun
                    had declared would break up the Union.</p>
<p class="p10">From that time forth he has acted with the abolition
                    party sometimes openly at other times he failed to vote on either side -- at
                    others he deemed it prudent to represent his constituents.</p>
<p class="p10">Now on the other hand the party to which I am attached have always been
                    consistently opposed to all such measures. We (speaking of the Democracy) have
                    opposed the agitation of this subject in the halls of Congress. We have denied
                    the right to petition upon the subject because slaves were property under the Constitution. (Though Botts in his late speech here took the ground that they were not) and
                    could not be confiscated.</p>
<p class="p10">We have procured a decision of the Supreme Court in
                    our favour (Dred Scott case). Speaking of the power of Congress in the territories
                    <i>[deleted: Judge]</i> Chief Justice Taney uses these very words. "The only
                    power conferred is the power coupled with the duty
                        <i>[deleted: to protect]</i> of guarding and protecting the owner in his
                    rights." Out of the nine judges of the court seven concured in this decision. And yet when we incorporate this in our
                    creed and demand that Congress shall exercise this protecting power we are
                    branded as traitors by the very party who were loudest in their professions of
                    loyalty to the South a few short months ago. The party which declares that they
                    go for the enforcement of the laws. Yet when we ask to have this power which the
                        highest tribunal in the country has declared is
                    legal enforced cries out that we want to break<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> up the Union -- and
                    that we are a set of traitors who ought all of us to be hung.</p>
<p class="p10">We have been driven to the wall at last. As a last resort we stand upon the
                    Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of 98 and 99.
                    By them we have determined to stand or fall. Holding up the Constitution we have
                    asked to have the rights it secures us given to us in the Union. If we have
                        them we are the last people who would wish to
                    dissolve the Union. On the other hand we have
                    determined that if it is necessary that we should go out of the Union for the
                    purpose of maintaining these rights that we will do it. It is an alternative which we do not seek but as a free people we will not submit to having our rights taken
                    from us by that greatest of all tyrants a numerical majority. We will have no
                    more men like Bell to compromise our rights away -- compromise but invites
                    aggression. For one I am like Harry Hotspur "upon a matter of right I will cavil
                    to the ninth part of a hair." Upon the election of Lincoln which the opposition
                    I fear are making but too sure -- some if not all of the Cotton states will
                    leave the Union if they are allowed to leave peacibly the other slave states
                    will not be slow in following where interest points. If the Federal power
                    attempts to coerce them into the Union again the border states will not be slow
                    to make common cause with their more southern sisters. So that in any event we
                    will have a <u>United</u>
                    <u>South</u>. </p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to hear that all are well I feared that either
                    you or the baby was sick from not hearing from you sooner. There is no news here
                    except in political circles and even there the argument seems to move very much
                    in a circle. we start with the resolutions of 98
                    &amp; 99 affirming the right of a state to leave the Union and we end with
                    them.</p>
<p class="p10">Baylors proposition to fuse with the Douglass
                    faction fell like a bomb among us and I confess I among others was afraid a
                    fusion upon that basis would be acceeded to. Thank Heaven that danger is past
                    and that our <i>[illeg.]</i> electoral ticket remains untarnished with the name
                    of a single man who holds to the heresies or follows
                    the fortunes of that desperate political gambler Stephen Arnold Douglass. </p>
<p class="p10">tell Frank that I will send him some papers -- But that if he wants to understand
                    the issues in the present canvass he will have to read the long editorials and
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> contributions not paragraphs about murders.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you are about as tired as I am by this time so I will close. Hoping
                    that all are well </p>
<p class="p10">I remain your affectionate son. </p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.H. Cochran </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Give my respects to all. I have not seen young
                        Alexander and would not be likely to grow very intimate with him if I had.
                        Setting aside my disinclination to dissipate my business is such that I
                        could not get time for it. Excuse mistakes and blots as there is a political
                        discussion going on in this room now and I have been party in it ever since
                        before I commenced to write.<br> J.H.C. <br> Oct. 9 I open this letter to
                        ask you to preserve these two papers which I send to Frank. I value them on
                        account of Mr. Seddons able letter. It is well
                        worth reading </p>
