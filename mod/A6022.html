<p class="p10">Sept 3d, 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">General-</p>
<p class="p10">I send out today four (4) horse wagons and and two horse wagons &amp; harness, all
     property which I have directed to be turned over to your command, part of them loaded with corn
     for Greenbrier River. Do me the favor to write me if it will be necessary to impress additional
     transportation if I can send you 6 to 8 wagons &amp; teams <i>[unclear: along]</i>
     belonging to the Confederate States.</p>
<p class="p10">I desire if you can do so, that you will demit the teams impressed to be returned as fast as
     I send out state teams to take the place of them. Capt. Hull, Quarter Master at Greenbrier
     River says his horses are suffering for corn &amp; it cannot be supplied from that county.
     He also wrote he wanted a large quantity of clothing of various sorts, which I sent to the
     Quarter Master General. He <i>[unclear: answers]</i> me that he has a very small quantity of
     clothing &amp; that Capt. <i>[unclear: Hull]</i> does not make a requisition allowance to
     support that. It would be well for a regular requisition to be put in for what clothing is
     required for any portion of your command, as winter is approaching &amp; the
      <i>[unclear: county]</i> you are now in <i>[unclear: requiring]</i> comfortable clothing
     &amp; c. Please tell me &amp; I will get any article that can be had, that is necessary
     for your command. Maj. <i>[unclear: Corley]</i> being on the other line I must hear from your
      <i>[unclear: company]</i> &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> like to be kept well posted as to your
     wants.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very respectfully, M.G. Harman. Major Comd.</p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. We have 100 Yankees prisoners here taken by Genl. Floyd near Gauley
      Bridge in the fight with Col. Tyler.</p>
