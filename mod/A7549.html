<p class="p10">Mt Solon, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">Here I am all alone with the delightful pleasure of answering your dear &amp;
                    truly welcome letter of Tuesday I was so glad &amp; thankful to get it
                    &amp; to hear that you were well. Every line written by your dear hand is
                    sacred, &amp; valued I wish from my heart that you were here this Evening
                    for it has been such a long time since you were with me. I looked for you last
                    Saturday. I thought you would certainly come, &amp; stay all week I did want
                    you to come so much but your letter Explained it all why you could not come
                    then. I am so glad you are coming Saturday if you live I hope the day will be as
                    bright &amp; pleasant as this has been then you will have a nice ride. You
                    can't imagine how much pleasure it gave me to have you say you never doubted my
                    affection for you. it is such a relief to me to know that you safely trust
                    &amp; believe in my love, for I do so entirely give you my heart with all
                    its affection that were a<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>thought to enter my mind that you for one
                    moment doubted me I should be very unhappy. Then never think that I do not love
                    you, &amp; nothing but a wish from you can Ever change my devotion,
                    &amp; were you even to wish that I should cease to love or think of you I
                    could not obey you, but would love you to my dying day Even without hope. it is
                    far better suited to my nature to love &amp; remember than to hate, &amp; forget those once dear to me. You must never ask
                    me not to love you for I do firmly believe that if
                    you should cease to love me &amp; would not want my love that my heart would
                    break, &amp; I would not wish to live without your dear &amp; most
                    precious love for it is the brightest sweetest &amp; best beloved joy of my
                    life to feel sure of your undivided &amp; entire affection. I never want to
                    think that you have Ever loved anyone but me nor that
                    you ever will love another while I live. it is my nature to be selfish in my
                    love I can't help it either. try as I may to be more generous I can't that is
                    just the truth. in very<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>truth I can't bear to think that anyone should fill your heart &amp; thoughts but
                        myself. I know no one does for your word is law
                    to me I believe the slightest word you ever utter for I know that you are
                    sincere to me in all things you say or do, &amp; it would be both unkind
                    &amp; cruel of me to doubt, or not to believe you since you have always been
                    so truthful, &amp; frank.</p>
<p class="p10">Ma, &amp; I received letters from Rennie today she &amp; her husband were well. Rennie write
                    that she loves him more &amp; more every day of her life. says he is such a
                    good husband. I am truly thankful that they are so happy &amp; they can
                    always be so if they will. Ma got a letter from dear pa Tuesday. we are still
                    lonely without him Rennie wants to know when I am coming to stay with her. I
                    don't know indeed when I can go, bless her heart I must go some time before
                    long. Hamie has come in to intrude upon my quiet with his studies for tomorrow.
                    We had a great time at dinner he wanted to make me read Rennie's letter out to
                    him &amp; I wanted him to read it to himself. for awhile I refused<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>but at last I read it <i>[illeg.]</i> rest Oh! I do want to see you. I can't
                    wait with any patience for <i>[illeg.]</i> long days to pass away before you
                    can come. it is so long long since you bid me Goodbye.
                    I shall be so glad, thankful &amp; happy to have you here again to look at
                    you, &amp; to hear you talk, to see you throw back your dear curly head
                    &amp; shake your foot, but I don't like to see you look grave, &amp;
                    unhappy, for then I think that I have done something to displease you, &amp;
                    that I don't want to do, for I do love to add to your happiness. I never wish to
                    give you one moment's pain, or to displease you about
                        anything. I love you more &amp; more Every
                    day of my life with all my heart, strength, mind &amp; thoughts I <u>lov</u>e <u>you</u> &amp; you only,
                    &amp; Ever shall It seems that I can't find words enough to tell you how
                    dearly I love you. Come Saturday if you live I long so much for you to come I
                    will show you then how happy I am to have you with me again. I hope God will let
                    you come to one He knows loves you more than her own
                    life. I do hope the fire will be burning brightly this time when you come. I
                    will see that it is warm &amp; sweet for you so you can feel happy &amp;
                    at home. All send love. I enclose love &amp; a kiss to you. God bless you
                    forever. come Saturday. I love you Oh! so fondly Goodnight </p>
