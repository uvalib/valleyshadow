<h4>Augusta County: Mary D. Williams to Samuel Hunt, March 2, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In his missive to Samuel Hunt, Williams makes an interesting assessment of the character of blacks in Staunton, arguing, "Having been conversant with freedmen in other parts of the state I hesitate not to say that the colored people here are not only far superior, by nature, to those in eastern Virginia, but have already made greater progress in knowledge than was made there in two years after their schools were first established."  In the final paragraph of the letter, Williams praises John Scott for his efforts to assist freedmen in Staunton.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
Rev. S. Hunt 
Staunton, Va. 
</b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1866</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">A glance at the statistics will show that the schools in Staunton are still flourishing and not only that but are becoming too large for the house that holds them.  Having been conversant with freedmen in other parts of the state I hesitate not to say that the colored people here are not only far superior, by nature, to those in eastern Virginia, but have already made greater progress in knowledge than was made <u>there</u> in two years after their schools were first established.</p>
<p class="p10">Much credit is due Mr. Scott for the untiring zeal with which he has labored in behalf of this cause.  That the people here<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> appreciate his service is manifest by the unbounded influence which he exerts over them and the great respect they have for his opinion.  It is also true that he is <i>[unclear: high]</i> esteemed by the white as well as colored people.  I have nothing in particular to say respecting my own school, excepting that they are making good progress + are exceedingly interesting children.  My night school is not as large as it was in the early part of the winter, as some have left town and others cannot leave their business long enough to learn a lesson.</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>M. D. Williams</i></p>
