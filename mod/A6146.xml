     <salute>Dear Beck</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I came to this place from Waynesboro several days ago, it is situated on the <abbr
      expan="Virginia">Virg.</abbr> Central <abbr expan="Railroad">RRoad</abbr>,
     <unclear>21</unclear> miles west of Staunton &amp; 18 miles East of Charlottesville, we now
     have all of our goods at this point. Samuel's family is here. as well as all of the Camden
     family. Sam went to Gordon'sville this morning where, Top Coffman <unclear>Kitite</unclear>
     &amp; Mahaney also are. we expect to ship our things to Gordonsville soon it is likely I
     shall remain at Greenwood several days, as we can not get Cars<pb n="2"/> to transport our
     Stores. I received your letter on yesterday directed here from Waynesboro &amp; was very
     sorry to learn that Mary was sick. I hope she is better again, should you write to me direct to
     Greenwood Depot, Albemarle <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr>
     <abbr expan="Virginia">V<hi rend="super">a</hi>.</abbr> &amp; if I should move to
     Gordonsville or Charlottesville I will have the Post-Master to forward your letter. As to the
     position of our Army <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Jackson is at Conrad's Store, Rockingham
      <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> &amp; the Yankees between Harrisonburg &amp; Staunton.
      <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Edward Johnson at Westview, 6 miles west of Staunton,
     &amp; the Yankees at Buffalo Gap in Augusta 10 miles west of Staunton. There is a good deal
     of excitement among the people<pb n="3"/>in Albemarle &amp; Augusta Counties. people are
     leaving Staunton as fast as they can get off. I do not know much to write about, my whole
     attention is occupied with our military Stores. It is likely I may be in Gordonsville soon.
     &amp; likely we may turn off at Charlottesville &amp; go to Lynchburg. How glad I am, I
     paid you a visit to Madison last week as Providence only knows when I will get to see you
     again. Should we get to remain any time in Gordonsville, I will write to you &amp; you must
     try &amp; come &amp; bring the children down, as I would like to see you all again, we
     are all so busy I fear I <orig reg="could">coud</orig> not get up to Madison, although I will
     do all I can to get up<pb n="4"/></p>
    <p>Tell your Pap I <orig reg="couldn't">could'nt</orig> get any plaster, as to lime I think I
      <orig reg="could">coud</orig> get plenty of it in Augusta, but there is no transportation at
     all for <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> but <orig reg="government">goverment</orig> good,
     &amp; even then it is hard work to Keep them far enough out of reach of the Yankees. Tell
     your Pap I should like very much to accomodate him, &amp; will do all I can to get them. I
     do hope things will assume a more favorable aspect soon, as I <unclear>apare</unclear> you I am
     getting tired of retreating all the time.</p>
    <p>I <orig reg="cannot">can not</orig> hear a word from New Market half of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     out of <abbr expan="New Market">N. M.</abbr> and in Augusta &amp; Albemarle, if you write
     to me Soon direct to the post- office, if you delay a day or two-direct to Gordansville-care of
     Capt. S. M. Sommers.</p>
