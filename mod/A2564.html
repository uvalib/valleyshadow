<p class="p10">Thursday, Dec -- 4<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Guiney's Depot, on Fredericksburg &amp; Richmond Railroad
      </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10"> I have just got to Head Quarters after four days of weary
     riding through the Blue Ridge, the hills at its base, the rolling country next and then the
     sand plains and almost interminable forests of the low country, landing at last on the banks of
     the Ny, by the side of an old pine thicket, and not far from the Railroad which you will remember we passed over after our ever-to-be-remembered freeze up
     in the Potomac at Washington -- We are 10 miles from Fredericksburg by the Railroad but any distance, from 15 to 40, by the road -- We are some 20
     miles from Port Royal -- where the Yankee gun boats are -- &amp; on the opposite side they
     have quite a force &amp; also opposite Fredericksburg -- Gen. Lee is within four miles of
      Fredericksburg -- No news of any importance to write. I was much
     fatigued by my ride, and thought I would be laid up -- but I stood it, and am now better --
     wish I had put some pickles in my pockets -- but there is a plenty of cider here and I will
     drink that until the jaundice disappears -- I have not seen the Gen. yet and do not know what
     he wants, but will see him tonight and add a few words before the mail closes -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Night. My Dear -- I have seen the General -- dined with him today, and my fate is sealed for
     the present -- as I anticipated -- he wants a map of the Adjoining country here, so good bye to
     home and the Valley for the present but I am in hopes that something will turn up so I can come
     yet -- where there is a will there is a way, and my will is strong enough in a conscience -- I
     hope we may not stay here always -- but soon get through with it -- All concur in the opinion
     that this is a hard country and hope we may not have to stay here long - - Boswell is away
     tearing up Railroad and I have not seen him, but will write in a day
     or two about the eatings -- I got here with most of my crackers and two apples for the Gen --
     which was all I expected -- I hope you will patiently await my coming and not "get blue" or let
     anything trouble you that you can avoid -- our great trouble swallows up all others -- and I
     hope that we may, in God's good Providence, soon finish this and long live to enjoy that which
     has been so dearly bought -- at such a sacrifice of blood and treasure -- The Yankee gunboats
     can not get up to Fredericksburg and the banks are so high they can only fire over one by
     hugging the other, and it is thought our sharpshooters will be able to pick the men off the
     decks if they come up for -- Secure for yourself all the butter you make and buy some more too
     and put it down -- get Mr. Wooster to pack up your pork -- tell him to send his letter to me in
     one from you and I will attend to it -- Nelson said you could have one of the large or one of
     the small hogs in the pen at the house -- I forgot to ask you, but you had better have a large
     one put up with yours and so have enough -- Write very soon -- be of good cheer and the Lord
     bless you &amp; the children --</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate -- husband</p>
