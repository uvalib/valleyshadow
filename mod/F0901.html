<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure I set myself to answer your kind letter which I received
     on last Saturday and <i>[illeg.]</i> was glad to hear from you and I am well at present and hope these lines will find you all well. I would have
     written sooner but we got marching orders. We are just there where Joseph is buried
     and Philip and me is going down as soon as we can get away to fix up his grave. Tell Pap that D. Nole said that another man come and
     got his son that lay with Joseph and if he comes he can get Joseph. I
     seen John Mason and he said that James <i>[unclear: Fegan]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> is just below where
     we    are and he is well. I have    seen Marshall Donley, <i>[unclear: Wilem Henry]</i> and a lot more
     of the boys and there is a lot of them that we haven't
     seen yet. You said you <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> but if we <i>[unclear: owe him]</i>
     anything I don't
     want you to pay him for I think he has got
      <i>[unclear: enough]</i> you can see little what he would take in cash for his farm and let me know. You said that you sent a bottle of numbersies I thought you didn't think worthwhile to send me anything for I wrote
     every
     week and I don't think you did but if you think
     it is too much trouble to write
     every
     week I don't
     want you to do it. You never as much as<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
     asked me whether I needed
     any stamps. I have a few yet. I won't
     write til I get one from you. Nothing more at
     present but remain your husband.</p>
