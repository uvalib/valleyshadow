<p class="p10">April 25th 1865 </p>
<p class="p10">Pleasant Valley Md</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Jennie </p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 20<sup>th</sup> this evening and was delighted
                    with the intelligence that you are recovering your health - you have written a
                        very cheerful letter and charming in every respect
                    - my letters can never awaken the emotions in another heart that yours have in
                    mine and if you will answer me always you may expect to hear from me very often. I would gladly write you a letter every
                    evening if I could have one to read from your beloved hand. I wrote to you a few
                    days ago and before this you have met with a much greater
                        <u>surprise</u> than the one you referred to this time -
                    you will begin to think I talk very plain<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    but you must remember that I am getting old, sober, and candid I mean to say
                    exactly what I think but still I would like to hear that "Please don't" especially when I know you don't mean it all. Girls <u>very</u>
                    <u>often</u> say things they don't mean. Oh but I would love
                    to occupy that big armed chair this evening just as I have done in happy days
                    that have passed - I could talk till morning and the regret that the night was
                    so short but it won't be long till we are allowed that
                        privilege again if all goes right. </p>
<p class="p10">Capt. Littleboy told us today that all the men would leave this valley in less
                    than two weeks some of them left today for Washington and I understand from good
                    authority that they are sent home from there. this news is almost too good to be
                    true but I only hope it is true.<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> If it is not true we will get home
                    some time this summer anyway for the war is just about finished and the time is
                    near "When Johnnie comes marching home" to "the girl he left behind him" "with
                    bright laurels on his brow."</p>
<p class="p10">I am still working at the bakery but I expect it soon abandoned and Lucius will
                    be a soldier again but no matter now for the fighting is all done. We have had a
                        very sorry time about camp since the death of our
                    worthy President.</p>
<p class="p10">Now Jennie it is eleven o'clock and I am not in the
                    habit of keeping late hours you must excuse me for not being more interesting
                    this time and write soon to </p>
<p class="p10">Your Humble Adorer </p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>Lucius</u>
