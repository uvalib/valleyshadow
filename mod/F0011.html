<p class="p10">Dec. 2nd 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Casey</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I write to let you know that I am still in the good enjoyment of good health
                    &amp; hope you are enjoying the same blessing Well Cynthia tomorrow morning
                    at 8 o'clock we start for Fredericksburg to join General
                    Burnside's army. I had hoped to get home to see you
                    before we left here but now I can not tell when it will be that I may see you It
                    is in the path of duty &amp; in the proper performance of it with a reliance
                    on the God of battles we may hope to have him smile on us. &amp; yet we do
                    not know in what manner he will glorify his name by us, whether by sparing our
                    health &amp; lives for future usefulness or by suffering &amp; death.
                    Whatever is his will let us say thy will be done in submission. Let us remember
                    that the bows of God are on us my dear wife &amp; endurance all things in
                    patience. I would like so much to see the children too with our youngest boy
                    Jimmy Sloan tell them that Pa would like so much to kiss them all this afternoon
                    &amp; take them on his knee. I will send this by a man from Washington Co.
                    &amp; you will find in it the key of my Carpet Sack &amp; a receipt from
                    Express Co. The sack will go to West Alexander to your address. I forgot when I
                    started it to keep out the berries that I had not used I was keeping them for a
                    time when I would be sick, as my health has been good all the time I forgot them
                    until the Carpet Sack was started &amp; then it was too late. Maybe you will
                    have a chance of sending them after a while with some
                    person. The box you sent has not come yet. The doctor was at the Express office
                    yesterday &amp; it was not there. One of the doctors has gone to town in an
                    ambulance. He will see if it is there &amp; if so will bring it out. I have
                    had no letter from you for 2 weeks now &amp; I would like very much to get
                    one soon to know how you all are. I feel uneasy lest some of you may be sick. No
                    more just now Cynthia but I pray that God may keep you in his Care &amp;</p>
<p class="p10">I ask for your prayers for your affectionate husband</p>
