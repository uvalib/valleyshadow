                <p>In this long letter to his cousin Rachel, James R. McCutchan writes of the beauty
                    of the area in which he is staying, telling Rachel of a deep mountain lake she
                    should see one day. The letter also refers to several people McCutchan had

                </opener>

                <p>I <orig reg="haven't">have'nt</orig> heard a word from you since I left your
                    house, I have no means of knowing whether you are dead or alive. Though I hope
                    the "black rose" is entirely gone from your cheek, &amp; that you are again
                    well &amp; happy. Together with the rest of the family that were sick when I
                    left. I had an extremely lonesome trip through the mountains to <del hand="h1"
                    />, but as I gave Lizzie an account of it in my letter to her, I will not here
                    repeat it.</p>

                <p>I am still with Henry, he is getting well again &amp; I think will soon be
                    able to walk about. He is able to sit up ten or fifteen minutes at a time now,
                    though not more than twice a day. I have had a directly hard time of it. I <orig
                        reg="haven't">hav'nt</orig> had a good nights sleep since last Wednesday was
                    a week. I was so sleepy this morning after breakfast, that I <orig
                        reg="couldn't">could'nt</orig> keep my eyes open, &amp; I lay down
                    &amp; went to sleep I <orig reg="didn't">did'nt</orig>
                    <pb n="2"/> wake up till dinner was ready &amp; I'm going to sleep again as
                    soon as I get through writing.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Paine is a fine old lady, her husband is dead &amp; she has no children
                    she has an adopted daughter, Miss Hattie Early a young lady about six teen. They
                    are all mighty nice about every thing, real sanctified methodists. The <hi
                        rend="underline">circuit rider</hi> is here now. I don't know how he can
                    preach but from his appearances, I judge if I had two days study, &amp; a
                    glass of brandy, I could preach as well in the back woods as he can.</p>

                <p>This is a romantic place, if you imagine little <unclear>young</unclear>
                    mountains coming from every <hi rend="underline">direction</hi> with deep narrow
                    hollers between &amp; meeting around a dark ravine filled with some dozen
                    plain houses, you have a pretty <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> idea of Newport &amp; its
                    vicinity.</p>

                <p>You would laugh if you could hear the old woman squalling at her little <pb n="3"
                    /> "niggers" She has about a half a dozen attired in long <unclear>tow</unclear>
                    shirts slit up on both sides, &amp; nothing else in the world on their
                    backs. She is a perfect <unclear>termagnent</unclear> among the darkies
                    &amp; when the equality of her temper has been a little ruffled, her voice
                    reminds me very much of a thrashing machine in full motion, or the escape of
                    steam from a steam whistle. I suppose I'm too hard on the old woman, but she
                    will forgive me I reckon for the sake of a little <unclear>four</unclear>.</p>

                <p>Well how is l_e_d getting along I suppose she quit coming to see the sick after I
                    left, she is the biggest fool I ever saw I think &amp; I dont know why
                    somebody <orig reg="didn't">d'nt</orig> tell her so. I <orig reg="haven't"
                        >have'nt</orig> heard a word from my Dearie since I saw her a month ago, I
                    would like very much to hear from her &amp; much better would I like to see
                    her, though it is hard telling when that will be.</p>

                <p><pb n="4"/>I wish you were here Rate, we would go to see the falls &amp; the
                        <hi rend="underline">mountain lake</hi>, two great natural curiosities. The
                    falls are about 5 <abbr expan="miles">mls</abbr> from here. I have never been
                    there, I know but little about it. The mountain lake is 8 <abbr expan="miles"
                        >mls</abbr> from here on top of a lofty mountain. The top of the mountain is
                    level for some 6 <abbr expan="miles">mls</abbr> across at this place, with some
                    interesting ravines. This lake has been formed in one of these in the last half
                    century. Some years ago several small streams from the mountain sides around led
                    down into the bottom of this deep hollow &amp; formed an outlet through the
                    ground, cattle were salted here it is said in Summer a
                    great<unclear>-eat</unclear> &amp; in the course of time the opening at the
                    bottom became closed &amp; it began to fill up, &amp; it was 30 years
                    filling up to where it formed an outlet <pb n="5"/>From a little pool where
                    cattle were salted it grew to be a pond, &amp; from a pond it has grown to
                    be a beautiful silvery lake three <abbr expan="miles">mls</abbr> in <abbr
                        expan="circumference">circumferance</abbr> &amp; three hundred feet
                    deep. You can't imagine any thing more beautiful &amp; grand than this lake
                    on the mountain top. There has been a beautiful hotel erected on its margin by a
                    Mr. Porter &amp; not another house within six miles of it. There are several
                    boats there for the accomodations of visitors, but all old &amp; out of
                    repair &amp; a sail on the lake in one of them is not half so pleasant as it
                    would be in a a good skiff or sailboat. I stopped there a little while as I came
                    from <unclear>mission</unclear> here &amp; sailed out upon the lake in <abbr
                        expan="company">comp'y</abbr> with Mr. Long, when we had gotten about a half
                    mile from shore, there came up <pb n="6"/> a tremendous storm of wind &amp;
                    rain &amp; you may well suppose that we hauled in <orig reg="canvas"
                    >canvass</orig>, tacked about, &amp; bent our oars into port, we reached
                    shore without any accident except a good soaking. The water is quite clear
                    &amp; pure &amp; one can see down in to it for some distance. </p>

                <p>There is a high knob of the mountain 3/4 of a mile from the lake, from the top of
                    which you can see into Kentucky, Tennessee &amp; North Carolina. When the
                    war is over I am going to get married and bring my old woman here to see it
                    &amp; you may come along. Give my love to all &amp; Cousin Sallie too
                    &amp; write soon. Direct to Newport Giles Co. Va. in <hi rend="underline"
