<p class="p10">Dear Cousin Thomas</p>
<p class="p10">I have just finished a letter to Cousin Jimmie and will endeavor to drop a few lines to you
     although I fear they will not interest you as I have not much news to communicate to you We are
     all tolerably well except John he has not gotten entirely well yet has not worked any but one
     day he gave out and has not tried it again. Your fathers folks were well this morning father
     saw Cousin Billie in Newport. Captain Curries Company started
     yesterday I was in Middlebrook when they passed they all looked very lively went to Staunton in
     wagons, there was about twenty wagons I think. They were very well fixed, the best of any of
     the companies from about here, had their tents, knapsacks
     canteens and almost everything necessary for a soldier, the
     ladies have been sewing for them in Brownsburg for two week about sixty there every days and
     five sewing machines. We have been sewing for you all this week in middlebrook made 61 pants,
     your tents started today I do not know whether the pants went or not.
     I wish you were here to go in our bible class it is hard I tell but we will have to study the
     harder we have it in the session room now severals of the class have
     gone to the army but it is still increasing have from thirty to thirty five,<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley26b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley26b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      Mr. Junkin is to preach at newport Sunday evening I wish you could
     be there to hear him. Hugh Beard has come home. got home last saturday; he is a good-deal
     fleshier than he was when he went away; his mother didn't know him I
     believe; but I think he has not changed scarcely at all. He says the Missourians a fighting
     among themselves about half are for the north &amp; half for the south. The Militia has got
     orders to hold themselves in readiness They are looking for a call daily. and what will become
     of the rest of us if they are taken away. There was word came yesterday that the Lincolnites
     were to be in Lexington last night, &amp; the home guards all gathered up their guns and
     started up there last evening and when they got as far as Brownsburg they found it was a false
     report. Well I will stop for I know you will be tired reading this scribbling. Please write
     soon for we are anxious to hear from you All send their love to you. Give my respects to
     inquiring friends not excepting yourself. </p>
<p class="p10">I remain your Cousin.</p>
