<h4>Augusta County: George W. Imboden to John H. McCue,
                    January 18, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>George Imboden confidentially writes John H. McCue, asking McCue to garner
                    support for John Baldwin as the nominee to the Court of Appeals. Imboden also
                    discusses the upcoming Congressional elections and the possibility of a
                    convention.</p>

<p class="p10">January 18/59</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">I drop you a few lines in a business point of view" there is a great stir in this
                    part of the world in regards to the election of <i>[added: a]</i> Judge of the Court of Appeals. We have been at work during the past few
                    days in getting up a <u>call</u> for <i>[deleted: of]</i>
                    John Baldwin, you will see this, in the paper I send you. We had but a few days
                    to get signers to the call. Baldwin has consented to run -- and I want <u>you</u> to get up a demonstration in his favor in advance of Robinson. Robinson has announced himself a
                    candidate, I had a talk with Baldwin this morning and told him I was going to
                    write you, and he requested me to say to you, to see Whitehead in regard to the
                    matter of course you must not tell W. this, if you can get up a paper and get as
                    many signers as possible, and send it to me I will have it <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>published.
                    I think that if the friends of Baldwin do their duty he
                    will be Elected beyond all doubt, there will be Robinson from Albemarle Parker
                    from Frederick <i>[unclear: Jim]</i> Barbour, and <u>perhaps</u>
                    Thomas J. Michie" So you see there will be a lively
                    time" John I want Baldwin elected on various grounds in the first place he is
                    the best qualified man in the district, 2<u>
                        <sup>nd</sup>
                    </u> it would suit him, and third it would be a great thing for us <u>small fry</u> to get him out of the way, though you may think this a sinister motive, but let that
                    be as it may it is human nature and can't be helped"</p>
<p class="p10">We have a <i>[unclear: sick]</i> time in the Tenth Session for Congress Jim
                    Skinner to Harman J S <i>[unclear: Harris]</i> and a man by the name of Newman
                    from Rockingham are all out for Congress, and we will have a fine fight, if the
                    democracy do not call <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>a convention in self defense I think the opposition do not intend to hold a convention,
                    but the democracy are becoming alarmed in this county" they have good reason for
                    it, if Harman and Skinner both run they will divide the vote and by that means
                    will electe John S. Harris, and they both Swear they will run. I don't care a <i>[unclear: straw]</i> who is elected though, I will vote for Harman"</p>
<p class="p10">The only danger of the opposition<sup>s</sup> holding a convention is
                    this, if we hold a convention it will force the democracy into, a convention and
                    of course they will elect their man, and as it is, we have the choice of the
                    democracy and can elect the man we wish, otherwise a man from Rockingham would
                    get the nomination, and thereby we would lose the
                    representative from this county. Well John I was sorry
                    in looking over <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>the proceedings of the Nelson meeting to appoint
                    delegates to the Richmond Convention, not to see the name of my friend John H
                    McCue" and I want you to explain this matter. I would like to give you some of
                    my <i>[illeg.]</i> in regard to the nominating an opposition ticket but have
                    not the time now, but will do so soon. I want to write you a long letter and
                    give you all the news from this county.</p>
<p class="p10">I am going to Elizza's wedding on thursday" give my best love to Cousin Liz" and the little Boys and Kiss the little
                    girls for me. I will come to see you before spring</p>
<p class="p10">from your friend</p>
