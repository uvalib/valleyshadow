<p class="p10">Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">I have seated myself to let you know that I have got to the company safe after I left home I
     concluded that I would go by Staunton. I got to Staunton on Wednesday and remained there until
     the next evening. I was two day and a half coming from Staunton to camp. </p>
<p class="p10">Everything is quiet here, no yankees no nearer than than
     Winchester fifty miles from here. It has been quite warm for the last
     few days. </p>
<p class="p10">They are all well in Staunton except Uncle Archy; he is mending.</p>
<p class="p10">No sickness in camp of any consequence. We get <i>[unclear: pretty]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> plenty of hay and wheat now. If we could get corn we would get along very
     well.</p>
<p class="p10">There is a good deal of cavalry down here. One battalion of Infantry and a battery of
     artillery. You must write soon to me. I must close writing this time.</p>
<p class="p10">Your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Wise</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Address J. Wise, New Market, Care of Capt. <i>[illeg.]</i>
      <i>[illeg.]</i>, Co. F 17 Battalion, Jone's Brigade Virginia Cavalry</p>
