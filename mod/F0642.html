<p class="p10">My Dear Mother, </p>
<p class="p10">I let you know that I am well at present and I hope that
                    you are the same that of good health and you must excuse
                    me for not writing sooner the ink wells and paper are
                    so scarce that I cannot get any to write to you. my tent partners give me
                    this to write to you and also I let you know that our Regiment Reenlisted all but
                    a few that couldn't enlist. I couldn't reenlist so I drove a team at the time when they were at home
                    August the 12<sup>th</sup>, 1864 and I am in the Regiment
                    again and I let you know that our
                        Regiment wasn't in no fight but it was very near it. and we <i>[unclear: 
                        had very
                    ]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> our regiment came and we had to build
                    breastworks from the Rapidan River to James River and that is about 70 miles and I got a
                    letter from my brother William and he says that he is in <i>[unclear: 
                        Fort
                    ]</i> Richard and you must excuse my late
                    writing so that is all for this time. write soon </p>
<p class="p10">from your son </p>
