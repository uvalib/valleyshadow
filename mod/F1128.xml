                </opener>

                <p>I seat down to inform you that I am hoping that these few lines finds you all
                    enjoying the blessing of health.</p>
                <p>I have been looking for some time for a letter from you....But in Vain.</p>
                <p>I expected my watch as you mentioned in your last letter that I received from you
                    that you intended to send it by express. But it has not come yet. I mentioned in
                    my letter some time ago that you need not send it if you have not-you not send
                    it till orders.</p>
                <p>The talk is that we will soon get <orig reg="paid">paide</orig> off again. There
                    is still some talk of us furloughed in 9 months and there is some talk or rather
                    Our Regiment going back to Guard Duty but I can't see it.</p>
                <p>Did I tell you that Simon Shuman is in our Regiment-the one that helped to
                    plaster our house.</p>
                <p>I will send you a letter that I got from Brother <abbr expan="Abraham">A.</abbr>
                    and Ashway. They think in 16 months more they will be roosting for some time.</p>
                <p>I hope the war will soon come to an end. I feel very well satisfied <orig
                        reg="here">her</orig> and I presume that if I were at home I would be very
                    satisfied.</p>
                <p>Well, I want you to feel contented about me. If I never get home try to meet me
                    in Heaven.</p>
                <p>Write often as you can. I have no news to write at present. As soon as I get
                        <orig reg="paid">paide</orig> I will <orig reg="send">sende</orig> you some
                    money.</p>
