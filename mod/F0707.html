<p class="p10"> I take this opportunity to write <br> you a few lines as I told you I should <br> when I got to the sacred soil of Old Virginia. <br> I came here on last Saturday 2 week had no <br>
     trouble getting through as the <i>[unclear: weather was]</i>
     <br>fine. We had a pleasant trip <i>[unclear: took the]</i>
     <br> boat at Washington for Aquia
     <i>[unclear: [illeg.]]</i> Saturday <br> morning got to camp about 8 o'clock in the <br>
     evening. It is 17 miles from the landing at Aquia
     <br> to Fredericksburg. There is a RailRoad from the <br> creek
      up. We came up on that. We are<br>
     camped about 3 miles from Fredericksburg
     <i>[unclear: [illeg.]]</i> laying along the river yesterday. I was out on <br> picket. I had
     a right good time. I would<br> just as soon be on picket as in camp
     if we<br> could have some arrangement for sleeping.  We are just <br> now cooking Dinner.  We have
     some potatoes <br> and parsnips that I got in a garden when out <br>
     picketing.  I think it will make a fine dish. 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="/papers/images/BitDon1b.jpg"><center><img src="/papers/images/BitDon1b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     We have to manage a great many way <br> to make hard tack and salt pork
     keep<br> one alive. Fried crackers and crackers hammered
     <br> up and cakes made out of them is the <br> principal living I tell you I wish I had <br> some of the ciders and apples
     that<br> are in Cumberland County. I could
     do well.  There<br> is not an apple to be had.
     <br> I seen them sell <br> at Aquia Creek at 7 Dollars per barrel
     and retail at 3 for a Dime.  The regiment is Small <br> at this
      time. There was a good many killed <br> and wounded in the last
     fight and since <br> that a great many have taken sick. Those<br> sick have been sent off. All here are pretty
     <br> well and the health of the men has been good <br> since the sick have been sent away. I have <br> been well much better than I could have<br> expected
     just coming from home and going into <br> the hardships of camp.  When I came here the <br> boy had just to lay Down on the ground without even a blanket some of them it was <br> rather hard <i>[deleted: [illeg.]]</i>
     We have since got shelter </p>
