<p class="p10">Mt. Solon, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr D.H. Evans</p>
<p class="p10">I have never <i>[illeg.]</i> Good bye feeling as unhappy as I did yesterday
                    Evening because I know you were leaving <i>[illeg.]</i> with wrong thoughts
                    against me regarding our proposed ride. If you could have read my heart,
                    &amp; known my disappointment you would only have been pleased, &amp;
                    not disappointed, nor would you have blamed me had I told you why I did not go
                    then. It was not that I thought people would say anything, for what could they say about me riding with <u>you</u> nothing at all &amp; who's business would it have been but
                    yours &amp; mine? I am one who does not care what the world says, or persons
                    think of what I do when I know I am right <i>[illeg.]</i> I know it would have
                    been right for <i>[illeg.]</i> horse back jaunt with <i>[illeg.]</i> but the
                    holy Sabbath, but <i>[illeg.]</i> reason I did not go. I will tell you <i>[deleted: ]</i> the truth why I did not, when you come Saturday a week,
                    &amp; nothing but the truth then you will say you did me wrong by thinking
                        as<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>you did I knew just what you would say about it that was why I
                    cried it grieved my very heart to have you misjudge me when I <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    it &amp; you will say so when I tell you <i>[illeg.]</i> the world was
                    against you knowing <i>[illeg.]</i> do it would not keep me from giving <i>[deleted: ]</i>, or from loving you, no I would only love you the more,
                    &amp; go with you the oftener if that was the case, but it is not, for all
                    speak highly of you who know you. I would neither Thank, nor respect the person
                    (if my own dear father) who would come to me, &amp; say one word of
                    unkindness against you, I could never esteem them again, nor would I have them
                    for a friend, that is my way of doing for those I love I don't like any one who
                    says any thing about them that is not just. If I could see your heart, &amp;
                    read there that you truly believe <i>[illeg.]</i> was not what you said that
                    kept me <i>[illeg.]</i> riding, it would lift such a heavy <i>[illeg.]</i> my
                    heart. I would write you why I <i>[illeg.]</i> but I would rather tell you so I
                    could <i>[illeg.]</i> you, &amp; have your answer from your mouth you will
                    laugh &amp; call me <u>vain</u>. Ma told me to tell you
                    that when you come she will tell you her self<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>&amp; so will I, it
                    will not make you angry for you will then know why I said it was for your own
                    dear sake that I did not <i>[illeg.]</i> I loved you so truly. This <i>[deleted: ]</i> talk to you now but I will <i>[illeg.]</i> go <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    when you arrive, &amp; will tell you <i>[illeg.]</i> did not go to church
                    whilst <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; that was for your sake too, as you shall hear
                    I know you will not love me less but love me more than
                    Ever. bless Ma she has been talking about you all day, says, she is afraid you
                    are in your store with no fire to warm you this cold damp day. Oh! how much I
                    would love to be with you today I feel so lonely,
                    &amp; unhappy. If I could see you now I would tell you all but I must wait
                    til you come which will seem ages to me two weeks Ma says you must come then, if
                    you don't come in a buggy just so you come, if you come in a conveyance of your
                    own we will if we <i>[illeg.]</i> go to Mossy Creek church. I will not <i>[deleted: ]</i> then indeed I will not I love <i>[illeg.]</i> you &amp; I
                    do not go with any gentlemen <i>[illeg.]</i> not since I loved you. I would
                        <i>[unclear: no]</i><i>[illeg.]</i> you <u>in</u>
                    <u>an</u>y <u>thin</u>g because I love you
                    too well for that &amp; some day if we live you will see &amp; know that
                    I have not. I could not rest for thinking of what<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>you said. I went off
                    to myself to cry &amp; grieve after you left <i>[deleted: ]</i> not told you the truth when you <i>[illeg.]</i> never do so
                    again but will <i>[illeg.]</i> will understand &amp;
                        <i>[unclear: no]</i><i>[illeg.]</i> I was so anxious to put <i>[deleted: ]</i> from you in the subject that <i>[illeg.]</i> Friday's mail to <i>[illeg.]</i>

                    for that. Ma says the exercise you have been taking in your rides down here has

                    your patience <i>[unclear: long]</i> enough in many ways. I could see that <i>[deleted: ]</i> so often have I done so, &amp; you <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    complained. I do think you are the best <i>[illeg.]</i> the world, you
