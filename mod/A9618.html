<p class="p10">Dear friend</p>
<p class="p10">I take my pen in hand to inform you that I am still alive yet as I have not heard from you yet I thought that I would drop you a few
                        lines
                    again If you get this I would like to hear from you if not <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    would send it back that is if you dont intend to answer
                    it to send <i>[added: it back]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">There is nothing of interest
                    in camp to day. The weather is very fine now and we are looking for the Yankees to advance now.</p>
<p class="p10">We have a good deal of sickness now <i>[illeg.]</i> is principally
                    Cold.</p>

                    when I was at home but <i>[unclear: I was]</i>
                    confined at <i>[unclear: home so]</i> close that did
                    not get any <i>[unclear: lase]</i> that I <i>[unclear: waned]</i> but I am in
                        hopes that I will see you
                    before long. We have live time of it on picket there is some nice gals down here
                    but not so nice as the Augusta Girls. I got the gloves
                    of Miss Sabley <i>[illeg.]</i> is there any talk of her
                    get <i>[illeg.]</i> now how is Mises <i>[unclear: Molley]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> is Will in the army <i>[illeg.]</i> and
                    has George Thope
                    gone back <i>[illeg.]</i> I will close
                    <i>[deleted: Goodby]</i>.</p>
