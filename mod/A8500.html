<h4>Augusta County: Jedediah Hotchkiss to John H. McCue,
                    May 7, 1859<br>

<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jedediah Hotchkiss asks John McCue for legal advice concerning a suit against
                    Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss also writes of the pleasantness of the Springs, and shares

<p class="p10">May 7<u>
                                <sup>th</sup>
                        </u> 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Stribling Springs Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Friend McCue:</p>
<p class="p10">Today the sheriff showed me a writ of "Fi.Fa." directing him to cause to be made
                    from me the amount of the note for which J. T. Brodt
                    sued me-- I was a good deal surprised -- for I thought we had the matter safely
                    taken care of, and that we could offset my note with
                    his. How is it? How came they to get judgement &amp; what is the state of
                    our proceedings against Brodt. I wish you would,
                    immediately, write to me, <u>fully</u>, in reference to this,
                    that I may know what to depend on -- &amp; if you will not be over in time
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to urge the matter to a close I wish you would send over the
                    papers and instruct me in reference to them, directing what to do. If it's
                    "Common law', it's not common sense, that I should pay
                    him when he is largely my servant. Harman has never
                    sent any queries to me, and so I have not answered them -- I should suppose that
                    he could be compelled to try the case now -- after waiting so long. I shall
                    apply to Harman for his interrogatories &amp; I wish you would put all the
                    legal machinery to work to bring him up -- I tell you he is hard to head off on
                    anything -- as poor Skinner is finding out to his cost -- worse off the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>track than on. I shall wait anxiously for a reply.</p>
<p class="p10">We are having glorious weather now -- joyous May. The candidates for M. C. are in
                    motion too -- so life is stirring on all sides -- The contest though is getting
                    too much one sided -- Harris is decidedly gaining ground -- the Dutch blood is
                    getting up for the favorite son of the "Tenth Legion", I should like to see
                    Skinner elected, myself, but I see no chance for him. My school closes, in 4
                    weeks <i>[deleted: here]</i>, then, I shall go to Churchville and open there, perfectly independent, on the 1<u>st</u> of next September.</p>
<p class="p10">If you can do anything for me, from your region, I will be obliged to you. If you
                    come over <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>at any time, we should be glad to see you at Lock Willow
                    Farm.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you saw the notice of Bartlett's Marriage, in the Spectator. He is
                    making a decided stir among the Brooklynites as a preacher. They are improving
                    this place in a way that will render it very attractive -- making walks,
                    renovating cabins &amp;c &amp;c -- It will soon be one of the
                    pleasantest places in the mountains I had the pleasure
                    of hearing Everett, in Staunton, His address was just what I expected -- from
                    the man &amp; the subject. Of course "Old Augusta" came in for her share of
                    the <i>[unclear: honors]</i>. My wife joins me in kind regards to you &amp;
                    yours--</p>
<p class="p10">Truly, your friend</p>
