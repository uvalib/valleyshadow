                <p>I have the honor to transmit herewith the Statements of several parties in
                    reference to complaints made against me, and bearing testimony to my conduct
                    during my former period of service in the Bureau. Unfortunately for me, these
                    parties who make the statements were, with two exceptions, out of Town when
                        <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> McDonnell was here. I therefore take the
                    liberty (in self defense) to forward them to you.</p>

                <p>The statements, as you will see, are nearly all from US Government Officers, and
                    those that are not are from reliable Union men, and with two exceptions are from
                    men who were here during the whole of my former period of service, and
                    consequently I think much better qualified to judge of my conduct that several
                    who have given their testimony on the other side, some of whom were almost
                    entire strangers to me, and not only me but to the whole community.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I also beg leave to refer you to the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James
                    Mitchel who came here early in the Spring of 1866, as a Preacher, under the
                    Baltimore Conference, <abbr expan="Methodist Episcopal">M. E.</abbr> Church, and
                    remained until about four weeks ago, when he went to Richmond and (I suppose) is
                    now a local Preacher there. Mr Mitchel is an <hi rend="underline">Illinois</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">man</hi>, and was for several years commissioner of the
                    American Colonization and Emigration Society, under the <hi rend="underline"
                        >lamented</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">Lincoln</hi> at Washington D.C.</p>

                <p>I regard it as somewhat important that you should see him and talk with him face
                    to face upon this subject, and hope you will be avail yourself of the
                    opportunity to do so if it is in your power.</p>
