<p class="p10">January the 5
                        1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">I now sit down to answer your letter of the 13 and 15
                        which I received on Christmas eve and I was glad to hear from you and that you were
                    well thank god we are all well but
                    grandmother is not so
                    well as she used to be She can't
                    eat as hearty as when you were at home She is not to
                    say sick but naturally
                    worn out with old age She can scarcely get to the table any more I think
                    she will
                    naturally die with old age the rest of the friends are all well as far as I
                        know of None
                    down at Christmas
                    except
                    uncle Jacob <i>[unclear: Joseph]</i>. I had a lonesome
                    Christmas not like the Christmas we used to have. Nobody seem to enjoy
                    Christmas but the blacks they had parties all round and mine have been frolicking all the time til to today. <i>[unclear: Lonis]</i> is going to Richmond with 250 others from this county to
                        work on the fortifications
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for two month around Richmond I hope that they
                    won't
                    need them. I think the Yankees
                    were
                    whipped too bad at Fredericksburg to try to get to Richmond
                        again. I suppose you
                        will
                    see
                    they have been
                    worse
                    whipped in Tennessee
                    since it is said
                    they have got the worst whip of
                    all since the war commenced
                    I hope they
                    will
                    soon stop this unnatural war
                        none of our friends or neighbors were killed at the
                        fight at Fredericksburg we have a mighty
                    dry winter so far and warm we
                    only had 8 or 10 days very cold weather yet it was
                    very cold and the snow was about two
                    inches
                    deep it just
                    dried up did not wet the ground any the ice was 4 or 5
                    inches thick then it all of a sudden got warm and
                        dry as sudden changes as
                        were you are right is a dry winter the roads are as solid
                    as in summer
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>and dusty the grain
                    fields look like fallow ground don't
                    look
                    green like last year good many
                    people
                    could not plow this fall
                    so
                    there is not as much seeded as
                        would
                    have
                    been. I <i>[unclear: rode]</i> out as you
                    <i>[unclear: hel]</i> I still have my wheat
                    some 350 or 400 hundred bushels
                    wheat is from 3 to 4 dollars per bushel
                    corn a bout the same and every thing in proportion the 6 I now will
                    close my letter we today killed our beef it commenced to rain but it has quit again we have a great deal of cloudy
                    weather but little rain the
                    boys heard
                    heavy
                    cannonading this morning
                    in the direction of Fredericksburg. Daniel's
                    arm is still not well the ball
                    still in he is poulticing it
                    it is open now on the opposite side. I think it will
                    come out but it may be some time yet some little of the
                        patching came out today and he vaccinated himself his arm is quite sore from it the
                        smallpox is about Staunton people are all <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>vaccinating
                    for the kind pox it makes Daniel right sick you wanted to know
                    what I had to give for Daniels substitute. I had to give a big price I gave
                    the <i>[unclear: coly]</i>
                    town property and three
                    hundred dollars cash money a person to be no object I got such a substitute that there
                    will be no
                    dispute about a great
                    many of the people
                    will have a good deal of trouble about their substitutes
                        some
                    will have to go themselves or get
                        another one again as
                        there was a great
                    deal of defraud practiced it
                        would
                    been better from first that
                        no
                    foreigners had been
                    <i>[unclear: cakeing]</i> for they all run off
                    what day you have to pay for your board now and day you get your pay if I had of knowing you needed
                    any money I could of sent some to you with Mr Slie. I certainly
                    would
                    come out if I could
                    leave grandmother for I would
                    like to see that country god
                    only knows
                    what may happen this year
                    which we just have entered in
                    I wish you a happy new year
                    great
                    prosperity in your case in
                    day good for our
                    fellow men give my respect to
