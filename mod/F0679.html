<p class="p10">February 12<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near New Bern N.C.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sister Lizzie </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 2<sup>nd</sup> inst. was received yesterday afternoon And I was very glad to
                    hear that you were all well at home I wrote to Sister Mollie and sent it with
                    the Captain. I suppose you have received it by this time. I was Sorry to See the
                    Captain go home after being So long together. But
                    he is getting old and I think he has done Enough for his Country. I suppose he
                    has had a busy time talking<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Since he got home. There is nothing of
                    importance going on here. The expedition that left here under General Foster has not returned yet. We have moved into
                    Barracks and live very nice. My quarters are got up very nice. I have one room
                    to myself about a large as mothers room upstairs, with a Stove in it, and a Small lumber
                    room. And we are playing soldier in Style now. I am Regimental Officer of the
                    day today and have an orderly to do my Errands. I got
                    white gloves for all company A. the other day and they came out in Style. The
                    weather is warm and we are having a pleasant time. I wish you all could be here
                    and see how nice we live. I would like to See you all<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> at home. But I
                    think that that I will not be able to do for Some time. I would like to See this
                    war at an End but I am afraid that it will be Some time before it is over. We
                    received two months pay on the last day of January. I did not Send any home this
                    time as my Expenses were pretty large Since we were paid in October. We expect
                    to get two months more in a few days. We presented Colonel Maxwell with a Sword on Sunday Evening which cost $150.<sup>00</sup> dollars. It was a very nice one, he is very much
                    pleased with it. We are expecting Colonel <i>[unclear: Lehman]</i> back today. But I am not very anxious to See him. If he
                    remains in Command I think I will go home for I will not Serve under a tyrant
                    and a Coward like him. And there is not an<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Officer in the Regiment
                    that will Serve under him. I believe that I have
                    nothing more to write at present. Remember me to Captain Laughlin and tell him that I am anxiously looking for a letter
                    from him. Much love to you all Uncle &amp; Aunt &amp; Mrs. McCoy
                    &amp; family. Write soon and often.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alvy </i></p>
<p class="p10">I will write to Father &amp; Mollie next time. I had
                        a letter from Levi yesterday. They are both well. I am much obliged for the
                        stamps. Alvy </p>
