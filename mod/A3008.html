<h4>Augusta County: Samuel Franklin Carson to
                         Unknown (probably Annie Harris), September 30, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carson writes to someone, almost certainly Annie Harris, about his army's
                         recent preparations to defend against a Yankee force. He expresses some
                         doubt about whether he will survive this encounter which will take place
                         somewhere along the "Rapidan river" near "Orange C.H."</p>

<p class="p10">Sunday evening Sept 30<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">
                              <u>Dearest</u>
                              <u>One</u>
                         </p>
<p class="p10">Once more it is my inestimable privilege to take my pencil in hand for the
                         purpose of writing you a few lines. We are now laying in line of battle,
                         about 14 miles below Orange Courthouse on the
                         Rapidan river. Came here yesterday evening. Since which time we have busily
                         engaged throwing up <i>[unclear: fortifications]</i>. The Yankee Cavalry
                         are visible on the opposite side, they have made no attempt to cross since
                         this day one week ago; this being the day they drove our cavalry out of
                         Culpeper. Our line is at present about 15 miles long, the enemy has some
                         three places of crossing. If they should attempt to cross at either or all
                         of these <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>places, they will meet with strong resistince I assure
                         you, as we have a very good position.</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter dated Sept 4<sup>th</sup> came to hand a day or two
                         previous to our leaving camp; the envelope was torn all to pieces, and was
                         probably read more than once before it was handed to one, but if it was it
                              don't matter.</p>
<p class="p10">Since I commenced writing the Canons has commenced firing &amp; I should
                         not be surprised if before this time tomorrow we will have bloody times
                         here. A detail is just starting back to the wagons to cook rations
                              <i>[unclear: Mr McEllence]</i> has been with us for more than a week.
                         I heard him preach two sermons since <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>he came into camp. he is
                         staying with the 25 Regiment in the end Brigade.</p>
<p class="p10">In reference to the wedding you spoke of - had
                         not heard one word of it until I received your
                         letter. I then made some inquiry &amp; after some time found out the
                         Chap, well "that gits me sure" - you said for <u>half</u>
                         <u>cent</u> you would give your opinions. Now just give
                         it <i>[added: in]</i> your next &amp; I'll give you
                         twice that amount. I must close for the present as I am so cold that I cant
                         scarcly write. please remember me to all inquiring friends &amp; believe me to be <u>ever</u>
                         <u>yours</u>, <u>devotedly.</u></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Frank</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> Write soon &amp; give one all the
                              news. you are still due me a letter. I will write if spared, when the
                              battle is over (if we have one) &amp; give you the particulars. I
                              ask an interest in your prayers &amp; trust that the day of our
                              deliverance is not far off.<br> Frank</p>
