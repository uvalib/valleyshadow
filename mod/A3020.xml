                    <p> It is now late in the night &amp; we are in <add hand="h1"
                              place="inline">a</add> dark &amp; dreary part of the world, <orig
                              reg="with">whith</orig> gloomy prospects before us - but not
                         withstanding all these things, I will devote a few moments in answering
                         your kind favor of <abbr expan="April">Apr</abbr> 13<hi rend="super"
                         >th</hi> which I received at New Market on day before yesterday. I hardly
                         know what to write about, as we are now leaving our <hi rend="underline"
                              >beloved</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">valley</hi> to the mercy of the Yankees. But we have
                         certainly left - &amp; are now on our way across the Blue Ridge. I
                         suppose to join <orig reg="Johnson's">Johnsons</orig> Army. In a few more
                         days you may expect to hear of <add hand="h1" place="inline">a</add> big
                              fight<pb n="2"/> somewhere. I will not trouble you with any more war
                         news at present. But will say a word in answer to something you said in
                         your letter. You spoke of being forced to come to a certain conclusion but
                         you did not say what it was. Well I have imagined to myself what that
                         conclusion was &amp; from what cause <add hand="h1" place="inline">you
                              came to it</add> I am <unclear>truly</unclear> at a loss to know. You
                         have made such declarations before &amp; I assure you you do me great
                         injustice. I hope therefore that you will give yourself no more <hi
                              rend="underline">uneasiness</hi> on that subject, unless it is your
                         pleasure to do so - please excuse this hasty note &amp; I will if
                              <unclear>prompted</unclear><pb n="3"/> write you again at my earliest
                         opportunity. I wrote you twice since I left but suppose you did not receive
                         either from the <unclear>tenor</unclear> of your last. I must bring this to
                         a close for the present with a hope (however faint it may be) of hearing
                         from you soon again. But if the Yankees get up the valley so as to cut off
                         communication Remember that you will still be remembered most
                         affectionately by your absent friend <del rend="none" hand="h1"/><lb/> Tony_<lb/> The
                         Boys are generally well &amp; in fine spirits. My love to all &amp;
