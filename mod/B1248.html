<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. H. Remington to
                    Orlando Brown, June 18, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Remington files his quarterly report about conditions in the 6th District.
                    Regarding Augusta County, he comments on the low wages earned by black laborers,
                    the inability to receive justice in the civil courts, the progress being made in
                    registering married couples and the flourishing condition of the schools. He
                    also comments on George Cook's abilities as Agent.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 18th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester </p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to inform you that I have completed the inspection required by
                    letter of Instruction No. 3 Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands
                    Headquarters, Assistant Commissioner
                    State of Virginia, Richmond June 7th 1866, and would
                    respectfully submit the following report.</p>
<p class="p10">Sub District "A", comprises the Counties of Alleghany and Bath, Captain Cha<sup>s</sup> Wolff Veterans' Reserve Corps
                    Assisant Superintendent with Office at
                    Covington, Alleghany County.</p>
<p class="p10">Captain Wolff, the pioneer officer of the Bureau at
                    Covington, has been on duty there about two months. The amount of business
                    transacted by him is small, the sub district containing comparatively few
                    freedpeople. No records have been kept except the record of cases tried, and the
                    file of letters received. Upon the several subjects of inquiry specified in the
                    letter of instruction I am able to state as follows:</p>
<p class="p10"> 1st The General condition of the Freedmen is good</p>
<p class="p10">2d There is a likelihood that they will <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>obtain justice from the Civil
                    Courts although no cases have yet been tried to test the question</p>
<p class="p10">3d The records of marriages has been commenced and will probably be completed
                    during the coming month, a certificate of marriage is given in each case. Each
                    of the four paragraphs of Circular No. 11 are being carried out.</p>
<p class="p10">4t No freedpeople are at present chargeable in these Counties for support. The
                    authorities intend to support such as may become chargeable, but have not as yet
                    assessed the tax for the year 1866.</p>
<p class="p10">5t The supply of labor is about equal to the demand</p>
<p class="p10">6t There are no schools for the freedmen in this sub district on account of the
                    scattered condition of the population</p>
<p class="p10">Captain Wolff is an officer of judgement and though not possessed of a very
                    thorough acquaintance with office duty, seems well qualified to manage the
                    affairs of the freedmen in this sub district.</p>
<p class="p10">Sub District B comprises the counties of Augusta, Highland and Rockingham, Lieutenant
                    George T. Cook, Assistant Superintendent with office at Staunton, Augusta County. This is a large
                    and important sub District. The freed population though large in <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the
                    aggregate is small when compared with the Whites, there being about one (1)
                    black to four (4) Whites. The office records are in good condition.</p>
<p class="p10">1st The condition of the freedmen is fair. They are generally at work, but in
                    many cases for very small wages, barely enough to keep them from starving.</p>
<p class="p10">2d There is no likelihood that they will get full and complete justice before the
                    civil tribunals in the majority of cases, even with the assistance of the Bureau
                    in bringing their complaints to justice, and without such aid, justice would be
                    impossible.</p>
<p class="p10">3d About 700 couples have been registered as married under the Virginia Statutes,
                    and the registry is still going on at the rate of 30 or 40 couples per day.
                    Certificates of marriage are given. Each of the 4 paragraphs of Circular No. 11
                    have been or are being carried out.</p>
<p class="p10">4t The authorities express an intention to take care of the poor, but their means
                    are slight at present, and will be so until next year.</p>
<p class="p10">5t The supply of labor is about equal to the demand with a prospect of better
                    wages next year, rates $8 to $10 per month and board, and in some cases much
                    less</p>
<p class="p10">6t The schools are very flourishing, and <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> there is a great demand for
                    more. The negroes seem very eager to go to school.</p>
<p class="p10">Lieutenant Cook has been in charge of this sub
                    district about one month, and has been successful in his conduct of affairs. He
                    is well acquainted with office duty, is zealous for the welfare of the freedmen,
                    and attention to his duties.</p>
<p class="p10">Sub-district C, comprises the Counties of Shenandoah and Page. Lieutenant J.T.H. Hall Veterans' Reserve Corps
                    Assistant Superintendent with office at
                    Woodstock, Shenandoah County. The feeling towards the
                    freedmen, and towards the Bureau in this sub-district is quite better. The
                    records of the office of the Assistant Superintendent are in a fair condition.</p>
<p class="p10">1st The condition fo the freedmen is fair.</p>
<p class="p10">2d No cases in which the freedmen are concerned have been tried before the Civil
                    Courts, the freedmen showing a great disinclination to bring their cases before
                    tribunals from which the state of feeling in the community renders it hardly
                    probable that full and impartial justice would be meted out to them.</p>
<p class="p10">3d The record of marriages has been commenced in proper form, and certificates of
                    marriages are given <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>The 4 paragraphs of Circular No. 11 are being
                    carried out.</p>
<p class="p10">4t The authorities intend to provide for the indigent freedmen, but their means
                    are at present very inadequate. The poor house buildings were
                    <i>[unclear: burned]</i> during the war, and have not yet been rebuilt.</p>
<p class="p10">5t The supply of labor is equal to the demand, and the able bodied freedmen are
                    generally at work.</p>
<p class="p10">6t There is one school in the sub district at Massanutten which is thriving.
                    There is a demand for schools at Woodstock, New Market, Mount Jackson and other
                    points in the sub district.</p>
<p class="p10">Lieutenant Hall considering the many annoyances to
                    which he is subjected arising from the strong feeling of hostility to the Bureau
                    in this Sub district has conducted affairs with a good degree of energy and
                    success, and seems to show a determination to do for the benefit of the freedmen
                    whatever is in his power.</p>
<p class="p10">Sub-District D comprises the counties of Frederick and Clarke Captain Gilbert R. Chandler Veterans' Reserve Corps
                    Assistant Superintendent with office at
                    Winchester, Frederick County. This is an important sub
                    district and contains quite a large colored population. The only records kept
                    thus far, are the <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>records of trials before the Freedmen's Court, the
                    record of letters sent, the file of letters received, and the account of rations
                    issued.</p>
<p class="p10">1st The general condition of the freedpeople is good, they are industrious and
                    working for fair wages.</p>
<p class="p10">2d The likelihood that they will as a general rule get full and impartial justice
                    in the Civil Courts is very slight. In several cases the authorities have
                    refused to take notice of apparently just complaints.</p>
<p class="p10">3d The register of marriages is commenced. Certificates are given. The four
                    paragraphs of Circular No. 11 have been well carried out. </p>
<p class="p10">4t The authorities express an intention to provide for the indigent freedpeople
                    but have no means at present for so doing.</p>
<p class="p10">5t The supply of labor is less than the demand</p>
<p class="p10">6 The Schools are well attended and in fair condition. There is a demand for a
                    school at Berryville, Clarke County.</p>
<p class="p10">The general condition of the freedmen's affairs in this sub district is very
                    good. Captain Chandler is an officer of great energy
                    and well fitted for the position. The amount of business being large, the lack
                    of a clerk has been a cause of considerable embarrassment and delay in its
                    transaction.</p>
<p class="p10">. . . .</p>
<p class="p10">. . . The moral influence of the mere presence of the Agents of the Bureau is in
                    itself a great protection to the freedmen. In many instances threats have been
                    reported as coming from white persons, that if the Bureau should be withdrawn,
                    the freedmen would be made to suffer for the firm stand they have taken to
                    secure their rights under the protection of the Government.</p>
<p class="p10">I am happy to state that the most unreasonable hostility against the negro
                    schools is perceptibly diminishing. Besides the old prejudice against the
                    eduction of the negro, the hostility was increased in some localities by a
                    misunderstanding amongst the whites as to the manner in which the schools were
                    supported, many laboring under the impression that the teachers were paid by the
                    Government. The eagerness of the freedpeople to attend School is wonderful, and
                    in most cases the scholars are making creditable and in some cases very
                    remarkable progress in their studies.</p>
<p class="p10">The foregoing report being respectfully submitted, I have the honor to remain</p>
<p class="p10">Your most Obedient Servant</p>
