<salute>Dear Bro</salute> 
</opener> 

<p>The schools here are very much embarrassed by not having proper and necessary facilities.</p>
	<p>Mr Scott informs me that he ordered some <hi rend="underline">Lamps</hi> for Night schools some weeks ago which have not been sent.</p>
	<p>It is impossible for the teachers to work their large night school without proper means of lighting their rooms</p><pb n="2"/>
	<p>Mr Tukey tho Bureau Supt here does all he can for the schools but I think he is realy overtaxed by the numerous drafts upon his private facilities</p>
	<p>I wrote to the Committee some weeks ago calling their attention to the fact that no arrangement had been made with Mr Tukey for board of teachers, home rent or anything else and urged the importance of some arrangement being made with him at once.  This was done at his request.</p>
	<p>He now informs me that no plan has been fixed upon<pb n="3"/> and that thus far all expenses have been met by himself--home rent paid to next March, teachers boarded etc. by himself.</p>
	<p>I know how Committee do not intend to neglect Mr Tukey but he is entitled to their notice.  He has done and is doing more for the schools than any Bureau Supt I know of.</p>
	<p>Will you not see that Lamps. Bells etc ordered by Mr Scott are sent <hi rend="underline">immediately</hi>. And also that Mr Tukey be <hi rend="underline">properly</hi> informed as to their preferences, or wishes in reference to teachers board etc.</p><pb n="4"/>
	<p>Mr Tukey now does not know what kind of a <hi rend="underline">bill</hi> to present but having advanced money for <hi rend="underline">various</hi> expenses needs a remittance and I would recommend that you send him 150 to 200 dollars by return mail</p>
	<p>Please also send an Invoice of school books Slates etc sent here some weeks ago as none has been secured</p>
