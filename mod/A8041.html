<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">As you are aware I failed in getting an appointment to West Point. Since that
                    time I have been offered very flattering inducement by a gentleman of Iowa. for
                    the purpose of gaining and education and Mother is very anxious that I should
                    go. She told me to write to you. to know if in your opinion there is any
                    likelihood of an early settlement of those cases as she wishes me to go to Iowa.
                    as it is entirely out of Grand Pa's power to aid me as he has recently bought a
                    farm which he has to pay for this year. or to know if there is any Surety of
                    anything being realized from those suits. if that was Sure I might get Some kind
                    friend to advance a Small Sum for me. indeed it would take but $500. (five
                    hundred) for my whole education. You may think it strange that I did not get
                    information on these points from Grand Pa But he says he knows very little about
                    it. Please answer this as early as convenient you will also accept my thanks for
                    your efforts on my behalf in regard to West Point.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste</p>
