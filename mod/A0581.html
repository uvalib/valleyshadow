<p class="p10">May the 30 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Harpers Ferry </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 23<sup>d</sup> came to hand. I am very sorry that I
                    bought a pistol but I was forced to buy one because I had to go on picket guard and the men on picket. When two were resting one was going and they
                    have at night riding by bushes have been fired upon by
                    an unseen foe last night the officer of the night whilst going the rounds was
                    fired at but not hurt.</p>
<p class="p10">The things that are not in the pistol case I took <i>[added: out]</i> the provision
                    that you were going to send down. you can send it to the Harper's Ferry and I wish you would get me some coloured stuff and make me two shirts
                    and pack them in the box with the provision. also send me one of little cans of powder that Johnie
                    sent sent me from Richmond.</p>
<p class="p10">You ask me if I want more clothes I want none but what
                    I have mentioned above. </p>
<p class="p10">I am now very well and on duty today camp life is right
                    hard but I do not mind it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have tended to my horse very well and he stands it as well if not better than
                    any other horse in camp. </p>
<p class="p10">There is no news here at all you hear more news than we do. I am very well and
                    hope to find you the same</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate Son </p>
