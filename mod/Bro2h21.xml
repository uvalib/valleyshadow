<salute>Dear <orig reg="Emmet,">Emmet</orig></salute>
</opener>

<p>You may think I have <orig reg="delayed">de<lb/>
layed</orig> writing too long, but it has been<lb/>
caused partly by my waiting to get a letter<lb/>
from home, not having received one since<lb/>
your brief note of 11th informing me of <name type="person">
<orig reg="Andrew's">An<lb/>

Our stay in camp after<lb/>
the fight was but brief.  Marched again<lb/>
on 16th to a point five miles beyond<lb/>
Orange <abbr expan="Court House,">C.H.,</abbr> and in sight of the
Yankee Camp<lb/>
and remained there four
days drawing and<lb/>
cooking rations almost every day so as to<lb/>
keep three days provisions on hand.<lb/>
Yesterday we again took up the line of<lb/>
march and advanced towards the enemy,<lb/>
our route being to the right of the railroad,<lb/>
and encamped near a little town called<lb/>
Stephensburg.  This morning <del hand="h1">morning</del> we took<lb/>
an early start&mdash;crossed the Rail<lb/>
Road at Brandy Station and are now within two<lb/>
miles of the <name><orig reg="Rappahannock">Rappihannock</orig></name>.
The enemy are<lb/>
on the further bank for the purpose of<lb/>
preventing or retarding our advance, and<lb/>
considerable cannonading has been going<lb/>
on across the stream.  The Yankees <orig reg="retreated">retrea<lb/>

A cavalry skirmish occurred yesterday, in<lb/>
which sixty prisoners were taken and the<lb/>
Yankees routed.  Most of the dwelling <orig reg="houses">hou<lb/>

<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> Charles refers to Andrew's release from Federal prison
on August 5, 1862, as part of a prisoner exchange. He had been captured at
Kernstown on March 23, 1862 (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth Virginia Infantry</hi>, 41).</p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p> The events Charles describes are those leading up to the
the Second Battle of Manassas, which began on August 28, 1862. At the
time of this letter, Jackson's brigades had just fought the Federals at
Cedar Mountain on August 8, during which General Winder was fatally
wounded. Colonel Ronald took command of the Stonewall Brigade while
Lieutenant Colonel Gardner took over the 4th Va Infantry. On the 10th of
August, Jackson moved his men to Gordonsville, where they rested for five
days, as Charles indicates. Late on the 15th, the men moved through
Orange Court House and set up camp near Pigsah Church where they
remained until the 19th. For the next two days, they marched in the rain
across the Rapidan River and across the Bull Run Mountains, setting up
the flanking movement which Jackson and Lee hoped would trap Pope's army
and allow them to seize the Federal supply base at Manassas Junction.
Although victory at Second Manassas was claimed by the Confederates,
their losses were considerable: the Stonewall Brigade suffered over four
hundred casualties. By the end of the fighting, the 4th Va Infantry's ranks had
been reduced to one hundred (<hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 138-152 and <hi rend="italic">Fourth
Virginia Infantry</hi>, 16-19).</p></note>

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> The First Conscription Act allowed a conscripted
(drafted) man to hire a substitute to serve his term. This
provision produced much division and tension between the poor and the wealthy.
Often, a substitute would desert a day after appearing in camp, then
agree to substitute for someone else. The First Conscription Act also allowed
each soldier who enlisted for three years to take a sixty day furlough
each year (Current, vol. 1, 396-99).
</p></note>
<note n="4" id="n4" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[4]</seg><p> James J. White, or "Old Zeus" to his students, was a
professor of Classics at Washington College from 1852-1893. He was
commissioned as a Captain when Company I was organized on June 2,
1861, but he resigned on September 6 of that same year due to illness.
He returned to teaching at Washington College
(Bean 11; Robertson 1, 80). However, White's
correspondence of 1862 shows that he wanted to return to the service:
enrollment at Washington College was down, as only those boys who were
both exempt from service and could afford the tuition were able to
attend. White indicates in his March 20, 1862 letter to Colonel Reid
that he was seeking a staff appointment with General Jackson. It is
possible that he received some kind of temporary command, which would
explain his presence in the Jackson Brigade in the summer of 1862
(Turner, 87-96).</p></note>

<note n="5" id="n5" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[5]</seg><p> From August 19 to August 24, as Jackson's army moved
northeast across the Rapidan River, the wagons carrying food and
supplies were mired miles behind the troops (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>,
141).</p></note>

<note n="6" id="n6" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[6]</seg><p> Thomas Spottswood White was born in Charlottesville,
Va in 1845. He joined the 4th Va Infantry, Company I in March of 1862,
but transferred to the 1st Va Calvary on February 4, 1863. John and
Henry Myers both enlisted in Company I in 1861. They were both
transferred to the First Virginia Cavalry on September 20, 1862
(Robertson, <hi rend="italic">4th Virginia Infantry</hi>, 65, 80).</p></note>

<note n="7" id="n7" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[7]</seg><p> "Aunt Mary" may refer to Eleanor's younger sister Mary
Stuart, born in 1828.  According to the Augusta County 1860 Census data,
she lived on property adjacent to the Brooks family.</p></note>

<note n="8" id="n8" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[8]</seg><p> General Longstreet's units joined Jackson's brigades on
August 29 (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 148).</p></note>

<note n="9" id="n9" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[9]</seg><p> On August 18, Jackson had four deserters brought into
camp to be shot in front of the entire division. The men were
blindfolded and told to kneel in front of an open grave. The rifle balls
drove their bodies into the pit, and all of the troops were marched past
the grave, driving home the consequences of desertion (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall
Brigade</hi>, 141). James Andrew Riddel of Augusta County, a private in
the 5th Va Infantry, Company A, was one of the men
executed. It is interesting that Charles notes this incident right
