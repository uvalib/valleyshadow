                    and declares that they will keep fighting for if the Confederacy should lose,

                    <salute>My Dear Wife,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>About an hour since I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> your kind Letter
                    written at "Milton Valley," 26th ulto, and mailed at Luray <abbr expan="January"
                        >Jan'y</abbr> 3rd. I was truly glad to hear from you dear Rachel for I have
                    thought so much of you today from some cause. Not withstanding I have been busy
                    writing all day yet thoughts of home and the dear ones there would continually
                    flit across my mind. I took a long walk just before dark and ascended a steep
                    hill where I took a seat and surveyed the country around and conversed in
                    thought with you and the dear little ones. I even tried to bring my views to a
                    close about going to Mr. B.'s, but really I could not decide. I sometimes have
                    fears as to putting someone to loss or suffering of some kind. This I do not
                    wish and then I think I could pay the visit too without danger. Our Command is
                    now over at Beverly and will return next week when I shall put in for a Furlough
                    of 15 days. In the meantime you can make your arrangements to go to <abbr
                        expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> and if I do not notify you of my coming to Mr.
                    B's. I will notify you about the time you had better go to Richmond. I may
                    conclude to come there and I may determine otherwise. The fact is <abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> H. expects to be gone himself in February as he
                    expects Mrs. H. out everyday. He has put in for a 30 day leave. I cannot go in
                    his absence, but I am in hopes to get off in <abbr expan="February"
                    >Feb'y</abbr>. If not you must be contented until sometime in March. I <hi
                        rend="underline">think</hi> you will be in time before <abbr
                        expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> "falls" or is "evacuated" either. I want to get
                    home on account of seeing the dear little children too, and I have sometimes
                    thought I had better keep the Furlough until the way is clear next summer.</p>

                <p>An order came here since Rosser left on the Raid to get all his command together
                    that <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Lee wanted more Cavalry and if so it is
                    thought as soon as he gets back we will be ordered again to Petersburg. I am
                    disposed to think we will remain though as Lomax's Division has gone there. I
                    don't mean Lomax's <hi rend="underline">old</hi> Brigade but the new Division.
                    It is thought that Lomax going will obviate the necessity for Rosser going too
                    on his return. If we do go I can afford to see you in <abbr expan="Richmond"
                    >R.</abbr> better then than at home I suppose. What arrangements do you propose
                    making in going? How do you expect to get out? And how to return? And who is to
                    accompany you and all about it? Let one know how you intend doing for I do not
                    want you to travel about alone or unprotected. Give me all your plans and I will
                    let you know at what time to execute them. Keep all quiet, though, relative
                    thereto.</p>

                <p>I am sorry to see you had your ride on Christmas Day for nothing. I suppose the
                    man will not return until Spring, if at all. A great many of the men are off in
                    the same way - almost desertion. There has been no disbanding of this or any
                        <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> in our Brigade. Companies have been sent
                    on Detached service thus affording opportunities to get home, but no general
                    disband of any.</p>

                <p>I have been quite lonely for 4 or 5 days since the Command went over the
                    Mountain. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> H. has gone off for 8 or 10 days on
                    a frolic. Jimmy is off all the time hunting Corn and I am left alone in camp. I
                    have had very good company for 3 days lately as Marcus Irwin (<abbr
                        expan="George">Geo.</abbr> C. Blake - More's nephew) came here and is
                    staying with me. He is just from Front Royal and belongs to 7th <abbr
                        expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> but has no companion there now that they have
                    gone over the mountain and came over to stay with one several days. He is quite
                    a nice young fellow and improved much. Tell Johnny to tell <abbr expan="George"
                        >Geo.</abbr> Carter that Marcus is well, having entirely recovered from his
                    wound. We sent Henry out to hunt as some good <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for dinner today
                    and he got some Pie and Pickle which we relished much. I enjoyed the can of
                    fruit you sent me very much dear Rachel. My boots are a <hi rend="underline"
                    >fit</hi> and I thank you so much for your kindness dear Rachel, as my others
                    were about <hi rend="underline">played out</hi>. I drew a pair of pants the
                    other day and had them altered and am now pretty comfortably clad. If you see a
                        <hi rend="underline">first-rate</hi> opportunity to send the suit, do so,
                    either to Mr. Nunn at Harrisonburg or Mr. Bibb at Charlottesville or John at
                    Richmond. Don't fail as you might not go to <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr>
                    yourself. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> the socks, gloves and vest sent
                    by Henry K. for which accept thanks. Thought I had mentioned receiving them.</p>

                <p>John is still in the trenches and there is no telling whether he will be released
                    or not. I know he has a hard time and much to undergo. His salary as clerk has
                    not been stopped yet. Lucy seems well provided for so far. She wrote once that
                    she needed a couple of barrels of flour, and wanted me to try and supply her
                    again, but I find it an utter impossibility to do so. Early has issued orders
                    that no supplies can be sent from the valley.</p>

                <p>Tell dear little Justa that Pa is glad to know she is knitting him a pair of
                    suspenders. He will need them about the time she finishes. About next winter
                    would do if she can get them done by that time. I hope, too, that she and Lilly
                    are trying hard to learn so that they can write Pa. Tell Oscar I read the Letter
                    he wrote me and I am glad to see he has not forgotten his Pa. Ask him if he
                    wants to come and see me again. I think though, the next visit will have to be
                    made by Lilly as he and Justa both came out to see me and Lilly has never had an
                    opportunity. Dear little things, how I would love to see them all once more
                    together and be permitted to remain at home without fear of the Yankees. That is
                    one reason I am so slow about deciding to go to Mr. B.'s. I consider that if I
                    should get there and lock myself up in a house a few days, what pleasure or
                    satisfaction would it afford? Admitting that I might get in and out without
                    capture, what satisfaction would there be in it? I have not forgotten yet what a
                    dreadful time I had last Fall when I came from Petersburg and laid around to no
                    purpose. But if I conclude to come I will let you know, and if not will notify
                    you in time to go to <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> A few weeks more will
                    develop the plans and enable me to make some calculation about it. There is to
                    be a general reorganization of the Army I see and Companies and Regiment to be
                    consolidated. There is no telling what disposition may be made of us soon. We
                    may be thrown into some other command and a complete change of <abbr
                        expan="Regiment">Reg't</abbr> and Brigade. Gracious only knows what is to
                    become of us. But many changes must take place.</p>

                <p>You seem to be very despondent and think "the South is nearly done." But while I
                    admit that everything is apparently dark and not very encouraging, yet my dear
                    Rachel "the South is not nearly done," but I fear and shudder because of the
                    suffering yet to be endured by the people, and particularly women and children.
                    There is no stopping of this war by the Southern people, and as long as a man
                    can be raised to shoulder a gun it will be prosecuted and defended on the part
                    of her people. If not on the present scale, it will be by falling back from
                    State to State until the last man is subdued. You may rest assured of this, that
                    unless the Yankee government desist from their purpose of subjugation, this war
                    will never end. It is sad though, yet much more suffering than we have yet
                    endured is to befall us all I am afraid. We are to realize the fact that we are
                    engaged in war and that to yield will only make our condition far worse. I would
                    much prefer now to see us thrown under the protection of the French government
                    and as a consideration for her protection pay tribute of some kind. But I
                    suppose our authorities know more that I on the subject and so long as my family
                    are not in a starving condition I shall trust for this war to cease upon
                    honorable terms and not other. No submission to tyrants has ever been our motto
                    as Virginians. If the cause of the South is lost, all freedom of thought and
                    speech is lost and we go back into the old monarchical forms of government. May
                    the Almighty deliver us from our enemies and establish right and justice once
                    more upon the earth, after passing through this terrible ordeal, is my only hope
                    and prayer. He will stop this war in His own time and in His own way.</p>

                <p>But I will close on this subject with the hope that you may all suffer as little
                    as possible and that ere long the bright days of Peace may come and "we may be
                    permitted to sit under our own vine and fig tree without any to make us afraid."</p>

                <p>I am glad to see you have a woman and who is she? There will be danger of her
                    communicating my visit to the Yanks if she knew I had such an idea, would there
                    not?</p>

                <p>I have heard nothing from my papers about being detailed in my present place.
                    Suppose all will go on so until the Army is reorganized.</p>

                <p>Have heard nothing of <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> H.'s application to be
                    relieved here but suppose will do so as soon as the Command get back. <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Funster has <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and the new
                    Commander of the <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg't</abbr> will no doubt have a
                    preference of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> master. The officer <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of the <abbr
                        expan="Regiment">Reg't</abbr> think I will get the place but I have my
                    doubts, as I cannot swear and drink quite enough suppose. These are great
                    qualifications for promotion now and I regret that it is so in the Army.</p>

                <p>Kiss the dear little children for me and remember me kindly to all the family. Do
                    the little children miss dear little Da much and talk about him?</p>

                <p>Instruct their little minds as much as you can find time to, Rachel. May Heaven
                    bless each and all of you.</p>
