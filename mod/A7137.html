Rev. E. P. Smith

<p class="p10">Jan 12<sup>th</sup> 1869</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your welcome letter of the 8<sup>th</sup> came last night announcing the cheering fact of an assistant en route for the Staunton School.</p>
<p class="p10">I labored very hard last week in preparing a Lecture for the purpose of drawing out more scholars in view of the arrival of this teacher and also to correct public sentiment which was not sound on many school questions.  By the blessing of God the Lecture was a success, and the children again flock to the school in new platoons</p>
<p class="p10">You inform me that you have shipped bedding--This is<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> kind, yet you remember that in my last letter I stated that I had made arrangements so that I would get along <u>someway</u>--but it will be handy to have the beding  Last Saturday I road 30 miles in the rain to see about that Mt Solon School--but as the people only get together on Sunday there was no opportunity of setting any arrangement by which to secure the proposed $10. per month.  But I left it in shape for the people to do on sunday, and they agreed to send me word yesterday morning but it did not come.</p>
<p class="p10">But if the teacher is as you say a <u>volunteer</u> there is no risk in sending him</p>
<p class="p10">The people will undoubtedly board him.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10">P. S. If one of the teachers could bring a doz. Montieth Geog. No 1--and a few Slates--and Primary Arith they might be of use in the Mt. Solon school and would not make a bulky bundle</p>
