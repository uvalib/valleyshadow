<p class="p10">September 6.</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Philadelphia
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My dear Father --</p>
<p class="p10">I reached Philadelphia at 10 last night-- too late to
                    call upon Mrs. Carson who, I understand, was expected here yesterday. With a
                    view to surprise her &amp; escort her on her way home, I made every effort
                    to get off from New York in the 2 o'clock boat, as I
                    supposed she could take that train. I was 15 minutes too late &amp; was
                    compelled to wait until 6 in the evening-- I intended
                    getting up in the morning to meet her at the depot, but being more than usually
                    tired, overslept myself.--Please tell Mr. Carson of my efforts.</p>
<p class="p10">I saw Henry Duehler &amp; Mr.
                    <i>[unclear: Nead]</i> when I arrived, &amp; received Mother's letter by the former. This morning, I <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    received yours enclosing two others.--</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Jos.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Mchaffey]</i> &amp; William M.'s wife
                    are at the St. Lawrence. They came yesterday, &amp; will go home tomorrow.
                    They report all well at Marietta.</p>
<p class="p10">Andrew has been very much <i>[deleted: ]</i> tired the last few weeks, but looks well. New York is crowded to overflowing, &amp; our Hotels are filling up.</p>
<p class="p10">I have nothing new to write, &amp; must be brief, as there is an accumulation
                    of business to <i>[deleted: atte]</i> transact.</p>
<p class="p10">Love <u>to Mother</u>,</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        Edward
                    </i></p>
<p class="p10">Money is very tight here today. The market will be
                        unsettled for some time.</p>
