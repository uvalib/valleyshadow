<p class="p10">Culpeper Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I am aware that Ephia is no more, but it cant be helped. I dreamed
     last Saturday night that I was home, and that Ephia was dying. There is an astrologer in our
     company and he told me that Ephia was dying when I was dreaming, and he also told me that you
     wrote a letter to me, and it got lost on the road coming. he also said that I would get a
     letter from you tonight stating that Ephia was dead, and also that
     she got buried<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> on Monday the 7<sup>th</sup> inst.</p>
<p class="p10">dear Sister, it is over two weeks since I had a letter from you but the astrologer told me
     that I would get a letter from you tonight. I knew that there was
     something the wrong because I did not get no letter.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister if Ephia is dead, then the astrologer is a true man, I believe that, he told me
     the truth. if Ephia is dead let me know immediately. for I
     dreamed that I seen you, all weeping and mourning, and I also was home
     in the house when she was dying. if my dream is true let me know it. I am well and in good
     health and I hope this will find you the same.</p>
<p class="p10">your Brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Josiah Bloss</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I am in hopes that I will receive your letter tonight. If she is dead, you must not trouble yourself too
      much. if so tell mother that she must not worry
      herself
      too much for fear that some thing will happen to her tell her to take my
      advice.<br><br>dear Sister after your trouble is over, I will tell you something if you will promise me not to take it hard afterwards</p>
