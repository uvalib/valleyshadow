<p class="p10">Nov 9th 1870</p>
<p class="p10">Danville</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your kind letter of the 8<sup>th</sup> ulto, came to hand when I was
                    absent, and I have been at home only one or two days since, is the cause of my
                    not writing sooner.</p>
<p class="p10">I observe that your district went in Convention as you predicted.</p>
<p class="p10">The difficulties surrounding our state are great enough, without the trouble and
                    annoyance of <i>[illeg.]</i> in responsible
                    positions, many mistakes have been made in our
                    nominations this fall, but none has pained me so much as the one made by your
                    people.</p>
<p class="p10">I fear that we have lost the state through of blindness of our people. It appears
                    that merit and ability afford no guarantee for
                    success, but that the greatest blusterer is to be the man.</p>
<p class="p10">Your friends all know that you were
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the man, not only for your district, but for the whole state, and it
                    is a public calamity that the country cannot have the benefit of your services
                    in the next Congress.</p>
<p class="p10">I understand that Judge C. Member from your county is making great efforts to
                    concentrate the consolidation vote in his
                    favour for the Senate. A friend told me that he had seen a letter from Genl.
                    Mahone to a member saying that if he had the selection of the next Senate it
                    would be Judge C. and it is upon that letter that the forces are being
                    collected.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been so much occupied with the State Fair and other matters that I have
                    given but little thought to the subject myself. Know of nothing discouraging, my
                        friends say they are sanguine, but no one can tell
                    how it will go. I should be pleased to hear from you occasionally</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Your friend
                    </p>
