<p class="p10">July 6 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Folly Farm</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I will vary the general rule by writing to you instead of Mother &amp;
                         thereby give you the pleasure of <i>[deleted: w-----]</i> opening the
                         letter before you get home.</p>
<p class="p10">First I know you want to know how we are. I am very well only a little too
                         cold. Georgie is out here with me &amp; as well as ever. Mr Smith has
                         taken a great fancy to him &amp; says he likes him better than any
                         Cochran he ever saw. Willie is in Staunton I believe he is very well
                         &amp; intended going to Mr Swopes today- Howe
                         Peyton I saw yesterday<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> he had been a little sick but was getting
                         very well He had not been in bed at all.</p>
<p class="p10">The 4<sup>th</sup> was celebrated here in a grand style. The
                         Winchester company were here &amp; their uniform was that worn in 1776.
                         Buckskin pants &amp; large boots &amp; ruffle shirts. I admired it
                         more than any I saw at all. The Charlottesville company was very pretty
                         &amp; the best drilled by far. They were so much pleased that the Captain went off &amp;
                         left them all in Staunton. The dinner was in the bottom of Mr Grey's yard &amp; he invited us up to his house
                         where we took our dinner &amp; saw everything without being in the crowd at all<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Of course
                         there were a few fights All the Mickies, Harmans, &amp; Garbers got in
                         a fuss with the "West Augusta Guards", because a
                              <i>[deleted: Garber]</i>
                         <i>[added: Harman]</i> got drunk &amp; tried to
                         force through the guard &amp; the officer pointed his musket &amp;
                         threatened to fire. Brother Jimmie said out loud
                         that "he thought Mr <i>[deleted: Garber]</i>
                         <i>[added: Harman]</i> ought to be put in jail
                         &amp; his father heard it &amp; told Jimmie that he <i>[deleted: inter]</i>
                         <i>[added: took]</i> that as a personal insult
                         &amp; would see him, but Jim in his way laughed it off &amp; said
                         it was nothing but the truth.</p>
<p class="p10">Everything was very quiet when we left town
                         yesterday evening I suppose the Charlottesville
                         company left this morning-</p>
<p class="p10">The <i>[unclear: Carringtons]</i> got here Monday<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and are staying
                         at Mr Imboden's. We all went to see them.
                         Cousin Sue Baldwin invited them to her house last night. I don't know how
                         long they will stay in Town The Peytons are quite delighted with cousin
                         Campbell &amp; cousin John Preston; so much so that they have invited
                         them up every day &amp; evening since they have been here.</p>
<p class="p10">Aunt Sarah &amp; Lizzie are fixing to go to Bath. They will go some time
                         next week.</p>
<p class="p10">Has Monty Lewis ever sent the <u>curls</u> or has he
                         written about them. Maybe he <u>is</u>
                         <u>waiting</u> for the <u>money</u>-I
                         wish you would send them on by express to Uncle Ben Crawford - <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>
                         Last night we had to have a large fire &amp; this morning it is still
                         cold, a very great change from the 29<sup>th</sup> of June in
                         Charlottesville.</p>
<p class="p10">Aunt Maria got a ripe tomato out of her garden yesterday.</p>
<p class="p10">Georgie says he would have written before but could not get Pen, ink, or
                         paper at Uncle <i>[unclear: Miffetts]</i>. He will write while out here,
                         as I can supply him with those articles.</p>
<p class="p10">Aunt Sarah says you had better send Georgie his winter jacket to wear out
                         here How is the gas gotten on - Have you gotten the <i>[unclear: 
                              chandelier
                         ]</i> yet<i>[unclear: ?]</i> &amp; what kind are they to be? I do
                         not like the brass ones <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> at all. I like bronze ones with green
                         enamel let in -</p>
<p class="p10">The people in Staunton talk of nothing else &amp; last Sunday cousin Sue
                         Baldwin wanted us to go to the <u>Presbyterian</u>
                         <u>Church</u> to <u>see</u>
                         <u>the</u>
                         gas -</p>
<p class="p10">Well I believe I have written all I know. I hope to hear from home soon.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate<br> daughter</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mary Pastor</i></p>
<p class="p10">Mr John Cochran Senior<br> I was introduced to a Major
                              Washington who showed me General
                              George
                              Washington's ring. It is very much like the one our John wears
                              - only instead of him it had G W. in little pearls
                              -</p>
