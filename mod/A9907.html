<h4>Augusta County: John D. Imboden to Annie Lockett,
                    November 17, 1870<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Imboden writes to his fiancee to express his eagerness to marry her and tease her
                    about how her acquaintances react to the news that she is engaged to an older
                    man. He also describes some of the experiences he and his daughters were having
                    in New York.</p>

<p class="p10">Nov 17. 1870</p>
<p class="p10">Grand Central Hotel New York</p>
<p class="p10">My little darling.</p>
<p class="p10">I will not wait for a reply to my Keysville letter, but write to you because I am
                    thinking about you all the time. I wrote a long letter to Sister Lou last night
                    in reply to a sweet, but half scolding letter I found here from her of date the
                        11<sup>th</sup>
                    instant. It was in answer to my note from Richmond
                    sending her my picture before I went to Mecklenburg. I again urged her to <u>command</u> you to say March. And if she does, you are <u>bound</u> to obey your older sister. If you do not I shall
                    conclude you are not "a good child" as she said you were, and will not be a good
                        <u>obedient</u> little wife, and you know that would be
                    very distressing to an old fellow like me, who has been used to <u>command</u> - <u>men</u> - for I know
                    well enough women don't require it.</p>
<p class="p10">I reached Richmond Monday morning at 11 oclock, &amp; left for the city at
                    3.30 P.M.</p>
<p class="p10">The girls Jennie &amp; Russie are with me. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>How I wish you were of
                    the party. They are enjoying the sight seeing hugely. Tonight we were at
                    Hallack's Theatre to see the Serious Family, one of the very best comedies I
                    ever saw. The girls were so much entertained that they are not yet in bed at 1
                    oclock. I too am wakeful for I was sick last night &amp; slept a good part
                    of today, recovering from a bilious sick headache, the result of a cold I took
                    in the lovely woods of Mecklenburg.</p>
<p class="p10">When a woman promises to marry a man she gets very complete control of him. I
                    feel that I belong absolutely to you, and you could make me do the most absurd
                    things if you were a mind to do so. I shall not be fit for any very serious
                    business till this state of things is reversed and you belong to me. I think the
                    most sensible thing I could do would be not to see you again till I am to bring
                    you away. For I find after leaving you it takes me several weeks to think of
                    anything else. But on the other hand as I could hardly exercise enough <i>[added: self]</i> control to stay away four months, I
                    suppose I shall have to take the consequences, and ar<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>range my affairs
                    so as to spend some time in our company business in your wilderness region,
                    having headquarters at Lombardy Grove. I can't yet tell when I am likely to get
                    away from this City - not in all probability for several weeks, as I shall await
                    here the return of Colonel McKaye our President from
                    London.</p>
<p class="p10">You don't know how anxiously I look for a letter from you. Now that your heart is
                    mine I want to read loving words from you. I want to hear all about how you
                    feel. What people say about us, for all such matters are a nice day's sunder
                    &amp; the source of infinite gossip in the neighborhood. Tell me how your
                    old loves stand the dreadful news that you are lost to them? How many more
                    threats are made against my life? Or will you keep the matter secret and enjoy
                    the few remaining weeks of your freedom to flirt with the unhappy youths your
                    ilk? I don't care how many men fall in love with you, provided you don't return
                    the compliment - and I am not much afraid of that, as I have such unbounded
                    confidence in your fidelity &amp; truth.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Tell me that you wrote to Sister Lou - and above all tell me
                    everything she says in reply. Mr. Strong has promised her to spend next summer
                    with her in Virginia &amp; the North. I wrote her to come on herself, if he
                    could not leave so soon, early in March, and join our bridal party. I should so
                    much like to have her along with you to prevent the natural feeling of
                    loneliness you will have for a little while if no one of your family joins us
                    when I bring you away. An elder sister, and above all a married sister is a dear
                    sweet companion to a young bride in the first pangs she feels in severing
                    forever her ties of childhood &amp; youth &amp; going away amongst
                    strangers. I never see a young bride without feelings of the deepest sympathy
                    for her; for it is a great trial to part from all she loved so much and trust
                    her life &amp; happiness to the keeping of untried hands. How loving
                    &amp; how tender should be the husband when he remembers the sacrifice made
                    for him? You may come to me with all trust and confidence for I rightly estimate
                    my obligations and my duties to you &amp; no act of mine shall ever bring
                    one tear to your eyes.</p>
<p class="p10">With love to all, I am with my whole heart devotedly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
<p class="p10">Can you read this scrawl? My pen is execrable.</p>
