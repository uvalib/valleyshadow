<p class="p10">Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Potter called with me this morning and requests that you go to Colonel J B Baldwin and request him to draw up the deed
                    for the Lot No. 20 so that he can have his brother Joseph and wife Susan,
                    Sampson &amp; wife Sarah sign with him bounded by R. Turrel on the East.
                    Brown on the west. Turnpike on the North &amp; an alley on the South, etc. </p>
<p class="p10"> I will take this occasion to state that this lot is not is not one on which the
                    the house was burnt as I represented to you but adjoining it on the West. I was
                    not aware of this until this morning and perhaps it would be as well if you
                    would come and see before purchasing, yet in my opinion the lot is a cheap one.
                    Do however as you think best. </p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
