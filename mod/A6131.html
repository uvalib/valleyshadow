<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan 14<sup>th</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Ewell</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to write you a line to let you know that I am tolerable well at this time hope this may find you enjoying good health. This is the Sabbath Day and it is very
     cold weather here and I suppose it is still
      colder in Augusta. Well Giney I received your letter yesterday eve written the
     7 and although I mailed one for you the other day I thought would write
     again I know how it is with me I would rather
     get two letters a week than nearaone think it is so with you. I was glad
     to hear that you were well when you wrote but
      sorry to hear that Pa's health is so bad, you
      said you had hung your meat and wished I had
     some of it <i>[unclear: you]</i> need not be uneasy about that we have plenty to eat at this time. have had meat
     hanging in our cabin ever since our first boxes came to us<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">I boiled that ham you sent me the other day it is fine, we have three
     or four pieces hanging up now in the top of our cabin besides we got three fresh boxes yesterday eve so that we as
      much provisions as we can make use of for some
     time James Snider got a barrel of provisions Sent by his Girl Miss Holse near middlebrook. Thomas Beard got a box from home
     Wilson Cale got a box we have taken another
     mess mate in our mess Cousin George Cook he wanted to join us and
     we have taken him in so there is six of us now Swartzel Beard Cale
     Snyder Cook and myself and we are all writing
     at this time but Snyder he is sleeping, he does his share of it that is writing to his Girl, you wished you
     could send me something by Swartzel I am glad you did not do it because we do not need anything to eatwe are living better than many people are at home if I find we need thing I
     will let you know it is no use<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">have so much a head not knowing how long
      we may stay here, we have
     cabbage potatoes Beans dried apples green apples flour meal pies cheese Bread cakes Sausage dried Beef
      chicken dried cherries
     cherry
     jam
     molasses onions and everything that
      housekeepers
     generallyhave except
     women
     and children, we have baked some raised bread it
      does
     very well some times we bake biscuits they go pretty well, have been talking about going to Petersburg to sell some of our butter as we have
     more than we want or can use for some time to come you stated that there is great talk of peace in
     augusta I think it will all end in talk for this time from all that I can learn I see no sign of peace unless the South gives up the war
     that they will not do as long as they can keep an army it is no use for
     us to build our hopes <i>[illeg.]</i>
     peaceat this time so far as I can see <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">although I wish for it as much as anybody still I see no hopes for it both parties seem determined to conquer the other, the only consolation I have is that it will only do
     what it is intended to do so we will have to submit to it. and the more
      we
     can submit to it the easier it will go with
     us though sometimes it seems to go hard still it is our duty to
     bear it as well as we can, trusting to a higher power than any earthly for our help</p>
<p class="p10">Well Giney I must stop for this time Wilson is not done
     writing yet him and Sarah do lots of writing to eachother</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Nely to try and raise her pigs for her meat
     another year if you all <i>[unclear: live]</i>, kiss her for me.</p>
<p class="p10">So nothing more but remain your affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John P. Dull</i></p>
