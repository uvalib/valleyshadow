<p class="p10">My Dear Bro</p>
<p class="p10">You letter of February 9 has just come to hand. I am
                    surprised that you had not received my letter written some time ago acknowledging receipt of your
                    draft. We have had immense floods which I suppose have delayed the mails and at
                    this place we have instead of a Post Master an
                    incompetent boy who does not know how to send letters to their proper
                    destination.</p>
<p class="p10">I sold the draft for three <i>[unclear: prct]</i> just what it cost you so that
                    nothing was lost. Your letter came in the midst of a most interesting meeting
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and also one from <i>[unclear: S]</i> I am glad to hear that
                    your daughters are nearly through with school. I hope they will prove a comfort
                    to you and sister and that you will not have occasion to regret what you have
                    done for them. My love to all.</p>
<p class="p10">Yoru Affect Brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>A. B. McCorkle</i></p>
<p class="p10">If you have to give A Pct please buy
                        and send one. Yours Fraternally A.B.M</p>
