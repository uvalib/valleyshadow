    </opener>

    <p>I am spending the day in camp -- as there is no church near and the going is too bad, mud
     frozen so a horse cuts through, to go any distance, so I have been reading the Psalms and will
     now write to you -- I find it much pleasanter in camp than I had any idea it could be, in fact
     about as comfortable as a house, with a good stove -- if anything it is too warm just now,
     though chilly and windy without, and I find no difficulty in writing, drawing, or anything else
     I may desire -- then I enjoy the good warm biscuits that we have, with stewed peaches, coffee
     sweetened with the prepared milk we got at Winchester -- in fact I have not a word of complaint
     to make &amp; if I can only keep up a moderate supply of butter &amp; dried fruit I
     shall do well -- I <orig reg="thought">though</orig> the exposure would make me sick, but
     instead I have been getting better ever since I came back &amp; am now feeling exceedingly
     well and think I shall fatten on light duty, soft water and hearty eating. I am sorry I am not
     at home now to help to make you comfortable for the winter -- call on Mr. Wooster to do any
     jobs you may want fixed up &amp; I hope I may at least get home for a short time during the
     month -- Can you spare me the little trunk -- traveling one?, and is it in good order, lock
     &amp; all -- I want it for my clothes &amp;c -- want to get rid of one big box to make
     room for my little mess box that I have written to Nelson to make for me -- give him one of the
     locks in some of the book case drawers to put on it, if they will suit. <pb n="2"/> My Dear, I
     will tell you what I want in my box -- so you can put them up in your own nice way -- as no one
     else can -- 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> some 10 lbs. of butter in <hi rend="underline">well
      salted</hi> lumps or prints -- have it <hi rend="underline">well</hi> salted and you can roll
     them up in something and I can put them into one of my buckets here 2<hi rend="super">nd</hi>
     then about a gallon of pickles -- they will have to be put in a stone jar -- (I told <abbr
      expan="Nelson">N.</abbr> to get 3 for you if he could find them) 3<hi rend="super">rd</hi>
     then about a peck of dried apples &amp; peaches , half &amp; half -- in separate bags
     (buy some more peaches like these if you can -- a half bush.) 4<hi rend="super">th</hi> 2 qts
     of dried corn 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> a peck of sifted corn meal -- well dried -- 6<hi
      rend="super">th</hi> a half peck of hominy, from Mr. Bear -- 7<hi rend="super">th</hi> A few
     dried berries, if you have any to spare. 8<hi rend="super">th</hi> chink the spaces with some
     very hard baked &amp; beaten crackers that can stand keeping -- 9<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     If you can as well as not, get the tin can I kept corks in, it has a cover, and fill it with
     lard, for our bread, and then add, if any room, a link of sausages for <abbr expan="Boswell"
      >Bos</abbr> -- I will write to or about getting the box ready and sending it, to me, you fix
     the contents -- Have Mr. Wooster dress the cloth nicely -- full it well &amp; &amp;c
     for I must have a coat from it before long, tell him to do his best, and the big knife shall be
     his as soon as I can send it -- Do you want Allen again, or what do you wish in the way of
     servants -- it is time to be thinking about them -- write me and I will write to those that
     have &amp; fix it -- Keep the Osnaburg -- I want some for some camp stools as well as for
     my coat -- use what <hi rend="underline">you</hi> want</p>
    <p> All is quiet here -- we drove out the gun boats the other day -- &amp; peppered them
     well -- the Yanks are thick on one side of the river &amp; we on the other -- The pickets
     have a talk now &amp; then. One of the <abbr expan="Yankee's">Y's</abbr> asked one of ours
     if Jackson had resigned -- he <unclear>answered</unclear> yes. Why? <abbr expan="said"
     >sd.</abbr> the other. Because Banks, his <abbr expan="Quarter Master General">Q.M. Gen.</abbr>
     had failed to supply him lately with stores, was our picket's reply &amp; &amp;c.
     Kenney has "biles" again -- is flat of his back reading -- The weather has been cold &amp;
     bad, but looks better today. Shall I send for the Examiner again, or would you prefer some
     other paper -- the <unclear>time</unclear> ends with the year -- I hope not to impose so many
     labors in another letter, it is too bad to put so many things on you, but we must all bear
     &amp; endure many things in this horrid war -- only the Lord grant that it may speedily end
     and peace and liberty again be ours -- Write to me soon -- very soon &amp; I will remember
     to write often -- Kiss the children -- I will remember &amp; write to Nelly before long -
     May God bless &amp; keep you all in his merciful care -- </p>
