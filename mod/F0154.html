<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I received both of your letters yesterday and was
                    glad to learn that you were all in the enjoyment of good health as i am
                    receiving the same blessing. we are pretty busy here just now preparing to give
                    the rebels a warm reception they have got an iron ram at
                        Savannah and tried to run past Fort Pulaski and
                    they have got flat boats and rafts to cross over to us with a large land force
                    but it will be the most sorrowful thing they ever
                        attempted we have only<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> about six
                    thousand men here and I wish they would bring forty
                    thousand and try to lick us we would show them the difference of fighting behind
                    batteries there was heavy canonading this morning about two o'clock towards Fort Pulaski I don't know
                    what it was but I guess it was the ram trying to pass you may do as you think
                        proper with the money put in the bank or keep it
                    yourself change is getting Scarce here too at first you could see nothing but
                    gold, now you get all one dollar bills we get paid with United States Bank notes
                    that was a fine turtle you was writing about but it was not as large as a one
                    the boys brought<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> in about two weeks ago it came out on land to lay -
                    they were out on picket and five of them run their bayonets into it and could
                    hardly master it it weighed two hundred and thirty
                    five pounds i saw it weighed i got them post stamps which you sent leave me know
                    how recruiting takes in York if they would know what i know it would go pretty
                    hard to raise one company in York I'm afraid the nigger question will raise a rumpus in the army Yet if
                    ever i get back i'll shoot all the niggers I come
                    across Give my respects to all inquiring friends no
                    more at present but remain </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Brother </p>

                        making a large seine to drag<br>Write soon I send you a ring made of James Island live Oak </p>
