<h4>Augusta County: John Scott to George Whipple, April 22, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Concerned about the future well being of the schools in Staunton, John Scott writes to Secretary George Whipple arguing that AMA teacher C. E. Dewey's imminent departure from Staunton would lead to a teacher shortage in the area.  He inquires if employing one of his top "scholars" as a teacher would be a viable solution to the problem.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
Rev Geo. Whipple 
Staunton Va 
</b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Apr 22<sup>nd</sup>/66</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">The Boxes No. 1608./9/10/12/13, containing clothing, came on the 20<sup>th</sup> and your instructions were received on the 21<sup>st</sup>.  We shall abide by the latter.</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Dewey is rejoicing over your acceptance of the resignation, based upon a request that she hastily <u>importuned</u> me to Approve.  All I have<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to <i>[illeg.]</i> is that you did not receive my letter of explanation <u>on</u> the subject at the same time you did her letter and had not the facts before you upon which to act, but she <u>seems determined to go</u> any way</p>
<p class="p10">The explanation was this (if you did not get my letter)  That as she made it appear <u>necessary to leave</u>, upon the spur of the moment I signed my approval  But upon a more careful consideration I could not endorse the fact which she stated that the numbers would become less in school<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> in the month of June except in night school (and they <u>will</u> there I almost hope, for we can't do them justice, there are so many.)</p>
<p class="p10">And in case they do not fall off in numbers we can not take her school as we have our hands full already.</p>
<p class="p10">I remarked last eve that very likely my letter did not reach you at the same time hers did and in consequence of which you might see fit to <u>reconsider</u>, your decision</p>
<p class="p10">But mayor <i>[illeg.]</i> (in whom she seems somewhat interested) intimated that it would not make much difference if you should <u>reconsider</u></p>
<p class="p10">I want at least to discharge my duty in regard to this matter.</p>
<p class="p10">If she goes (as she doubtless will) and the numbers continue and you do not see fit to send any body in her place,  Shall I <u>hire</u> one of my best, first class, scholars to take charge of the school, as it is under my eye, in the same room,-- provided such an one can be persuaded to do it, and will work for a small sum, for four weeks?</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
