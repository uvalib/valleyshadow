<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to

<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with the requirements of Circular
                    Order No. 10 Series 1866 (Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands) I have the honor to report that during the month of July the county
                    courts of Augusta and Highland counties have held brief sessions at which no
                    important cases involving the rights of Freedmen were passed upon, save an
                    indictment against Thomas Harris (colored) for
                    attempted rape upon the person of two children, also colored. His counsel
                    obtained a postponement to the February term, for the prisoner.</p>
<p class="p10">Several colored women arrested for disorderly conduct and unable to procure bail
                    are in jail and their behavior is very bad, even in prison. It is to be
                    regretted that hard labor cannot be added to imprisonment as the latter alone
                    has no terror for them. </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be, General<br>Your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i><u>Thomas P. Jackson</u><br>Agent</i></p>
