                    October 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Samuel G. Lane forwards to McPherson a letter written by his cousin, S. L.
                    Hayman. In the letter Hayman expresses gratitude toward McPherson and comments

<p class="p10">October 6th 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Raleigh</p>
<p class="p10">D<sup>r</sup> Sam G Lane!<br>Dear Cousin!</p>
<p class="p10">I have been <u>intending</u> to write to you ever since I left
                    Pennsylvania, but have been prevented by sickness and <i>[unclear: close ]</i>
                    confinement to the store -- I received your letter
                    last week &amp; thank you truly for the courtesy and kindness of feeling it
                    manifested you are not mistaken in regard to my feelings toward my friends
                        <i>[unclear: of]</i> the good old Keystone" and a letter from home is
                    indeed green spot in the cheerless <i>[illeg.]</i> deserts of North Carolina.</p>
<p class="p10">Immediately on receipt of yours I wrote - at considerable length - to Fitz Hugh
                    stating every instance of my conclusion with <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>McPherson and asking as
                    a personal favor his reconsideration of the matter. I have not since heard from
                    Fitz. H. but from previous knowledge of the man I fear he will not be likely to
                    change his position if he has taken it against McPherson Feeling as I do under great obligation to McPherson I should be very sorry to be made innocently
                    the cause of anything sending to injure him -- please explain this to him that
                    he may not think me ungrateful for his many acts of kindness towards me. had <u>I</u> any influence in Franklin County I should certainly give it in his favor.</p>
<p class="p10">Political excitement is running high and all our banks have refused to discount
                    till after the election. Great financial troubles <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>of Lincoln's election. Breckenridge will most likely carry this state
                    though Bell will run him very close. Douglas will not poll a large vote as his
                    supporters are very few &amp; weak-- I have been frequently <u>questioned</u> about my political views, and have
                    expressed myself far more strongly in favor of the northern institutions than
                    when in Pennsylvania. There is far more freedom of
                        <u>sentiment</u> here than I supposed and I know several
                    persons who take the <u>N. Y. Tribune and read Helper</u>,
                    though a <u>violent</u> republican would not be tolerated and
                    voting for Lincoln would be considered a <u>capital</u>
                    offence. Should South Carolina, Alabama, &amp;
                    Mississippi secede and an attempt be made to enforce Lincoln's administration,
                        North Carolina will certainly join the 'southern

                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: under]</i> no other <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>circumstances.</p>
<p class="p10">I am not very much pleased with Raleigh. It is a remarkably
                    slow &amp; <i>[unclear: aristocratic]</i> place, been confined to the store
                    from 6 A.M. to 11 P.M. I have seen very little of society - and - though <u>noticed</u> by several persons of position I shall mingle
                    very little in it as I am still so much of a <u>Yankee</u> to
                    submit to <u>patronage</u>. I do not think under present
                    circumstances it <u>would</u> do to trouble McPherson though
                    I should like very much to have a letter from him to Branch. I feel I may not be
                    able to <i>[unclear: retain]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> situation long, as I have been very sick nearly ever since my
                    arrival and am too weak to attend to business as it should be done. Please do
                    not mention that Miss <i>[unclear: Wirginan]</i> promised to express <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>her influence with some of her merchant friends of Baltimore in my favor, so shall I have slight prospect there. A few years ago
                    I would have been too proud to use such means but now I am only so glad to
                    accept of <u>anything</u> likely to <i>[unclear: secure]</i>
                    me a good situation. Ah Well! What vile uses may we come
                        <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10">I have heard lately from <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; Anna, but not one word from
                    any one at Mount <i>[unclear: Al]</i>. Excuse the haste with which this is
                    evidently written my time is completely taken up. I am obliged to write as now
                    at the store -- subject to constant interrupting. Write to me again shortly. I
                    shall <u>always</u> be glad to hear from you. With love to
                        <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>cousin Kate. The Dr. &amp; Kate <i>[unclear: Hay]</i></p>
<p class="p10">In haste, Affectionately Your Cousin</p>
<p class="p10"><i>B. Lane Hayman<br>Care P.F. Pescud Druggery,
                        Raleigh, N.C.</i></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:<br> I send you Sam H's
                        answer to my letter, that you may see I fulfilled my promise, &amp; that
                        the young man is grateful for your kindness. I congratulate you upon the
                        result of the election, and am proud that Franklin did her duty to her
                        favorite. Of course "The Times" takes much credit to herself for inflating
                        your "<u>balloon</u>," and launching it into the open
                        skies. The only compensation I ask is a seat in the ca (I
                        don't mean the Lincoln Cabinet)<br>
                        Respectfully Yours, <br>S. G. Lane Honorable
