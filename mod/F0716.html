<p class="p10"> June 3rd 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Raleigh Court House
      </p>
<p class="p10"> Dear Friend--</p>
<p class="p10">Your note (for it is <br> too short to be called a letter) of the <br> 18th came duly to
     hand, being <br> forwarded from Winfield. </p>
<p class="p10"> We left that place on the 9th <br> of May. We remained a week at <br>
     Gauley Bridge, when we proceeded <br> to this place. We expected an
      attack when we first arrived from <br>
     Humphrey Marshall who was <br> reported coming on the
      <i>[unclear: Loagan <br> Road]</i> with a considerable force. </p>
<p class="p10"> We immediately commenced fortifying, but up to this
     time all <br> is quiet. The only force here at <br> present is our regiment and about <br>
     100 Cavalry. The balance of our <br> Brigade is at Lewisburg. General
      <br> Cox's forces are at Flat Top Mountain, 19 miles from here. Our Brigade consists of the 11th, 36th, 44th <br> and 47th Ohio Regiments and
     Simmons' <br> Battery and under the command of <br>
     Colonel Crook (acting Brigadier
     General) </p>
<p class="p10">I do not know how long we <br> shall remain here. We are to be <br> mustered and paid this
     week, and <br> I suppose we shall sooner after <br> move somewhere. I am beginning to be habituated to a soldier's life, <br> but the
     thought often comes <br> across my mind that I am not <br> learning anything useful and forgetting what little I do know.-- </p>
<p class="p10"> I hope the war will close in <br> time for me to <i>[deleted: come]</i> go to 
      Pennsylvania
      to help you cut some of <br> that fruit you are bragging of. Tell <br> the Governor
     to put up plenty of cider as I shall be a frequent visitor
     <i>[deleted: this summer]</i> next winter. <br> It is singular you have nothing to write. Of course I do not <br> expect to hear
     important war <br> news, but there is certainly something
     to write. How is your duck? <br> How is my duck? How are the <br> ducks generally? How are
     the <br> male sex? Is anyone committing matrimony?
     &amp;c. &amp;c. etc. etc. <br> Dou have any fun? Are any <br> of our old friends in
     the army? <br> Good Lord! if I were in there <br> writing a letter to myself I could <br>
     fill six sheets of foolscap.--- </p>
<p class="p10"> My case is different. I am the <br> only person in the regiment &amp; of <br> course
     you are not particular about <br>
     their welfare. The war news you <br> can learn much better from the
     <br> papers than I can communicate.
    </p>
<p class="p10">As I have met with no important personal adventures
      lately, I must now close for want 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitSho3d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitSho3d.gif"></center></a><br><br> of matter to write. </p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to your family and friends. </p>
<p class="p10"> Hoping soon to hear from you. </p>
<p class="p10">I remain</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
      D.R.P. Shoemaker
     </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Your offer to pay the postage <br> on this letter comes in quite
       convenient, just now. I always <br> manage to have a
      little loose <br> change in my pocket, but just <br> at this time there are no postage <br>
      stamps in the place. And the <br> Quarter Master is not authorised <br> to take money, so I
      had to let him <br> frank it. Direct your letter thus <br>
      D.R.P. Shoemaker
      <br>
      Company E. 11th Regiment <br> 3rd Brigade Ohio Volunteer Infantry<br>
      Raleigh Court House, Virginia</p>
