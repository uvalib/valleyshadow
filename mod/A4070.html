<p class="p10">My Dear One:</p>
<p class="p10">Much to my regret I could not find any way to get home short of walking in &amp; back
     &amp; the mud is too deep for that much effort, for my friends consider me constitutionally
     averse to much exertion, so I have patiently endured my fate -- tired one night on my
     diminished no: of blankets &amp; eaten a cold dinner today off the nice biscuits, butter
     &amp;c that you sent me, after a good breakfast on ditto with buttermilk - - Mr. Robinson
     &amp; Billy started yesterday morning with the horses &amp; I let William go to
      <i>[unclear: May]</i> last night -- Mr Reed &amp; Maj. Rogers spent the night with me --
     I got eggs &amp; butter for Gen. Ewell -- have too much baggage
     yet, but do not see how I can diminish it -- I sent back any quantity to you, as you have no
     doubt fully realized by this time -- I do not see how you got it unloaded, but hope you had
     some help -- If there is anything in the lot that you want use it -- Mr. R. sent you his odd
      shoe<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I was up at church today -- William Bakers -- All the
     Episcopal Church was there -- a perfect <i>[illeg.]</i> of ladies -- I do not know why there
     was in service at the Episcopal Church -- No news of special
     interest, though it is said Longstreet has arrived at Charlottesville -- We must expect active
     operations very soon now -- There were two bottles of Vinegar -- they got here too late for me
     to get more -- You had better put this recipe in your note book -- Dr. Chapman gave it to me --
     he uses it to kill the nerve in a tooth Viz - - 1 Grain of Arsenic, 1 Grain of Morphine,
     Kreosote enough to make a paste of it, then put a piece the size of a pins head in the cavity
     &amp; confine it there with a little wax -- or cottn &amp; wax -- </p>
<p class="p10"> I did not hear anything of Nelly's tooth when I was home - so it must have gotten well -- I
     hope to get to camp safely tomorrow -- though I have many bundles to look after. I will write
     to you very soon after I get there -- You must be of good cheer -- I hope this campaign may, by
     God's blessing, end the war -- The news from Louisiana is very cheering -- it is said Banks got
     a bad whipping &amp; that he sent over 7000 wounded to Baton Rouge. Be of good cheer my
     love and try and not exert yourself too much Many kisses for you all -- the children must learn
     much this spring and summer</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye &amp; God be with you </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
