W. E. Whiting Esq. 
Staunton Va 
</b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 1 1866</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Enclosed please find a Bill of expenses for the Board of Teachers for the month of June 1866 which I believe settles all claims for the year.</p>
<p class="p10">Mrs Tukey's expenses are made up <i>[unclear: exclusively]</i> of fare between Baltimore and New York for which you sent the Teachers free tickets.</p>
<p class="p10">I passed through N. Y. about three weeks ago, and resigned to have called at the Rooms but I had the misfortune of having my Pocket Picked while passing through <i>[unclear: Baltimore]</i> and lost the whole of my last two years savings and only had money enough left by me to pay my expenses through to Boston without laying over in N. Y. which I should have been obliged to do had I called at the Rooms.  It was a severe blow for me but I am reconciled to it  True I did not lose very large amounts but when a poor man is robbed of nearly all he has got in the world he feels it very sensibly--be it ever so small.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: yet conclusion]</i> I wish to say one word about our Schools--and what has been <i>[unclear: accomplished]</i> at this point during the last year.  When we came here one year ago we found Colored people without Church or School <i>[unclear: house]</i>, and the popular prejudice so strong against the Bureau and the Teachers, that for a long time the doors were all closed against us, and we could not get a place for an <i>[illeg.]</i> House for the Teachers.  But firm and prudent management has overcome much of this prejudice and forced even Rebs to respect us, and we wind up our Schools here with a Church for the people to worship in, and a School House to educate their Children <i>[illeg.]</i> and it <i>[illeg.]</i>we could hire any House that might be for rent about us soon. <i>[illeg.]</i>. any citizen here.</p>
<p class="p10">The Colored people here have made great progress in Learning <i>[illeg.]</i>. True it may have cost a little more than <i>[illeg.]</i> some other points--but if so it is to be attributed to the fact that there was no Govt Buildings here which <i>[illeg.]</i> could get into, and it being the first year everything had to be bought or hired, but it is money well invested that I think will pay a high rate of interest and entitle all which have been engaged in this great work to a higher Seat in the Heavenly Kingdom and in conclusion Mrs Tukey and myself desire to thank you and the rest of the Com. For your uniform kindness and courtesy to us.</p>
