<p class="p10">Camp near Shenandoah Mountain</p>

<p class="p10"> I will now attempt to answer your kind letter, which I received some time since,
                    but until now, had no opportunity of responding to,
                        owing to the fact that we have been on the march
                    ever since it was received until the present. We are
                    now in the mountains up to our <u>knees</u> in mud. We layed
                    over today, it being a day appointed by the president
                    for Thanksgiving. I suppose you have heard all the particulars of the fight at
                        M<sup>c</sup><i>[unclear: Dowell]</i>. A great many of our best
                    soldiers fell in this hard contested battle. Yet we succeeded in completely
                    routing the enemy making them leave behind a large portion of their baggage<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> in <i>[illeg.]</i> commissary <i>[unclear: stores]</i>
                    Quartermasters <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10">We pursued them fast for three days <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    coming in light of their rear guard, but they did not
                    feel disposeed to fight - they fell back to Franklin the County <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    of Pendletown, where they were reinforced <i>[illeg.]</i> it is said we stood
                    before them for three days - but they did not make an attack. finding their
                    position impregnable We fell back some 8 miles
                    &amp; there waited a day but they
                    <i>[unclear: didn't]</i> fall on. We then continued to fall back to this place.
                    It is thought that we will now go into the valley. We will <i>[added: leave]</i> in the morning at 6 oclock. I hope we will soon
                    get some rest. If we should get in the valley come &amp; see us.</p>
