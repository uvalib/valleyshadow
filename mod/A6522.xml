    <p>On the 15<hi rend="super">
      <hi rend="underline">th</hi>
     </hi> of the <unclear>present</unclear> month I <orig reg="received">recived</orig> a note from
      <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> containing a tribute of respect to my much lamented cousin Clinton Hatcher
     with a request to have it published in one of the Leesburg papers which request I complied with
     so far as I was able.</p>

    <p>I took it to the Editor of the Washingtonian and he gave me a promise to have it published in
     the next issue of his paper but it failed to appear for reasons entirely unknown to me.</p>

    <p>I will see him before the next issue and learn the cause of it being delayed and will forward
     the copies desired immediately after its appearance.</p>

    <p>You asked for particulars concerning his death.</p>

    <p>I will give them so far as I know them. He fought like a hero all day with his company and in
     the evening <pb n="2"/> in making a charge on the enemy he rushed on and became separated from
     his company and fell in with the Hillsborough Border Guards <orig reg="where">whare</orig> he
     did good service until just at dark when my Brother who fought with him during the day and was
     then detailed to bring off our <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Howitzers saw him and Clinton waved his hat to him and cheered him on.</p>

    <p>The fight was just <unclear>closing</unclear> and Clinton going on to the river bank, when
     within thirty yards of the bluffs the enemy discharged one more and the last volley when
     Clinton fell with a ball shot through his heart.</p>

    <p>His last words were come on Boys let's give them one more charge. He fought fearlessly and
     well, but poor fellow, I fear he was too rash.</p>

    <p>I sometimes think if he had have had less courage he would not have been killed.</p>

    <p>He thought it his duty to defend to the uttermost his native country and in so doing
     sacrificed his life.</p>

    <p>Poor Clinton, He sleeps his last <del hand="h1">sleep</del> long happy sleep May he rest in
     peace I will plant the rose as you requested.</p>
