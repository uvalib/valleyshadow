<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, July 3, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson writes on behalf of Benjamin Frazier, who is looking for his four older
                    children because he is unable to support his four youngest children without
                    assistance. Hector Sears, the Agent in Fredericksburg, reports that Frazier's
                    eldest son is the only one in a position to help him.</p>

                    asks search be made for his children. Benjamin was owned by Joseph W.
                        <i>[unclear: Treague]</i> near Wilderness tavern, Spottsylvania County
                    Virginia on approach of U.S. army was sold to Lorenzo
                    Shaw, with four (4) small children, Lucy (9) Nancy (7) Everett (5) and _______
                    (2) years, for whom he cannot provide on account of ill health. His grown
                    children, from whom he asks help, are Benjamin who fell to William Stephen,
                    Wilderness, Nathan who lives near Treague's, Pamelia who lives near
                    Fredericksburg and Emily Williams who lives with Edward Stephens near
                    Fredericksburg. Benjamin appears a deserving man but without help must soon
                    become a charge upon the public.</p>
