<p class="p10">Wednesday December the
                                14<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp in front of PetersBurg</p>
<p class="p10">Kind and respected Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I take the opportunity this evening of informing you that I am well at present. I received your letter on Saturday the tenth and was glad to hear from you and that you were all well. I
                    would have answered your letter sooner but we have not been in camp since Friday
                    evening about six o'clock only a little while on
                    Monday morning and last night we came in to camp again about Eight o'clock but we don't know how
                    long we will stay We have been out on a raid. We started
                    on friday evening at about six o'clock and marched
                    about two miles<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and encamped for that night and the next day it commenced to sleet and rain when we was putting up our
                    tents and it sleeted the whole night and rained part of the next day. I tell you
                    that we had a rough time of it we was encamped in a field and it was nothing but
                    mud. Well now before I go any further about our raid I
                    must let you know what I seen that day. It was Saturday the day I received your letter. There was two men had deserted
                    our Army and went to the rebels and took up arms
                    against us and they were captured sometime ago and on
                        Saturday they were both hung between one and
                    two o'clock. They were marched in <i>[deleted: in]</i> front a regiment and a brass band and <i>[deleted: ]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: their coffins carried alongside of
                        them.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> There coffins was set
                    down along side of the gallows and they were marched
                    up on the platform with two officers and a preacher. The officers talked to
                        them awhile and then the preacher prayed for them
                    and then the officers put the bandage on their eyes and
                    the rope around their neck. I tell you that it was not
                    many seconds to they were dead. You had better believe it was a pretty hard sitsight. Well now I
                    will leave that subject and go on with our raid. So we
                    started that evening about four o'clock and marched the whole night through the
                    mud halfway up our boot legs and after we got through our picket line our
                    Regiment was ahead and then we was halted and ordered to load our guns and then
                    the two front Companies was ordered to go ahead that
                    was Company A and Company F <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and we marched on to five o'clock on
                    Sunday morning and then we encamped on the bank of the
                    <i>[unclear: Nottoway]</i> river. We did not cross the river but the sixth
                        Corps had crossed the river sometime before and
                    that day about 10 o'clock they commenced coming back.
                    The first that come was the pioneers on the wagons
                    with the pontoon bridges and then a lot of cattle that they had captured and
                    then the cavalry. There was a pretty long string of
                    them. I was standing on the bank of the river and I seen John Boggs and he said
                    that your brother got wounded. He did not say that he was bad or not. I seen
                        several of the boys that I knew. They were all well and in good spirits. There was some of them had
                    geese and chickens tied to their saddles. They had a
                    little of everything with them.<br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> Well now I will give you the balance
                    of our trip. We did not capture anything but some sheep. There was a flock in a
                    field with them in it. You may know that our two companies went into them. We got all of them. Bill Sibert got one hind
                        quarter and Phillip got the other one and then
                    Jacob Shearer got at and cooked some of it for that was all we had to eat that
                    and a little perched corn. We ate some of it and then we
                    started back. It was about 3 o'clock and then I only
                    seen part of their army. We could not see anything but
                    horses and men. There was some of the Cavalry in
                    front of us and they did put<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> fire to all the buildings along the road
                    and some of them was most splendid houses but they are paying them for burning
                    Chambersburg. We came into our camp that night. It was about 2 o'clock when we landed in camp. There was some of the
                    boys did not get in that night at all. Phillip was one of them that did not get
                    in and there was a good many others that did not make it in to camp that night
                    but I made out to get in and night watch at that for my feet was most awful sore
                    and the <i>[illeg.]</i> in my shoulder but them
                    that did not get in to camp that night had it better than we had for we had to
                    march right back in the morning again about 2 miles and they<br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br> saved
                    saved that and we encamped in the woods that morning and stayed there until
                    yesterday evening to about 6 o'clock and then we
                    marched back to our camp. You had better believe that we slept good after we got
                    our supper. There was some of the boys feet got that sore and some of them froze
                    that they could not put on their shoes. My feet did get a little sore but I
                        made it to camp.</p>
<p class="p10">Well now if we stay here I will try and hunt him up and see how he is now. I have
                    wrote once a week to you since I came out and I want you
                    to do the same and then I will know if you get them all or not. You sent me your
                    likeness and little Annie's. I did not get Mary's I don't know if you sent
                    it or not.<br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br> So I think that I will bring letter to a close for this
                    time and when you get this letter and reads it you may give it to Father and let
                    him read it. So nothing more at present but remains,</p>
