<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to
                    Thomas P. Jackson, July 15, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McDonnell writes Jackson from Staunton, where he had arrived to check Jackson's
                    books and records. McDonnell, however, was unable to find either Jackson or his
                    records, and submits him a list of questions to answer in detail in his next
                    monthly report.</p>
