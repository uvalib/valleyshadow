<p class="p10">May 17th, 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg </p>
<p class="p10">My good old Friend, </p>
<p class="p10">I have been somewhat disappointed in not seeing you up here to see the men
                    playing soldier, and now since Gov. Curtin is expected here tomorrow, (Saturday)
                    I will feel sure that you are coming, and look for you, my but they do look
                    proudly, just come a nd see. Three Regiments were in yesterday afternoon and
                    make a long line of people, who with their glittering bayonets under the rays of
                    the shining sun, accompanied by their Bands, or marshal music, and the heavy and
                    steady tramp of three thousand men, m ake all who stand and look on, feel, that
                    they are not soldiers, all this can but give a very faint idea of the appearance
                    of one hundred and fifty thousand human beings marched into the field of battle
                    by the warming and thrilling sound of <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/bitner1b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/bitner1b.gif"></center></a><br><br> almost
                    countless drums and Oh! what, or who can describe the feeling of that immense
                    congregation of human souls when the sound of the booming cannon first disturbs
                    the quiet of that breast and paints death and destruction all around. We may try
                    to form some idea of th e scene presented by a battlefield, both while in the
                    actual contest and after, but can never, in my opinion, realize the horrors of
                    such a sight until we ourselves behold it, and such; humanity forbids us from
                    wishing. May it never be seen in our land, b ut may the Flag continue to wave
                    over the land of the free and the home of the brave. </p>
<p class="p10">Aunt Lydia and Uncle Ryner spoke of coming to see the soldiers and as you no
                    doubt will not object to having an errand there, you can tell them that saturday
                    will no doubt be a suitable day as we expect all the soldiers in town while
                    Curtin is here. I have been expecting to read your letter before this time, but
                    suppose you are preparing to keep me reading one day when it comes, which I will
                    gladly do. Mine to all inquiring friends. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Little Ellic </i></p>
<p class="p10">Excuse this side as I thought I had it full. You can
                        guess what is not written, now Good-bye </p>
