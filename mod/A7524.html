<p class="p10">Sept 18. / '67.</p>
<p class="p10">Mt. Solon, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. D.H. Evans,</p>
<p class="p10">Your last dear letter is before me. I was thankful to hear of your safe arrival
                    home You could not have been more grieved to leave me than I was to give you up.
                    It seemed that I could not let you go I cried a long time after you left my home
                    looked forsaken &amp; desolate, &amp; so it was to me You Ella, Magnus,
                    &amp; our two <i>[unclear: Sunbeams]</i> Lula, &amp; Macon all gone Oh!
                    I felt that I could not stay. I hope it will not always be thus. I am so glad
                    you sent me back the photograph you took from my Album because I did want to
                    keep it so much. I was not angry with you for<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>taking it from me. I
                    thought you would rather I did not have it, &amp; I knew you knew best that
                    you did not think it a very good one but I do. I will not put it in my Album
                    again as you don't want me. I thank you Oh! so truly for sending the Ledgers. I
                    was both surprised &amp; pleased to see them for I thought after what you
                    said last Sabbath you would not send them to me again. I only blamed myself for
                    saying what I did to you. Although I was teasing
                    you only to see what you would say I did not blame you. How my heart longs for
                    your presence today. I feel that I can't wait until I
                    see you again. each visit you pay me only increases my desire to have<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>you always near me I am happy &amp; contented when with you, lonely
                    &amp; sad when we are parted. Oh! how truly my heart Loves, trusts,
                    &amp; looks to you for happiness. I am so glad to hear you love to come to
                    my home, for I know now that you enjoy your visits &amp; in the future I
                    shall try more earnestly to make my home pleasant &amp; attractive to you. I
                    will not leave you so often alone to attend to any domestic affairs, but will
                    stay near you only &amp; with you, for I do love you more than all in the
                    world. Yes I have a very dear &amp; happy home but this bright &amp;
                    loved circle has been so broken of late years by Ella's marriage my precious
                    &amp; noble brother's sad &amp; early death, &amp; pa's absence that
                    I can scarcely realize it to be my once cherished happy home.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>God has
                    been merciful in sparing from the grave many to make home still sweet to me but
                    not as in days gone forever, &amp; "Memory oft will heave a sigh" for buried
                    home joys. The circle will never be again united link after link will be taken
                    by marriage &amp; death until my dear lonely father &amp; mother will
                    have no bright &amp; smiling face to look upon or make joyous their fading
                    years. This picture is too sad I must brighten it by saying we will all, if we
                    Can, go to see them often &amp; fill their hearts &amp; home with happy
                    voices, sunny smiles, &amp; social talk. then The old home will ring with
                    gladness. I can see Ma &amp; pa now in imagination on an occasion like I
                    have just pictured, smiling &amp; happy, feeling young again with their dear
                    daughters &amp; their husbands who have all come at <u>once</u> to cheer up the lone but loving hearts which have been forsaken
                    by their children for other loves &amp; homes daughters who left them lone
                    &amp; sad to make sweet &amp; happy the hearts &amp; homes of their
                    chosen husbands as they once made I send love &amp; a kiss to you. Come down
                    soon I forgot to tell you Mr. John <i>[unclear: Firns]</i> sent me a basket of
                    peaches Monday Ma sends love</p>
