<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Amanda C. Armentrout,
                    September 16, 1863<br>

<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William writes to Kate that his health is good although his toe continues to
                    cause him trouble. He mentions troop movements around Culpeper Courthouse and
                    his thoughts about the Yankees.</p>

<p class="p10">Sept 16th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Orange C.H.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">Once more I have the privilege of dropping you a few
                    lines. My health is very good &amp; I hope these
                    few lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. For
                    the last two or three days we have been expecting
                    a fight. The enemy advanced on our cavalry last Sunday at Culpeper C.H. &amp; drove them back after
                    a slight engagement to the Rapidan River. We received orders Sunday night at one OClock to cook one
                    days rations &amp; be ready to march at day light early Monday morning we
                        were marched down below <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>O.C.H. for to
                    await further orders. The enemy crossed the Rapidan at
                    Raccoon ford. Gen Early with his division drove them
                    back I suppose it was nothing more than a Yankee raid trying to reconnoiter our strength &amp; position. There is many
                        rumors afloat I know we are not settled yet I
                    would not be surprised if we don't go to Fredericksburg every thing seems to
                    indicate a change of base. The greater portion of
                    Longstreets corps; if not all; has left us for some point not known to me now
                    Capt G. arrived yesterday evening with eight men; a
                    heavy reinforcement for our company. We have the largest company in the Regt some
                    fifty odd reported for duty. The boys all seem cheerful; &amp; willing to meet the enemies of our country on any field to dispute our rights with them
                    I hope we may go back to our old camp &amp; remain there
                    until the weather gets colder &amp; I fear to if
                    we go on a long march that I could not stand it on account of my toe We had
                    preaching every night while we were in camp The Rev. Mr Taylor of Staunton preached to us Monday
                    evening I believe there
                    were more than five thousand soldiers gathered under the
                    sound of his voice eagerly listening to the words of light &amp; life that
                        seemed to flow from his lips at the same time we
                    could hear the booming of the distant cannon while he
                    preached I prayed that the <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>holy spirit might fall on us, as it did on
                    the children of Israel on the day of pentecost
                    &amp; that thousands might there make their peace with God. Dear Kate when you receive this no doubt you will say cold; so cold; but I
                    would not have you think thus for there is not a beat
                    of my pulse but beats true to thee. O how often I think
                    of the past when you were by my side; my arms encircling
                        your waist &amp; you sweet lips gently pressed to mine then I was happy;
                    yes happy; as the gay warbler whilst they are singing their notes of praise to their maker I must
                    soon close your Br is well I had a notion to close him up in his box &amp;
                    send him home awhile to his fond &amp; loving sisters my love to all good by
                    my best &amp; dearest Kate</p>
