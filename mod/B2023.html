<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to R.
                    M. Manly, November 4, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's letter to Manly states that John Scott will be coming to teach in
                    Staunton, but that Miss Rowell refuses to serve as his assistant. Jackson asks
                    Manly to provide new assignments for Miss Rowell and her assistant.</p>

<p class="p10">November 4 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Enclosed I forward a letter from Mr. John Scott with the explanation it appears
                    he has permission from American Missionary Association to take charge of schools at Staunton and I think he is desired
                    by the colored people here and will relieve me of a very troublesome business so
                    I hope he will come. Miss Rowell however intimates to me that she will not be
                    allowed to act as his assistant nor is she willing to do so. This will
                    necessitate a change for her and the assistant promised by Freedman's Aid Commission of New York, now daily
                    expected. Please have matter arranged definitely (for this double correspondence
                    and expectation of change is prejudicial to the school and unpleasant to Miss
                    Rowell) and inform me of decision as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Your obedient servant
                    </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thos P. Jackson<br>Agent</i></p>
<p class="p10">Return Mr. Scotts letter with answer if you please</p>
