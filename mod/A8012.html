<h4>Augusta County: N. Sargent to Alexander H. H.
                    Stuart, August 12, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Sargent praises recent "articles" of Stuart's in Whig newspapers, discusses the
                    issue of slavery in relation to national politics and the upcoming presidential
                    election.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 12, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Washington</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I have noticed &amp; read with much interest, My dear Sir, your articles in
                    the Whig, and I have been gratified to observe the favor with which your
                    proposition has been responded to in the State. I have taken some pains to
                    impress the minds of several influential men as to the importance of holding the
                    convention &amp; of inaugurating, &amp; thoroughly organizing the
                    "Opposition Party" in Va, &amp; the South. I spoke to I. S. Gallagher and
                    his brother of Charleston Free Press, before your first
                    article appeared, &amp; got them <i>[unclear: unlisted]</i>. They have
                    barbed you up zealously.</p>
<p class="p10">There is a good article in the Whig of the 11th yesterday, which sounds like your
                    voice.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you will have an address prepared, &amp; I shall then be sure it will
                    be just right: sound, moderate, conservative, <u>conciliatory</u>. You are right when you<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> say "we must be content to
                    stand where our fathers stood". That is the only safe ground we <u>can</u> stand on.</p>
<p class="p10">The course taken by Goggin &amp; Bell, of Ky in their canvasses, has hurt us
                    very much, not only with conservative men at the North, but by creating a schism
                    among ourselves. I can never subscribe to the doctrine that Congress must <u>protect</u> slavery in the Territories; never. We must
                    repudiate that vagary.</p>
<p class="p10">The democratic Party at the South has run upon a rock upon which they must split
                    the African Slave trade. I am glad to see Phillips, late of Ala, &amp;
                    Reuben Davies M. C. of Miss, coming out against it.</p>
<p class="p10">Wise, like a man detected in a conspiracy to set fire to a building, has the
                    hardihood to acknowledge his complicity, but rails and bellows in the most
                    furious manner against<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the <u>rascality</u> of
                    treachery, &amp; the publication of a private letter! He is like a pheasant
                    that makes a great flutter till her chickens have all hid, &amp; then flies
                    away.</p>
<p class="p10">I have seen "Hancock". His purpose is made apparent. What would the South say to
                    Foot of Vt.? If the North object to Bates, Bell, Crittenden, Reves &amp;c,
                    suppose Va. should offer, in a spirit of magnanimity
                    &amp; compromise, to take Foot--a <u>nominal</u>
                    republican, but a truly <u>conservative</u> man? I throw out
                    this idea for you to turn over and reflect upon. The North <u>couldn't</u> object to him, &amp; the South would be safe with him. But he must be better known to some of the
                    "controlling spirits" of the South, before they would agree to this.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not think Fillmore could be run with any chance of success, such is the
                    bitter &amp; inappeaseable hostility to him on the part of the republicans;
                    hence I mention Foot.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you will find your farming<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and distilling operations
                    pecuniarily successful. I shall be most happy to drink your health in your own
                    "old Wheat" whenever you may afford me an opportunity.</p>
<p class="p10">I have a small place near this city, around &amp; near which a good many are
                    now buying &amp; building. It is 4 1/2 miles
                    north-northeast from the capitol &amp;
                    contains 60 7/8 acres. I shall plant to acres of it grape vines next spring, for
                    which some of it is well suited. Population is pushing out in that direction
                    quite fast.</p>
<p class="p10">Believe me most sincerely<br>Your friend &amp; obedient</p>
<p class="p10"><i>N Sargent</i></p>
<p class="p10">Do not neglect the Whig--keep the public mind astir<br>I
                        do not think that Douglas will be the Charleston nominee, If not, &amp;
                        the Opposition are united we shall succeed Hon A. H. H. Stuart
                    </p>
