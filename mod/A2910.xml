                <p>I seat myself this evening to drop you a few lines to let you know that we are
                        <orig reg="preparing">prepareing</orig> a box to send you. we expect to send
                    it to Staunton <orig reg="tomorrow">tomrrow</orig> to go down Friday We send
                    your overcoat, socks, flannel shirt, gloves, one <orig reg="chicken"
                    >ckicken</orig> some pies biscuit butter and some apple butter rolled in paper
                    &amp; a bottle of <add hand="h1" place="inline">and ginger cakes</add>
                    molasses. we could not send you a blanket this time but if you still want it let
                    us know and we will send it to you the first opportunity we did not know we
                    could send a box this week or I would have send over to Pa's and got some apples
                    but we did not know it until this morning. Mr Spencer said he would take it down
                    on one of his wagons for us. Mag says to write as soon as you can about the
                    cloak cloth and let her know the price she <pb n="2"/>wants the real cloak or
                    beaver cloth if you can get it she says not to go over $125.00 per yard but for
                    my part I had rather you would not to any expense about mine unless you think
                    you can get a bargain there is twelve <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> of this
                    cloth and it would not take more than 7 1/2 or 8 <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr>
                    off the beaver cloth, if you do get it send it by some reliable person, the
                    cloth looks very well now but Mag is <orig reg="afraid">affraid</orig> it will
                    stay so long. We wrote to you monday and I suppose you will get it before you
                    receive this one I wrote in it for some white flannel 4 or 5 <abbr expan="yards"
                        >yds</abbr> if you can get it I will be very glad I cannot get any here
                    there was some in Staunton but it was very coarse and looked like it was mixed
                    with dark wool. Pa is here they are all well except cold he brought a few apple
                    over and we will send them to you. More Paxton's family have nearly all had
                    diptheria they are getting better now. we are all well. I believe I have no news
                    to write. write soon. <add hand="h1" place="inline">We directed the box to you
                        in care of Tyler &amp; son.</add>
                    <pb n="1"/>Mag received your letter yesterday she says she is going to look for
                    you home in a few days. Hannah says she will write to you in a few days. Nothing
                    more at present.</p>
