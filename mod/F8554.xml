                    <salute>Dear Uncle,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I will commence this letter by offering you apologies innumerable for not writing
                    before. Your's of the 14<hi rend="super">th</hi>, is duly received with another
                        <del hand="h1">whome</del> whose date I "disremember". I am glad to hear
                    that you are fixed so comfortably in Washington and hope you may ever be so.
                    Sleighing has been "splendid", but to-day it has thawed and this evening I am
                    afraid, finishes sleighing until next snow. I have sleighing a good many times
                    this winter and I have had more fun than a little. Skating has also been good,
                    but is now in the same condition as sleighing. Uncle is away now; he went down
                    to Cincinnati this morning. School has closed <del hand="h1">U</del> until the
                    third day of January. Deer are brought into town very frequently &amp;
                    indeed, game of all kinds abounds. Rabbits, quails, deer and many other kinds
                    are brought in town almost daily. I have attended several parties <del hand="h1"
                    /> the last month <pb n="2"/>&amp; this and have experienced a great deal of
                    pleasure at each. Christmas or rather Saturday, the day kept as Christmas, was
                    decidedly dull and I guess New Year's will not be much, if any, better. The
                    Library of the Union School is very much frequented and I do not know what I
                    should do in the way of reading if it were not here. It is open every Saturday
                    from the hours of ten to twelve to everybody, who <orig reg="chooses"
                    >choses</orig> to go there. I confess my stock of news is run out <del hand="h1"
                        >an</del> &amp; also my inclination to write<del hand="h1">s</del>.
                    Please answer soon--</p>
