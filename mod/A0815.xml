     <salute>Dear Sister Kate,</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>It has been a long time since I received a letter from you, I suppose you have some on the
     way, but as we have been marching for the last month <hi rend="underline">constantly</hi>, they
     have not been able to <orig reg="find">finde</orig> my camp. I received a letter from Addie
     yesterday also a <hi rend="underline">short</hi> one from Cos. Linda. I understand you have
     been <orig reg="complaining">complayning</orig> a great deal lately. I hope you are well now,
     you must take good care of your health. We have had two dear Brothers taken <orig reg="from"
      >frome </orig>us, God grant the rest may be <pb n="2" entity="garb15b" pid="uva-lib:503054"/>
      left us. We expect to remain here a few days. This will be the first
     rest (of any course) we have had since we left <unclear>Gin Station</unclear> the 1<hi
      rend="super">st</hi> of June. <orig reg="Our">Oure</orig> Horses are almost completely broken
     down, can scarcely drag the Guns, this morning is the first corn they have been fed for 20
      <orig reg="days">dayes</orig>, as we are near the Rail now we will be able to get
      <unclear>good feed</unclear> for them. Mr. <unclear>Hallan</unclear> I
     <unclear>understand</unclear> is inquiring about Jim. him &amp; Michael
     <unclear>Duregher</unclear> deserted the company in Yorke City and have not been heard of
     since. </p>

    <p>Tell Ma I left a <unclear>bundle</unclear> of 25 yards of calico in New Market at the <orig
      reg="house">hous</orig>
     <pb n="3" entity="garb15c" pid="uva-lib:503055"/>
     of Mr. D. L. Thomas. Asher left a <unclear>bundle</unclear> there
     too, we were not able to carry it and did not know that we would be near home. If you have an
     opportunity you can get the bundles from Mr. Thomas. </p>

    <p>He is a Brother of Henry Thomas of Staunton. I am very badly off for Shirts. I have to borrow
     one <orig reg="until">untill</orig> I can have mine washed. I have but the one. </p>

    <p>Our Corps is the only part of the army encamped here, do not know where the rest of the army
     is, it is said that we will move in the direction of Gordonsville in a few <orig reg="days"
      >dayes</orig>. Ask Nellie why she does not write <pb n="4" entity="garb15d" pid="uva-lib:503056"/>
      to me <orig reg="occasionally">occasionley</orig>, I suppose <orig
      reg="both">bothe</orig> of you are having holiday now, Does Nellie run off as much as ever,
     tell her she must be a good girl.</p>

    <p>Cos John I understand is better write soon and tell me about him.</p>

    <p>We are having as many black berries as we can eat - there is an abundance of them this year.</p>

    <p>Love to all my friends, tell them I will expect to hear frequently from home now, as we are
     expecting the army to take a rest of a few <orig reg="days">dayes</orig>, and letters will be
     able to find the way to camp. Tell me all about home, <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig>
     is interesting. <hi rend="underline">does</hi> the Foundry look like old times, is the
     Henderson <unclear>Cupola</unclear>
     <unclear>tender</unclear>. Remember me to the Chaps and do write soon to your Bro.</p>
