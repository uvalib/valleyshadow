<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Ordered to march at 4 but as it rained all night &amp; was still inclement did not get off till between 5 &amp; 6. Marched about 3 miles and made a wearisome halt in the rain for Hill to pass through Hagerstown. We followed him, passing through Middleburg Pennsylvania, &amp; camping 1 mile from Greencastle. The march was a most tedious one, rainy all day and the roads very muddy. The country is a fine one, well cultivated and the crop looking well, better than with us. There seems to have been plenty of rain here.</p><p class="p10">There was some waving of hankerchiefs in Martinsburg &amp; Williams Port, but even more in Hagerstown. Here the men are sullen and the women obsequious, bowing even at a distance as if to conciliate. All seem afraid we will injure them knowing how well they deserve it, but Lee has issued orders forbidding any one taking or injuring private property excepting the Commissary supplies &amp; Quartermasters &amp;c</p><p class="p10">Generals Lee, Longstreet &amp; Pendleton passed us today.</p><p class="p10">Our march today was about 15 miles. The Dutch farmers say Take de horses take de cattle take eberyting put don't purn de parn don't purn de house &amp; don't hurt de wife &amp; leetle one.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday, June 27, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Orders more sensible today, to march at 6 1/2 o'clock. Passed through Greencastle in Franklin County Pennsylvania where the people all looked very serious, most of the houses closed, but the inhabitants were visible. Fine country well cultivated. An old farmer said he could not blame our army for taking horses &amp;c for he had heard the Yankees boast of what they had taken from the Southern people.</p><p class="p10">A fine day for marching, but only made about 15 miles passed through Marion a village 4 miles from Greencastle &amp; through Chambersburg, a thriving town of perhaps 7 or 8,000 inhabitants, camping 3 miles beyond the latter place. Stores closed but streets and windows filled with men and women, the latter very common looking, not to compare with our Southern females. Quartermaster &amp; Commissary supplies pressed in Chambersburg The men caught some fowl on the road, but were made to offer to pay for them. I am glad to see the men are allowed to walk through wheat fields &amp;c, instead of confining them to the muddy roads. Some of the women were very impudent. A few of our men exchanged hats with citizens in a very quiet manner. 'Tis said one murder was committed by a souther soldier, but as the parties were drunk I did not hear what was done with the men. 'Tis also said that some of our men have been bush-whacked, this should not be allowed. Met several droves of horses going South.</p><p class="p10">I did not mention that a deserter was shot in Garnett's Brig on the 25th upon halting for the night. The offense was committed some time ago.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday, June 28, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Orders to clean guns wash clothes &amp;c. Some of our officers attempted to go into town to buy some articles, but Lee's orders prohibited it. No one is allowed to purchase but Chiefs of Departments and they only for the use of the Army.</p><p class="p10">Heard today that Grant had made another attack upon Vicksburg been repulsed with great loss &amp; was recrossing the Big Black in retreat.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday, June 29, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Orders to march at 8 wh were countermanded, remained quiet until 3 when we took up line of march retracing our steps through Chambersburg where the people seemed quite delighted at our <u>retreat</u> saying we were running from McClellan. One damsel vented her spleen upon me by a horrid grimace, it was quite amusing. We camped about 2 miles south of town in a fine grove.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday, June 30, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A detail made from regiment to tear up Rail Road. Various rumors viz Beauregard on the march to join us. The rest of Lee's Army in motion. Ewell retracing his steps &amp; turning off towards Gettysburg. 1000 Yankee militia captured near Carlisle paroled &amp; every man stripped of his shoes &amp;c &amp;c. Our Quartermasters have pressed a number of horses, the horses are fond in all sorts of out of the way places, even covered up in straw ricks, &amp;c. They are taken &amp; if the owner is found he receives pay for him from $80 to $100. Showery for the last two days. Our mail came and left today.</p></p>
