<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: P. F. Earman to W. J.
                    Jackson, August 20, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Earman writes about the prevalence of horse thieves in Augusta County, and ways
                    in which they may be stopped, including the formation of local "vigilance
                    committees." It is unclear whether the letter was meant for Thomas P. Jackson,
                    or if it is indeed meant for another man by the name of Jackson.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">August 20<sup>th</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Burkes Mills Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I have just received your letter
                    this evening and hasten to reply. At the time of writing to General Schofield I did not know that you were
                    established at Staunton or I should have written to you instead. I have no
                    complaint to make of an official, either Military or Judicial as I believe they
                    are all prompt executing the law when called upon. That which I complain of as
                    being <u>intolerable</u> is horse stealing and the trouble is
                    to get officials on the task in time and not in any want of of promptness on
                    their part. In Some neighborhoods in Augusta County the citizens are forming
                    themselves into vigilance committees for their <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> own protection
                    against this nuisance, and we were about doing the same, and I had written to
                    the General as one of the
                    Committee for instructions not wishing to go into an arrangement of that kind
                    unless with the sanction of the Commandment of this District horse stealing has highly become
                    intolerable here a short time since there were five horses Stolen from this
                    immediate neighborhood in one night from different persons the <i>[added: time]</i> that would, necessarily have been consumed in
                    getting officials would have enabled them <i>[added: (the
                        theives)]</i> to make their escape but by pursuing them at once they were
                    over taken in the north mountain and the horses recovered. But for want of arms
                    the theives escaped which is to be regreted by every law abiding citizen. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Since then there have been other horses stolen in the neighborhood, no doubt by the same individuals so
                    that no one was safe at any time. It was with a view to break up this band of
                    marauders that the letter was written and not designing to call in question the
                        <i>[unclear: promptness]</i> of any offical whatever <i>[deleted: (Scratched out writing)]</i> Hoping this explanation may be satisfactory. </p>
<p class="p10">I Remain<br>Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>P.F. <u>Earman</u></i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Please excuse my writing with pencil as I was
                        anxious to answer at once and was out of ink.</p>
