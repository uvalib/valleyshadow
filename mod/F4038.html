<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    August 20, 185x<br>

<p class="p10">August 20</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Our Convention met yesterday &amp; was largely attended by Democrats
                    &amp; harmonious in its action. After careful reflection &amp;
                    consultation with leading friends, we agreed that it would be better for
                        <i>[unclear: Rone]</i> to run than for me. It would avoid a contest of
                    unexampled bitterness, and give a Democratic element essential to the ticket. We
                    then compelled Rone to accept. I am fully convinced that it was wise, although either would be elected beyond doubt. We will
                    certainly carry out ticket.</p>
<p class="p10">The convention treated me very handsomely. They would <i>[illeg.]</i> me <i>[deleted: ]</i> a <i>[unclear: united]</i> &amp; earnest fight for me for
                    Senator, but I would not assent to it. They then passed <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>a very
                    handsome resolution regretting my declination &amp; presenting me for
                        <i>[unclear: M. S.]</i> Senator. That of course amounts to nothing, as I
                    have no such notion, but it is a graceful compliment from my own people. I have
                    never seen a convention in the county in which there was such a cordial
                    &amp; earnest disposition to befriend me.</p>
<p class="p10">You will see the resolutions in the paper.</p>
<p class="p10">I enclose you another letter from Captain
                    <i>[unclear: Henderson]</i> about young Harper. His promotion is so strongly
                    urged from the line that the Gen cannot hesitate. I am without formal interest
                    in the matter.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly Thine</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honorable Eli Slifer
                    </p>
