<p class="p10">Fredericksburg Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Own Sweet Sister Kate</p>
<p class="p10">Your most dear, &amp; ever welcome letter of the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    instant reached me safely a few days ago which found
                    me very well &amp; truly glad to hear from &amp; to hear that you
                    together with your father's family were enjoying good health &amp;
                    prosperity, with the exception of the little bad feeling which prevented you
                    from attending Church but I truly hope that ere this reaches you, you may be
                    fully restored to perfect health again. Well Sister
                    Kate it is now drawing <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>very near Christmas. Many in this place are in
                    anticipation of a gay time, at balls &amp; parties but I don't expect to be here during the Christmas. My calculation is to
                    leave here Christams night for home if I am not disappointed. That is if the
                    Steam Boat does not fail to make its usual trip from Baltimore. I cannot tell
                    now whether I will return to this place soon or not, it depends altogether upon
                    future arrangements. I reckon you had better not answer this, until you hear
                    from <i>[added: me]</i> again as there is no regular line of
                    communication to my County &amp; as it is near mid winter the Steamers are
                    about making their last trips. Consequently we are <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>soon to be deprived of the only means of Public conveyence or
                    Communications with this place Should I return to Fredericksburg again I will
                    write to you immediately. I truly hope you may spend a pleasant time during the
                    Christmas. I really wish it was in my power to visit you this Christams I am
                    sure I could spend a pleasant time. It was two years the
                        14<sup>th</sup> of this month since we parted. Well do I remember
                    that eventful day. What strange things time has
                    brought about. Two years ago we knew each other only as strangers tonight I
                    address you my Dear Kate as Sister &amp; must say as I have often said I
                    love you as such I feel like I am writing to one <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>who truly merits all
                    my love, in whose heart I am proud to say I have a place, according to my
                    unshaken confidence in your most noble &amp; worthy self. Remember my dear
                    Sister that though we be ever separated, you will ever be a bright star on the
                    pages of my fond memory if life is spared &amp; fortune smiles I am
                    determined to see you. I assure you there is nothing that would be more
                    gratifying to me than a visit to Rose Dale, the home of my much loved Sister Kate. The night is growing old I must close
                    for the present by wishing you a Merry Christmas &amp; happy New Year my
                    love to all, wish your dear self may God forever bless you.</p>

                        Brother</p>
