<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Edward
                    McPherson, December 14, 1860.<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure's letter to McPherson expresses his fears about the impossibility of
                    compromise between the northern and southern states. McClure also urges that
                    Simon Cameron not be given a position in Lincoln's cabinet.</p>

<p class="p10">December 14th</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours from of the 10th was duly received &amp;
                    read with pleasure</p>
<p class="p10">However impractical may be the Southern leader
                    at Washington &amp; in the discontented States, it is manifest that the
                    righteous, <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; temperate position of the Republicans
                    generally in telling upon the Southern people.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not see myself how the matter is to be compromised. The difficulty may be
                    adjusted &amp; the adjustment termed a compromise; but it must in fact be a
                    surrender on one side or the other. How <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>is the right to hold slaves
                        <u>in <i>[illeg.]</i></u> to be
                    <i>[unclear: compromised]</i>? How is a Slave <i>[unclear: Cide]</i> to be
                        <i>[unclear: compromised]</i>? The North can never consent to the universal
                    dominion of Slavery in this nation and nothing less will satisfy the South; and
                    indeed nothing less will ensure the perpetuation of Slavery. The restoration of
                    the Missouri Compromise line &amp; its extension to the Pacific, would grate
                    very harshly upon the connections of the Northern people. It would be no
                    concession to the North, for it would make no territory free that could by any
                    possibility be slave; while it would inevitably force Slavery into Southern
                    California, New Mexico, &amp; would be followed by the annexation <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>of <i>[unclear: Baha]</i> &amp; the absorption of another slice of
                    Mexico. Rest assured that if the North concedes its present forces, the South
                    will ever here after have the preponderance in the Senate &amp; practically
                    the supreme <i>[unclear: pres]</i> of the government. Our present victory would
                    be fruitless save to disgrace us as a party in one our establishment &amp;
                    in the eyes of the civilized world.</p>
<p class="p10">What is to be done I can scarcely suggest. I know what should be done. The North
                    should enforce the laws at home and also enforce the supremacy of the laws with
                    all insurgent States; but as a party we are divided, &amp; I am not hopeful
                    of a happy &amp; creditable solution of the difficulty.</p>
<p class="p10">Our people we are firm but moderate oh, then <i>[illeg.]</i>. They are <i>[deleted: ]</i> to please to the utmost short abandoning vital principles.</p>
<p class="p10">I see that a paper is circulating among the Pennsylvania Members <i>[unclear: enjoy]</i> Cameron for a Cabinet
                    appointment. I trust our delegation will not add to the already dangerous force
                    of that man. He can't go into the Cabinet. For the rebellion will be terrible
                    wherever it seems to be possible, &amp; the party would not survive his rule
                    a single year.</p>
<p class="p10">Will you be home during the holidays? If so perhaps we may meet at Harrisburg
                    about New Year. Write me often </p>
<p class="p10">Very Truly Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
