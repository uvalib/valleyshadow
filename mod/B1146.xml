                <p>McDonnell submits the quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District including Augusta
                    County. In relation to the condition of blacks in Augusta County, McDonnell
                    bemoans what he considers to be the persistence of "immoral" behavior and
                    "lewdness." He does note, though, that the schools in Augusta seem to be
                    flourishing. His report concludes with more general observations about attitudes
                    toward education and social mores. He also mentions the transfer of Thomas
                    Jackson out of the 4th Division, remarking that "this Sub-District loses the
                    services of a most valuable officer, which is as much regretted by the
                    Freedpeople of his division as by myself.."</p>

                <p>I have the honor to submit the following Inspection Report of this Sub District
                    in obedience to Circular No. 5 Series of 1864, from <abbr expan="Headquarters"
                        >Head Qrs.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Assistant Commissioner">Asst Comr</abbr> State of Virginia, viz:</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">First Division</hi>, comprising <hi rend="underline"
                        >Frederick</hi> County</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The General Condition of the
                    Freedpeople cannot be said to have much improved since last report. The first
                    quarter of the year is always a <unclear>pinching</unclear> time among laborers,
                    and the severe weather here, has caused many privations, but except in cases of
                    sickness of heads of families there has been no actual suffering. The local
                    authorities relieve cases of sickness impartially, and where such cases are
                    known, no difficulty is experienced in providing a remedy. Of course the means
                    of the freedpeople have decreased much during the past three months, and no
                    contracts have been made for the present year. The moral condition of the people
                    is still at a low ebb. Bastardy is far too common, and the Officers of the Law
                    are hopelessly blind to all such cases, where a colored woman is one of the
                    parties. Indeed there <pb n="2"/>seems to be no remedy for this practice, which
                    white and colored alike regard with indifference.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> But little hope of impartial
                    justice being given to colored people, where they are interested against Whites,
                    is entertained in cases of jury trials, even Magistrates will stretch the
                    provisions of the law to convict a colored or acquit a white man.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Register of Marriages is
                    complete for this division. No additions have been made to it during the
                    quarter. All parties contemplating Matrimony are now directed to the County
                    Clerks office for a license.</p>

                <p>II. In all practicable ways I instruct the freedpeople as to their duties and
                    responsibilities under act. of February 24<hi rend="super">th</hi> 1866.</p>

                <p>III. The Civil Authorities take no action to abate lewdness and adultery, every
                    effort is made by us both through the Churches and the Commonwealth Attorney to
                    stop the evil.</p>

                <p>IV. Freedpeople use only one surname.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> A poor house for the County
                    and Corporation and adequate to the demands is provided. The authorities are
                    impartial in the treatment of inmates but this superstition which has become
                    general, few freedpeople can be induced to avail themselves of its privileges.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The supply of labor far
                    exceeds demand, and during the past winter many were out of employment. Now that
                    spring work has commenced the surplus labor will soon distribute itself to find
                    employment. No Contracts have been made and Employer and Employee are alike
                    unwilling to enter into any. It is by this means the freedman can obtain monthly
                    cash payments, it certainly will be for his advantage, as he is almost
                    invariably cheated in long accounts and store payments.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The School here at Winchester,
                    aided by the Bureau has been more successful the past quarter than heretofore.
                    The teachers are competent, industrious and untiring in their efforts to make it
                    what it has become, a first class school. Its government and proficiency will
                    compare, favorably, with any school of its grade, and parents, pupils and public
                    seem equally well pleased with its operations. The three other schools, however,
                    give but little hope of future promise. Two of them are taught by colored women
                    who are deficient in the first elements necessary for the work, and the third is
                    taught by a white lady, who, whatever her abilities may be, can make but little
                    progress, as she has other <pb n="3"/>duties to attend to during the hours of
                    school. The aggregate number of pupils in the four schools is one hundred and
                    ninety (190) of whom one hundred and thirty one (131) attend that aided by the
                    Bureau.</p>

                <p>Efforts have been made to organize a school at Newtown, but the people are too
                    destitute to maintain it, and it closed for want of patronage.</p>

                <p>If teachers were furnished, schools could be established at Newtown and
                    Middletown, with an average number of fifty (50) pupils to each.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Second Division</hi>, comprising the Counties of <hi
                        rend="underline">Clarke</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Warren</hi> and <hi
                        rend="underline">Page</hi>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The General Condition of the
                    Freedpeople is slowly but steadily improving. Low wages, natural prejudices, and
                    the <unclear>almost</unclear> general impositions on their ignorance all causes
                    which operate most unfavorably against their rapid advancement. Very few
                    contracts have been made for the present year, but the people are generally
                    employed at an average of nine dollars ($9<hi rend="underline">
                        <hi rend="super">00</hi>
                    </hi>) per month, and the usual allowances.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The likelihood of freedpeople
                    getting full and complete justice in cases where they are <pb n="4"/>interested
                    against whites is at least very doubtful if the restraints of the Bureau were
                    removed. Since voting for the convention a more unfavorable feeling against them
                    has become manifest which could not fail to be participated in by a majority of
                    a jury and produce results prejudicial to the ends of justice.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Register of Marriages is
                    completed for each County, and each of the four paragraphs of Circular No. 11
                    series of 1866 are fully carried out.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The County Authorities
                    manifest a disposition to provide for their own indigent poor, but the means at
                    their disposal are so wretched, and the feeling of the freedpeople is so
                    strongly opposed to the poor-house, that but very few, even when ever so
                    destitute, can be induced to enter them.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> At present the supply of labor
                    is equal to the demand. As the spring advances many more could find employment
                    at perhaps about ten dollars ($10-) per month, on farms. Mechanics of any kind
                    are not in demand in either County.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The condition of the Schools
                    are as good as can reasonably be expected. The teachers are not fully competent
                    to the work, but they are the best that can be procured at present.</p>

                <p>At Berryville, the school numbers sixty <pb n="5"/>eight (68). It is in charge of
                    H. E. Keys, a colored man who should still be a scholar instead of a teacher. As
                    there are no advanced pupils, and he is a good disciplinarian his school is
                    doing very well.</p>

                <p>The school at Front Royal is also in charge of a colored man named B. H. Roberts,
                    and numbers seventy six (76). This school is more advanced than the last
                    mentioned, but the teacher is no better, and but little can be expected until a
                    more competent man can be obtained.</p>

                <p>At Bentonville, the school numbering seventeen (17) is in charge of John Crawford
                    (white). In his last report this teacher spells the word "No" in two places
                    "know" and "unknown" "unown" - The school therefore can do but little good in
                    this division unless men better qualified for the work are procured for

                <p><hi rend="underline">Third Division</hi>, comprising the Counties of <hi
                        rend="underline">Shenandoah</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Rockingham</hi></p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The General Condition of the
                    freedpeople in this division is perhaps better than in either of the other
                    divisions in this Sub-District, owing it is supposed to the comparatively few
                    therein and the demand for labour. All are <pb n="6"/>employed and although the
                    wages are small, still, with constant employment, there is no suffering as the
                    people have a choice of employers, causes of complaint are few, and if temperate
                    and economical, they cannot fail in steady progression.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The prospect of full and
                    complete justice being given Freedmen in cases where they are interested against
                    Whites is not good. An offence committed by a colored person is looked upon as
                    more heinous, and therefore should be punished more severaly than the same
                    offence committed by a white person. Political and other prejudices operate
                    unfavorably to the ends of justice in this division.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Register of Marriages for
                    Shenandoah County is completed and in convenient form, it has not yet been
                    finished for Rockingham County. The four paragraphs contained in Circular No 11
                    are carried out so far as known.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The county authorities provide
                    for the indigent freedpeople as for the same class of whites, the means are
                    ample, and the houses tolerably fair for the purpose.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The demand for labor will
                    generally exceed the supply. Freedmen with familes would do well to settle in
                    this division avoiding <pb n="7"/>Harrisonburg as a location, which is already
                    too full.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The School at Harrisonburg.
                    numbering one hundred and seven (107) in charge of Miss Phoebe P. Libby is in
                    excellent condition, and which reflects credit on its teacher. Twenty six
                    dollars ($26) was paid in February by the pupils for the support of this school.
                    The Schoolhouse is the property of the freedmen.</p>

                <p>The school organized on the 21<hi rend="super">st</hi> of January at New Market,
                    now numbers fifty six (56) and is in charge of Jesse Robinson (colored) As yet
                    the colored people have manifested but little disposition to sustain this
                    school. Only six dollars ($6<hi rend="underline">
                        <hi rend="super">00</hi>
                    </hi>)) was paid by the pupils in February.</p>

                <p>At Woodstock the school in charge of Miss Mary J. Knowles numbers sixty (60) and
                    exhibits a fair degree of proficiency. Schools could be organized at Strasbourg,
                    and Mount Jackson if teachers and rooms were supplied, with an attendance of
                    about fifty (50) at each place.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Fouth Division</hi>, comprising the Counties of <hi
                        rend="underline">Augusta</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Highland</hi>. </p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The condition of the
                    freedpeople during <pb n="8"/>the winter months has not improved morally or
                    socially. The officer in charge complains that the Civil Authorities refuse to
                    take action themselves or cooperate with him to abate lewdness and adultery.
                    Hence the fullest scope is given to the unbridled passions and very general
                    demoralization is the result. Although labor has been in good demand at lower
                    wages, lack of economy high wages and provisions with too much intemperance has
                    kept the people in a condition little better than beggary.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> Mr. Jackson, the officer in
                    charge, states that the indisposition to accord impartial justice in cases
                    between whites and colored is increasing. The fault lies, he says with Jurors
                    and Magistrates, who will extend the provisions of the law for a white and
                    contract it for a colored man.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Register of Marriages for
                    Augusta County is complete, no names are now added to it. In Highland County the
                    colored population is sparse and scattered, and the weather so very severe that
                    travel has been very difficult, and forbade completing the registry, which the
                    officer says he will shortly be <pb n="9"/>able to do.</p>

                <p>II. The people are made fully acquainted with the act of July 27, 1866</p>

                <p>III. The officer of the Bureau is powerless without the aid of the Civil
                    Authorities to prevent gross immorality among the freedpeople.</p>

                <p>IV. But one surname is used by freedmen.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The County Authoritites have
                    ample means provided by taxation for taking care of their own poor, and a work
                    house receives such destitute freedpeople as are proper subjects and desire to
                    go to it.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> During the quarter the supply
                    of labor has been somewhat ample for the demand. Much fewer contracts by the
                    year have been made than usual, both employer and laborer declining to enter
                    into annual contracts.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The Schools in this division
                    are in a prosperous condition. That aided by the Bureau at Staunton has one
                    hundred and forty (140) pupils and is well conducted by excellent teachers,
                    whose ability is amply shown by the proficiency of the children under their
                    charge.</p>

                <p>The House at Waynesboro is nearly ready for occupancy, and the private schools
                        <pb n="10"/>at Deerfield and Mount Sidney are doing well. A School at Laurel
                    Hill will be put in operation as soon as the building is constructed for that
                    purpose.</p>

                <p>It is a matter of congratulation to those having an interest in the freedpeople
                    to see the steady and persistent efforts made by them during the past winter in
                    the cause of Education. Not a village in this Sub-District whose people have not
                    exhibited a commendable spirit on the school question. Although too poor to
                    erect or provide suitable schoolhouses, they contribute their
                    <unclear>mite</unclear> for the support of a teacher which, however insufficient
                    he may be, is still looked upon as the regenerator of the rising generation. It
                    is hoped the "Normal School" at Harpers Ferry, at no distant day, will supply a
                    corps of competent colored teachers to fill all the demands of the Valley. Here
                    at Winchester, religious feuds have so divided the people, as to render serious
                    obstacles to the speedy erection of a schoolhouse but beside the public school
                    aided by the Bureau, the small schools maintained by the freedpeople, even <pb
                        n="11"/>though tinged with sectarianism, point strongly to the fact that
                    education is the great objective aim of all, and with more enlightened ideas,
                    petty dissentions must disappear.</p>

                <p>Much less suffering this winter than on the two preceeding ones, was experienced
                    although the weather was and continues to be severe. The people, understanding
                    that no assistance would be given by the Bureau, and that the poorhouse would be
                    the only refuge in case of need, made the most desperate and successful efforts
                    to escape what they would consider the greatest calamity. A judicious supply of
                    clothing given at such times as would actually prevent suffering encouraged the
                    people to labor more diligently to supply their families with the necessary
                    food, fuel and shelter and I trust will make them more economical of the next
                    summer's earnings, and thereby better enable them to meet the demand of another
                    winter.</p>

                <p>Intemperance, immorality and crime, the hydra-headed monster, naturally to be
                    found in the wake of a people relieved from slavery to whom education was denied
                    by law, and the marriage relation <pb n="12"/>also is fast disappearing. Except
                    in the Whiskey manufacturing districts in Augusta &amp; Highland Counties,
                    but very little intemperance is seen. True the efforts to organize temperance
                    societies have failed but the failure was mere the result of want of
                    co-operation on the part of ministers and members of churches than from almost
                    all other causes combined.</p>

                <p>Immorality and bastardy are still the bane of society, although of less frequent
                    occurence than formerly. The officers of the Bureau are alone in their efforts
                    to suppress this evil. From long custom the civil authorities are totally
                    indifferent if not blind to a curse, which but for the Bureau would be as
                    general as in the balmiest days of the most ardent stock raising slave dealer.
                    Until more humane and just men, men who regard the freedpeople as <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">a</add> little better than brutes can be placed in civil
                    positions where justice will be impartially administered this evil will not be
                    expunged. As a class the Freedpeople are not given to the commission of crime --
                    except one man for horse stealing in Clarke County, no serious charges have been
                    made against the colored people. Some cases of pettit larceny by half grown men
                    and rarely if ever by heads of families, sometimes <pb n="13"/>occur.</p>

                <p>That the political status of parties applying for justice to the Civil Courts
                    have much to do with the decisions rendered, I will leave you to judge by the
                    two cases forwarded <abbr expan="through">thro'</abbr> this office March 11 by
                    Mr. <abbr expan="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> sP. Jackson to your Head Quarters.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, allow me to add that <add hand="h1" place="inline">in</add> the
                    transfer of Mr. Jackson, this Sub-District loses the services of a most valuable
                    officer, which is as much regretted by the Freedpeople of his division as by
                    myself.</p>
