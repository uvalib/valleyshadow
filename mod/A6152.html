<p class="p10">April the 5 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta County Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin Jimmy</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this morning to Express my gratitude unto you in answering your kind letter of
     the 20<sup>th</sup> finding me in good health with the rest of the family &amp;
     hoping when those few lines comes to hand they may find you enjoying that condition of health
     which renders the human most happy in this life Cousin you must excuse
     me for not writing sooner I would have written but I had started a letter to you a few days
     before I received your last &amp; I thought I would wait for an answer from that but perhaps you did not get it as you requested me
     to direct to NC I will do so as I have nothing of importance to write at present I'm sorry I haven't something good to write to you
     this time but I can't interest you by writing as long as the war lasts
      perhaps it may take a notion &amp; stop of a sudden sometime
      A great many persons think it will this spring but I believe the old Prophets are all dead &amp; the young ones don't
     know
     anything about it or it would have stopped long ago well Jimmy
      we've had some very disagreeable weather for sometime on the soldiers
     but they don't
     seem to mind it as much as I do for them I received a letter from one a few days ago &amp; he
     stated that his fingers had gotten so frosted when he was on guard he Could hardly write poor
     fellow if I had him here I would Certainly Cure them for him like <i>[unclear: Kit]</i> did
     yours if you remember anything about it well Cousin I'm sorry to tell you that Brother William has gone back to camp again I hate
     to see a soldier start as bad now most as I did at first but they can't help it I have to shed tears but it does no good well Cousin I hope we
     may have fine Crops this year &amp; plenty of fruit &amp; the war may Close that the
     Men May get home again &amp; we will<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Certainly have some fine spread boilings as
     the old Pennsylvanians Call it I want you If the war ever ends
     to bring your Sister &amp; some of your Connections to see us &amp; tell Cousin AM to
     Come tell him he don't think worthwhile
     to write to me but he does to <i>[unclear: Kit]</i> &amp; she ain't as much kin to him as
     I am for my name is houser &amp; hers is hanger &amp; if he don't think so tell him I've heard old people say that I favor
     them more than all the rest by the name &amp; I don't think I will
     ever take the letter H from my name If it ain't Houser it will be
     something like it well Cousin Jimmy it would have afforded me great pleasure to see you &amp; your Cousin AM before you left Virginia but I hope to
     see you both some future day if we never meet on this earth we will hope to meet in heaven
      <i>[unclear: weel]</i> in the god of battle trust &amp; die for old Virginia I must soon
     bring my uninteresting letter to a Close for the want of something to write receive my love
     &amp; warmest affections</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your Cousin</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mollie M Houser</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS Please write soon give my love to all tell your Cousins to write to
      me &amp; the next time you write tell me what has become of your brother William as you
      wrote to me once about his being in bad health give my most pious regards to Cousin Monroe
      &amp; my love to all the rest of your Connections &amp; receive a due portion
      yourself<br> from your most affectionate Cousin MMH<br> Greenville
       Augusta<br>County<br>Virginia<br> when you direct my letters to
      Mollie M Houser they will be alright I always get mine without
