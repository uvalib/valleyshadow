<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, June 21, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch sends a friend bearing a note to his wife. He hopes for an end to the
                    war so he can see his family and "live in peace." He says that business at the
                    Hotel has been slow due to destruction of the railroad. He also discusses
                    financial matters, the possibility of his returning home with a pass, and mutual
                    acquaintances.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Hester</p>
<p class="p10">Captain B. is going down the country this morning to
                    hunt us some supplies and hopes to get near enough to his home to hear from or
                    see his family. He promises to try &amp; get a few lines through for me to
                    you I hope he will be able to see you &amp; state to you precisely my
                    condition &amp;c <i>[unclear: here]</i> I wrote you a few days ago fully,
                    which I hope you have received, in this I explained all of our matters fully. I
                    have been hoping for some time that you would be able to get up &amp; at
                    least see me if not to stay entirely. I want so much to see &amp; remain
                    with you all and hope soon to be able to do so (I do think that this war must
                    soon end, &amp; we then can live in peace. I am not doing so much now in
                    business the railroad being destroyed for several miles distant but soon expect to have it in
                    running order. I have not any thing of importance now to write the war news
                    seems to be going alright As to our business you
                    have become so accustomed to managing that you can do it better than I can
                    advise <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> you. from this task I hope soon to be able to relieve I have
                    a pass from General Hunter to return home &amp; stay when I desire to do so but
                    he feared that it would not be fully respected by the present Com<i>[deleted: ]</i><i>[unclear: alt]</i> at Martinsburg General
                    Sigel &amp; of course I want to have all right
                    before <i>[unclear: reentering]</i> Do try &amp; write me &amp; let me
                    know how you are getting along how the children are doing &amp;c &amp;c-</p>
<p class="p10">I have chanced to get a few green backs which I send you. use them as you desire
                    You had better not hold it long. If have not use for the money now, try
                    &amp; turn it around into coin or good Maryland money and hold it until you
                    need it</p>
<p class="p10">Louise is not so well she carries the keys &amp; keeps house for me. Hen has
                    had the whooping cough &amp; quite ill but now better Jonny is alright Jack &amp; Ellen I have not heard from
                    since the Yankees were here but suppose they are all safe Don't let Freddy go out to harvest any place as it is not safe for him as
                    he is not stout</p>
<p class="p10">My earnest prayer is that god may bless and protect you &amp; all ever</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
