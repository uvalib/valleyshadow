                <p>Rosenbery discusses strategy for crossing the Rapidan River and describes the
                    attempt to implement that strategy. Rosenbery anticipates heavy fighting in the
                    summer; he does not believe he will be able to return home after only nine
                    months of service. As in earlier letters, he still waits for his repaired watch
                    from home, and he also is still waiting to get paid.</p>

                <p>I seat myself to inform you that your letter came to hand a few days ago.</p>
                <p>I was glad to hear that you were all well. I am well at this time. Hoping that
                    these few lines may <orig reg="find">finde</orig> you all enjoying <orig
                        reg="excellent">escellent</orig> health. I have not much to write if I were
                    at home I could talk more than I can write here for you would ask questions and
                    I would try and answer them.</p>
                <p>On the 6th of this month we went out <orig reg="reconnitering"
                    >recconnonitering</orig>. We went down to the <orig reg="Rapidan">Rapidon</orig>
                    River.</p>
                <p>We lay as a support. This is our Division. While the 3rd Division was taken
                    across the river by General Hays. He was supposed to be drunk and I do not doubt
                    it in the least.</p>
                <p>General Warren has ordered General Hays to advance to the river and no further.
                    The object <orig reg="in">is</orig> view was to <orig reg="relieve"
                    >releave</orig> the <orig reg="Cavalry">Calvery</orig> Picket and draw the
                    attention of the <orig reg="rebels">rebs</orig> while General <orig
                        reg="Kilpatrick">Kilpaterick</orig> would make a raid in order to give the
                        <abbr expan="rebels">rebs</abbr> a chance to throw down arms and come over
                    then that wished.</p>
                <p>And others said it was to draw their attention while General Butler would try to
                    release our prisoners at Richmond.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may it looked like a very foolish thing to me that General Hays
                    would take his men across the river in front of their <orig reg="artillery"
                        >artilery</orig> knowing at the same time that we could not get our <orig
                        reg="artillery">artilery</orig> near enough to play on theirs.</p>
                <p>The 3rd Division had to march by the flank while the <abbr expan="rebels"
                    >rebs</abbr> mowed them down with grape and shell.</p>
                <p>As far as I can <orig reg="learn">lean</orig> the <abbr expan="report"
                    >rport</abbr> states that there is 250 men killed, wounded and missing. But this
                    I do not believe. I hope that it is not so many but I fear that it is worse.</p>
                <p>The engagement took place on Saturday 6th-Hays crossed in the morning. Then
                    recrossed in the evening on the night we returned to camp.</p>
                <p>I look for hard fighting this summer. I wrote a letter to <abbr expan="Abraham"
                        >A.</abbr> and Ashway <orig reg="some time">sometime</orig> ago. I have
                        <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> no answer as yet.</p>
                <p>I fear that it is <orig reg="libelous">libious</orig> about my getting home when
                    my 9 months are up. Well, it shall not trouble me if I live I will get home
                        <orig reg="some time">sometime</orig>.</p>
                <p>Well, I wrote Brother John a letter some time ago. I wonder if he has got it.</p>
                <p>I have sent a ring in a letter to Rachel that I made and I sent her a memorial.</p>
                <p>I would like to have my watch if ever slow motion get its finished.</p>
                <p>Well, write soon and I will write as often as I can. So farewell for this time.</p>
