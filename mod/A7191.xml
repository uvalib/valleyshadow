<p>In her report to secretary Hunt, C. E. Dewey predicts that large numbers of students will attend AMA schools after the Christmas holidays, as many of the "children are hired out till then."  Commenting on local assistance for the AMA, Dewey states, "Three of the citizens, two women + a man, + one of the soldiers, have offered their assistance in the night school + two of them have commenced teaching with pretty good success, but they are not trained to the business + we see many defects."</p>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute> 
</opener> 

<p>I forward the report of my school for the few days it has been established.  Not much can be fairly said of the general progress of the school, or of the size of it.  We hear of very many who intend to send after Christmas, whose children are hired out till then.  We have new scholars every day and next month I hope to be able to put much larger figures in my day school report.</p>
	<p>But thought the school has only been established so recently, I can see an astonishing progress in the acquirements of the children.  When I commenced my scholars with one or two exceptions, were learning their letters; now I have two reading classes, in two or three letters.  I have no cases of insubordination to report.  The children are generally orderly, quiet and obedient.  I feared trouble from one boy, who is a constant subject<pb n="2"/> of ridicule to the school, but by placing him by himself + <hi rend="underline">trusting</hi> him while I reprove the school for laughing at his peculiarities, he has proved one of my best children.</p>
	<p>Our night schools are very interesting + seem even more important than our day schools.  The majority are under twenty years of age; comprises many who in other places would go to day school, but here the necessity of labor keeps them away.  Our rooms are crowded every night, many standing or sitting on the floor all the evening rather than lose the instruction of one evening.  Three of the citizens, two women + a man, + one of the soldiers, have offered their assistance in the night school + two of them have commenced teaching with pretty good success, but they are not trained to the business + we see many defects.  I don't know as this report will suit you, but as we have had no printed blanks sent us, we have done the best we could copying from an old one.
