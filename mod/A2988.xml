                    Hays, James Trotter, Samuel A. Lightner and James Hutcheson, we were on picket
                    at Waidsville on the <orig reg="Occoquon">Opecken</orig> river one &amp; a
                    half miles from Brucetown; only thirty men of the 5th Regt was <orig reg="there"

                        >brigads</orig> of <orig reg="Cavalry">Cavelry</orig>, We held them in check
                    for about three quarters of an hour. When about two Hundred charged across the
                    ford getting into our rear, we all <orig reg="clumped">clubed</orig> together
                    &amp; fell back about two Hundred yards, When the <orig reg="cavalry"
                        >cavelry</orig> that had got in our rear charged us <orig reg="calling"
                        >cauling</orig> loudly on us to surrender, But the little band heeded them

                    one of company D who threw down his gun &amp; surrendered, he then <orig

                    have my gun loaded &amp; ready to shoot him if he moved. Several of the boys
