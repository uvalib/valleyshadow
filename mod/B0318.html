<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, May 23, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson asks permission to postpone the registration of marriages and children
                    among the black community until such time as voters are registered, to save
                    time.</p>

                    Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands,<br>Office 4th Division, 9th
                    Sub-District, Virginia.
                    Captain John A.
                        McDonnell<br>Sub Assistant Commissioner<br>Winchester
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 23 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">I respectfully refer to your communication of date May 15/67
                    <i>[unclear: advising]</i> that a supply of Blanks had been forwarded for
                    "registry of Children and of Marriages required by Circular
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> No. 11 Series 1866 Headquarters, Assistant Commissioner," and
                    stating I am "expected to hasten its completion in (my) Division."</p>
<p class="p10">The present is an inconvenient <i>[unclear: season]</i> for laboring men to
                    absent themselves from work and as the freedmen will very soon be called upon to
                    Register <i>[added: as voters]</i> have I your permission to
                    defer the registration of Marriages &amp;c until the time of Registration of
                    voters when all will certainly be present. If the list sent for Augusta County
                    is not in proper form required additions could thus be made to said county
                    register.</p>
<p class="p10">If it is absolutely necessary that the register for Highland County should be
                    proceeded with at once, I will have notice given by the local preachers and make
                    record on the Sundays, as the only mode of sercuring general Registry.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Your obedient servant
                    </p>
<p class="p10"><i><u>Thos P. Jackson</u><br>Agent</i></p>
