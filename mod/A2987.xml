                <p>As I have a few moments after helping cook our rations I hasten to drop you a few
                    lines knowing you will be <orig reg="anxious">ancious</orig> to hear from me. I
                    arrived <orig reg="safely">safly</orig> in camp the 15th. found all the boys
                    well; They <orig reg="were">ware</orig> all camped in line of battle at
                    Fishershill above Strausburg. We had a fine commanding position &amp; well
                    fortified: The <orig reg="enemy">enimy</orig> thought it prudent to make a <orig
                        reg="retrograde">retrogade</orig>
                    <orig reg="movement">moovment</orig> &amp; commenced retreating <pb n="2"
                    />&amp; had a slight engagement in the <orig reg="evening">eavning</orig>
                    near Winchester. Our Brigade never got close enough to fire at the Yanks; Some
                    of <orig reg="their">thare</orig> leaden messengers came <orig
                        reg="unpleasantly">unplesantly</orig> near us. The <orig reg="enemy"
                    >enimy</orig> was reported to have a large army from 40 to 50 thousand. We have
                    been reinforced by one Division of Longstreets corps &amp; two Brigade of
                    F.H. Lee <orig reg="cavalry">cavilry</orig>. The <orig reg="enemy">enimy</orig>
                    <orig reg="destroyed">distroyed</orig> nearly the entire wheat crop from
                    Winchester to Strausburg, burned <orig reg="many">may</orig> barns. We are now
                    lying in the woods near Bunkers hill, ten miles below Winchester have orders to
                    be ready to <orig reg="move">moove</orig> at any moment none of us <orig

                    treated kindly at many <orig reg="places">plases</orig> by the <orig reg="Dutch"
                        >duch</orig> of <orig reg="Rockingham">Rockinham</orig> &amp; <orig
                        reg="Shenandoah">Shanandoor</orig>; all the objections I had to the girls
                    they <orig reg="were">ware</orig> all barefooted &amp; as I thought awkward
                        <pb n="3"/>in <orig reg="their">thare</orig> manners; They would commence
                    talking <orig reg="Dutch">duch</orig> in our <orig reg="presence"
                    >presance</orig>, often I thought they might be talking about me. None that I
                    saw could I think half as much of as my -- I am sure. Do not censure me for not
                    writing sooner I <orig reg="fully">fooly</orig> intended writing the day after I
                    got to camp but was sent to the ordinance wagon &amp; coming back to camp I
                        <orig reg="stopped">stoped</orig> at a <orig reg="Battery">Batery</orig>
                    &amp; found my cousin R. Brand &amp; stayed nearly all day with him; he
                    is a nice young man; I think you would know him he is still <orig
                        reg="redheaded">readheaded</orig> &amp; freckles in his face. For a few
                    day after leaving I think I was a little low spirited probably you can account
                    for it I <orig reg="don't">donnt</orig> think it was leaving Lottie; though her
                    company was very agreeable. Since I have got with the boys I have been in fine
                    spirits &amp; have been enjoying the best <pb n="4"/>of health, I hope <orig
                        reg="these">theese</orig> lines may find you enjoying the same blessing Jake
                    is enjoying fine health. Abe &amp; Hunter the same Abe is now by my side
                    writing to his better half Be <orig reg="cheerful">cheerfull</orig> &amp;
                        <orig reg="happy">hapy</orig> &amp; pray that I may be spared to return
                    to thee once more Often I think I would not have nothing to live for if it was
                    not for thee; It is an <orig reg="evil">eavill</orig> thought but still it will
                    arise in my wandering thoughts I must soon close as it is getting so dark I can
                    hardly see how to write; My love to all Write soon, oh how glad I would be to
                    get a letter from you tomorrow excuse bad writing &amp; all mistakes I will
                    write again before long from one that has wished <orig reg="thee">the</orig>
