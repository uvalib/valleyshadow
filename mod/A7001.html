<h4>Augusta County: William L. Ramsey to Matthew Pilson, May 17,
     1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William Ramsey writes Matthew Pilson to thank him for his donation of ten dollars for their
     Sabbath school. Ramsey also mentions the departure of their minister, Reverend Lawson, leaving
     their region with only one minister, a Mr. Thomas, who originally delivered the money from
     Matthew Pilson.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I write to acknowledge the receipt of ten dollars from yourself for our Sabbath School at
     Bethel through Rev. Mr. Thomas. It is a very acceptable gift indeed and we tender you the
     thanks of the Sabbath School.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Thomas desires me to say that as he did not visit us soon after his return home the money
     was not then paid. He however requested Rev. Mr. Lawson to hand it to us but he knowing that we
     would not need it untill Spring did pay it then. It is as well perhaps that we did not receive
     it untill now owing to the irregularity of the mails we might have lost it in sending for
     books.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Lawson has gone to Pa, and we are without any minister except Mr. Thomas in this region.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Wm L Ramsey</i></p>
<p class="p10">
      Mr. M. Pilson
