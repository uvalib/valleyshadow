<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 2<u>
      <sup>nd</sup>
     </u> came to hand yesterday -- we went across the Potomac on Friday -- took around by way of
     Sharpsburg, to near Hagerstown &amp; came back via Williamsport -- got 150 beeves, 2000
      bushels of corn, a large lot of leather &amp;c, drove away the
     Yankee cavalry -- killed 4 &amp; captured 8 of them &amp; we had one man wounded
     &amp; Saturday came back across the Potomac &amp; on to our old camp I got you a bonnet
     pattern, sent for it &amp;, did not get the one I wanted -- but you can see if it pleases
     you when it gets home -- I got two neck ribbons for the girls -- could only find one bright
     colored one -- I enclose them &amp; 2 skeins of silk &amp; a yard of elastic cord
     &amp; a paper of needles -- I will send 2 spools of white cotton thread &amp; <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>one of black thread -- all I could find -- such little articles are very scarce &amp;
     dear -- &amp; there are calls innumberable for them -- We sent our Cavalry over to demand
     of Chambersburg $100,000 to pay for the houses of Col. <i>[unclear: Boteler]</i>, Andrew
     Hunter &amp; Ed. J Lee, that were burned by the order of Hunter, informing them, if they
     did not comply that we would burn the town -- The demand was made &amp; they laughed at
     Gen. McCausland -- &amp; refused -- he obeyed his order &amp; burned the town --
     destroying some 250 houses -- he then left &amp; went westward -- followed for some
     distance by Averill, but slowly - our forces came back across the river &amp; to Moorfield
     where he encamped -- Johnson's<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Brigade being towards Roumey -- Averill followed
     &amp; fell on Johnson at daylight -- finding him asleep -- &amp; routed him completely
     -- Johnson was culpably negligent &amp; the affair was extremely disgraceful Johnson barely
     escaped, in his stocking feet &amp; on the bare back of a horse. There is but one opnion
     about Johnson -- &amp; the only wish is that he had been captured also -- He did good
     service in Maryland &amp; is a bold dashing fellow, but has no
     discipline -- Averill got about 400 of our men -- I suppose &amp; when he had gotten them
     he put back as hard as he could go - - The enemy is said to be moving quite a large force to
     Harper's Ferry &amp; we know that part of Grant's army is coming this way -- but we have
     arrangements made to meet them in all directions -- We moved today back to near Winchester
      to cover the roads leading<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>to the passes in the Blue Ridge
     -- It is very dry here also -- I am sorry it has been so dry at home -- as I heard that it had
     rained there -- I am glad Mr. Geeding will attend to my horses &amp; will be much obliged
     to him -- Miss Priss F -- had better dry up -- for <u>I know</u> what the
     people of Staunton think of Allie -- I can get along without Handkerchiefs until I get a chance to get mine -- I am wearing some of my flannels -- they are
     large enough -- I will get you what I can of your list -- I wrote you what I sent in the box --
     it will soon get home -- &amp; I enclose a few items that I have now I am delighted that
     the ribbon pleased you -- for my taste is <u>not</u> good -- Glad Anne is
     improving -- She shall have the red ribbon for it -- I certainly answered all your queries in
     my last letter seriatum -- I enclose you a few envelopes &amp; will put in stamps if I can
     get them before I send -- will try for a cloak -- but the chance is poor I fear -- our money is
     at such a heavy <i>[illeg.]</i> -- write often -- Love to all &amp; God bless you -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
