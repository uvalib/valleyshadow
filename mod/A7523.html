<p class="p10">Sept 16th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Mollie</p>
<p class="p10">We arrived home safely &amp; had a very
                    pleasant ride that is Magnus &amp; my self had.
                    Ella had a very
                    unpleasant one She had to take care of the children &amp; she was completely Exhausted when we
                    reached home I felt very sorry for her but could not
                    relieve her of her charge. Pardon me for not giving you back the Photograph that
                    I had taken out of your Album which I intended to
                    give back to you but forgot it you will find it enclosed I Suppose you thought very hard of me
                    for taking it after you Expressed a wish to keep it &amp; said if I gave it
                    back to you you<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>would not put it back in your Album forgive me this
                    time &amp; I won't do so again as regards the Ledger I sent you the two back numbers &amp; Shall continue to send the
                    Ledger although you forbid me not to I said that I
                    would not but I have changed my mind since I returned &amp; concluded to
                    send them to you.</p>
<p class="p10">Oh how much I did dislike to leave you on last Sunday I did wish that we could
                    have brought you with us for Mt. Solon is so lonely I went out on the Porch
                    Sunday &amp; looked at the place &amp; wondered how in this world you
                    all could content your Selves to live in Such a place where
                    there is no society I think I Should <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    my Self if I had to live there but there is your Dear Ma. &amp; Sisters I have never<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>met
                    a more affectionate family in my life everyone seems to Study the interest of
                    the other which ought to be the case with all Brothers &amp; Sisters. You
                    have one of the best of Mothers I have never seen her Equal it is the greatest
                    pleasure I have is to visit your home. I feel as though
                    I was going home when I visit your home I must bid you goodbye for they are waiting on me to go to the
                    country give my love to your ma. &amp; all my friends in Solon I send love
                    to you &amp; a Kiss all of your friends are well good bye I shall think of
                    you while I am gone I will be back Thursday write soon</p>
