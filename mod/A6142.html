<p class="p10">September 5th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Mt. Pisga</p>
<p class="p10">Dear companion</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter dated August the 27th last evening. it put
     me out of sorts to hear that you have not heard or got no letter since
     i have
     been in this camp. i have written some 7
     letters to you since the first day of august. i think it long between your letters. i have
     received some 3 or 4 that was dated in august from you. i can't tell
     why mine don't go to you. it ain't because i
      don't start them but i trust that they will come to hand yet. it must
     be the fault of the mail some where or how i
      don't
     know which. if the paret is with calf and her is not it may be that it
     would be best to beef her though i leave that with you to judge. it will
     suit me the way you think or do best. you want to know what i think of the war. i think it is a hard war but i don't think that it can last a great while longer though it may
     last longer than i think. there is a good deal of confusion amongst
     some of the soldiers in some of the brigades. it is mostly of the north
     carolinians. some virginians they say that the South is whipped but i don't think that and i don't think that the yankees will ever subjugate the south by fighting. for my part i can't say how long it will last but i still hope and trust god will soon see fit to put a stop to this horrible war. we have had a great revival of religion in our brigade and still a going
     on yet. Many have professed [part of the letter is gone here]<br> I must come to close by
     informing you that i am well and i hope and trust to god that this will
     find you and all of the family enjoying the same blessing of health
     which God has been so kind to bless me with.</p>
<p class="p10">As Mr. Hanna is a waiting on me i send my love you and all</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jesse Rolston</i></p>
<p class="p10">L. Hanna is on his way home and he waited until I wrote this. I started one to you by Swink
      last Monday. if you have not got the letters i sent to you answer this as soon as you can
       Mary C. Rolston
