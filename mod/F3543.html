                    regiment, the 126th Pennsylvania Volunteers. He requests that the General bring
                    the request to the attention of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="p10">October 2nd, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">General-</p>
<p class="p10">I beg to ask attention to the enclosed document relative to the <i>[deleted: ]</i>oral of Major James C. Austin, of 126th Penna Vols. The major is an old
                    acquaintnce and a friend, a thoroughly loyal man, and a good citizen. He + his
                    friends feel very keenly the present positions he occupies, are very anxious for
                    his reinstatement. He entered the service upon the President's late call, and he
                    sacrificed as much as almost anyone I know in entering the army.</p>
<p class="p10">there is but one testimony from Camp, that is to the actual disabling sickness,
                    certified to by the Colonel and other officers. <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>or he nor able physically, he <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <u>his regt.</u>, and nor <i>[illeg.]</i> when the order
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> I do not believe any one doubts his courage, his loyalty,
                    or his anxiety to do a soldier's full duty.</p>
<p class="p10">If able to see you personally + talk you all + know of him, I think you would be
                    satisfied on all these points. I am certain, + do unreserved endorse him of
                    entirely deserving of the confidence of his regiment + the government. I believe
                    that an order revoking that part of general order no. 125, which affect Austin,
                    replacing him in his regiment would be an act of justice. May I request that you
                    bring this issue to the attention of the Sec??</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor, General, to be<br>
                        your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Edward McPherson</i></p>
