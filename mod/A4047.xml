    <p>Yours of the 11<hi rend="super">th</hi>, one week ago today, came to hand yesterday, and
      <orig reg="though">tho'</orig> I have written to you twice &amp; wrote to you yesterday by
     Humphreys, in sending back my baggage, yet I will write again in reply to yours -- We are quiet
     -- in camp and the voices of prayer &amp; praise again goes peacefully up instead of the
     sounds of strife that have so much of late <orig reg="disturbed">distrubed</orig> our Sabbaths.
     Mr. Lacy preached at our <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> at 9 A.M. &amp; now he
     has gone to preach near Gen. Johnson's <abbr expan="Quarters">Qrs</abbr> -- his text was "Seek
     the Lord &amp; ye shall find him" &amp;c -- a very good short practical lecture. The
     enemy came over to near Leetown, day before yesterday, cavalry &amp; was repulsed by Stuart
     and driven back to the river at Shepherdstown -- the day before that they advanced from
     Harper's Ferry &amp; were driven back, but they captured Col. Harman, who was thrown
      from<pb n="2"/>his horse and stunned by the fall which led some of his men to think he was
     killed or badly wounded. A paper was taken from the Yankees at that time which had in an
     account of the riots in N.Y. City, resulting from an attempt to enforce the "Conscript Act", in
     which Kennedy, the <abbr expan="Chief">Chf.</abbr>
     <orig reg="Marshall">Marshal</orig> &amp; some of his assistants were killed, a square of
     the city burned up Governor's Island taken possession of the arms, railroads, telegraphs
     &amp;c of the city held by the mob &amp;c &amp;c, all of which you will soon see,
     no doubt, showing that time long predicted of opposition at home to Lincoln's domination may
     have already come -- The rain interfered with us seriously &amp; made it a matter of
     necessity, almost, for us to cross the river, we offered Meade battle for three days, but he
     went to fortifying himself so we came off and left him, passing the river in safety and our
     army is rapidly filling up from stragglers &amp; convalescents &amp; we are getting our
     men shod &amp;c &amp;c -- ready for what may be -page three- deemed best for the
     country - We regret the loss of Vicksburg, but consider that no vital blow was struck by its
     capture &amp; we feel that upon the very heels of reverses our most brilliant victories
     have always hung &amp; therefore, trusting in God, we look confidently to the future - The
     events I spoke of in the North have all transpired since the fall of Vicksburg - so you see the
     reputed "victories" of the "Union" army have not made the North a unit, and if you had seen, as
     we saw in Pa., the hatred of parties to one another, you would readily believe they never would
     become a unit. I started most of my baggage home yesterday &amp; went to Winchester to see
     about my bundle - it went on to Staunton by Capt. Persinger &amp; I sent it to the care of
     Maj. Bell, it may have gone to the Express office - it was wrapped up in a <orig reg="piece"
      >pice</orig> of oil cloth - you ought to have <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> it long ago
     - I know it went to Staunton. I saw note paper sold in Winchester Yesterday at $3 a quire,
     &amp; suppose that is what it is worth, so the two bundles you will have to sell are worth
     $20, or $30 - I mean the two 1/4 reams of note paper - Keep everything else of <pb n="4"
     />papers I send back &amp; see that all the things are dry before putting away -- I cannot
     send you any heavy articles &amp; you must do the best you can &amp; I will aid when in
     my power - I wish such extortion could be stopped -- but if you sell or trade away anything you
     must make prices correspond to what you have to pay -- in no other way can you live -- I am
     sorry for Mrs. Allen -- she has my heartfelt sympathy -- I thought they all were safe &amp;
     had not heard of the deaths you speak of -- but "it is appointed, unto all men, <hi
      rend="underline">once</hi> to die" and if they die nobly doing their duty it is well, they
     might have died as soon ingloriously at ease in the quiet of their homes -- they could not die
     before their appointed time &amp; if prepared it is all well -- William is well &amp;
     sends his love to May &amp; the children, our loss at Gettysburg has been much <orig
      reg="exaggerated">eaggerated</orig>, we did not lose more <orig reg="than">that</orig> at
     Chancellorsville -- I am quite sure from returns that have come in, that 15000 will cover all
     our losses -- I sent you a few candles -- abolish night work -- for candles are not to be had
     -- it's a fact &amp; facts are stubborn things -- I write on my knees sitting on the ground
     &amp; expect to eat off &amp; sleep on the grouond &amp;c &amp;c -- so go <orig
      reg="though">tho</orig> times &amp; like reasonable philosophers we must adapt ourselves
     to them -- enjoy what we have &amp; not think of what we have not. It exhausted my funds to
     buy my goods or I would send you money now, but will send when I draw my pay for this month --
     Be of good cheer -- &amp; May God bless you all. Remember me kindly to my friends -- Much
     love for you all at home -</p>
