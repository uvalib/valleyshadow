<p class="p10">Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">I do not like to write this evening, but as those tents are to go in the morning I will not
     have time. We have all been at Church today. Would that you could
     have enjoyed the Same inestimable blessing But as this cannot be
     I will tell you for your encouragement
     there is much fervent Prayer offered up for
     you and all those Dear friends who have At their Country's call taken their lives in their hands and gone out from Among us We received
     your letter of the 31<sup>st</sup> this morning Just when we were ready to go to Church we were very glad to hear from you. We thought if you had left
     Harpers Ferry we would not hear from you for some time I am very Sorry to hear that the measles
     are in Camp As it is A very dangerous disorder to be exposed in. I want you to use every
     precaution and be as careful of yourself as the circumstances in which you are placed will
     admit of. Some of the Ladies are making Soldiers Cloaks out of their Piano covers; I have none But will send you one of my Oil cloth
     table covers; which I want you to Spread down when you have to make your bed on the ground it
     will keep the dampness from you I want you also to wear it Around you when you have to stand
     guard when it is raining</p>
<p class="p10">Monday morning</p>
<p class="p10">Your Father has gone up to Newport to see who is going If M<sup>r</sup> Hite<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley24b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley24b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     goes it will be good chance for you to send any thing home that
     you do not want It would also be a good chance for us to send <i>[deleted: any]</i> things to you If we knew what you wanted if you need Stockings or anything send us word that we may have time to prepare it Your Pa will
     send you some money. I will send you a Round of Beef and would like to send you some cakes; but
     think they will be old and dry before you could get them. I will send you two Staunton papers
     you will find a piece in each marked which I want you to read. I will
     put the things in a coarse pocke which you can use for dish-cloths if you need them. And now my
     Dear Son in closing I will Admonish you once more to observe Gods
     Sabbath and all his commandments as strictly as you possibly can in the circumstances in which
     you are placed. There are many precious promises in his Holy Word to those who do.</p>
<p class="p10">Nothing more but I remain your affectionate Mother</p>

<p class="p10">I wish you would hurry up your term and get
      home on a furlough I would like very much to see you You must not wait until all the others have been home before you come. At least come against the end of
      three months Mr Beard has left a bundle and a letter here Mol for John for us to send I will
      just put the letter in the envelope with yours you can give it to
      him and make him believe it is from me<br> Allison </p>
