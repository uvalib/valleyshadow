<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Pastor notes that during the dress parades women from the country come to
                         watch, though he is no "lady's man." He mentions that Annie's cousin Anne B
                         has also written to him. And he discusses his relationship with Annie.</p>

<p class="p10">May 29th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Bolivar</p>
<p class="p10">Friend Annie,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter dated May the 23<sup>rd</sup> on last Sabbath &amp; was glad to know that you had
                         not entirely forgotten your absent friend. I wrote you a long letter while on the "Shenandoah
                         Heights" one Sabbath
                         &amp; sent the same by Dr. McChesney, which should have reached you by
                         the time Lieutenant McKanny arrived at home,
                         but I suppose you never received it. As you only spoke of receiving a note.
                         I have nothing of interest to write you now. Things are going on about as
                         they were when I last wrote you. I have seen some nice ladies this week. In
                         the evening when we go on Dress parade they begin to come in from the
                         country &amp; assemble on the <u>parade</u>
                         <u>ground</u>
                         until it's a very difficult matter to get though
                         the crowdin consequence of their "<u>extension
                         shirts</u>". Yesterday I had the exquisite pleasure of becoming acquainted
                         with a beautiful little girl, but she was <i>[unclear: summoned]</i> so
                         with <u>soldiers</u> that I had no chance<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> of
                         cultivating it to any extent.</p>
<p class="p10">I have had so little to say to the ladies since I left that I hardly know
                         what way to conduct myself in their presence not being a lady's man.
                         &amp; this you know.</p>
<p class="p10"> I got a letter from your dear Cousin Anne B - which I estimate very highly
                         indeed from the fact, that she is the <u>only</u> lady
                              (<u>except</u>
                         <u>your</u>
                         <u>self</u>) who has thought enough of one to write. I
                         also received a nice rosette from her that I will endeavor to keep as long
                         I possibly can as a token of her respect for me.</p>
<p class="p10">You wished to know the state of my health in your last? well I am in good
                         health. never engaged better in my life. I think that the <u>camp life</u> will agree with me firstrate if I can
                         only get plenty of <i>[unclear: 
                              <u>provender.</u>
                         ]</i></p>
<p class="p10">You need have no fear of my coming to the conclusion you spoke of in your
                         last from the fact that I am no longer held (by you) with the<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                         same esteem that I have reason to believe I once was. This is my humble
                         opinion, which I drew from the winding up of your last. I had no idea of
                         ever hearing that thrown up to me again. I think you ought to let "by
                         gones" be "by gones". And not harbor the idea any longer. I am very much
                         obligated to you, for anything you have done
                         in endeavoring to make my stay here comfortable &amp; agreeable. And I
                         sincerely hope that your pathway through this life may be strewn with
                         flowers, &amp; that you may have a peaceful entrance at last into
                         heaven above.</p>
<p class="p10">I must bring this uninteresting note to a close. hoping to hear from you
                         soon.</p>
<p class="p10">I subscribe myself your <u>true friend</u> and
                              well wisher,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                              <u>Tony Pastor</u>
                         </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Give my love to all my acquaintances Tell Miss
                              Jennie I would like to hear from her. I had my beauty taken a few
                              moments ago <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>with a <u>linsey</u>
                              <u>shirt</u>

                              side.<br><br> P.S. 2<sup>nd</sup> May 30 -<br> As I did
                              not get this in the office yesterday I will add a few words this
                              morning. The <u>West</u>

                              expecting to get orders too, but haven't as yet received them. Half the Lexington
