                        <br>My dear Friend </p>
<p class="p10">I was in Staunton yesterday and failed to get Reverend
                    Mr Stuart to preach on next Sabbath, Reverend Mr See had just engaged him for next Sabbath,
                    he is going to the Army, I saw Mr Baker says it will
                        suit him to be with us on Saturday and Sunday of
                    next week would like to be with his own people on
                    Friday, that is the understanding unless we give him further notice, he says he
                    can come the next Sabbath if that will suit us better, I did intend coming by your House on my
                    way home, but having to go by Fishersville in the morning and the day being so
                    very warm, I was unable to do so. In hopes you are improving.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your sincere friend</p>
