<p class="p10">May 12<sup>th</sup> /63</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Hamilton's Crossing</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this morning to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well with the
     exception of being very tired from the effects of the late terrible suffering we have passed
     through We lay in line of battle for nearly three days and nights besides the hard fight of May
     3 On Tuesday evening May fifth it commenced raining and did not stop until friday The whole of
     which time we were compelled to lay out or be marching through the
     mud. This last battle is one among the most terrible that we have had lately. a great many of
     the wounded Yankees being burnt to death. The large brick house at Chancellorsville took fire
     and burnt up with about two hundred wounded yankees who were so badly hurt that they could not
     move and their own soldiers did not help them any. Later in the day the woods took fire and a
     great many more helpless men perished. I seen some of these buried and it was truly sickening
     to see their burnt and charred bodies<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley47b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley47b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      and their burial was not much better as there was so many that our
     men could not dig graves for them but just threw a few shovels   full of dirt over them and passed on to the next remarking as they did so that
     if they had stayed at home as they should have done they might
     probably have gotten a decent burial I seen some of their dead who had been buried in gutters
     with the clay all washed off of them and they almost as black as charcoal from exposure to the
     air. I suppose you have heard of the death of Lieutenant Charles
     Calhoun he died sunday morning from the effects of amputation of his leg his father came down
     sunday evening he had heard of his being wounded but did not know that he was dead he seems to
     be very much distressed. Cyrus strong was wounded badly we heard sunday that he was not
     expected to live but have heard nothing since Last Sunday was appointed by General Lee as a day
     of Thanksgiving it was pretty
     generally observed through our part of the army. Our preacher made
     a very good sermon from the (20) &amp; (21) verses of the (26) twenty sixth. Chapter of
     Isaiah. As my paper is nearly out I will close by asking you to excuse all mistakes bad writing
      etc. Give my love to all inquiring
     friends &amp; relations; Aunt Ann, &amp; Uncle James's,
     family, in particular. </p>
<p class="p10">and receive a due share yourself from your affectionate nephew</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thomas M. Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">Ps (Please write soon &amp; direct to Hamiltons Crossing)</p>
