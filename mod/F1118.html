<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham
                    Rosenbery (father), December 31, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>As in earlier letters, Rosenbery announces his faith in God. He goes onto review
                    casualties that have struck his regiment. He closes by describing his sleeping
                    quarters and requesting more letters as well as his repaired watch from
                home.</p>

<p class="p10">December 31, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Stephensville, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself to inform you that I feel to thank God that He has
                    spared me in life and good health to this present time. And enabling me to
                    converse with you by pen and ink. Trusting in God for rich blessings.</p>
<p class="p10">These few imperfect lines may find you and all the
                    family enjoying good health.</p>
<p class="p10">I have nothing of importance to write at this time.</p>
<p class="p10">We are still laying in Winter Quarters and it is raining today. Yesterday it was
                    clear and warm. It reminded me of a Spring Morning.</p>
<p class="p10">Our camp lays in a low place. Plenty of mud. We lay about 5 miles Southeast
                    direction of Brandy Station. I do not call this a very healthy place. The health
                    of our Regiment is pretty good in a general way. One
                    man died night before last. One last night and one died a few weeks ago. There
                    was one man out of the 52nd Regiment died last night
                    at the same hospital.</p>
<p class="p10">There is 4 Regiments in our Brigade. There is on an
                    average from our Regiment that reports at the sick
                    call in the morning about 60 men. That is a small number where there is so many
                    men together.</p>
<p class="p10">About the other three Regiments I cannot tell. I have not heard where the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry is but I suppose they are in
                    front.</p>
<p class="p10">While I think of it, I will ask you if you have fixed my small account with Huber
                    yet.</p>
<p class="p10">I think that I must stop writing, I have no comfortable place to write.</p>
<p class="p10">I have a good bed to sleep on these long nights. It makes my my bones feel sore.
                    My bed is good to wake me up early in the morning. My feather bed does not
                    bother me much. My bed is made of white oak poles. On the poles I lay my gum
                    blanket. Then my overcoat. Then I take off my blouse. Lay it down. Then I have a
                        woolen blanket to cover with. My knapsack for a
                    pillow. I presume that you will call this a poor bed. But
                    anything will do for a soldier.</p>
<p class="p10">Send my watch as soon as you can. I will close by sending my best to all.</p>
<p class="p10">I would like to know if my family has forsaken me. It loooks a little that way.</p>
<p class="p10">So fare well, dear father, for this time.</p>
