                <p>This personal letter to How from Addison Terry was written after How left the
                    Bureau and Virginia. Terry relates the reorganization of the Bureau which moved
                    Augusta County from the Winchester to Lynchburg jurisdiction. Terry comments
                    that as a result the Bureau's power is even less than it was before. The rest of
                    letter contains personal news from Winchester and commentary on the tense
                    political situation in that town.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
                </opener>

                <p><unclear>Since</unclear> receiving yours of 2<hi rend="super">d</hi>
                    <abbr expan="instant">inst</abbr>, which I read with much pride and pleasure I
                    received the order &amp; letter which I enclose, and have prepared the
                    reports called for, with the exception of the personal narrative <abbr
                        expan="report">rep't</abbr>. The date at which the last yearly statements
                    were mailed was September 15 1865.</p>

                <p>I hope none of your relations were sufferers by the great fire in Portland but I
                    suppose many of your friends, and I fear all your family there must have lost a
                    great deal. <pb n="2"/> It seems as if all cities were doomed at some period, to
                    be nearly destroyed by fire. I suppose the Transcript office went with
                    everything else; fortunately the loss of property does not also include loss of
                    life, as might have been the case. I presume you are recommencing practice, and
                    I hope your old patients will be ready to welcome your return.</p>

                <p>There has been quite a change here. The District has been divided. All the
                    counties from Augusta to Potomac are transfered to the <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Commissioner">Asst. Comr.</abbr> Baltimore, &amp; the
                    others, including Augusta attached to 7th <abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr>
                    (Lynchburg).</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>Mr. How is still at Staunton. He is now borne by <abbr expan="Major">Maj</abbr>
                    White at Richmond, to where <abbr expan="Major">Maj</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Remington">R</abbr> transferred everything in these Counties. The
                    change has made no other difference here, than that the work will be much less,
                    and all the <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendents">Asst Supts</abbr>
                    <unclear>more</unclear> easy of access. The real power of the Bureau is nothing.
                    I can't even say it has been reduced to nothing for that would imply that it had
                    been powerful but its influence is less and less. Miss Florence Sharp desired me
                    to send you her regards, also Miss Wright the <unclear>Malerys</unclear>, the
                    Doctor &amp; <unclear>Sla--maker</unclear>
                    <unclear>Chalfaut</unclear> returned yesterday from York, and I understand that
                    their business here has been <pb n="4"/>so very unsuccessful that they intend to
                    give it up. It is no use for people with decided and open loyal sentiments to do
                    anything here. On the days of the great Federal procession S.
                        <unclear>O'Ch------</unclear> store was the only place of any size open in
                    town, Mr. Dennys &amp; Mac kept their grocery stores open &amp; the
                    Journal office and that was all. One Northern storekeeper here turned out in the
                    procession. Mr. <unclear>Slaymaker</unclear> comes S.
                    <unclear>-----out</unclear> with the quakers 4th of July &amp; had a
                    celebration out at the ridge. Of course after such open demonstrations the
                        <unclear>Ch--lry</unclear> wont trade with him. Southern agricultural Stores
                    are pressed to supply the demand for harvesting while their store is
                    comparatively deserted. Mr Watsons addressed the Darkies at a <unclear>pie
                    nie</unclear> held lately. His business is very poor, and is worse than it <pb
                        n="5"/>used to be, and it was never good.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="Major">Maj</abbr> Remington is a good sound loyal man. The Regulars
                    had a small party or hop at the Hotel recently. <abbr expan="Major">Maj</abbr>
                    R. &amp; <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Chandler, were the only Officers
                    not invited. <unclear>I could</unclear> not have gone, but the slight was, of
                    course, the Bureau. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Ellis, who married Miss
                    Griffith, was here and invited but didnt go. Nearly all who went were Rebels.</p>

                <p>Mr. Ward is very much liked, and has a good congregation, even on the hottest
                    days, and he is a much better man than <pb n="6"/>he was supposed to be.</p>

                <p>Mr. <unclear>Creave</unclear> did good service in drawing the line, so that
                    whoever came after him had to take sides at once, not that I think it was
                    necessary in Mr. Wards case.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="Major">Maj</abbr> Remington sends you his best wishes, and will <del
                        hand="h1">right</del> write.</p>

                <p>The Feud at our house after many skirmishes finally broke out in open war, and
                    Mr. &amp; Mrs S. &amp; ditto C. left. The Chalfauts went to Wrights, and
                    the Slaymakers to Mrs Chase's.</p>

                <p>Dr. Atwood has been rendered very proud by an addition to his family. Mother
                    &amp; little girl doing exceedingly well.</p>

                <pb n="7"/>

                <p>I don't think any body ever left more friends behind him after so short a
                    residence than you. I never see any one without hearing them enquire about you.
                    Everyone seems interested to hear how you are getting on &amp; where you
                    are, and particularly among the girls, whether you are married. One of the
                        <unclear>S-sch</unclear> Newspapers after you left had a very complementary
                    paragraph stating that you were to be assigned to more important duties
                    &amp;c.</p>
