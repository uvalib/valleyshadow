<h4>Augusta County: Isaac N. Smith to Colonel G. Q.
                    Tompkins, June 10, 1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Smith ponders the nature of war and analyzes the current state of military
                    affairs. He fears Richmond will fall, and he discusses the activities of
                    Confederate and Union forces in Virginia, as he reviews the strategies of
                    several Generals, including Jackson, McClellan, Fremont, and others. Smith also
                    discusses the difficulty of communicating with his family.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Colonel C. Q. Tompkins
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 10/1862</p>
<p class="p10">Folly Farm (near Staunton)</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Colonel -</p>
<p class="p10">So far from adding anything to my despondency, your letter was a source of
                    gratification &amp; satisfaction - Your sentiments harmonize more nearly
                    with mine, than those of anyone else, &amp; I
                    read your statement of occurrences &amp; remarks upon them, with a
                    consciousness that I am reading truths, &amp; not monstrous exaggerations-
                    The utter disregard for truth, which permits both sides in every contest great
                    or small, to claim a magnificent victory; &amp; for justice, which
                    aggravates every slight irregularity on either
                    side, into a monstrous outrage &amp; crime, illustrates forcibly the
                    degrading tendency of the war - an approach to truth may be attained from the
                    public prints <i>[added: only]</i> by a careful study of
                    details in the accounts of both sides, &amp; deducing conclusions - upon
                    general statements nothing can be founded</p>
<p class="p10">Upon general principles I am led to believe Richmond must fall. Time is all a
                    besieging force of appropriate numbers needs, &amp; that time has been<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> given in a great measure. M<sup>c</sup>Clellan's
                    reconnaisances have been sufficiently complete for more than a week or ten days,
                    to admit of definite plans &amp; arguments, doubtless now in course of
                    prosecution. Except the battle of Seven Pines, we have read of no engagement
                    near Richmond, &amp; I am satisfied the Yankees have not been idle. I am
                    forced to conclude also that the "Seven Pines" is wholly without other than
                    moral effect. The Yankees were doubtless somewhat worsted, but its <i>[added: effect]</i> bears such a proportion to the fate of
                    Richmond, as a skirmish among <i>[unclear: 
                        pickets
                    ]</i> to an impending battle between <i>[deleted: opposing]</i>
                    contiguous armies. I am also so perfectly satisfied that the Confederate <i>[added: generals]</i> have already done, &amp; are
                    still doing everything that can be done in the premises, as to make that fact an
                    important consideration in my conclusions. If they could have done so, they
                    would certainly have before this joined battle in full force, &amp; thus
                        <i>[added: have]</i> adopted perhaps the only means of
                    saving the city. Whilst I am writng this may have already been done, but we
                    heard nothing of it.</p>
<p class="p10">I know you have mourned with me over the<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> losses of our regiment at
                    Lewisburg. My first information was that poor Thompson <i>[deleted: was
                    killed]</i> and Colonel Patton's brother were killed,
                    and that Rand was left lying in the field with a broken arm. These things
                    shocked me greatly, &amp; I have been greatly relieved to learn that my
                    information was not correct. We have though to mourn some <i>[added: good]</i> men, Lieutenant Tom Mason formely "orderly" of Barker's Company was killed- he was a very worthy man. <i>[unclear: 
                        Captain
                    ]</i> Chase &amp; Lieutenant Johns (formerly 1<sup>
                        <u>st</u>
                    </sup>
                    Lieutenant &amp; orderly) of Lipscombe's Company were also killed, Except one of the privates Chenning) of the
                    Riflemen these are <i>[added: all of]</i> the fatal
                    casualties I have learned Thompson's <u>other</u> eye was
                    badly shot, &amp; being badly stunned by the Shock, he was left for dead
                    upon the battlefield - Rand was <i>[added: not wounded but]</i> taken prisoner in Mason Matthews house
                    - I am glad of it - he will now at least be out of danger &amp; can see his
                    friends. - The regiment is said to have behaved handsomely, they had the post of
                    honor (the right flank), &amp; drove the enemy before them as far down as
                    Mason Matthews house; the <i>[illeg.]</i> repulse &amp; flight of the left
                    made it necessary for them to retreat but they were so far in advance, as to
                    make their escape<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> with great difficulty, &amp; not without severe
                    loss as the Yankees had nearly closed in behind them. I get this information
                    from Captain Ruby who has recently written me. You <i>[deleted: have]</i>may have heard it long since - I have a warm affection for <i>[deleted: ]</i> the regiment, &amp; whilst I rejoice over their gallantry I
                    deeply mourn their losses</p>
<p class="p10">I can tell you little or nothing <i>[illeg.]</i> of news here, On Sunday <i>[deleted: ]</i> cannonading was heard here. On yesterday morning (Monday) I
                    heard with great distinctness heavy cannonading, very frequent &amp;
                    somewhat continued - We learn the fight on Sunday was Ewell's force with part of
                    Jackson's old command, engaged with Fremont &amp; Rosecrans' forces between
                    Port Republic &amp; Harrisonburg. On yesterday Jackson fought Shields' near Port Republic - Shields came up the
                    Valley from Front Royal on the East side of the South Fork of Shenandoah,
                    &amp; the battle took place on that side - Jackson attacking. To tell the
                    results of these two engagements is a different matter. I hear that the
                    Confederates were victorious in both, - the following are some of the accounts.
                    The rumor before the fight on Sunday morning was that
                    Jackson &amp; staff had been captured at their headquarters (this was false
                    of course) - Sunday evening "Enemy <u>badly whipped</u> took
                    18 cannon" "Enemy <i>[unclear: do]</i> took three cannon"-<i>[deleted: Monday
                        morning" Ewell whipped Fremont]</i> "Enemy <i>[unclear: do]</i>" took
                        everything Shields had" (Shields army at that
                    time not engaged) - Monday morning "Ewell <i>[deleted: whipped]</i> &amp;
                    whipped &amp; routed Fremont"- etc., etc., etc. Monday evening "Jackson routed Shields, Shields
                    retreating &amp; blocking the road behind him" - Last evening late it was
                    reported Fremont was crossing the North river at a ford between Port Republic
                    "The Valley Turnpike, &amp; it is certain that the bridge across the river
                    at Port Republic was burned by <i>[deleted: --- Jackson ---]</i> the
                    Confederates - A victory followed by the <i>[deleted: retreat]</i> falling
                    back of the victorious army, &amp; the destruction of the only bridge left
                    in the Valley, is certainly not a remarkable success. The bridge you will see by
                    reference to a recent <i>[illeg.]</i>, across Middle river just before its
                    junction with<br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> the South fork of Shenandoah river. Ewell fought
                    somewhere along the road from Port Republic to Harrisonburg, &amp; must have
                    fallen back for he would scarcely have burned the bridge behind him. An
                    additional fact is <i>[added: that]</i> sick &amp;
                    wounded etc. are being removed from Staunton by
                    order of Jackson - it is also said that Jackson received a regiment or two
                    reinforements on yesterday, &amp; more are expected today. These are reports which have reached me distilled through many
                    brains &amp; lips. You can study them for yourself I can draw no conclusions</p>
<p class="p10">I have abandoned all hope of receiving any letters from my wife &amp; sister.
                    My efforts to get them aided as I have been by kind friends have been
                        <i>[unclear: unavailing]</i>. My family have not heard from me either. The
                    Federal officer at Charleston burned my last letter which reached them <i>[added: in February]</i>
                    Colonel Patton thought the last which I wrote improper
                    &amp; did not feel authorized to send it - on neither side therefore have we
                    received letters for many months. The short letter I have received from my
                    mother who seemed too much affected to write news.</p>
<p class="p10">My kindest regards to all of your family &amp; believe me very truly</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
