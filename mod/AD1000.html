<h4>Augusta County: Diary of DeWitt Clinton Gallaher (1864-1865)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About DeWitt Clinton Gallaher:<br></b>DeWitt Clinton Gallaher was born in Jefferson County,
Virginia (later West Virginia), on August 2, 1845.  As a
youth, he moved with his family to Waynesboro, Virginia, and
later attended school at Hampden-Sidney College, Washington
College (now Washington and Lee), Munich University, Germany,
and the University of Virginia.   After the war, Gallaher
moved to Charleston, West Virginia, to practice law.  He died
in 1926.  This diary describes his service in the 1st Virginia
Cavalry and includes details about his work as a provost guard
and about his relationship with fellow officers and
soldiers.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>June 8, 1864</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">THIS DIARY BEGINS THERE:  June 8, 1864.  (Former notebook
or "Diary" is lost)</p><p class="p10">Marching to overtake General Sheridan's Cavalry raid.
Marched from Ashland, Hanover County, towards Frederick's
Hall, in Louisa County. Followed him several days, skirmishing
continually. Finally caught up with his main forces at Trevilians on the railroad. </p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 11-12</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Fight at Louisa Courthouse, and
a very hard one at Trevilians
Station on the old Virginia Central
(Now Chesapeake and Ohio) Railroad. Here I got a fine Yankee Carbine (a short shot
gun for cavalry), discarding my old one. We badly worsted
Sheridan so much that he tried to get back to Grant as fast as
he could.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 13-14-15</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We pursued Sheridan, who finally eluded us, towards Bowling
Green, Caroline
County, Virginia.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 16-17</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Camped near Milford Station, on R. and F. Railroad.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 18-19-20</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March towards the White House near
the York River. Remain around there several days. Fight with
negro infantry.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 21</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March back to Battom's Bridge.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 23</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March in the night and long after daylight to near Charles
City, Courthouse and not far from
Harrison's Landing on the James River.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 24</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Fight--a sharp one, with Gregg's Cavalry near Charles City
Courthouse. Our Regiment was
dismounted and we were sent in on foot. In determining who
were to dismount, the Company was lined up and counted by
fours, that is; every fourth man was to hold the horses of
numbers 1, 2, 3, and his own of
course, and take and keep them in there rear, as far as
practicable out of danger, and to bring them up, if a retreat
were ordered or in any other emergency, when there was a
terrible scramble to mount and get away. It fell to me to
dismount and go in that day. I shall never forget that day or
the next! </p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 25th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">It was very warm, burning hot, and just before the charge
was ordered we were in the edge of some woods and under fire
of artillery and small arms, a piece of shell--called shrapnel
now--struck my left boot and as I nearly fell some of the boys
(Jim Kerr and Phil Coiner) wanted to carry me off, supposing
my leg was broken. When ordered to advance and charge the
enemy there, we crossing an open field running as fast as we
could, the Yankees began to "Skedaddle" and flee! I got close
up to a General, or a bunch of officers, trying to rally their
fleeing men and took deliberate aim at him and can never
understand why he did not fall as he galloped away. He may
have only been wounded. We followed them on foot for three or
four miles in a blazing sun. I was never so tired in my life
carrying my carbine pistol and ammunition, but the excitement
kept me up. We drove them until it was too dark to follow.
They ran clean away into the night. Oh How glad I was to again
mount my faithful horse and go into camp for the night!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 26th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I was so stiff and sore from that running fight yesterday I
could hardly saddle my horse and mount him. Expecting an
attack, for Grant was still pressing Lee, we were again
ordered to go in dismounted and await the attack. It again
fell to my lot to dismount!</p><p class="p10">As Lee was falling back, I well knew that if in the fight
our Regiment was ordered to retreat, I could not run--was too
sore and stiff from the previous day's exertions. I know if we
retreated I was sure to be either captured or killed. I could
not run back to our "Led Horses." So I took off my jacket,
fastened it to my saddle and took off a gold ring my mother
had given me and told the boy holding my horse that I did not
expect to be back again and to give or send the ring to my
mother for me, and told him to send my horse home and that he
could have my other things. </p><p class="p10">Well, down into the woods we went, ready for a fight and
expected attack, but after lying there several hours we were
recalled and again mounted our horses. The Yankees had gone in
another direction, so we marched after them towards the famous
"Malvern Hill" the scene of a bloody battle the year before on
McClellan's retreat, where driven by Lee, he (McClellan) sought the protection of his
gunboats on the James River. So much of my foreboding of
prison or worse! </p><p class="p10">We cross on a pontoon bridge James River near Drury's
Bluff, as Grant changed his attack on Richmond by placing his
army on the south side of the river, near Petersburg, and most
of our army followed to that side.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 27th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We lie in the woods all day, the first real rest for about
50 days. The last three days were terrible--very hot and the
dust inconceivably thick, and men suffering.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 28th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Moved camp to within about 6 miles of Petersburg
overlooking the James River. </p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 29th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Pass through Petersburg and fight--and whip General
Wilson's Yankee Cavalry, capturing 13 peices of artillery, all
of his wagons and 300 or 400 runaway negroes whom Wilson had
picked up and harbored.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>June 30th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We follow Wilson's cavalry to Jarretts Station on the
"Petersburg &amp; Weldon Rail Road"--as it was then called, now
the A. C. L., and encamp there that night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 1864

</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 1st</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Leave Jarrett's Station and March nearly all day until we
encamp for the night. Within about 2 miles of Dinwiddie, Courthouse.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 2nd</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March to within 2 miles of Reams Station on the Petersburg
&amp; Weldon Railroad marching about all
day. Encamp there that night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 3rd</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Lie in camp all day. Grateful rest!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 4th-5th-6th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Was put on Provost Guard duty today. This "guard" was over
prisoners, etc., temporarily. My horse got badly chocked--
thought he was dying for awhile. He came around all right.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 7th to 27th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">In camp in woods near Petersburg. Very hot. But little to
eat for man or horse. Feed so scarce we waded a swamp near by
and cut grass for our poor horses. They even barked pine trees
so famished were they. Our fare was "hard (very hard) tack"--
crackers which we cooked in grease from fat pork. I went into
Petersburg one day and found
1/4 lb. of pepper! Quite a find. It cost me $2.50 for the
1/4lb., but it was worth it. We used it to "season the hard
tack and grease. With the pepper, it gave some tang to it and
of course, pep too.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 28th (1864)</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">"Boots and Saddles" was blown by the bugler at 10:11 p.m.
and we hurriedly moved out of camp and through Petersburg in
the night and crossed James River on Pontoon bridges back
again to the north side, and in the sultry heat and fearful
dust of thousands of horses, we
went into Camp about 6 miles below Richmond and remained there
that night. (29th)</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 30th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March down the Charles City Road a couple of miles. Halt in
the hot sun a long time. I buy a real loaf of bread and prize
it highly, for I was really sick today. Went back to our
artillery Camp for the night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 31st</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Some of us were sent to Chaffin's Bluff overlooking James
River to stop all cavalry men from going into Richmond--
Stragglers etc. I found I was near a man named Hoppe, who knew
my family. I called at his house and they gave me something to
eat. We were called off our post about sundown and again
crossed the James River on a pontoon bridge (there were three
of them) to the South side--so we had crossed all three
pontoons--marched until after midnight and went into camp and
slept like a rock.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 1864

</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 1st (1864)</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Got up before daylight and marched through Petersburg again
and went into camp just where we previously had been. Bath in
a nearby creek. It was fine after all those days of torrid
heat and dust.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 2nd (1864)</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">My 19th birthday! How I spent it? My dinner? Cold water,
cornbread (made of meal, grease, and water) and fat bacon! I
quote from my then taken notes--"How differently spent from my
usual way of doing so! Nobody to bestow upon me their smiles
and gifts." I was put on guard that night over some Yankees
and vagabonds--stood two hours as guard in the night thinking
of the dear home in the Valley. Dave Drake came in from his
home and gave me a snack. Drake was a messmate and had been
home on furlough.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 3rd</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I go out "foraging." Get some peaches and get a dinner at
Mr. Carter's. Ate very heartily!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 4th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I did some writing for Captain Henry Lee in his tent. Today
I bought a canteen of sorghum molasses. Great treat!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 5th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Went to see Sam Priller who was sick at a Mrs. Blick's and
got my dinner there. A "war-time" dinner. Returned and "Boots
&amp; Saddles" blew--Marched back to old camp again near
Petersburg. Marched until 1:00 a.m. Very tired out. Had to
rise at 5:00 a.m.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 6th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Got up at 5:00 a.m. and marched to near Manchester opposite
Richmond. Went into town to get something to eat. Camped near
the town.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 7th (Sunday)</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Left camp and marched to and through Richmond--up Pearl to
Main Street, to 3rd to Broad and to
Brooke Turnpike. As we were riding along at corner of Franklin
and 3rd Street, someone called my
name. I found it was Miss Laura Kent, whom I had met and known
in Waynesboro. She begged me to accompany her to her home,
corner of 1st and Franklin and get something to eat. I was
terribly dusty from marching in such clouds of dust as a
Brigade of horses can and did raise. Tried to beg off, though
terribly hungry, but she insisting, I yielded. The streets
were full of Church goers at the time. I tied my horse in
front of her home and entered with her to the parlor, where
entertaining some well
dressed officers in flashy uniforms and shining boots,
evidently swivel-chair sissy officers around Richmond, who
looked almost shocked to see a private, dusty and not very
neat sitting at a marble top table eating from silver and
china! I was so fussed and felt so awkward, I really could eat
but little. So I told Laura I "had a sick comrade" and if she
would fix up a lunch I would take it to him. She readily did
so. Bidding her goodbye, I rode away to overtake my command.
Needless to say, that soon after leaving, I threw my reins on
the neck of my horse and the "sick comrade" ate and enjoyed
that lunch. I ate every crumb of it. I overtook my command at
the Yellow Tavern (where our old Commander General J. E. B.
Stuart was killed in the May previous) Go into camp for the
night at Ashland.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 8th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March to within two miles of Beaver Dam Station on Rail
Road.  (Now the C&amp;O Railroad)</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">As we were marching along in lower Orange or Louisa County,
I heard a wonderful cheering of our men. The cause was that
most of our Regiment and Brigade were from the section where
the mountains were and the boys had been down in the God
forsaken "lowlands" and were so sick of them that when they
first caught sight of the Blue Ridge, their hearts were
thrilled and a joyous shout and cheer went up. It reminded one
of the "Retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks" who cried with joy
"Thalatta! "Thalatta!" (The Sea! The Sea!) When they got so
near home! (See Zenophon's Anabasis for this.)</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 15th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">In camp near Front Royal. Had a meal at a Mr. Buck's.
Enjoyed it. Hear the Yankee Cavalry are in the neighborhood.
We had expected this. General Jubal T. Early, then in command
of the Valley, had but few cavalry and had appealed to General
Lee to send him some, as Sheridan's Cavalry had been running
over the few cavalry that Early had. Hence Fitz Lee's old
Brigade (ours) was sent to him.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 16th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Yankees came up and we attacked them. We were badly
managed and were repulsed at Guard Hill with some loss; went
into the Camp of the previous night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 17th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Some of us got a girl at the big mill near Luray to make us
some real coffee. Very fine. Brucie Trout was the girl and she
was very pretty and kind to us.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 18th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Marched to within 6 miles of Winchester on the Plank Road.
We had a scrap with Yankee Cavalry below Winchester on the
Berryville Road. It rained in torrents and we got soaked
through and through. Horrible night we had! Hungry--wagons not
up with us--fearfully tired, and sleeping in the rain.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 22nd</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">On the March I went to a man's house named Knode, who was a
friend of my mother's family. Got a "snack" there. In camp at
a Church in Lee Town (Jefferson County). Rains very hard. In
the suburbs of Lee Town, Dr. Gregg Gibson, a cousin of Amelia,
my brother William's wife, lived in the old Tucker home. A
beautiful old colonial house, with a grove of "ancestral"
trees around it, and with an immense garden with a vine clad
brick high wall all around it, radiant with flowers and
beautiful shrubbery. Here, my
sister in law, just married in that house was staying. Her old
home was in the Vicinity and William had taken advantage of
our troops being in possession there temporarily and had gone
down and married Amelia. I called to see her. You can imagine
the pleasure and surprise that visit was! I got off for a
visit to Mr. Abel's that night and slept in a <i>bed</i>! Met some girls there from the Luray
Valley named Lionberger. An old friend, Joe Crane had married
one of them.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 25th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rejoin my command at Lee Town, which had been inactive for
several days, and in camp. Marched through Martinsburg and encamp at Falling
Waters on the Potomac River, and nearly opposite Williamsport, Maryland. Here we found many old "union"
farmers (sympathizers with the North) and we helped ourselves
to their orchards and fine hay (for our weary horses.)</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 26th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We drive the Yankees across the Potomac and shell the town
of Williamsport across the river.  We watered our horses in
the Potomac, the same we had ridden from the "Wilderness" in
May, then to Richmond, Petersburg and in the many fights all
summer.  We made no attempt to cross into Maryland but rode to
Shepherdstown about 20 miles away, where I saw some relatives
and many old friends.  Went into camp at Billmyer's Mill about
two miles from town towards Charles Town where we camped for
the night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>August 31st</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">My horse "Don" which I had ridden from May all through our
marches and fights becoming lame from a disease common in the
army called the "greasy foot" starting from the "scratches"
caused by going through so much mud and such hard service. We
lay out in a big field nearly all day grazing our horses and
taking it easy, as the enemy showed no disposition to attack
us for which we were ready. Took some flour to a Miss Dawes
who lived nearby and she baked it for me.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>September 1864
 
</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>September 2nd</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Encamped at an old Yankee CAMP near Winchester, our
regiment ordered down on the Opequon to "picket." Late in the
night we were ordered to go on a reconnoiter towards
Berryville. Saddled up and started, very dark and not knowing
when or where we would run into the enemy. We were sent down
there, about 10 miles, to find out if the enemy was there in
much strength. Well, we found them! As we rode into
Berryville, our company in advance, we ran right into a big
column of Yankees starting out on a raid. It was our Regiment
against a Division of Cavalry. We retreated in haste and our
Company being in the front in the advance down there, of
course we had to cover the retreat back towards Winchester. It
was pitch dark and as we flew up the Pike some of the boys got
outside of the road, for there were no fences along there (the
armies had burned them all up) and in the running through the
woods along the road, two boys, Newt Finley and Sam Miller ran
under an overhanging grape vine (as we learned afterwards),
which caught and dragged them off their horses and were
captured. The enemy pursued us some miles and it was a race,
sure enough. The wonder is they did not capture the whole of
our Regiment! I shall never forget that ride on that dark
night! It was to laugh after it was all over, but not when we
were riding for our lives and away from the capture or death
or both.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>September 3rd</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The enemy advance and drive our pickets in, but probable it
was only to "feel" us for they soon retired from our immediate
front.  I got permission to go into Winchester and spent the
night at a Mr. Strikers, an acquaintance of our family.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>September 15th to October 8th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I spent at home on furlough and certainly did enjoy it.
General T. L. Rosser's command came to the Valley about this
time and being an old friend of my family offered me a place
with his brigade which was very welcome to me for I did not
like my Captain, Tom McClung, a rough farmer who was
tyrannical and abusive, especially to a boy who held himself
as his superior socially. The "insolence of office" was not
all in "Hamlets Soliloquy."</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 1864
 
</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 10th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Arrived at General Rosser's headquarters, who welcomed me
heartily, near Columbia Furnace in the "Back Road" in
Shenandoah County.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 14th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Still with General Rosser.  We threw up various breastworks
on the side of the mountain near Fisher's Hill and hourly
awaited and expected a battle.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 15th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">General Rosser had me detailed to be at his head-quarters,
nominally as a "courier" but really with all the privileges of
a staff officer--riding and messing with him. It was no soft
place, however, for he was as brave as a lion and he expected
everybody around him to be in the thickest of the fight,
carrying orders to the front, and to be with him and at his
side whatever the danger and had no use for any other
kind.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 16th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Lie in camp all day. I carrying orders and dispatches from
General Rosser to the different commands. He was then in
command of Fitz Lee's whole division, as well as his own
Laurel Brigade--the 7th, 11th, 12th Regiments and Whites
Battalion of the 11th Regiment. Hugh McGuire was captain of
Company E. He married my sister,
Sallie, January 12th, 1865 and killed on Lee's retreat, dying
at Amelia Springs, Virginia. No braver trooper ever lived!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 17th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We go on a raid at night and ride all night nearly and
surround and capture a picket of Yankees--forty four in
number. Some of our boys who lived in that vicinity guided us
on bypaths until we got between the picketing battalion and
their main body. Our raid was for the purpose of learning the
location of the enemy's cavalry as to which we succeeded
fully.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 18th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We rest all day in camp but about 10:00 p. m. we saddle up
and start towards the enemy, and about 3:00 a. m. we ride into
their pickets capturing them and about daylight we gallop into
their main body's camp. Many of them were up and getting their
coffee, etc. They scampered away leaving many prisoners. We
followed and found them massed in thousands ready for us.
These were all cavalry and horse artillery on the right flank
of Sheridan's army. Soon, we heard heavy firing on our right
where the infantry were. It proved to be Gordon's Division
mainly who in the night had scaled the mountain side on
Sheridan's left flank and broken into the camp of the 8th army
Corps of Sheridan, before they were up out of bed, capturing
great numbers, all their artillery, camp, etc. The Yankees
were dumbfounded and panic stricken and fled with a "devil
take the hindmost" race. Sheridan's whole army began to
retreat in great disorder towards Winchester--about 16 miles
away. "The day was lost" as it seemed to them and to us. About
3:00 p.m. General Rosser sent me along our front to obtain
some information and to my disgust and amazement I beheld our
infantry scattered and plundering in the Yankee's recent Camps
and the Yankees rallying and about to advance, which later
they did and upon reporting this to General Rosser, he ordered
our cavalry company to fall back to the South Side of the
Creek where his horse artillery galloped and went into
position on the hills. There we awaited their attack, but they
did not attack us, though we stayed there until after dark.
From our position we could see our infantry retreating in
great disorder just as the enemy had done in the early
morning.</p><p class="p10">Briefly, the facts were these: Our men were half starved.
When they got into the Yankee's camp, and found great stores
of supplies they stopped and went to looting and plundering
despite the efforts of their officers to induce them to follow
the retreating enemy, but they moved not, except only a
few.</p><p class="p10">Sheridan was in Washington that morning and hearing his
army had been surprised and was retreating, he came on a
special train to Winchester (100) miles and about 4:30 p. m.
reformed his retreating army at Middletown or New Town and
forced them towards our army, scattered and demoralized with
plundering. As he had three or four times as many as Early,
the result was a terrible defeat for us. They captured
hundreds, recaptured all their artillery which we had captured
in the forenoon and nearly al1 of Early's artillery besides.
There is a narrow roadway on the Pike along there and a bridge
and there being a jam and stoppage of wagons and artillery
there, the capture was easily made of all our artillery
(nearly) and a big wagon train.</p><p class="p10">Early fell back to Fisher's Hill that night about 4 miles
from the early morning fighting.</p><p class="p10">About 9:00 p. m. General Rosser sent me over to General
Early's on the Pike to learn the situation and to ask for
orders. It was some miles away and about midnight I found him
and his staff asleep near the Pike on Fisher's Dill. He was
awakened and sent word to Rosser fully as to his plans.
Meanwhile, I delivered Rosser's request to General Early to
have one of Rosser's Regiments called in which was picketing
on our extreme right--on detached duty, as our cavalry's main
body was on Early's left flank. General Early said he had no
one to send and that I would have to call the Regiment in as
he would fall back at daylight. So I had to go. It was a
rather ticklish business. The Regiment was some three or four
miles away and the night very dark and I knew absolutely
nothing of the roads. I was told they were along Cedar Creek.
So off I started, riding with ears open and my pistol in my
right hand ready for trouble. Finally passing through some
very dark woods, I was challenged by a picket. Not knowing if
I had run into a Yankee or riot, I wheeled my horse around
ready to escape, if I had struck the enemy. I inquired of the
picket "what Regiment is yours?" He replied and then, knowing
who was in command of it that day, I asked him who was in
command and he answering correctly; I advanced and told him to
start out of there at once. So about daylight we reached the
Pike where we found the army had left and only a rear guard
just moving off.</p><p class="p10">Had we been a half hour later we would have been captured.
By this time, I was about "all in," and so was my horse for I
had ridden on him the night before and all day and all night
just gone, and had nothing to eat for either man or beast
except a few crackers and some oats and corn gathered from the
Yankee Camp.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Ordered to go to Staunton and have blanks printed and go to
"leave" for a few days. I rode into New Market, about 7 miles
away. Spent the night at Major Hawk's Head Quarters. He was
General Early's Chief Commissary Staff Officer. I sent my
horse back to camp.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 31st</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Left New Market on the stage. I found Fred Effinger of
Staunton top of stage and he and I enjoyed the ride. He told
me there was a girl in the stage who had run off from home
with a soldier and she had been in camp with him, of "easy
virtue" etc. They discovered her in a soldier's uniform and sent her home. In
passing an old frame house the stage came to a stop and the
driver called to a woman standing in the door and said, "Here
is your daughter!" I can even now see that awkward girl in
uniform running up the walk crying and her poor old heart
broken mother coming to meet her. Arrived in Staunton that
night.</p></p>

<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>November 26th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">March to Bowman's near Mathais, and to Moorefield, Hardy
County. Last night; we (Rosser's Head-Quarters) had supper at
a house where we had a sumptuous
meal. There were seven kinds of preserves on the table,
sausage, etc. People delighted to see and feed us. Just as we
were about to go into camp we ran into about 300 Yankees who
had come out from New Creek (Now Keyser) on the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad on a scouting
expedition. We pitched into them and routed them badly
capturing one piece of artillery and some prisoners--among
them was "Nate" Goff, of Clarksburg, who was sent to Libby
Prison in Richmond. He became famous while in prison because
when the Confederate government threatened to hang him if the
Yankees hung a certain Confederate, Goff wrote a letter saying
"Do not consider me if it is your duty to hang that
Confederate.  I am willing to be sacrificed." Goff afterwards
became U. S. District Attorney of West Virginia, then United States Judge and Secretary of War and finally United States Senator and still lives in
Clarksburg. His son Percy Married Carrie Bassel, who is an
older sister of Martha, my son Miller's wife. Goff and I often
spoke of his capture by us, and he was and is one of the
finest men I ever knew. As the purpose of the raid was to
surprise and capture New Creek and its garrison, General
Rosser knew that the Yankees whom we struck at Moorefield
would ride all night to warn the New Creek garrison, he
decided also to ride all night and get there first. So we rode
all night in the rain through the mountains, guided the short
way by some of our boys from that section. We beat them there
and about 9:00 a. m. we came in sight of their camps, one on
each side of the little narrow valley of New Creek.</p><p class="p10">Rosser sent Major Jim Sweeney of Wheeling in front with
about 20 men to rush and capture their picket in the road,
which we could see. This picket had erected as was often the
case--a rail fence across the road and they on the inside of
it, so that if surprised, the attacking party would be delayed
by taking down the fence and they could gallop back in the
meanwhile and give the alarm.</p><p class="p10">To our amazement and delight when they saw Sweeney's men
coming they thought of course it was their scouting party who
had gone to Moorefield and was returning, and they actually
took down the fence and hailed our men. It was raining and it
was a dark misty morning and when too late they discovered
their fatal mistake and every man of them was captured and
very quietly too. So the alarm was not given at all! Rosser
divided into three parts; one rushed down the valley to the R.
D. Station, one to the camp on the left hill side and the
third to the battery of artillery on the hill to the right.
Never were people more surprised, for they had no idea any
Confederates were within 100 miles of them! It was all over in
a half hour. The main objective of the raid was to get cattle
for Lee's starving army. We gathered up about 500 fine cattle,
several hundreds horses and about 700 prisoners and got away
from there that afternoon. I picked up a wonderful little mule
to send home to my little brother Hugh, who rode and kept him
at home. That night many of our prisoners escaped and of these
we cared little for we had a hard time feeding our own men and
prisoners already in our prisons south. Many years after I met
a member of the West Virginia Legislature who told me his
brother, a Yankee soldier, was captured there and another
brother was the officer in charge of the prisoners that night
and the confederate "winked at" the Yankee brother's escape
who was later killed near Richmond. We burned the depot and
many supplies and I got a Sutler's trunk and found it full of
nice clothing, notably fine woolen outside shirts, a fine pair
of trousers, which after the war I wore and called my "New
Creek Pants." Also many years after when I was a member of the
Democratic State Executive Committee in West Virginia, there
was a fellow member, Colonel Tom
Davis, a brother of Senator Henry G. Davis. He told me I must
visit him at Keyser.(formerly as stated "New Creek") I told
him I was there once and recalled our raid there and when I
told him we had burned a big white painted store, when I had
filled a bag full of plunder, he said, "Why you little rascal!
That was MY store!" He was a union man and we had a good laugh
over it. The Yankees sent a large force to intercept us from
out of Cumberland but they were too late and we got away with
all our booty. That night, we rode back to a Union man's
place--a Mr. Babb whose son Charlie, I afterwards served many
years on the Board of Regents of the West Virginia University and we often talked of that
raid.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>November 28th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Left Mr. Babb and that afternoon stopped at Petersburg and
stayed at a Mr. Cunningham's. They had several very pretty
daughters and the family gave us a glorious welcome and those
people had more to eat than we had seen anywhere during the
war, for very seldom did any soldier of any army ever go
there. The snow, a deep one, had fallen and some of us got out
an old sleigh and took the girls out riding. I often met
"Jake" Cunningham (who was the son of that family) in
Charleston as he was an official in the Legislature. He said
his family often spoke of me as the youngest and smallest one
of our party there. We and our horses were certainly in clover
there.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>November 29th</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Left Petersburg and rode over the snow covered hills to a
man named Dasher, where we had good rooms, though crowded, and
plenty to eat. Dasher had a barrel of whiskey. Everybody
nearly got "full" and there was a "pillow fight" up stairs.
Holmes Conrad and Jim Thompson were in it. They acted like so
many children all night. I shall never forget that night and
its absurd and ridiculous events.</p></p>

went sleigh riding. We took the girls out and in crossing the
little river our sleigh upset and Perkins and I got out in the
water 2 1/2 feet deep and righted the sleigh and rescued the
girls. Upon our return to the house, The Cunningham home, I
was dripping wet and half frozen and Mrs. Cunningham gave me a hot toddy. I shall
never forget it.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sunday. No preaching for us. Captain Dawson, an Englishman
who was on Rosser's Staff, had a fine voice so he and the
girls gave us some very sweet music. We certainly were in an
oasis of plenty and comfort. Dawson after the war was editor
of a newspaper in Charleston South Carolina and married there. Became famous as a writer and was
murdered by a man who was in love with Dawson's clerk, a
beautiful girl. The murderer was jealous of Dawson's influence
over the girl who he (Dawson) had
besought to throw the fellow over. But I think he was
acquitted by a jury.</p></p>

again march back to Staunton and go on out to Swoope's about 8
miles West of Staunton, having ridden about 35 miles in the
cold. We expected to go into Winter Quarters at Swoope's but
heard the Yankees were on a raid towards Charlottesville, I
started in Staunton to go to see Lou Trout but General Rosser

Charlottesville, where we heard the Yankee raiders had gone
back.  Hugh McGuire and I spent the night at "Mirador," where
Mr. James Bowen then owned and lived. His grand daughter Mary
Funsten was there, a beautiful charming girl and a sister of
the late Bishop Funsten who recently died in California. Colonel Funsten was colonel of 11th Virginia Cavalry, Rosser's Brigade, and his
son "Boz" was captain of the 11th and was there that night and
got "lit-up"--very. Mr. Bowen had lots to drink and was very
generous with it. By the way, this country place "Mirador"
later became famous as the home of Colonel C. D. Langhorne father of the
famous Langhorne girls, the "Gibson girls." Langhorne spent
much money remodeling and beautifying this country seat and
was buried there I think.</p></p>

Our people had so little to eat for man or beast most of the
cavalry were permitted to go home until called out and rest up
their horses. Each army had a picket force down the valley
below Harrisonburg to watch each other. I was glad enough to
remain at home a while. Some of our cavalry who could not get
home (inside the enemy's lines) went to Swoope's to remain
awhile. General Fitz Lee was down at Bruce's on Main Street
and the band gave him a daylight serenade. It was a sort of
"gala Day" for old Waynesboro. Lieutenant Charlie Minnegrode of Fitz
Lee's Staff was playing the devoted to Helena Withrow. He was
later in April badly wounded on Lee's retreat. General Rosser
at my mother's invitation went to Hanover and returned to our
house with his wife and baby and remained there as guests for
some time. She was Bettie Winston, of Courtland (their home)
near Hanover Courthouse and a
lovely woman. Many years after in coming out of Richmond on
the train with General Rosser and wife, a young lady got
aboard and recognizing me said, "come back and see Bettie." I
did so. When I was introduced to "Sallie," the young lady with

<p class="p11"><b>March 1st 1865</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Tonight Captain Hugh McGuire
came home about midnight and alarmed us all by the news that
the Yankees were coming up the Valley towards Staunton in
heavy force. His squadron of Cavalry had been on picket at the
bridge on the Valley Pike near Mt. Crawford, about 150 Cavalry
were all that were there between Harrisonburg and Staunton.
His squadron made the best stand they could at the bridge, but
the enemy sent a large force up the river, which they forded
and come in behind our men. It then became a race up the Pike
towards Staunton. Some of our men were captured. Captain McGuire lost his hat and rode to
Waynesboro that night hatless. His account of that race was
very amusing and thrilling too. Sheridan had started out from
Winchester with about 9,000 picked cavalry to ride to Richmond
and join Grant at Petersburg. Some of the cavalry galloped to
Fishersville in the night and gave the alarm to General Early.
The Yankees rode into Staunton that night. Early at once moved
out his infantry, about 2,200 only, from Fishersville down to
Waynesboro, they arrived there about daylight.  Early and his
staff came to my mother's for breakfast, where I saw him turn
down a tumbler half full of whiskey before breakfast. (This
was a weakness of his.) It was a rainy blue morning in every
way. My Mother sent the slaves (negroes) horses, wagons etc.,
by my brother William across the Blue Ridge for safety.
Everybody who had slaves, horses, etc., did likewise. Our
wagons came very near being captured for they had just turned
off the Main Road to Charlottesville when the enemy galloped a
thousand strong near them and rushed on after the fleeing
Confederates. So fast did these fellows ride that they got to
Greenwood Depot, ten or fifteen miles from Waynesboro, that
they fired into a train leaving there with munitions. They
killed one of our men on the train. The mud was fearful and
very amusing stories are told of that stampede of civilians,
wagons, negroes, etc., over Rockfish Gap. This was the last
fighting in the Shenandoah Valley.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The morning of this fight General Rosser with about 100
Cavalry (all he had there, for all the others were disbanded
for the winter and many at Swoope's in Winter Quarters) rode
up to within sight of Christy's Creek about 4 miles from
Staunton. There we saw a blue column of Yankees coming. Rosser
gave some orders to the officer in charge of the small cavalry
force with him and taking about a half dozen of us with him he
rode into the woods in bridle path until we reached a country
road and then rode to Greenville and Staunton Road about 10
miles away. Rosser's object was to see for himself whether the
enemy was going towards Lexington and Lynchburg or not, General Hunter had gone the year before.
We rode in the rain all day. We found no traces of the enemy
on that road. Then we rode on to the Middlebrook and Staunton
road and there found no signs of the enemy. Rosser's idea was
that the movement towards Waynesboro was a mere feint to cover
his real movement to Lexington. But he was mistaken.</p><p class="p10">About 4 p. m. General, Rosser
turned to me and said, "Clinton, (he always called me so) you
go back to Waynesboro and tell General Early that none of the enemy has
gone this way. And careful you do not run into the Yankees."
Rosser and the others remained to watch if possible the
movements of the enemy.</p><p class="p10">Off I rode in the rain not knowing where I would finally
land, in Waynesboro, in prison or in another world. As I rode
along I noticed every farm house closed. Not a soul to be
seen. The people know the Yankees were near and had run off
and hidden their horses, stock, etc., as best they could.
Occasionally I noticed some one peering around the corner of a
house or a tree watching me and no doubt they were wondering
if I were a Yankee scout. I had a black oil cloth cape on to
protect me from the rain, and of course, no one could tell
whether I was a Yankee or Confederate.</p><p class="p10">Along about evening I heard a terrible rumbling and human
voices as I neared the Staunton and Waynesboro road where the
Tinkling Spring road passes it. To my amazement, as I drew
nearer, I beheld the Yankee wagons going rapidly towards (!)
Waynesboro, about two miles away! The mud was terrible and the
wagon drivers and soldiers with them were shouting and
swearing at their horses.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rosser and all of us had heard artillery in the forenoon at
Waynesboro and he remarked, "Well, I suppose Uncle Jubal has
driven them off and they may come this way on their way to
Lexington." How mistaken he was! Early had not driven them
away. The shoe was on the other foot.</p><p class="p10">I soon got away from the road and rode through a lane to
old man Shirey's house to learn the news. It was about dusk. I
had noticed some camp fires out beyond his house in the woods.
I rode up to his gate and halloed. He came out and recognized
me and was scared to death almost. He cried out "For Heaven's
sake, get away. Don't you see those Yankees? Over there in the
woods and down there at my spring?" He then told me Early had
been routed. So I rode into a lane leading over towards South
River keeping in view for some distance those Yankees at the
Spring, who if they saw me, supposed I was one of their men. I
was trying to get across the river to the Mountain for the
night. I stopped at Jim Irvine's who then lived at the Ellis
place on the hill. It was raining and cold and he told me all
he had heard about Early's defeat and gave me some corn for my
jaded horse who had had nothing to eat all day and begged me
to remain all night if I thought it safe but I declined. They
begged me not to try to ford the river which was very high and
out of its banks. But I swam my horse, dark as it was, over
the river and soon met Phil Coiner of my old Company "E" 1st
Cavalry, and he and I rode up into the mountains and slept on
the ground all night. Old David D. Coiner joined us soon after
we laid down. He was frightened to death. All night long he
kept saying "It's a terrible time, Terrible time."</p><p class="p10">The next morning we could see from the mountain Waynesboro
and vicinity. I noticed a big fire and a column of smoke right
in a line with my mother's house, which I supposed was
burning. I afterwards found out the fire was from burning a
lot of Early's wagons on the hill in front of Shaws (now
Antrim's) house on the hill.</p><p class="p10">Phil Coiner and I decided to ride into or as near as we
could to Waynesboro. As we entered the town the last of the
Yankees were leaving en-route to Charlottesville. I went home
and got something to eat and listened to all that the Yankees
had done while there. They (Hun like) had broken into my
mother's smoke house, taken her hams, etc., broken into her
pantry on her back porch and taken almost everything they
could find. However, some edibles were saved by the following
incident. Dr. Hunter McGuire of Stonewall Jackson's old staff,
but now of General Early's staff, and chief surgeon was
captured by the enemy and asked to be paroled and allowed to
go to my mother's. Being a non-combatant, and of very high
rank he was allowed to go. He brought with him a staff officer
of Sheridan's and my mother had them a nice meal prepared.
While doing so, she came in and appealed to the Yankee Staff
Officer, Lieutenant Vail, for
protection. He at once gave her a guard and drove the thieving
rascals off.</p><p class="p10">Dr. Hunter McGuires Capture:</p><p class="p10">He told me he was trying to escape and had reached a piece
of woods, where the "Brandon" Hotel now stands in Basic, and
finding his pursuers very close behind him tried to jump his
horse over a low rail fence and get into the woods. But alas!
His horse fell with him! An officer told the fellow to put his
gun down, saying "He's MY prisoner." The Dr. told me he was a
Mason and that he made a Masonic sign and the Yankee officer
being a Mason also had saved his life. He said the enemy
treated him very nicely and paroled him. My mother and
children all hid in the cellar under our kitchen during the
fighting. Fourteen of our men surrendered on our back porch
where they had run when the stampede began. He also told me
that while he and his Yankee protector were in our sitting
room waiting for their meal, which my mother was preparing,
(for our negroes had been sent away except one woman, Mammy
Jane,) the Yankee officer noticed a Knight Templar picture on
the wall. It had my father's name on it. He inquired who this
Hugh L. Gallaher was? When told he said, of course, he would
protect his family and did. He also stopped their plundering
and burning down at the Tanyard nearby.</p><p class="p10">I think that he was a Colonel
Forsythe of Sheridan's staff. He wrote my mother after the
war, as did Lieutenant Vail.
Stonewall Jackson had captured very many prisoners in 1862 at
the battle of Port Republic about 20 miles below Waynesboro.
They were marched to Waynesboro and put in the fields above
our house. They were nearly starved. Vail wrote a note to my
mother wishing to buy something to eat. But she went with a
servant herself to see that Vail and not Confederate guards
got the basket. Of course she refused any pay for it. Hence
Vail wrote her after the war very often.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>From March 3 to April 9, 1865</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Early on March 3rd or 4th, General Rosser, as soon as he
could gather some of his men together did so and started to
intercept Sheridan, thinking he would go from Charlottesville
towards Lynchburg.  So we went up the Valley and crossed over
the mountain near Greenville, gathering up men as we could.
We went into Camp at Massie's Mills, Nelson County.</p><p class="p10">Finding the enemy was making for the James and Kanawha
Canal we rode hard to catch up with him.  But he rode hard
too, very hard.  We went to Columbia and Scottsville but were
too late.  Then it was a race to overtake them.  The roads
were so deep in mud we made but slow progress. The enemy's
horses (about 9,000) wagons had cut those clay roads up so
badly that for years afterwards the ruts and tracks could be
plainly seen. I never saw anything before or since like those
roads.  We followed them until dawn in the County of King
William.  We first got sight of them riding very rapidly on
the other side of the Pamunkey
River but then out of our reach.</p><p class="p10">Sheridan's forces then joined Grant and took an active part
later on Lee's retreat to Appomatox.</p><p class="p10">Our Command joined Lee and was with him until April 9, 1865
at the surrender.  As our cavalry were scattered all up and
down the Valley and Rosser wanted them badly he sent me to the
Valley to have their officers bring them to him, and I was so
engaged when we heard Lee had surrendered.  We did not believe
it at first but soon learned the
worst.</p></p>
