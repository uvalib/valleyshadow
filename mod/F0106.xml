                <p>I received your kind letter just as we were packing up to march to this place and
                    I could not get time to answer it you say you wrote letter before but I never
                    got it and had about concluded that you did not want to hear from me <orig
                        reg="anymore">any more</orig> but I am glad I was mistaken we are now
                    encamped in a beautiful field on the bank of the York river about two miles from
                    Yorktown. we do not expect to stay much longer for it is reported that we are
                    going to join Gen. Popes Army my health is <orig reg="very">verry</orig> good at
                    present but I have been Sun struck twice this summer and in the hospital nearly
                    half of my time since the battle of fair oaks.<pb n="2"/> I suppose you had a
                    good time at camp meeting this year. I was thinking of it nearly all the time I
                    was going on and wishing that I was there but my camp <orig reg="meeting"
                    >meetin</orig> is not blessed with the presence of any ladies I have not seen
                    any since I wrote you the last. I have almost forgot what a lady looks like for
                    it has been so long since I seen one.</p>

                <p>I have hardly time to write any today for I am on duty and <orig reg="maybe">may
                        be</orig> we will march tomorrow so I will write while I can.</p>

                <p>Give my regards to all the young folks of my acquaintance reserving the largest
                    portion yourself and believe me as ever your</p>
