                <p>The schools in my district have all continued with their usual prosperity and
                    about their usual numbers during the past month. The building in which the
                    school is held at Lexington, is retained by a very uncertain tenure. What we are
                    to do after the 20th of this month is not yet certain.</p>

                <p>The number of pupils in day school is one hundred and twenty seven, average
                    attendance at night school ninety seven.</p>

                <p>The schools at Staunton all <unclear>function</unclear> prosperous, some that the
                    attendance at evening school has not been as large as usual, the number of
                    colored pupils at the day school has been one hundred and eighty four, number of
                    white forty nine, average attendance at the evening school forty nine.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>The numbers of pupils at Harrisonburg is not as large as I anticipated before
                    starting the school, but I regard it as one of the most encouraging fields of
                    labor in my district.</p>

                <p>The white people of Harrisonburg <unclear>manifest</unclear> a better spirit than
                    in any other part of the Valley. The number of pupils in the day school is
                    seventy two, average in evening school sixty three.</p>

                <p>Front Royal has forty one in day school and average thrity six in the evening.
                    Martinsburg &amp; Shepherdstown remain about the same as last month. Harpers
                    Ferry has lost a little. Many of the colored people are moving away. We have
                    withdrawn one teacher from Martinsburg, and one from Harpers Ferry and sent them
                    to Charlestown since the Holidays. We intend to open a school at Woodstock as
                    soon as a room can be furnished. We would also open schools at Waynesboro and
                    Brownsburg if we had suitable rooms for them.</p>
