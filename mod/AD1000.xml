</head>

<p>DeWitt Clinton Gallaher was born in Jefferson County,
Virginia (later West Virginia), on August 2, 1845.  As a
youth, he moved with his family to Waynesboro, Virginia, and
later attended school at Hampden-Sidney College, Washington
College (now Washington and Lee), Munich University, Germany,
and the University of Virginia.   After the war, Gallaher
moved to Charleston, West Virginia, to practice law.  He died
in 1926.  This diary describes his service in the 1st Virginia
Cavalry and includes details about his work as a provost guard
and about his relationship with fellow officers and
soldiers.</p>

 <!-- <ref>Battle Description, Camp Life, Enlistment, Military
Authority</ref> -->

<p>I accepted a position on General John D. Imboden's staff
with the rank of Captain, as aide-de-camp, while his command
was operating in the Shenandoah Valley. Though he was very
kind to me and I was "messed" with him and his staff and we
had orderlies and colored servants and everything to make a
soldier's life comparatively pleasant, I very foolishly (I now
think) became afraid the war would end without my being in
some big battle. So I, in October, 1863, resigned all the
comforts of a staff officer and joined as a private in <abbr
expan="Company">Co</abbr> E, 1st Virginia Cavalry, then down
with General <abbr expan="Robert E.">R. E.</abbr> Lee's army
on the Rapidan River, <orig reg="Culpeper">Culpepper</orig>
County, Virginia. While with Imboden, we made one or two raids
into Hardy County, now West Virginia, and had some sharp
fighting; but I longed to be "with Lee" all the time.</p>

<milestone unit="section" n="The Battle of the Wilderness"/>

<p>General Grant crossed the Rappahannock and the Rapidan
rivers May 2nd, 1864, and from that hour until the 12th of
May, the battle--the greatest of the war in duration and
losses--raged fiercely. Our Cavalry Command went after
Sheridan's Yankee Cavalry raiders who were making for
Richmond. General J. E. B. Stuart was killed at "Yellow
Tavern," about 15 from Richmond and Sheridan went back and
joined Grant, who was still pressing Lee with about four times
as big an army as Lee's. Captain Hugh McGuire, my brother in
law, was wounded May 5th, at the "Wilderness" and afterwards
mortally wounded on Lee's Retreat, April 6th, 1865. Early in
June (1864) Sheridan, with a very heavy force of Cavalry and
Horse Artillery with all men mounted started out again to get
to Richmond and capture it and liberate the Yankee prisoners
there while Grant was holding Lee from protecting
Richmond.</p>

<p>March in the night and long after daylight to near Charles

</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-06-24" id="d16">
<head>June 24</head>
<p>Fight--a sharp one, with Gregg's Cavalry near Charles City
<abbr expan="Courthouse.">C. H.</abbr> Our Regiment was
dismounted and we were sent in on foot. In determining who
were to dismount, the Company was lined up and counted by
fours, that is; every fourth man was to hold the horses of
<abbr expan="numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1, 2, 3, and his own of
course, and take and keep them in there rear, as far as
practicable out of danger, and to bring them up, if a retreat
were ordered or in any other emergency, when there was a
terrible scramble to mount and get away. It fell to me to
dismount and go in that day. I shall never forget that day or
the next! </p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-06-25" id="d17">
<head>June 25th</head>
<p>It was very warm, burning hot, and just before the charge
was ordered we were in the edge of some woods and under fire
of artillery and small arms, a piece of shell--called shrapnel
now--struck my left boot and as I nearly fell some of the boys
(Jim Kerr and Phil Coiner) wanted to carry me off, supposing
my leg was broken. When ordered to advance and charge the
enemy there, we crossing an open field running as fast as we
could, the Yankees began to "Skedaddle" and flee! I got close
up to a General, or a bunch of officers, trying to rally their
fleeing men and took deliberate aim at him and can never
understand why he did not fall as he galloped away. He may
have only been wounded. We followed them on foot for three or
four miles in a blazing sun. I was never so tired in my life
carrying my carbine pistol and ammunition, but the excitement
kept me up. We drove them until it was too dark to follow.
They ran clean away into the night. Oh How glad I was to again
mount my faithful horse and go into camp for the night!</p>
</div3>

<milestone unit="section" n="A Presentiment"/>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-06-26" id="d18">
<head>June 26th</head>
<p>I was so stiff and sore from that running fight yesterday I
could hardly saddle my horse and mount him. Expecting an
attack, for Grant was still pressing Lee, we were again
ordered to go in dismounted and await the attack. It again
fell to my lot to dismount!</p>

<p>As Lee was falling back, I well knew that if in the fight
our Regiment was ordered to retreat, I could not run--was too
sore and stiff from the previous day's exertions. I know if we
retreated I was sure to be either captured or killed. I could
not run back to our "Led Horses." So I took off my jacket,
fastened it to my saddle and took off a gold ring my mother
had given me and told the boy holding my horse that I did not
expect to be back again and to give or send the ring to my
mother for me, and told him to send my horse home and that he
could have my other things. </p>

<p>Well, down into the woods we went, ready for a fight and
expected attack, but after lying there several hours we were
recalled and again mounted our horses. The Yankees had gone in
another direction, so we marched after them towards the famous
"Malvern Hill" the scene of a bloody battle the year before on
McClellan's retreat, where driven by Lee, he (<abbr
expan="McClellan">McC</abbr>) sought the protection of his
gunboats on the James River. So much of my foreboding of
prison or worse! </p>

<p>We cross on a pontoon bridge James River near Drury's
Bluff, as Grant changed his attack on Richmond by placing his
army on the south side of the river, near Petersburg, and most
of our army followed to that side.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-06-27" id="d19">
<head>June 27th</head>
<p>We lie in the woods all day, the first real rest for about
50 days. The last three days were terrible--very hot and the
dust inconceivably thick, and men suffering.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-06-28" id="d20">
<head>June 28th</head>
<p>Moved camp to within about 6 miles of Petersburg

<p>Pass through Petersburg and fight--and whip General
Wilson's Yankee Cavalry, capturing 13 peices of artillery, all

picked up and harbored.</p>

<p>In camp in woods near Petersburg. Very hot. But little to
eat for man or horse. Feed so scarce we waded a swamp near by
and cut grass for our poor horses. They even barked pine trees
so famished were they. Our fare was "hard (very hard) tack"--
crackers which we cooked in grease from fat pork. I went into
<orig reg="Petersburg">Petersburgh</orig> one day and found
1/4 lb. of pepper! Quite a find. It cost me $2.50 for the
1/4lb., but it was worth it. We used it to "season the hard
tack and grease. With the pepper, it gave some tang to it and
of course, pep too.</p>

<p>"Boots and Saddles" was blown by the bugler at 10:11 p.m.
and we hurriedly moved out of camp and through Petersburg in
the night and crossed James River on Pontoon bridges back
again to the north side, and in the sultry heat and fearful
dust of <orig reg="thousands">thousand</orig> of horses, we
went into Camp about 6 miles below Richmond and remained there
that night. (29th)</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-07-30" id="d30">
<head>July 30th</head>
<p>March down the Charles City Road a couple of miles. Halt in
the hot sun a long time. I buy a real loaf of bread and prize
it highly, for I was really sick today. Went back to our
artillery Camp for the night.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-07-31" id="d31">
<head>July 31st</head>
<p>Some of us were sent to Chaffin's Bluff overlooking James
River to stop all cavalry men from going into Richmond--
Stragglers etc. I found I was near a man named Hoppe, who knew
my family. I called at his house and they gave me something to
eat. We were called off our post about sundown and again
crossed the James River on a pontoon bridge (there were three
of them) to the South side--so we had crossed all three
pontoons--marched until after midnight and went into camp and
slept like a rock.</p>

quote from my then taken notes--"How differently spent from my
usual way of doing so! Nobody to bestow upon me their smiles
and gifts." I was put on guard that night over some Yankees
and vagabonds--stood two hours as guard in the night thinking
of the dear home in the Valley. Dave Drake came in from his

in Waynesboro. She begged me to accompany her to her home,
corner of 1st and Franklin and get something to eat. I was
terribly dusty from marching in such clouds of dust as a
Brigade of horses can and did raise. Tried to beg off, though
terribly hungry, but she insisting, I yielded. The streets
were full of Church goers at the time. I tied my horse in

china! I was so fussed and felt so awkward, I really could eat
but little. So I told Laura I "had a sick comrade" and if she
would fix up a lunch I would take it to him. She readily did
so. Bidding her goodbye, I rode away to overtake my command.
Needless to say, that soon after leaving, I threw my reins on
the neck of my horse and the "sick comrade" ate and enjoyed
that lunch. I ate every crumb of it. I overtook my command at
the Yellow Tavern (where our old Commander General J. E. B.
Stuart was killed in the May previous) Go into camp for the

<p>As we were marching along in lower Orange or Louisa County,
I heard a wonderful cheering of our men. The cause was that
most of our Regiment and Brigade were from the section where
the mountains were and the boys had been down in the God
forsaken "lowlands" and were so sick of them that when they
first caught sight of the Blue Ridge, their hearts were
thrilled and a joyous shout and cheer went up. It reminded one
of the "Retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks" who cried with joy
"Thalatta! "Thalatta!" (The Sea! The Sea!) When they got so
near home! (See Zenophon's Anabasis for this.)</p>

Enjoyed it. Hear the Yankee Cavalry are in the neighborhood.
We had expected this. General Jubal T. Early, then in command
of the Valley, had but few cavalry and had appealed to General
Lee to send him some, as Sheridan's Cavalry had been running
over the few cavalry that Early had. Hence Fitz Lee's old
Brigade (ours) was sent to him.</p>

<p>On the March I went to a man's house named Knode, who was a
friend of my mother's family. Got a "snack" there. In camp at
a Church in Lee Town (Jefferson County). Rains very hard. In
the suburbs of Lee Town, Dr. Gregg Gibson, a cousin of Amelia,
my brother William's wife, lived in the old Tucker home. A
beautiful old colonial house, with a grove of "ancestral"
trees around it, and with an immense garden with a vine clad
brick high wall all around it, radiant with flowers and
beautiful <orig reg="shrubbery">shrubery</orig>. Here, my
sister in law, just married in that house was staying. Her old
home was in the Vicinity and William had taken advantage of
our troops being in possession there temporarily and had gone
down and married Amelia. I called to see her. You can imagine
the pleasure and surprise that visit was! I got off for a
visit to Mr. Abel's that night and slept in a <hi

<p>Encamped at an old Yankee CAMP near Winchester, our
regiment ordered down on the Opequon to "picket." Late in the
night we were ordered to go on a reconnoiter towards
Berryville. Saddled up and started, very dark and not knowing
when or where we would run into the enemy. We were sent down
there, about 10 miles, to find out if the enemy was there in
much strength. Well, we found them! As we rode into
Berryville, our company in advance, we ran right into a big
column of Yankees starting out on a raid. It was our Regiment
against a Division of Cavalry. We retreated in haste and our
Company being in the front in the advance down there, of
course we had to cover the retreat back towards Winchester. It
was pitch dark and as we flew up the Pike some of the boys got
outside of the road, for there were no fences along there (the
armies had burned them all up) and in the running through the
woods along the road, two boys, Newt Finley and Sam Miller ran
under an overhanging grape vine (as we learned afterwards),
which caught and dragged them off their horses and were
captured. The enemy pursued us some miles and it was a race,
sure enough. The wonder is they did not capture the whole of
our Regiment! I shall never forget that ride on that dark
night! It was to laugh after it was all over, but not when we
were riding for our lives and away from the capture or death
or both.</p>

<p>I spent at home on furlough and certainly did enjoy it.
General T. L. Rosser's command came to the Valley about this
time and being an old friend of my family offered me a place
with his brigade which was very welcome to me for I did not
like my Captain, Tom McClung, a rough farmer who was
tyrannical and abusive, especially to a boy who held himself
as his superior socially. The "insolence of office" was not

side whatever the danger and had no use for any other

<head>October 17th</head>
<p>We go on a raid at night and ride all night nearly and
surround and capture a picket of Yankees--forty four in
number. Some of our boys who lived in that vicinity guided us
on bypaths until we got between the picketing battalion and
their main body. Our raid was for the purpose of learning the
location of the enemy's cavalry as to which we succeeded
fully.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-10-18" id="d60">
<head>October 18th</head>
<p>We rest all day in camp but about 10:00 p. m. we saddle up
and start towards the enemy, and about 3:00 a. m. we ride into
their pickets capturing them and about daylight we gallop into
their main body's camp. Many of them were up and getting their
coffee, etc. They scampered away leaving many prisoners. We
followed and found them massed in thousands ready for us.
These were all cavalry and horse artillery on the right flank
of Sheridan's army. Soon, we heard heavy firing on our right
where the infantry were. It proved to be Gordon's Division
mainly who in the night had scaled the mountain side on
Sheridan's left flank and broken into the camp of the 8th army
Corps of Sheridan, before they were up out of bed, capturing
great numbers, all their artillery, camp, etc. The Yankees
were dumbfounded and panic stricken and fled with a "devil
take the hindmost" race. Sheridan's whole army began to
retreat in great disorder towards Winchester--about 16 miles
away. "The day was lost" as it seemed to them and to us. About
3:00 p.m. General Rosser sent me along our front to obtain
some information and to my disgust and amazement I beheld our
infantry scattered and plundering in the Yankee's recent Camps
and the Yankees rallying and about to advance, which later
they did and upon reporting this to General Rosser, he ordered
our cavalry company to fall back to the South Side of the
Creek where his horse artillery galloped and went into
position on the hills. There we awaited their attack, but they
did not attack us, though we stayed there until after dark.
From our position we could see our infantry retreating in
great disorder just as the enemy had done in the early
morning.</p>

<p>Briefly, the facts were these: Our men were half starved.
When they got into the Yankee's camp, and found great stores
of supplies they stopped and went to looting and plundering
despite the efforts of their officers to induce them to follow
the retreating enemy, but they moved not, except only a
few.</p>

<p>Sheridan was in Washington that morning and hearing his
army had been surprised and was retreating, he came on a
special train to Winchester (100) miles and about 4:30 p. m.
reformed his retreating army at Middletown or New Town and
forced them towards our army, scattered and demoralized with
plundering. As he had three or four times as many as Early,
the result was a terrible defeat for us. They captured
hundreds, recaptured all their artillery which we had captured
in the forenoon and nearly al1 of Early's artillery besides.
There is a narrow roadway on the Pike along there and a bridge
and there being a jam and stoppage of wagons and artillery
there, the capture was easily made of all our artillery
(nearly) and a big wagon train.</p>

<p>Early fell back to Fisher's Hill that night about 4 miles
from the early morning fighting.</p>

<p>About 9:00 p. m. General Rosser sent me over to General
Early's on the Pike to learn the situation and to ask for
orders. It was some miles away and about midnight I found him
and his staff asleep near the Pike on Fisher's Dill. He was
awakened and sent word to Rosser fully as to his plans.
Meanwhile, I delivered Rosser's request to General Early to
have one of Rosser's Regiments called in which was picketing
on our extreme right--on detached duty, as our cavalry's main
body was on Early's left flank. General Early said he had no
one to send and that I would have to call the Regiment in as
he would fall back at daylight. So I had to go. It was a
rather ticklish business. The Regiment was some three or four
miles away and the night very dark and I knew absolutely
nothing of the roads. I was told they were along Cedar Creek.
So off I started, riding with ears open and my pistol in my
right hand ready for trouble. Finally passing through some
very dark woods, I was challenged by a picket. Not knowing if
I had run into a Yankee or riot, I wheeled my horse around
ready to escape, if I had struck the enemy. I inquired of the
picket "what Regiment is yours?" He replied and then, knowing
who was in command of it that day, I asked him who was in
command and he answering correctly; I advanced and told him to
start out of there at once. So about daylight we reached the
Pike where we found the army had left and only a rear guard
just moving off.</p>

<p>Had we been a half hour later we would have been captured.
By this time, I was about "all in," and so was my horse for I
had ridden on him the night before and all day and all night
just gone, and had nothing to eat for either man or beast
except a few crackers and some oats and corn gathered from the
Yankee Camp.</p>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-10-20" id="d61">

<p>Ordered to go to Staunton and have blanks printed and go to

away. Spent the night at Major Hawk's Head Quarters. He was
General Early's Chief Commissary Staff Officer. I sent my
horse back to camp.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="entry" n="1864-10-31" id="d63">

<p>Left New Market on the stage. I found Fred Effinger of
Staunton top of stage and he and I enjoyed the ride. He told
me there was a girl in the stage who had run off from home
with a soldier and she had been in camp with him, of "easy
virtue" etc. They discovered her in a <orig
reg="soldier's">soldiers</orig> uniform and sent her home. In
passing an old frame house the stage came to a stop and the
driver called to a woman standing in the door and said, "Here
is your daughter!" I can even now see that awkward girl in
uniform running up the walk crying and her poor old heart
broken mother coming to meet her. Arrived in Staunton that
night.</p>

<p>March to Bowman's near Mathais, and to Moorefield, Hardy
County. Last night; we (Rosser's Head-Quarters) had supper at
a house where we had a <orig reg="sumptuous">sumptious</orig>
meal. There were seven kinds of preserves on the table,
sausage, etc. People delighted to see and feed us. Just as we
were about to go into camp we ran into about 300 Yankees who
had come out from New Creek (Now Keyser) on the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R.</abbr> on a scouting
expedition. We pitched into them and routed them badly
capturing one piece of artillery and some prisoners--among
them was "Nate" Goff, of Clarksburg, who was sent to Libby
Prison in Richmond. He became famous while in prison because
when the Confederate government threatened to hang him if the
Yankees hung a certain Confederate, Goff wrote a letter saying
"Do not consider me if it is your duty to hang that
Confederate.  I am willing to be sacrificed." Goff afterwards
became U. S. District Attorney of West Virginia, then <abbr
expan="United States">U. S.</abbr> Judge and <abbr
expan="Secretary">Secry.</abbr> of War and finally <abbr
expan="United States">U. S.</abbr> Senator and still lives in
Clarksburg. His son Percy Married Carrie Bassel, who is an
older sister of Martha, my son Miller's wife. Goff and I often
spoke of his capture by us, and he was and is one of the
finest men I ever knew. As the purpose of the raid was to
surprise and capture New Creek and its garrison, General
Rosser knew that the Yankees whom we struck at Moorefield
would ride all night to warn the New Creek garrison, he
decided also to ride all night and get there first. So we rode
all night in the rain through the mountains, guided the short
way by some of our boys from that section. We beat them there
and about 9:00 a. m. we came in sight of their camps, one on
each side of the little narrow valley of New Creek.</p>

<p>Rosser sent Major Jim Sweeney of Wheeling in front with
about 20 men to rush and capture their picket in the road,
which we could see. This picket had erected as was often the
case--a rail fence across the road and they on the inside of
it, so that if surprised, the attacking party would be delayed
by taking down the fence and they could gallop back in the
meanwhile and give the alarm.</p>

<p>To our amazement and delight when they saw Sweeney's men
coming they thought of course it was their scouting party who
had gone to Moorefield and was returning, and they actually
took down the fence and hailed our men. It was raining and it
was a dark misty morning and when too late they discovered
their fatal mistake and every man of them was captured and
very quietly too. So the alarm was not given at all! Rosser
divided into three parts; one rushed down the valley to the R.
D. Station, one to the camp on the left hill side and the
third to the battery of artillery on the hill to the right.
Never were people more surprised, for they had no idea any
Confederates were within 100 miles of them! It was all over in
a half hour. The main objective of the raid was to get cattle
for Lee's starving army. We gathered up about 500 fine cattle,
several hundreds horses and about 700 prisoners and got away
from there that afternoon. I picked up a wonderful little mule
to send home to my little brother Hugh, who rode and kept him
at home. That night many of our prisoners escaped and of these
we cared little for we had a hard time feeding our own men and
prisoners already in our prisons south. Many years after I met
a member of the West Virginia Legislature who told me his
brother, a Yankee soldier, was captured there and another
brother was the officer in charge of the prisoners that night
and the confederate "winked at" the Yankee brother's escape
who was later killed near Richmond. We burned the depot and
many supplies and I got a Sutler's trunk and found it full of
nice clothing, notably fine woolen outside shirts, a fine pair
of trousers, which after the war I wore and called my "New
Creek Pants." Also many years after when I was a member of the
Democratic State Executive Committee in West Virginia, there
was a fellow member, <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Tom
Davis, a brother of Senator Henry G. Davis. He told me I must
visit him at Keyser.(formerly as stated "New Creek") I told
him I was there once and recalled our raid there and when I
told him we had burned a big white painted store, when I had
filled a bag full of plunder, he said, "Why you little rascal!
That was MY store!" He was a union man and we had a good laugh
over it. The Yankees sent a large force to intercept us from
out of Cumberland but they were too late and we got away with
all our booty. That night, we rode back to a Union man's
place--a Mr. Babb whose son Charlie, I afterwards served many
years on the Board of Regents of the <abbr expan="West
Virginia">W. Va.</abbr> University and we often talked of that
raid.</p>

<p>Left Mr. Babb and that afternoon stopped at Petersburg and
stayed at a Mr. Cunningham's. They had several very pretty
daughters and the family gave us a glorious welcome and those
people had more to eat than we had seen anywhere during the
war, for very seldom did any soldier of any army ever go
there. The snow, a deep one, had fallen and some of us got out
an old sleigh and took the girls out riding. I often met
"Jake" Cunningham (who was the son of that family) in
Charleston as he was an official in the Legislature. He said
his family often spoke of me as the youngest and smallest one
of our party there. We and our horses were certainly in clover
there.</p>

<p>Left Petersburg and rode over the snow covered hills to a

plenty to eat. Dasher had a barrel of whiskey. Everybody
nearly got "full" and there was a "pillow fight" up stairs.
Holmes Conrad and Jim Thompson were in it. They acted like so
many children all night. I shall never forget that night and
its absurd and ridiculous events.</p>

<p>Learning that the Yankees have gone back down the Valley we
again march back to Staunton and go on out to Swoope's about 8
miles West of Staunton, having ridden about 35 miles in the
cold. We expected to go into Winter Quarters at Swoope's but
heard the Yankees were on a raid towards Charlottesville, I
started in Staunton to go to see Lou Trout but General Rosser
sent for me. We were going to attend a so called "Musical

back.  Hugh McGuire and I spent the night at "Mirador," where
Mr. James Bowen then owned and lived. His grand daughter Mary
Funsten was there, a beautiful charming girl and a sister of
the late Bishop Funsten who recently died in California. <abbr

son "Boz" was captain of the 11th and was there that night and
got "lit-up"--very. Mr. Bowen had lots to drink and was very
generous with it. By the way, this country place "Mirador"
later became famous as the home of <abbr

famous Langhorne girls, the "Gibson girls." Langhorne spent
much money remodeling and beautifying this country seat and
was buried there I think.</p>

<p>The enemy and our troops in the Valley were practically
going into Winter Quarters. The weather being fearfully cold.
Our people had so little to eat for man or beast most of the
cavalry were permitted to go home until called out and rest up
their horses. Each army had a picket force down the valley
below Harrisonburg to watch each other. I was glad enough to
remain at home a while. Some of our cavalry who could not get
home (inside the enemy's lines) went to Swoope's to remain
awhile. General Fitz Lee was down at Bruce's on Main Street
and the band gave him a daylight serenade. It was a sort of
"gala Day" for old Waynesboro. <abbr

Lee's Staff was playing the devoted to Helena Withrow. He was
later in April badly wounded on Lee's retreat. General Rosser

some time. She was Bettie Winston, of Courtland (their home)

lovely woman. Many years after in coming out of Richmond on
the train with General Rosser and wife, a young lady got
aboard and recognizing me said, "come back and see Bettie." I
did so. When I was introduced to "Sallie," the young lady with

<p>The winter of 1864-5 was fearfully cold and "The dark
foreboding days of the Confederacy" in very truth. Lee's army
was practically starving down at Petersburg. All our sea ports
were blockaded--no supplies of any kind could reach us. Many
saw that the end was near but still had stout hearts, "Hoping
against hope." In the valley there were but few Confederate
troops left. General Early had been compelled to send every
man he could spare to Lee. So he had left only Wharton's
Division of Infantry and one of Rosser's Brigade remaining.
The infantry were in Winter Quarters at McLures, near
Fishersville and the Cavalry scattered at their homes and a
few at Swoope's and picket was kept up and down about
Harrisonburg. The enemy was also in Winter Quarters and they
too had a picket force near and below Harrisonburg. All
operations by either side were stopped until the weather
permitted the campaign to open in the early spring. Everything
was comparatively quiet in the Valley, except little dashes of
the picket force. We were all expecting now to be called out
at any day. This was the situation until:</p>

<head>March 1st 1865</head>
<p>Tonight <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Hugh McGuire
came home about midnight and alarmed us all by the news that
the Yankees were coming up the Valley towards Staunton in
heavy force. His squadron of Cavalry had been on picket at the
bridge on the Valley Pike near Mt. Crawford, about 150 Cavalry
were all that were there between Harrisonburg and Staunton.
His squadron made the best stand they could at the bridge, but
the enemy sent a large force up the river, which they forded
and come in behind our men. It then became a race up the Pike
towards Staunton. Some of our men were captured. <abbr
expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> McGuire lost his hat and rode to
Waynesboro that night hatless. His account of that race was
very amusing and thrilling too. Sheridan had started out from
Winchester with about 9,000 picked cavalry to ride to Richmond
and join Grant at Petersburg. Some of the cavalry galloped to
Fishersville in the night and gave the alarm to General Early.
The Yankees rode into Staunton that night. Early at once moved
out his infantry, about 2,200 only, from Fishersville down to
Waynesboro, they arrived there about daylight.  Early and his
staff came to my mother's for breakfast, where I saw him turn
down a tumbler half full of whiskey before breakfast. (This
was a weakness of his.) It was a rainy blue morning in every
way. My Mother sent the slaves (negroes) horses, wagons etc.,
by my brother William across the Blue Ridge for safety.
Everybody who had slaves, horses, etc., did likewise. Our
wagons came very near being captured for they had just turned
off the Main Road to Charlottesville when the enemy galloped a
thousand strong near them and rushed on after the fleeing
Confederates. So fast did these fellows ride that they got to
Greenwood Depot, ten or fifteen miles from Waynesboro, that
they fired into a train leaving there with munitions. They
killed one of our men on the train. The mud was fearful and
very amusing stories are told of that stampede of civilians,
wagons, negroes, etc., over Rockfish Gap. This was the last
fighting in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
</div3>

<div3 type="note" n="nd" id="d107">
<head>Note</head>

<p>The morning of this fight General Rosser with about 100
Cavalry (all he had there, for all the others were disbanded
for the winter and many at Swoope's in Winter Quarters) rode
up to within sight of Christy's Creek about 4 miles from
Staunton. There we saw a blue column of Yankees coming. Rosser
gave some orders to the officer in charge of the small cavalry
force with him and taking about a half dozen of us with him he
rode into the woods in bridle path until we reached a country
road and then rode to Greenville and Staunton Road about 10
miles away. Rosser's object was to see for himself whether the
enemy was going towards Lexington and Lynchburg or not, <abbr
expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Hunter had gone the year before.
We rode in the rain all day. We found no traces of the enemy
on that road. Then we rode on to the Middlebrook and Staunton
road and there found no signs of the enemy. Rosser's idea was
that the movement towards Waynesboro was a mere feint to cover
his real movement to Lexington. But he was mistaken.</p>

<p>About 4 p. m. <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr>, Rosser
turned to me and said, "Clinton, (he always called me so) you
go back to Waynesboro and tell <abbr
expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Early that none of the enemy has
gone this way. And careful you do not run into the Yankees."
Rosser and the others remained to watch if possible the
movements of the enemy.</p>

<p>Off I rode in the rain not knowing where I would finally
land, in Waynesboro, in prison or in another world. As I rode
along I noticed every farm house closed. Not a soul to be
seen. The people know the Yankees were near and had run off
and hidden their horses, stock, etc., as best they could.
Occasionally I noticed some one peering around the corner of a
house or a tree watching me and no doubt they were wondering
if I were a Yankee scout. I had a black oil cloth cape on to
protect me from the rain, and of course, no one could tell
whether I was a Yankee or Confederate.</p>

<p>Along about evening I heard a terrible rumbling and human
voices as I neared the Staunton and Waynesboro road where the
Tinkling Spring road passes it. To my amazement, as I drew
nearer, I beheld the Yankee wagons going rapidly towards (!)
Waynesboro, about two miles away! The mud was terrible and the
wagon drivers and soldiers with them were shouting and
swearing at their horses.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="note" n="nd" id="d108">
<head>Note</head>

<p>Rosser and all of us had heard artillery in the forenoon at
Waynesboro and he remarked, "Well, I suppose Uncle Jubal has
driven them off and they may come this way on their way to
Lexington." How mistaken he was! Early had not driven them
away. The shoe was on the other foot.</p>

<p>I soon got away from the road and rode through a lane to
old man Shirey's house to learn the news. It was about dusk. I
had noticed some camp fires out beyond his house in the woods.
I rode up to his gate and halloed. He came out and recognized
me and was scared to death almost. He cried out "For Heaven's
sake, get away. Don't you see those Yankees? Over there in the
woods and down there at my spring?" He then told me Early had
been routed. So I rode into a lane leading over towards South
River keeping in view for some distance those Yankees at the
Spring, who if they saw me, supposed I was one of their men. I
was trying to get across the river to the Mountain for the
night. I stopped at Jim Irvine's who then lived at the Ellis
place on the hill. It was raining and cold and he told me all
he had heard about Early's defeat and gave me some corn for my
jaded horse who had had nothing to eat all day and begged me
to remain all night if I thought it safe but I declined. They
begged me not to try to ford the river which was very high and
out of its banks. But I swam my horse, dark as it was, over
the river and soon met Phil Coiner of my old Company "E" 1st
Cavalry, and he and I rode up into the mountains and slept on
the ground all night. Old David D. Coiner joined us soon after
we laid down. He was frightened to death. All night long he
kept saying "It's a terrible time, Terrible time."</p>

<p>The next morning we could see from the mountain Waynesboro
and vicinity. I noticed a big fire and a column of smoke right
in a line with my mother's house, which I supposed was
burning. I afterwards found out the fire was from burning a
lot of Early's wagons on the hill in front of Shaws (now
Antrim's) house on the hill.</p>

<p>Phil Coiner and I decided to ride into or as near as we
could to Waynesboro. As we entered the town the last of the
Yankees were leaving en-route to Charlottesville. I went home
and got something to eat and listened to all that the Yankees
had done while there. They (Hun like) had broken into my
mother's smoke house, taken her hams, etc., broken into her
pantry on her back porch and taken almost everything they
could find. However, some edibles were saved by the following
incident. Dr. Hunter McGuire of Stonewall Jackson's old staff,
but now of General Early's staff, and chief surgeon was
captured by the enemy and asked to be paroled and allowed to
go to my mother's. Being a non-combatant, and of very high
rank he was allowed to go. He brought with him a staff officer
of Sheridan's and my mother had them a nice meal prepared.
While doing so, she came in and appealed to the Yankee Staff
Officer, <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Vail, for
protection. He at once gave her a guard and drove the thieving
rascals off.</p>

<p>Dr. Hunter McGuires Capture:</p>

<p>He told me he was trying to escape and had reached a piece
of woods, where the "Brandon" Hotel now stands in Basic, and
finding his pursuers very close behind him tried to jump his
horse over a low rail fence and get into the woods. But alas!
His horse fell with him! An officer told the fellow to put his
gun down, saying "He's MY prisoner." The Dr. told me he was a
Mason and that he made a Masonic sign and the Yankee officer
being a Mason also had saved his life. He said the enemy
treated him very nicely and paroled him. My mother and
children all hid in the cellar under our kitchen during the
fighting. Fourteen of our men surrendered on our back porch
where they had run when the stampede began. He also told me
that while he and his Yankee protector were in our sitting
room waiting for their meal, which my mother was preparing,
(for our negroes had been sent away except one woman, Mammy
Jane,) the Yankee officer noticed a Knight Templar picture on
the wall. It had my father's name on it. He inquired who this
Hugh L. Gallaher was? When told he said, of course, he would
protect his family and did. He also stopped their plundering
and burning down at the Tanyard nearby.</p>

<p>I think that he was a <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
Forsythe of Sheridan's staff. He wrote my mother after the
war, as did <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Vail.
Stonewall Jackson had captured very many prisoners in 1862 at
the battle of Port Republic about 20 miles below Waynesboro.
They were marched to Waynesboro and put in the fields above
our house. They were nearly starved. Vail wrote a note to my
mother wishing to buy something to eat. But she went with a
servant herself to see that Vail and not Confederate guards
got the basket. Of course she refused any pay for it. Hence
Vail wrote her after the war very often.</p>

<head>From <dateRange from="1865-03-03" to="1865-04-09">March 3 to April 9, 1865</dateRange></head>
<p>Early on March 3rd or 4th, General Rosser, as soon as he
could gather some of his men together did so and started to
intercept Sheridan, thinking he would go from Charlottesville
towards Lynchburg.  So we went up the Valley and crossed over
the mountain near Greenville, gathering up men as we could.
We went into Camp at Massie's Mills, Nelson County.</p>
<p>Finding the enemy was making for the James and Kanawha
Canal we rode hard to catch up with him.  But he rode hard
too, very hard.  We went to Columbia and Scottsville but were
too late.  Then it was a race to overtake them.  The roads
were so deep in mud we made but slow progress. The enemy's
horses (about 9,000) wagons had cut those clay roads up so
badly that for years afterwards the ruts and tracks could be
plainly seen. I never saw anything before or since like those
roads.  We followed them until dawn in the County of King
William.  We first got sight of them riding very rapidly on
the other side of the <orig reg="Pamunkey">Pamunky</orig>
River but then out of our reach.</p>
<p>Sheridan's forces then joined Grant and took an active part
later on Lee's retreat to Appomatox.</p>
<p>Our Command joined Lee and was with him until April 9, 1865
at the surrender.  As our cavalry were scattered all up and
down the Valley and Rosser wanted them badly he sent me to the
Valley to have their officers bring them to him, and I was so
engaged when we heard Lee had surrendered.  We did not believe
it <orig reg="at">as</orig> first but soon learned the
worst.</p>

feet underground, and wrapped up in his blanket (under which
he and I had often slept) We soon had his body dug up and put
in a box which his brother Charlie had sent down there, and he
(Baldwin) now sleeps in a Staunton Cemetery. His brother was a

were almost of the exact age and playmates in childhood. As I

<head>My Horse Don</head>
<!-- <ref></ref> -->
<p>Think of it! I rode my faithful horse Don from Waynesboro
in the Spring of 1864 to the Lee's Army there in the Rapidan
below Orange <abbr expan="Courthouse">C. H.</abbr> at
Summerville Ford, there through the terrible Wilderness
Campaign where fighting was every day and there to the
Chickahominy River, and back and forth during <orig
reg="Grant's">Grants</orig> advance on Richmond, lasting
thirty or more days, to Richmond and across the James River to
Drewry's Bluff and to below Petersburg where we had scarcely
anything for our horses. Indeed we waded into some swamps and
had to cut the swamp grass and carried it to our poor horses.
Then we crossed and recrossed the James River and finally in
August rode through Richmond on our way to the "Valley" to
Martinsburg and there to the Potomac River and finally back to
Winchester, Berryville, etc, until about the 12th of September
my horse broke down and I was sent home for a fresh one.
Through about five months of hard, very hard, service this
noble horse carried me. One can hardly imagine the devotion
and love a cavalry man feels for his horse! Often after riding
all day and so tired and weary and sleep I could hardly stand,
I curried and rubbed down my horse and often gave him some of
my hard tack to eat. This was but natural however for upon him
I depended when in a "tight place" to get me out safely.
Sometimes at night marching, when we stopped a while, but
still unsaddled, and waiting for orders, we laid down by the
roadside to get a bit of sleep and with our own bridle reins
fastened to our wrists our horses stood patiently by the side
of us. Of course sometimes a fellow got trampled upon but
rarely seriously. After the war, "Don" became our "buggy
horse" and lived to a good age. No animal ever had my love as
he, except a pointer dog, Brick, which I had many years after
in Charleston. Verily, if there be such a place for faithful
honest animals Don is now in Horse Heaven and Brick in Dog
Heaven, or both together in some such haven and Elysium.</p>

<head>A Flag of Truce
<!-- <ref></ref> -->
</head>
<p>One cold day in the winter of 1863-4 while we were in
winter Quarters near the Rapidan River, below Orange, <abbr
expan="Courthouse">C. H.</abbr> <abbr
expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, and when I was one of many
couriers of Major General J. E. B. Stuart, Major H. B.
McClellan, Chief of Staff, came to me and said, "Gallaher, I
want you to fix yourself up, man and horse, and go with me
under a Flag of Truce. We wish to make a good appearance you
know."</p>
<p>Complimented that he had selected me out of so many fine
boys who were proud to be attached to the Head Quarters of
Lee's Cavalry, I got busy myself and had my horse rubbed down
nicely.</p>
<p>There were only three of us.Major <abbr
expan="McClellan">Mc.</abbr>, the Sergeant of the Couriers,
Ben Weller, and myself. That afternoon we rode away from Camp
on our mission. It was a very cold day and there was a slight
snow on the ground and the roads frozen hard.After riding some
miles we came to our Infantry pickets. As usual we found North
Carolinians doing picket duty. Those poor fellows fought as
hard and endured as much suffering as any others from any
state. And here on a bleak hill there were nearly frozen, no
fires allowed day or night, watching and guarding the more
fortunate lying back miles away in Camp and Winter
Quarters.</p>
<p>They soon hailed us and inquired of our missions which
Major McClellan soon explained and they let us pass beyond,
wishing us good luck.After riding some miles further on we
came upon outpost pickets, the cavalry, who had been there all
the night before and as they were required to be mounted all
of the time for fear of being surprised. After chatting a
while with these boys on out-post duty and learning all we
could as to where we would probably run into the enemy's out-
posts, bade them goodbye. We were in "No Man's Land" and at
once fixed a white handkerchief (there were a few in our army)
upon a sabre and holding it up to be seen, we roped on and on
and always with eyes and ears open. About sunset we suddenly
heard the Challenge "Halt!" We did so and soon spied a couple
of "blue coats" on top of a small hill in the corner of some
woods. They inquired our mission and told us to advance. We
did so and sat there talking with them while one dashed back
to their Reserve for the Captain, who soon came up at a
gallop. We explained matters. Major McClellan desired to see
his brother a Captain or Major on General George H. Meade's
Staff, who commanded on the Army of the Potomac and who later
Commanded at Gettysburg in 1863. General Meade's Staff had
some of General McClellan's old staff on it. General McClellan
had been badly defeated by General Lee below Richmond and was
deposed from the command of the great "Army of the Potomac."
So they rode with us back a mile or two to the "Reserve," whom
we found sitting around some fires trying to keep warm, but
all saddled up and ready upon an instants alarm to go forth,
whenever or wherever called.</p>
<p>A man was dispatched at once to Culpeper <abbr
expan="Courthouse">C. H.</abbr> some ten miles away to bring
<abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> McClellan to see his
brother. We sat around the welcome fire in the woods talking
with those boys. I say "boys," for we were all boys in both
armies. They shared their canteens of brandy with us and we
gave them all the tobacco we had. They had usually a hard time
to get tobacco in the Northern Armies. I have taken several
drinks of alcoholic nature in my life but if I lived a century
I should never forget that brandy! We were nearly frozen and
that brandy seemed like a nectar of the God's to us! But it
apparently was no more welcome to us than our tobacco to those
boys from the north. Along midnight we heard horses galloping.
They proved to be Captain McClellan and escort coming to see
his brother, our Major McClellan, impatiently awaiting him. As
the Captain hurriedly dismounted the Major rushed to him and
soon they were locked in each others arms and weeping. We
learned that a letter had come through our lines to Major
McClellan telling him of a devoted sister's death in
Philadelphia. And hence this flag of truce, whereby these
brothers, one in each army fighting each other, could meet and
talk over their grief and sorrowing loss of a sister!</p>
<p>They left us and went off to another fire some distance and
sat there a long time talking by themselves with no one to
disturb them. I shall never forget the pathetic sight of those
two brothers sitting way off to themselves and sharing their
sorrow at a sister's death and they situated as they were. But
the time came for them to bid each other goodbye, and this was
scarcely less emotional and pathetic than their meeting there.
Warmed somewhat with the brandy we rode away and through their
outpost pickets again into "No Man's Land" on our return, and
about sunrise reached our camp again.</p>

<head>General Rosser and General Custer
<!-- <ref></ref> -->
</head>
<p>They were cadets at West Point when the war came and
classmates and intimate devoted friends, Rosser from Louisiana
and Custer, I think, from Ohio. Each left West Point; Rosser
to go with his state and Custer to go into the Union Army,
bidding each other such a goodbye and with their personal
blessing, as one can imagine. But the strain upon their
affection and admiration for one another never weakened all
during life. Rosser was an officer in the Washington artillery
of New Orleans for a while and then made Colonel of the famous
fighting 5th <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> Cavalry
Regiment. Though only about 25 years old he became a Brigadier
and finally a Major General of Cavalry. Custer soon rose too
to a Brigadier. In the many cavalry fights their commands were
opposed and fought each other. Custer was a dandy--a dude as
we now call it, but was as dashing, as brave and able a
Cavalry General as the Union Army ever had and nobody realized
this more than our cavalry men. Sometimes we saw him leading
his men, easily recognized by his long flowing yellow hair
down on his shoulders, one of his vanities. He generally wore,
'tis said, a fancy jacket or <orig
reg="roundabout">rounabout</orig>, scorning a regular coat.
Unhappily for us, he, as was nearly always in our fights or
battles the case, generally far and away outnumbered us.
Towards the close of the war, Rosser and Custer often were
pitched against each other and each saw the other in our
fights and maneuvers. It was the dream of each to capture the
other and many messages did they send each other. Sometimes
the one falling back or retreating leaving a note, chaffing or
indulging in good natured rivalry.</p>

<head>Rosser's Escape to Courtland
<!-- <ref></ref> -->
</head>
<p>In the spring and winter of 1864: Rosser and Custer were in
Hanover County Virginia and almost daily for a while opposing
each other. Rosser's wife was at her old home there,
Courtland, and though a very hazardous venture, Rosser
determined to spend the night at Courtland. Some of the
negroes knowing he was there made their way to Custer's
command that night and told him of Rosser's near presence,
thus betraying Rosser. Custer at once saddled up his command
to capture the devoted husband Rosser. He soon drove in our
pickets and had Rosser's abiding place, as Custer thought, and
good humoredly believed, fully surrounded and his (Custer's)
long felt dream about to be realized in capturing Rosser! But
a faithful old house slave ran into Rosser's room and waking
him up and warned him, and meantime while Rosser was only
about half dressed himself, the old slave saddled his horse
for him. Rosser got away! Narrowly escaping being shot when
discovered. Custer chagrined, and though good humoredly
disappointed, decided he would call upon the wife of his old
chum at West Point. He did so and remained for breakfast!
Although the one was overjoyed and the other sorrowing at
Rosser's escape both always said afterwards each had enjoyed
the meeting. Knowing Rosser would soon be there again, "in
force" Custer had but few with him. Custer decided he had
better get away pretty soon and did so, but left a note as
follows for Rosser:</p>
<p>"Dear Tom--Hearing you were "at home" I called to see you
and sorry not to find you there."</p>
<p>Signed "Custer."</p>
<p>Mrs. Rosser gave Rosser the note. Next day Custer came with
a big force and drove Rosser away. But before leaving, Rosser
left the following note for Custer.</p>
<p>"Dear Custer--Hearing you were at my house I called to show
you some hospitality and sorry you had left!"</p>
<p>Signed "Rosser"</p>

<head>Note
<!-- <ref></ref> -->
</head>
<p>General and Mrs. Rosser used to tell this amusing episode.
After the war Rosser without a dollar in (his) pocket in
Washington: Custer then about to go out West got Rosser an
appointment as a surveyor on the then building Northern
Pacific <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R.</abbr> Rosser invested in
land along the <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R.</abbr> made a
fortune and lived in St. Paul <abbr
expan="Minnesota">Minn</abbr>. He later rebuilt Courtland into
a beautiful estate. Custer's command was protecting the
surveyors on that Northern Pacific <abbr expan="Railroad">R.
R.</abbr> from the marauding Indians and it is said that in
some of their fights Rosser was in the front on all occasions.
Poor Custer was killed in the Custer massacre in the Big Horn
battle with the Indians. Major Reno of the Union Cavalry and a
brave fighter in the War was in Washington after Custer's
death and drinking and swearing about Custer, whom he disliked
for some reason Rosser overheard him and not being willing to
hear his old friend abused it is said he kicked the drunken
Reno out of the hotel.</p>

<p>Rosser lost his fortune and became Post Master in
Charlottesville Virginia. Some years ago when I went from
Waynesboro over to University of Virginia I called to see
General Rosser at the Post Office. When he said for me to
enter his private office he arose and threw his arms around me
saying "Clinton God bless you! What are you doing here? He
invited me to his house in the country and I have a thousand
times sorely regretted that I did not go. He said "Why Bettie,
(his wife) would love to see you." He and his wife both are
now dead. I have loved no man more than I did General Rosser.
God bless him and his!</p>
