<h4>Augusta County: Samuel B. Coyner to Mary Anna Sibert, January
     20, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Samuel B. Coyner wrote from camp in Hedgesville, (West) Virginia, to one of the "Mt Solon
     girls," Miss M. A. Sibert. He excuses the tardiness of his letter by describing his injuries
     sustained in a sleigh ride gone awry. He also asserts the sobriety of his conduct since
     entering his company and mentions several joint acquaintances.</p>

<p class="p10">Jan. 20, 1861-</p>
<p class="p10">Hedgesville, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Mary Anna Sibert, <br>My dear friend,--</p>
<p class="p10">On account of a lame hand, got in a <u>frolic</u>, I have not written to
     you as soon as I intended. I should have written to you on my last arrival at this place; but
     on last Friday night (this is Monday) I became very glusome and determined to have a sleigh
     ride. One of the boys said if I got a sleigh, he would furnish the horse and we would have a
     ride. Slipping around in one of the alleys, I "pressed" the desired article and hitching in
      <i>[illeg.]</i> the horse, we started off, for Martinsburg distance 7 <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> miles; we
     went within sight of the town, but the pickets would not let us through, as it was after the proscribed hour, being about 12 o'clock. We then turned back
     and came in fine style till within 3 miles of camp, when the horse took fright and started. I
     tried to stop him by running him into the fence-course, but that made matters worse, or <u>better</u> I scarce know which, for the vehicle upset, threw us all out,
     myself upon my face, nearly breaking my nose and spraining my thumb, and by my trying to hold
     him, dragged me several paces bruising and blackening my eye in an ugly manner. He got away you
     may guess after all and dashed into town at a wild <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> rate. There was still another
     sleigh and I with the two belonging to that got into it &amp; drove off, but had not gone
     more than 50 paces before that horse started also. We got free however, without any additional
     injuries, and sleigh and horse dashed on. We now had to walk along a road which not an hour
     before we had passed so merrily with jingling of bells and shouting of glad voices. And so
     ended the chapter, with the exception of the repairing of the sleighs. - And I had forgot to
     say that in our party were three sleighs, one broke down &amp; two were run away with, and
     none came into town whole. Four sleighs were smashed up that night. I know you will think that
     we were on a spree. If you dont <i>[unclear: Mag]</i> will. But I <u>was</u> not. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I was just as sober then as I am in writing this letter. Indeed so
     sober has been my conduct since I have been in the company, that the boys say they would not
     believe it if they saw "Samuel B.," as they call him, <u>drunk</u>. And I am
     not <i>[unclear: boasting]</i> in the least. -- But I am taking up all my letter in the
     description of my sleigh ride. I have no news however, of
     importance. We are back again in the glorious little town of Hedgesville after a most terrible
     scout. Indeed, we had a rougher time than we have ever had. Two soldiers of one of the Georgia
      Reg<sup>s</sup>- like to have froze to death &amp;
     two young men who were visiting their acquaintances really did freeze. We
     expect to quarter here for the Winter &amp; most of the boys are well pleased, there being
     plenty of pretty and dear girls here. Give my love to all the family &amp; all the Mt Solon
     girls &amp; <i>[unclear: Maggie]</i> &amp; the <i>[unclear: Dr.]</i> &amp; little
     May.</p>
<p class="p10">&amp; believe me your eternal friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
      <u>Samuel B. Coyner</u>
     </i></p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you have heard of John since the battle of
      Beth. I saw him &amp; all my acquaintances they looked hearty. They are
      in Romney now I think-- Tell Ella Ill write to her soon</p>
