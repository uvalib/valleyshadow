                <p>I was taken down with fever at New Market about the middle of August and sent to
                    Staunton for treatment. Two weeks ago I was sufficiently recovered to come to
                    this place. I am now well and will return to duty in a few days. Mary is with
                    us. Her health is still very delicate. She read your letter of July 28<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi> &amp; answered it at once. This week I <abbr
                        expan="received">recd.</abbr> your letter of July 14<hi rend="super"
                    >th</hi>. I am endevouring to carry out your request but doubt my ability to
                    accomplish anything. I have written to <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Wise
                    invoking his aid &amp; hope it will be more potent than my efforts. Some of
                    your friends have been killed since your capture, though I believe none with
                    whom you were very intimate. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Lang &amp;
                    Thornhill were killed below Winchester week before last. Poor Lang we shall miss
                    him greatly. George &amp; Jimmy &amp; <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr>
                    McPhail well at last accounts. The 18<hi rend="super">th</hi> won the
                    distinction of a special report from the Division Commander a few days ago for
                    gallantry. I would say more if it were not contraband. Ma was to see me in
                    Staunton. All were well at home. I effect to see them next week. I have laid
                    aside a Salem letter for you which I suppose will "keep" till you get back.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Massie of the Institute is here &amp; sends
                    his regards to you. His brother Rodes is a prisoner. If at Johnson Island make
                    his acquaintance. I shall endeavour to get Mary to winter in <abbr
                        expan="South Carolina">S.C.</abbr> or <abbr expan="Georgia">Ga.</abbr> for
                    her health.</p>

                <p>Give my kindest regards to Ginnevan, Ervin, Warden, Makely, Re<del rend="none" hand="h1"/>,
                        <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Imboden &amp; all other friends with
                    you. I spend many an hour thinking of you all and hope ere long a general
                    exchange may restore you to your friends. Mary writes in love to you. Russie,
                    Frank, &amp; Jennie are all at school at Mr McPhail's.</p>
