<p class="p10">Wednesday Dec. 17<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp at Moss Neck Caroline Co. Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I just received your letter of the 10<sup>th</sup>, the
     first word from home since I left, though I have written four or five
     times --I am very sorry you have had such a time with Anna, &amp; hope she is now better
     and may continue so -- for I know it is very hard on you to have so many cares -- I see, by
     your letter, that you are worn down by care, and so have the "horrors" -- You will say I do not
     appreciate your troubles, but I know I do, and fully feel for them all, but words are of little
     use &amp; I can only hope for days of peace and respite from the stern demands of cruel war
     to enable me to fix myself &amp; family as I would desire, and so they may have as much of
     comfort as this changing and uncertain world can supply -- I do not expect to find any
     perfectly satisfactory state of things in such a condition of being as
     this, and only hope to <u>use</u> its transitory pleasures and ills, mixed
     as they are, as preparatory for a better &amp; surer world -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10"> I have written to you about Allen -- I will see to the payment of his hire &amp;c, and I
     wrote to you to know what you desired about servants &amp;c and hope to hear from you in a
     few days, in reference to that. I wrote you a gloomy letter the day before the big fight of
     Saturday, in which I indulged in gloomy anticipations of what might happen on the morrow, but
     my gloomy mood passed with the day, although that day brought sadness to many hearth stones --
     gloom to many a household, yet God's good Providence spared me -- and I am thankful, truly
     thankful, for my own sake &amp; ten thousand times more on my family's account -- and may
     God for his Son's sake still shield me -- May that it may be so, My Dear, &amp; teach our
     little ones to ask protection from our Heavenly Father for me from the "arrow that flieth at
     noonday"</p>
<p class="p10"> The account of the battle in the papers is a very good one -- and you can form a good idea
     of what was done from that. The enemy crossed back night before last, during a storm, to the
     other side of the Rappahannock -- leaving his dead on the field, although he had asked and
     obtained <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> a truce to take off his wounded and bury his dead and had collected them
     from the battle field for that purpose -- thus tacitly admitting that he had been completely
     whipped -- cut short in his onward career towards Richmond -- We heard that the enemy intended
     to cross last night at Port Royal, 20 miles below Fredericksburg, so we started yesterday
     morning and came on down the Rappahannock &amp; came on to this place on our way to Port
     Royal, but heard that the enemy had not come down, so we halted by the wayside and bushed it
     for about half the night then the Gen. froze out and we hunted up a house and slept soundly
     until 10 o'clock this morning, the first time for several nights -- Burnsides has disappeared,
     but I guess we will soon find out his whereabouts. We are some 14 miles from the Railroad now, but have constant communication -- My letter did not reach
     you in time for my box -- so I shall be content until such time as I can come or it can be
     safely sent to me to the care of Maj. Hawks at Guinea's Station Richmond, Fredericksburg, &amp; Petersburg    Railroad
    </p>
<p class="p10"> I went down to the enemy's lines during the day <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> of truce and saw the Yanks carry
     off their dead -- I tell you they lost a great number -- they lay in heaps in many places, <u>mown</u> down by the steady and continued fire of our brave soldiers.</p>
<p class="p10"> Our position was a very fine one, our men sheltered by the woods -- but we had many killed
     &amp; wounded by the shells of the enemy from long range guns -- One Battalion of our Artillery had 119 horses killed &amp; disabled and 98 men -- The
     line of battle was four miles long -- and the enemy had three lines of troops reaching about
     that distance and then masses of troops besides.</p>
<p class="p10"> Write to me soon my Dear -- I will try to come up soon and see about servants &amp;c
     &amp;c -- and I have some hopes we may be through with this war by Spring and, if my life
     is spared I may return to my family &amp; the pursuits of peace. If any one says I might
     pay my debts from my salary I can only say that such a person is a heartless wretch --
     destitute of patriotism and ignorant of what it costs a soldier to serve his country and defend
     such souless creatures as the set of sharks at home that think only of gain and personal
     aggrandizement -- I will write to Nelly a few lines though I have a head ache and feel badly
     tonight having been up so much of late</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye and God bless you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
