     <salute>My Dearest Wife,</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I think it exceedingly doubtful of this ever reaching you, but I must write a line to let you
     know where and how I am. Shortly after receiving your letter of the 25th March, I joined the
     1st Reg. Cavalry and was detailed at once at Genl. Stuart's Hd.Qrs. in the Quartermaster's
     Department of which Major Fitzhugh, former Adjutant Genl. of Gen. Stuart is now chief. And
     since have been actively engaged in purchasing horses &amp;c. I was just contemplating a
     trip to Warren with a view of getting to Clarke when the Enemy crossed the Rappahannock and
     drove us from Culpeper. I need not give you any details of the late military operation further
     than to say that the Enemy's Cavalry have gotten between this point and Richmond cut the <abbr
      expan="railroad">R.Road</abbr> at Louisa <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and other points below, penetrated
     to James River, and are running wild over This Country Plundering and robbing --
      unfortunately<pb n="2"/> we have but one brigade of Cavalry, a few infantry, and two Batteries
     here, Genl. Stuart being somewhere below towards Fredericksburg. And the force is by no means
     sufficient to oppose the Enemy, as they have some 14000 Cavalry. However Gen. Lee has gained a
     glorious victory at Fredericksburg, driven the Enemy across the Rappahannock, and Their Cavalry
     must leave at once if they <hi rend="underline">can</hi>.</p>

    <p>I am waiting here until the way is open I have not heard from Jim since I left him some two
     weeks ago - Nor have I heard from Richmond- </p>

    <p>I am hoping my dear wife from day to day that the tide of war may bring me nearer to you, and
     enable me to see you once more, but now that I am regularly enlisted in the Army again I have
     no freedom of action, and must bear and endure with what patience and fortitude I can command.
     And have to beg of you my love to comfort me, by exhibiting also that degree of Christian
     resignation which I know will be vouchsafed to you - </p>

    <p>I have no time to write more at present. All is commotion here - </p>

    <p> With love to all. And more than all for ...</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>As ever <lb/>Yours</salute>
     <signed>P.H.P.</signed>
     <seg type="postscript">Charlottesville May 8th 1863<lb/> I came up here yesterday <del
       hand="h1"/>found all well and very glad to see me once more. Aunt Kitty is the same old thing
      - As good and kind as ever. And perfectly willing to kill me with eating. She sends her love
      and says she is not so much afraid of Yanks now. Aunt Fanny lives with her now. She is very
      infirm, and dreadful fretful - I return to Gordonsville this morning. <lb/> Yours in Haste
