<p class="p10">New Providence House</p>
<p class="p10">Misses Lucy Turk &amp; Mary Smiley &amp; Mary Turk - My Dear
                        Young friends,</p>
<p class="p10">I have received your kind invitation to attend your soiree on tomorrow night. I
                    thank you very much for it. It would afford me great pleasure I know to attend,
                    for I am a dear lover of music &amp; like to see young people enjoying
                    themselves, &amp; I doubt not you will have both good music &amp; much
                    true enjoyment on tomorrow evening. But my duties here are such that it is
                    impossible for me to leave <i>[unclear: home]</i> at this time; I have an
                    appointment to preach at Mr <i>[unclear: Ind.]</i> R. Berry's tomorrow
                    afternoon.</p>
<p class="p10">Permit me, my dear friends, to say a word or two of earnest counsel to you, for I
                    feel a deep interest in your welfare.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Just one word in a general way.</p>
<p class="p10">Always in all circumstances remember that you have characters as young ladies to
                    maintain, &amp; never permit yourselves to compromise in any way the
                    gentleness, modesty, &amp; kindness which should ever characterize the true
                    lady. But especially never compromise in the least your christian character. You
                    are the professed followers of the blessed Savior- always remember that,
                    &amp; act accordingly.<br> The highest, &amp; most precious ornament of
                    a true lady is genuine piety.<br> Live near to Christ then, my dear young
                    friends - study diligently your Bibles - be faithful in prayer &amp; in the
                    discharge of every Christian duty. This need not, &amp; should not mar a
                    single pleasure, or make your faces less bright. Be cheerful- live ever gay -
                    but let your cheerfulness &amp; gaity be that which becometh<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    <i>[deleted: &amp;]</i> followers of Jesus. Let <i>[deleted: y]</i>
                    not your gaity be boisterous or frivelous.</p>
<p class="p10">May the blessed Savior bless you richly, &amp; enable you to gr<i>[deleted: ]</i> grace in the knowledge of the Lord &amp; Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="p10">I am your sincere friend &amp; pastor</p>
<p class="p10"><i>L. D. Jenkin</i></p>
<p class="p10">Please hand the enclosed note to Miss Baldwin.</p>
