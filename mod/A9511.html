<p class="p11"><b>To
                    Rev. Dr. Francis McFarland
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 31st, 1862</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My dear Doctor,</p>
<p class="p10">I am very grateful to you for your prayers to God for the success of the
                    operations which God has entrusted to me. Please continue to pray for me and for
                    the success of the troops entrusted to me. It cheers my heart to think that many
                    of God's people are praying to our ever kind Heavenly Father for the success of
                    the Army to which I belong. Without God's blessing I look for no success, and
                    for every success my prayer is, that all the glory may be given unto <u>Him</u> to whom it is properly due. If people would but
                    give all the glory to God, and regard his creatures as but unworthy instruments,
                    my heart would rejoice. Alas too frequently the praise is bestowed upon the
                    creature. Whilst we must not forget the superior importance of spiritual
                    victories, yet I trust that you under God's direction do what you can in
                    securing the prayers of His people for the success of our arms, especially for
                    the success of those which are entrusted to me, an unworthy servant, but who
                    desires to glorify his name even in my present military calling. My trust is in
                    God for success. Praying for a continuation of your usefulness,</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your much attached friend.</p>
