<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I haven't
                    much to write as Jinnie has
                    written but will say if you can get any Beaver cloak cloth for Jinnie and I. we have our cloth at home
                    it looks very well now but when it is worn a while it
                        won't look well. I was at Staunton friday week saw
                    some cloth I could have got for one 100 and 25 dollars a yard is very heavy. since that time it was sold M<sup>rs</sup>
                    McCormick and I was there last friday it was all gone but I could have gotten
                    off <i>[deleted: of]</i> several pieces of broad cloth some cotton chain
                    and some all wool all the same price named a bove I was offered 50 for mine but
                    I wouldn't take that I do not want to do a foolish thing sell mine <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and get broad cloth such as men make coats of you
                    know that won't
                    do unless it is well lined about the Baddie - if you cant
                    get for a fair
                    price do not get at all. some get 4 yards for a cloak but I think 7 or seven
                    and a half will make two
                    cloaks for Jinnie and I. the cloth is double
                    width I thought you could
                    get good cloth there for less than I could here. let
                        me know what you can do I will
                    keep the cloth until I hear from you if you get cloth
                    send with some reliable person or fetch your self I think you might be able to come home. Henry and B F M<sup>c</sup>Nutt came home last night on detail to get some things and our cattle they brought a wagon to take things in Apples and potatoes and dry fruit they have to go back
                    thursday or friday. Henry and all the detailed men are all as mad as they can
                        be all can hardly keep our
                    stack of wheat men came
                    saturday four came yesterday to get wheat and some came last week and pressed
                    the tithe corn. It makes H mad
                    to think they detail men out of the army to thrash and
                    shuck corn instead of leaving the owners to attend to their
                    own
                    business try all you can to get home there is a good deal of wool to card yet some have been
                    taken a way some say they are waiting on your getting
                    home Henry seems to think if the people would get up a petition you could get off Ad Steel got off as Miller. write soon did
                    you get my letter I wrote when at Aunt Sallies I
                    received a letter from you Saturday</p>
