<p class="p10">Dear Lissa you said in your letter that the little boy weighed 28 lbs. I don't think he has
     gained much. I want you to kiss him for me as I don't have no chance to kiss him myself and
     when you kiss him think of me. I weighed some three weeks ago and I only weighed one hundred
     and seventy eight and William Offlighter weighed 177. There was but one pound between us. Well
     I must bring my. William Offlighter sends his love to you all also Hiram Coyner. Give my love
     to all.</p>
<p class="p10">I heard that they had sent for Gerard and David Gray. I thank god that they have not had the
     chance to send for me. I thank the lord for his kindness towards me that he has give me good
     health. If I don't meet you on earth I hope to meet you in heaven above where parting will be
     no more. I must close for this time. Please excuse me for this time. Write soon. So nothing
     more but remain your affectionate husband until death. </p>
