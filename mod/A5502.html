<h4>Augusta County: Alexander H. H. Stuart to Frances
                    Peyton Stuart, January xx, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Alexander H. H. Stuart writes to his daughter, Frances Peyton Stuart, concerning
                    the secession convention and a recent visit by Fanny's aunt and the Misses
                    Peyton. He speculates as to who will be elected to represent Augusta County in
                    the secession convention.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Thursday</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Fanny</p>
<p class="p10">I am much indebted to you for your letter -- It relieved my mind in regard to the
                    children, who, I hope are by this time quite well.</p>
<p class="p10">I received no Staunton paper last night &amp; therefore am quite in the dark
                    as to what our people are doing in Augusta-</p>
<p class="p10">When I first arrived in Richmond I found the most alarming excitement prevailing,
                    which threatened the most disastrous results -- All direct opposition was
                    fruitless. We had for the time, to give way -- <i>[unclear: Gradually]</i>
                    however we gained strength, &amp; now I think the conservative party is in
                    the majority &amp; will be able to prevent any further mischief -- It will
                    now be for the people to decide what shall be the character of the convention to
                    be elected on 4<sup>th</sup>
                    February. I sincerely hope the union party will
                    succeed in electing a majority against secession-</p>
<p class="p10">The weather here has been dreadful -- yesterday morning it cleared off
                    beautifully, &amp; it was a charming day -- Today is also mild, bright
                    &amp; beautiful -- I hope you will induce your mother to ride on<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the McAdamised road -- She is so negligent of her health, that it is necessary
                    for you &amp; your sisters to stimulate her to "make an effort-</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Howe]</i> Peyton is here, &amp; I presume will return to
                    Staunton -- The unsettled condition of the country is the reason he assigns for
                    failing to go to Texas -- He is a decided secessionist -- He says he spent Christmas at Mr Towles's &amp; that Mr Towles has
                    been elected a secession delegate to the Louisiana Convention --</p>
<p class="p10">I still hope there will be an accommodation of existing difficulties on the lines
                    of Mr Crittenden's propositions -- The joint committees, of which I am a member,
                    agreed, last night, to report that in the opinion of Virginia Mr Crittenden's
                    plan would be satisfactory --</p>
<p class="p10">The Misses Peyton &amp; your aunt Susan came up to the Capitol this morning
                    -- The girls are looking very blooming &amp; pretty -- I have not seen much
                    of them, as I have been very much engaged -- Mrs Thompson &amp; party will
                    leave tomorrow for Halifax -- She seems in high spirits, &amp; improves very
                    much on acquaintance<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I hope you &amp; your sisters will write to
                    me as often as you can -- It is a great satisfaction to receive even half a
                    dozen lines every day to assure me that all are well.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope we shall have a recess of the Legislature in a week or ten days, though I
                    am not by any means certain of this fact -- It would be very gratifying to me to
                    return home for a week or ten days --</p>
<p class="p10">I have heard nothing from home in regard to the Convention -- I do not know who
                    will be candidates except your uncle John, &amp; Harman, &amp; Imboden
                    -- As for myself I have no desire to be a member, &amp; shall not seek the
                    position -- If the people desire it, of course I cannot refuse -- I suppose I
                    will get some letters this evening which will give some idea of the state of
                    feeling at home.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all the children &amp; tell them all to write to me. </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate father</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alex H. H. Stuart</i></p>
