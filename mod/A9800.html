<p class="p10">Dear Stuart-</p>
<p class="p10">I have received the claim of
                    Cousins for a horse killed in Battle. It requires to pass through the Auditor's
                    office which causes a good deal of delay. &amp; then I learn that the
                    appropriation is exhausted, but that will be remedied very soon. I will put it
                    in regular <i>[unclear: course for so intend]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">We have no news here of any kind except that which comes from the Valley,
                    indicating the coming of Early's army this way. I was all along our lines on the
                    North side of the River yesterday &amp; saw <i>[unclear: unescaped]</i> war
                    looking down from Fort Harrison to the point of Yankee lines. I was nearly all
                    day within range of cannon &amp; at times in musket range of the enemy, but
                    there was not a shot. The enemy are building within quarters.</p>
<p class="p10">I fear the <u>Habeas Corpus</u> will again be suspended, but I
                    hope <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>in some modified form. Mr. <i>[unclear: Trenholm]</i> has made
                    a capital impression here socially, &amp; officially &amp; his report
                    rates very well. I think it will in the main be adopted, but as yet matters are
                    not sufficiently developed to enable me to form an opinion.</p>
<p class="p10">The President's negro mishap has cause much feeling against him in quarters very
                    near him as Harris, Ruffin &amp;c &amp; I learn it is doing much
                    mischief in stampeding the slaves.</p>
<p class="p10">The city is just now unusually free of gossip. I have not heard anything worth
                    writing about. I saw Sandy &amp; so his the other day &amp; all well,
                    but hungry.</p>
<p class="p10">Love to all your folks.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John B. Baldwin</i></p>
