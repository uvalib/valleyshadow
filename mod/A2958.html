<p class="p10">My Dear Willie</p>
<p class="p10">I have not received a line from you yet but concluded I would not wait any longer
                    this is a beautiful Sabbath morn &amp; I wish you were here to go to church
                    with me Annie Mollie Jake &amp; George have gone &amp; I thought I would
                    stay at home &amp; write to the dear one that is far a way. I expect to go
                    to prayer meeting this evening Oh how I wish you were
                    here <i>[added: to go with me]</i> for I feel some what
                        lonely have not had time to have the blues much but
                    am anxiously looking for-ward for Saturday to arrive
                    &amp; to bring my dear one with it the time will not appear long for I will
                    be so busy that I will hardly have time to think but do
                    not disappoint me for you know Willie I will be very uneasy if you don't come think it very strange that I have not got a
                    letter yet have sent twice to the office but hope I will soon hear from you I
                    expect you have forgotten Kate as she is so selfish I reckon I had better look
                    for a sweetheart this eve perhaps I could find one that would take your place Well Willie dear this is the first time I have had
                    a pen in my hand since you left me I am getting careless would have written to cousin Mollie C but have forgotten her address so I cannot write until I see you will write to cousin Joe this week &amp; Dottie I have been too busy to write to
                    them we are all very well I have had a slight cold but feel very well now hope
                    this will find you well &amp; happy &amp; in fine spirits &amp;
                    above all striving to do the will of our dear Mother remember thy dear Kate at
                    the <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>throne of grace &amp; pray that I may over come the selfish
                    feeling that rise in my bosom for you &amp; that we may both draw nearer to
                    each other by the strong ties of holy love it makes me very sad some time when I
                    think I have caused thy dear bosom to heave a sigh for my selfishness but it is
                    my nature &amp; hope you will love me dearer for it after awhile but you will say how can I love you dearer I do not know that
                    you can but that it will make you happy to think that you have it in in your
                    power to wound &amp; to heal Willie you think me very childish I acknowledge
                    I am but can not help it my love is so strong that it makes me thus do not let
                    it grieve you I hope by the grace of God to over come
                    it &amp; make you very happy it is my desire to
                    make you happy &amp; I believe I can but enough of this. I have no news to
                    write the boys are not done cutting up their corn yet
                    the rain prevented them yesterday we had a hail storm Friday evening it did no
                    damage here, in the neighborhood of cousin John Crist it broke out most all of
                    the window panes &amp; cut the parlor so it will
                        hardly be worth saving it has made quite a change
                    in the weather I expect it will get cold before we want to see cold weather I
                    wish we could get married before it gets cold I am
                    anxious to be with you; I suppose you were teased enough about having me in
                    Augusta but I think it was for the best but I can't stay
                    much longer I hope it will save you the trip over the mountain I shall not
                    promise you that though I expect I will have you to
                    come to old Augusta every two or three weeks after
                    something for <i>[deleted: ro ex]</i> what do you think of all that but I
                    must close I would like very much to accompany this do not let any thing in this
                    cause one sad thought but be cheerful &amp; happy please excuse haste &amp; all imperfections I
                    will try &amp; look my prettiest Saturday eve write very soon.</p>
