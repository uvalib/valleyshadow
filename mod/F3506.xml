                </opener>

                <p>I am at home, wounded, on "Leave of Absence" for thirty days. My time expired
                    yesterday--My "Leave" being dated Dec. 19th 1862. Here I am, in a quandary. My
                    wound is not yet healed up, is still a running sore, and being in the head, on
                    the left temple, it is in an exposed and <hi rend="underline">critical</hi>
                    place, so my surgeon assures me &amp; consequently protests against me
                    venturing to return to my <abbr expan="regiment">regt</abbr> (126th regt. Pa.)
                    or even venturing out on two or three days travel--and yet the surgeon cannot
                    comply with the literal terms required by Dec. 5 of the <hi rend="underline"
                        >extracts</hi> from the Regulations, accompanying my "Leave of Absence," by
                    which he is required to swear that the patient is not <hi rend="underline"
                        >"able"</hi> to travel. This I cannot <hi rend="underline">ask</hi> him to
                    do because I <hi rend="underline">can</hi> travel (though not <hi
                        rend="underline">fit</hi>) else I would not be here &amp; yet the
                    surgeon deems it both imprudent &amp; dangerous to make the venture, the
                    wound being in the head. On <hi rend="underline">pleasant days</hi> I can
                    &amp; <hi rend="underline">do</hi> go out and feel the better for a little
                    exercise.</p>

                <p>I have no desire to remain away from my comrades in arms one day longer than is
                    necessary. I want to serve my country and the measure of my services is not yet
                    full and will not be until this <orig reg="rebellion">rebelion</orig> is crushed
                    out if I live so long.</p>

                <p>If an extenson is granted, I assure you I will not use one day more of the time
                    given than is necessary to heal my wounds.</p>

                <p> My address stands at the head of this note.</p>

                <p>My "Leave of Absence" is dated Dec. 19th 1862-- disability report the previous
                    day.</p>

                <p>herewith I send surgeons certificate. I will await your reply.</p>
