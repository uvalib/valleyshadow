<p class="p10">near Fairfax Court
House</p>
<p class="p10">
Dear Ma,</p>
<p class="p10">
You will perceive by <br>
the heading of this, that we have changed <br>
our camp a few miles.  Though you need <br>
fear no hostile demonstrations on the <br>
account as we are yet ten or twelve <br>
miles from the outposts.  We were only <br>
moved about five miles&#8212;only one <br>
mile below us in Fairfax Court
House<a href="#n1">[1]</a>, a <br>
very pretty village in time of peace, <br>
but now every where you
see signs of the <br>
presence of soldiers; a general air of neglect <br>
and confusion, fences torn down, tents <br>
of regiments and brigades seem in every <br>
direction as far as can be seen through the <br>
openings of trees.
The country here is very <br>
pretty; it is hilly, though not such high <br>
hills
as we are accustomed to in the valley, <br>
but a succession of low
parallel
ridges

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Bro1i184.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Bro1i184.gif"></center></a><br><br>
running nearly north and south, which <br>
render the appearance a
great deal more beautiful <br>
than the low flat country around the Junction.<br>
It is very densely wooded&#8212;mostly pine <br>
and the whole filled up with thick undergrowth, forming the very best protection <br>
to the pickets and
scouting parties, and also <br>
a shelter for those terrible engines of
destruction <br>
(to the Yankees)-"masked batteries."<a href="#n2">[2]</a> </p>
<p class="p10">
Troops are still
concentrating between this <br>
place and our picket lines&#8212;the main body <br>
of the army is here&#8212;what it all means <br>
no one of course can tell, though you may <br>
rest assured there will be no more falling <br>
back on the Junction, unless we are completely beaten, of which however I have <br>
little fear.  I
do not believe the Yankees are <br>
ready to fight us yet&#8212;their loss was too <br>
great on the 21<sup>st</sup> July for them to have <br>
recovered from it so soon.<a href="#n3">[3]</a> All military <br>
operations are exceedingly dull <br>
and sluggish.  </p>
<p class="p10">
We are both very well and right <br>
pleasantly situated, if indeed a camp <br>
life can be, at all
pleasant.  The camp <br>
is a right good one, the water not quite <br>
so good as
that we left.
</p>
<p class="p10">William Wilson<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
reached camp <br>
this morning, from Fairfax Station <br>
where he left the boxes, and for which <br>
we will send tomorrow.  He
gave us <br>
all the news, both from home and <br>
Rockbridge.  The Cars now run
regularly <br>
to Fairfax Station, about 3 miles from <br>
the Court House.  You
will hereafter<br>
direct your letters to
<u>Fairfax Station</u><br>
Company I 4<sup>th</sup>
Regiment Va. Volunteers.
</p>
<p class="p10">
I suppose Charles told you that <br>
Capt. White's
resignation has been accepted <br>
and that Mr.  Morrison has been elected <br>
Captain.  He will make an excellent <br>
captain. I like him very much. <br>
 He is one of the most industrious and <br>
intelligent men I ever saw.<a href="#n5">[5]</a>
</p>
<p class="p10">
Father wished to know that amount <br>
coming to <u>William</u>
 from the Confederacy.<a href="#n6">[6]</a><br>
Captain White
 is not here and Captain <br>
Morrison knows nothing about it, he <br>
can only make the calculations at
$11 per <br>
month which results as follows: $31.63 <br>
up to the first of July and
then 16 days <br>
in that month $5.50 making $37.13. <br>
The pay master made a
note on the pay <br>
rolls, that William had died and the day <br>
of his death
(16th of July) but the amount <br>
could be drawn at anytime without <br>
difficulty.
Any statement from the Captain <br>
could in no way, be of any service,  I think. <br>
He can find out better in Staunton than any <br>
one here can tell him.  <br>
I am
going to Fairfax Station today for the boxes. </p>
<p class="p10">Much
love to everybody.<br>
 As ever your son.</p>

Eston
is very well, the most contented man in camp.  <br>
John D.<a href="#n7">[7]</a>
is pretty well.<br>
Lieutenant Wilson has been right sick <br>
but is now nearly
well.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> While Jackson's Brigade was stationed at Fairfax
Court House, Company I of the 4th Virginia Infantry (the Liberty Hall
Volunteers) was assigned to guard General Gustavus Smith's
headquarters (Bean, 64).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> A "battery" was a unit of organization for the field
artillery. A battery usually consisted of four or six guns. See
http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/~cjt1/artillery.html for more information
about Civil War artillery.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> Andrew refers to the Confederate victory at
the First Battle of Manassas, which  was fought on July 21, 1861. </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> William N. Wilson, a fellow student at Washington
College, volunteered for Company I of the 4th Virginia Infantry in June
of 1861.  Wilson was captured at Kernstown on March 23, 1862 and
exchanged on August 5, 1862, so
when this letter was written he
must have just returned to the service.
  He was listed as a deserter after November
27, 1862 (Robertson, <i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>, 81)</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> James J. White (1828-1893) (cf April 14, 1861, July
16, 1861) was a professor of Classics at Washington College and was
commissioned as a captain when Company I was organized on June 2, 1861.
He resigned on September 6, 1861 and returned to teaching at the
College (Bean 11; Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 1, 80).
Henry Ruffner Morrison, also a teacher, was elected captain
of the company on September 12, 1861. Morrison was one of those captured
at Kernstown on March 23, 1862, but was exchanged on August 5 of that
year. He eventually resigned from the service and died in 1879
(Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 65).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">[6]</a> William Brooks died of a cerebral or spinal disorder
on July 16, 1861. See Andrew Brooks' July 16, 1861 letter to his mother,
as well as James White's letter to James Brooks on July 16, 1861; both
letters broke the news of William's death to the family.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n7">[7]</a> John D. Brooks, perhaps a cousin of the Brooks
brothers, enlisted in
Company H of the Fifth Virginia Infantry on April 19, 1861.
After serving five months as regimental quartermaster clerk,
Brooks was promoted to first sergeant in September of 1861.
In April of 1862, he was transferred to Company E, and he
was promoted
to captain in 1864.
He was paroled at
Appomattox Court House in April of 1865 as Captain, Assistant
Quartmaster, 2nd Corps, Army of Northern Virginia.
