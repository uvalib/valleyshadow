<p class="p10">Camp near Harrison Landing </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister! </p>
<p class="p10">Your welcome letter of July 22<sup>nd</sup> reached me in good health, and I was
     very happy to hear that you were well, and that you have not waited so long this time before
     you wrote to me for I am always anxious to hear from you, and how things are going on in the
     old neighbourhood. I wrote a letter to Sister Louisa before I wrote to you the last time, and I
     received one from Father which I have answered, but I have not received any answer from either
     of them yet. I have not yet wrote to Sister Anne nor Amanda, as I do not know where to direct
     their letters to. when you write to me again, please send me their address. I have not much
     news to tell you, but <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br> as I have not much to do this afternoon I thought I might as
     well employ some of my time in writing to you. Those men of our regiment who were taken
     prisoners, on the 27<sup>th</sup> of June, have been released on parole of honor,
     and were sent home. Nathan Jones was along with them, they passed by
     this place last Wednesday, a week the 23<sup>rd</sup> but
     I did not get to see them. Last week I saw Jonathan Harley, he looks
     well, and is hardy, but he says, it goes hard for him on long march. I have been to see the
      104<sup>th</sup> but they are never in camp when I get there. the first time i was
     there they were out on picketguard and I only saw Levi Rosenberger and
     Bill Franks, and yesterday I was there again and they were out on a review; I saw Levi Markley, he had been down at the river to wash, and when he came back to
     camp the regiment had gone out and he was left behind pb n="2"/&gt;he is well and so are all the rest of the boys. Levi told me that Bill Snyder has been
     discharged. last night a party of rebels came across the river in a small boat with the
     intention to set a vessel on fire, but our guards saw them before they
     got near the vessel and fired into them. the rebels then tried to go back, but were taken
     prisoners before they could get away. I have not heard from Christian Lindauer since we came
     here. the last time I heard from him he was in Frankfurt yet and him and his sister were well.
     I would like to know how Polly Furhman is getting along with her young one, and what has become
     of Fyatty Miller. I never hear anything about them. I would like to know what has become of
     Charles Fackler. I will now close with my highest regards to all our family and friends, give
     my best respects to Levi Leidy and <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> his family; give my love to Sister Anne and
     Amanda if you see them, and tell them that I will write to them as soon as I get their address, which would be easy for me to get if they would write to me
     first, and tell me where they live. I should be glad to hear from you soon again. </p>
<p class="p10">I remain your affectionate brother, </p>
