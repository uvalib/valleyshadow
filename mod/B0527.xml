                        expan="New York Volunteers">N.Y.V.</abbr>

                    Ferry, Jefferson <abbr expan="County, Virginia">Co. Va</abbr>.</p>

                <p>I have had personal interviews with the several officers <abbr expan="commanding"
                        >commd'g</abbr> the <unclear>military</unclear> districts and sub-districts
                    embracing the counties assigned to me, and received assurances of their
                    assistance and co-operation in the promotion of the objects of this Bureau, and
                    arrangements have been made for the distribution of troops <pb n="2"/>in the
                    best manner their limited numbers would allow, for the support and protection of
                    the <abbr expan="Assistant">Asst.</abbr> Superintendents.</p>

                <p>The Freedmen are generally at work, and for able bodied men, the demand exceeds
                    the supple. Women with 3 or more little children find it difficult to obtain
                    employment and there is no authorized system of apprenticeship by which such
                    children might be permanently provided for, and the mother disincumbered, be
                    able to support herself. Cases of this kind are comparitively infrequent, but
                    difficult to meet when they occur, because there are no vacant habitations
                    accessible in this District and the cases are distributed on a
                        <unclear>territory</unclear> which from its extent and difficient
                    communications render relief establishments impracticable.</p>

                <p>There will be numbers of infirm and helpless freedmen, besides some among them
                    who were called "free negroes" for whose support some local provision must be
                    made, and I again respectfully suggest that the local authorities, as overseers
                    of the Poor may be made to take care of them -- as they best can for the
                    inhabitants will then have a personal interest in the matter and permit the use
                    of vacant cabins, which they would now rather burn than have them occupied under
                    the auspices of the "Freedmens Bureau" --.</p>

                <p>The Freedmen are rapidly becoming familiar with and accustomed to their new
                    relations to the whites, and give encouraging evidence that with facilities for
                    education, and unobstructed entrance into fields of labor and business <pb n="3"
                    />they will soon cease to be regarded as an incubus upon the state or as
                    subjects for the tutelage and guardianship of everybody, particularly those whom
                    they already surpass in patriotism.</p>
