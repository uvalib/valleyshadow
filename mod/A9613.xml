                </opener>

                <p>I suppose you think I have forgotten you but far from it. I received your <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">kind</add> &amp; affectionate letter, and was
                        <orig reg="truly">truely</orig> glad to hear from you &amp; my old
                    school-mates on the Creek. I am not very well at present, as I have a very bad
                    cold, which is quite common in this vicinity.</p>

                <p>Well, news is so very scarce I hardly <orig reg="know">no</orig> where to get
                    intelligence to write to you.</p>

                <p>I was in company with some ladies last night, and my ideas are a little tangled,
                    and it requires some exertion to extricate them. But I managed to keep my heart,
                    and am no <pb n="2"/>suscipient (as you already know) of other people's hearts.
                    I hope you had a joyous time, during your meeting at Calvary, &amp; also
                    hope you had a revival of religion in your midst. You said that there was need
                    of one in <hi rend="underline">your</hi> neighborhood; you need not limit it to
                    your own neighborhood for all neighborhoods need it.</p>

                <p>You made mention of some in Greenville, who had made a profession, I was glad to
                    hear of it, and hope they will remain "steadfast in faith."</p>

                <p>You hoped, (you said) that I might succeed in getting one of Mrs. P. daughters, I
                    have not courted them yet &amp; have not <orig reg="gotten">gotton</orig>
                    sense enough to do that; I think I will have to take a few lessons under you,
                    for <pb n="3"/>fear I begin wrong and fail in my attempt. You said that you
                    would like for me to send you my likeness, I'm afraid I would break all the
                    glass that can be started. I am very thankful that I am going to school where I
                    am; I know Midway of old, and the "Burg" is not far behind.</p>

                <p>Well, I want to go to prayer meeting to night, so I must conclude. Give my love
                    to all inquiring friends &amp; accept a portion for yourself. Write soon.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Yours, affectionately from your friend</salute>
