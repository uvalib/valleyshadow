<p class="p10">Dear Father </p>
<p class="p10">I let you know that I am well at present hoping these few lines may find you enjoying similar
     blessings</p>
<p class="p10">Further I let you know that I thought I would write to you once more and see if I could get
     an answer this time I wrote a letter to Cyrus also and got an answer I would very much like to
     know where<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> brother Daniel is I request that you give me directions to him as I will
     write to him Now don't forget to answer soon and give me the directions
     to Dan in Particular </p>
<p class="p10">Further I let you know that our Colonel arrived to our Regiment on Sunday He is a nice young
     man only 25 years old we are not kept as hard anymore as we had when we
     were under the command of the Colonel of the 16<sup>th</sup> Regiment I also let you
     know that moved out of Camp Simmons and into Camp M<sup>c</sup>Clellan a new camp
     about 2 miles from Harrisburg I also let you know that news is very scarce so I must let you
     know that our captain made a nice speech to the company and he was saluted by three cheers of
     every one of the company we don't hardly hear anything of the war all
     that we hear goes in our favor and it is expected that the war don't
     last long any more so I don't think that I or any of us will get into
     battle which gives<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> me great courage and all of our company I have not seen my brother Jonathan since I left that camp which was on last Monday a
     week, but I heard there that they have their uniforms so no more at
     present, hoping to get an answer I also let you know that all of the boys as much as I know Ike
     Beutz and Cyrus Engle are well so much of your</p>
