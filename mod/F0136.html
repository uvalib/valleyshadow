<p class="p10">Sep 30<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Hilton Head Port Royal South Carolina</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 10<sup>th</sup> this morning and i hasten to reply by
     saying i am pleased to hear that you are all in the enjoyment of good health i am still
     enjoying the same blessing although it is very sickly here at the present time about one half ou our Reg't are sick there was one died out of my mess day
     before yesterday so many being sick makes our duty still harder on us the one half of the Reg't
     has got to do what the whole did i think we will have to do the provost guard duty this winter
     as General Mitchel says the Reg't that does the Post guard has to do the provost guard this
     winter they are putting up splendid barracks for the Reg't that remains here to guard this
     place i think that they will attack Savannah and Charleston before
     long but i don't think that our Reg't will go along as we have no field
     Officers and Col Brown the post commander says that the 76<sup>th</sup> is the only
     Reg't fit to guard<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> the post around Hilton Head. we had a warm march from Seabrook on
     Saturday we had been on picket duty a week the mosquitoes almost eat me up post was on top of a
     signal station i could see plenty of rebels on the main land with a large telescope i could see
     Fort Pulaski plainly they telegraphed from the station that i was at
     to Fort Pulaski the oranges are ripe and we are enjoying ourselves with them. I think the
     rebels were nearer to Pennsylvania then they will ever get again that was the only good move
     that Gen McClellan ever made to let the rebels get up there and entrap them i would have liked
     to be there at that time to act guerilla on them i would have shown them what it was to be a
     live guerilla i would have shot every picket on the York County
     hills you were saying that they would spoil your looking but there is no danger of that they
     they will never go back again for they were to badly licked i guess by the time you receive
     this you will have some rabbits caught already i would like to help you to catch some Give my
     respect to all relations and also to acquaintances.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>John J. Miller </i></p>
<p class="p10">PS/ I wish you to have those seed planted they are a very pretty Flower
      if they grow I got them in Beaufort <br> PS/ you had no need of sending any post stamps i had
      enough i forgot to let you know</p>
