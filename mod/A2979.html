<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 7th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">At Home</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">Truly time has seen many days pass &amp; your letter remained unanswered, I
                    have procrastinated until I am ashamed to seat my self to write even to
                    the kindest of friends. One request I will ask of you that is to forgive
                    &amp; forget, I intended writing before I left camp. But after I had a
                    chance for a furlough I thought I would wait Until I
                    got home &amp; then I might come down, But alas it seems that I can never
                    get away from home, I have had very bad health ever since I came home. Some days
                    I suffer with chills &amp; fevers with violent headache &amp; pains in my limbs. Father is very ill with the
                    mumps, though I think he is getting better, It will be my time to have them
                    next, as I never had them, I have had chances to have taken them before, probably I may miss them this time, I won't care if I were so
                    fortunate. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Well I reckon you think, "What have I been doing towards
                    enjoying myself" since I came home, The blues have been my most constant
                    companion I declare I never was as lonesome in my
                    life Time seems to stand still on her wheels, Tom is busy plowing so if I wanted to go anywhere I
                    have no horse to ride. I formed a slight acquaintance
                    with your friend Fannie Seems to be a very nice girl, Kind I think would make a
                    noble coquette, But you must not tell her that I ever
                    thought such a thing, well you know that it is natural for self willed man to
                    form an opinion of the fairer sex on first sight. Well I
                    do not know what to write to interest you I promised to answer the questions that I asked in my
                    last letter in reference to your Cousin Lizzie, But I will wait hoping that I
                    may see you before long. Then I can answer you verbally, I know that I can satisfy you in
                    that way better than by writing I suppose you have already form some idea of my
                    reason for asking you. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I hope that I may soon get my health &amp;
                    be able to help work some on the farm as we will be late with the spring crop I
                    suppose you were surprised to hear of me coming home as
                    you wrote that I won't come home for six months, <i>[deleted: Thare]</i> if I could get a furlough. Therefore
                    don't suppose you are very anxious to see me, But for my part I never was as anxious to see you in my life Though you may think my actions do not
                    prove it, Well you must recollect my health
                    &amp; more I have no way of getting about, Despair not I will be down ere long, And then my
                    long absence will make it a happier meeting, Often you
                    are by my side in my nightly dreams them it seems that
                    I am happy, But I wake up &amp; find it all delusion I must bring this uninteresting letter to a close I hope this may
                    find you enjoying your usual good health if I have written anything in this
                    letter to mar your feeling your pardon I crave</p>
<p class="p10">From your attached friend</p>
