<p class="p10">June 10th 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Mollie</p>
<p class="p10">Your dear letter of the 4th came Safely to hand &amp; gave me much pleasure to hear that you were
                    well. I was extremely sorry I disappointed you on
                    last Saturday. My Business was of Such a Nature I could Not possibly leave if I live I will be down this coming Saturday. My
                    Brother left for home on Yesterday I did not like to give him up he is my favorite Brother. Our friends called us twin Brothers for we were together
                    all the time that he was in Staunton. Magnus read a letter from your <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    Pa on Yesterday they arrived Safely your Pa &amp;
                    Ham were quite well I Suppose Magnus will Send the letter down to your Ma by
                        today's Mail. You Express the wish in your letter
                    that I will Never love money. I must confess that all my energy is aimed at making a fortune the
                    reason I Strive to do so is to make others comfortably &amp; happy &amp; for them to have all the comforts
                    of this world. Some have abused the wealth that God has placed in their hands hording it up it does
                    them no good or their
                    family Such Persons is a Curse to themselves &amp; those that Surround them</p>
<p class="p10">While on the other hand <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> others use their
                    wealth in promoting the Interest of the Community
                    in which they live in releaving the wants of the
                    Poor, &amp; giving their
                    families all the comforts of this world. I can't agree with you that wealth takes away all tender &amp; holy affection from the heart wealth nor
                        anything Else on this Earth can Step in between
                    Husband &amp; wife if they do they have never truly loved Each other</p>
<p class="p10">oh I would like so much to See your dear face it has been
                    so long Since we have Seen Each other it seems as
                        though it has been months
                    Since I have seen you my love. A few more days if God Spares <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> my life
                    I will See you. See the one that I truly &amp; devotedly love one that I
                    love with all my Strenth &amp; Soul. No one Else has a place in my heart but
                    you <i>[deleted: yo]</i> &amp; you only My love</p>
<p class="p10">Mr R Keofe is talking about coming down with me
                    Saturday</p>
<p class="p10">You need not look for <i>[illeg.]</i> me until after
                    Dark I will not leave Staunton until late about Six oclock</p>
<p class="p10">My love to your Ma, love to all my friends. Ella &amp; family are all well. I Send a loving Kiss to you I love you with my
                        whole heart &amp; Soul you &amp; you only.
