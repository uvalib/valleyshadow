    </opener>

    <p>I have been intending for a long time to write to you, but having a very large family to look
     to, and the cares of "public life" too, I have found it difficult hitherto to do so. You and
     Aunt Sally have no doubt heard about that large boy of mine in Albemarle. Mrs Randolph says
     that he is a real monster, but I have <orig reg="never">neve</orig> seen him, and only know him
     as just by reputation. I shall take more interest in "little folks" now than ever, and after
     the war will add a "Blue Beard" to my library. My wife is well and writes to me every two or
     three days. She and the rest of the family have been somewhat disturbed about about Lewis
     Randolph-my brother-in-law-who was at Roanoake Island and was taken prisoner. They have heard
     however within the last few days that he was not wounded, and was upon the Ocean in a Yankee
     vessel destined probably for Fort Monroe or some more northern point. He was First <abbr
      expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> in a company from Albemarle commanded by <abbr
      expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Robert Coles. The latter was killed. He was a very promising
     &amp; fine young man, and was engaged to a daughter of <abbr expan="Doctor">D<hi
       rend="super">r</hi></abbr> Fairfax, formerly of Alexandria &amp; now of Richmond. He was
     engaged only two days before he left Richmond, and has left his intended all he had. His loss
     is the more to be regretted since he is the only<pb n="2"/> child of Gov? Edward Coles of
     Philadelphia who was partial enough to the "Old Dominion" to live in it. The loss of <orig
      reg="Roanoke">Roanoake</orig> Island, Port Royal, Hatteras, Rich Mountain, Forts Henry
     &amp; Donelson are as unaccountable to me as the singular manner in which Virginia's
     favorite General-Robert Lee has been kept in the back-ground, and obscure men put forward. Our
     convention with a unanimity as unparalleled, as that manifested in the Congress that selected
      <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr> Washington, singled out <abbr
      expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr> Lee as if by a presentment of his fitness to
     lead our Armies. <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr> Scott was dismayed at
     it, and yet this chosen leader and <orig reg="favorite">favorate</orig> of his state, owner of
     Arlington Heights, and acquainted with every foot of the District of Columbia was kept merely
     to organize the Army, and then to <unclear>keep</unclear> up Wise Floyd &amp; H.R. Jackson,
     and then to stay the consequences of the disaster at Port Royal, whilst Beauregard from the
     swamps of <orig reg="Louisiana">Louisana</orig>, was sent to operate against the enemy on the
     Potomac, &amp; Wise from the beach of the Ocean to manage the Mountain country, with that
     little Georgia <unclear>Fernin</unclear>-Jackson to man a line of mountain <orig reg="defense"
      >defence</orig> that honest <unclear>farmer</unclear> from the low-lands too could not help
     from being broken, and we have had old "<orig reg="Stonewall">stone wall</orig> Jackson"- a
     native of Harrison County-exasperated to the point of resigning because he could not be allowed
     to operate as he believed he could most effectually in a region so familiar to him. There is
     something about all of these things that is as I have said unaccountable to me. I think<pb
      n="3"/>that there has been mismanagement somewhere, but of course this is just between you
     &amp; me. It will not do to express such opinions except to you, or my father, and knowing
     you to be a great thinker I thought that I would just feel your thoughts about these things to
     see if mine cannot be bettered by it. I have not felt dispirited by the news from Tennessee. I
     think that the losses we have sustained there &amp; at <orig reg="Roanoke">Roanoake</orig>
     and Port Royal are mainly attributable to the advantages the Yankees have over us on the water.
     When we get them out on the land we can whip them. I am glad that our Legislature has at last
     had the good sense to adopt your suggestion about increasing the number of privates in our
     Companies to a hundred. I saw an extract from a letter of yours to a member of the Legislature,
     copied in the Whig a few weeks ago, and the plan you propsed met with universal
      <unclear>affectation</unclear> out here. It ought to have been adopted at the beginning of the
     War, and the Volunteers ought to have been received only for the War. We will now have only
     confusion and delay in bracing up, when this would have been unnecessary if we had started
     right. There are many who will reenlist for the war &amp; many who will have to be forced
     to go- all this from our <del hand="h1">morocratic</del> plan- everybody institutions, the
     prostitution of the ballot box, and the "liberty, equality and fraternity" feeling that has
     been pervading all classes in this county until<pb n="4"/>the government has gone to decay, and
     our new one is contending against the evil effects of bad associations For my part I prefer the
     excesses of power to the excesses of liberty, and when the war is over I hope we will have a
     government that will stand the test of time, and keep the rabble quiet.</p>
    <p>The worst population we have in <abbr expan="Virginia">V<hi rend="super">a</hi></abbr> is
     over here. The journey men stay at home, sell <orig reg="whiskey">whisky</orig> to the
     soldiers, trade horses and groan and complain at their bad lot whenever any service is required
     of the militia. The best ladies-or rather women for there are no ladies here-work, milk the
     cows, set the table, and sweep their houses when their husbands are worth a hundred thousand
     sometimes &amp; the little negro chaps are petted and taken care of in the house with the
     whites. Indeed the Negroes are as good here as their masters &amp; often more polite and
     refined. The idea of such people having anything to say in government. It would ruin any
     country. A good many of the refugees that come over the mountains have come to keep from being
     drafted in the northern Army, and they ought now to be taken &amp; put in the front rank at
     Manassa, for volunteering on our side is the last thing that many of them want to do. They
     would rather trade in horses and whiskey. I have been emptying their whiskey barrels for five
     miles around &amp; shall keep it up. I just <orig reg="sent">send</orig> out one officer
     &amp; men to search houses &amp; destroy all that they find. Some of these rascals have
     been selling to my men at $27 per gallon &amp; <unclear>
      <orig reg="mere">meare</orig>
     </unclear> whiskey and <unclear>
      <orig reg="drinking">dranking</orig>
     </unclear> at that. They have been getting quite uneasy since<pb n="5"/> I commenced the war
     upon them, and I shall put this rascally extortion &amp; illegal <orig reg="traffic"
     >trafic</orig> down if I have to break some of their necks. We are in Winter Quarters in a rich
     little valley called Crab bottom where the head waters of James River &amp; the Potomac
     begin, our stream flows south &amp; the other north and the fountain heads are only a few
     miles apart The proprieters are all grasers, and I learn that they easily make from ten to
     fifteen <orig reg="percent">per cent</orig> on their Capital invested in land and stock clear
     of all expenses. It would be an interesting occupation amongst a different people. Maple sugar
     and Maple syrup are both made to a considerable extent here, and I have some <orig
      reg="everyday">every day</orig> on my table together with fine milk &amp; butter, and then
     we have rice &amp; coffee <orig reg="etc.">&amp;c</orig> &amp; live well enough.
     Our Cabins are all very plain but very comfortable and Old Scott-just like an Old <orig
      reg="Bachelor">Batcheler</orig>- has provided himself with sheets pillows &amp; pillow
     cases and when he went to Powhatan left them in my charge together with his straw mattress so I
     am getting on very well with a good bed, Candles, towels, tin basin &amp; a plenty to eat
     and a little indifferent whiskey which you know I only take occasionally. <abbr expan="Colonel"
      >Col.</abbr> Scott is still sick in Powhatan &amp; will hardly be back I expect before the
     first of April. We will all have to come before the company officers in <unclear>time</unclear>
     for reelection I expect of course to continue in the field, and expect<pb n="6"/> to be elected
     without any difficulty. Most of the <abbr expan="regiment">regimt</abbr> will reenlist I
     expect, and many are ready to do so now The law as regards exempts does not exempt overseers if
     I remember aught. for I saw the bill hastily. This will put me to great inconvenience &amp;
     many others, but we will have to make a great struggle in the spring &amp; I shall not
     grumble. I expect that the war will probably be over by midsummer, unless the English &amp;
     French continue their heartless course of indifference towards us, and even without aid we may
     break down our enemies. Their funds must give out. I hope that all of our friends who can will
     save their tobacco until after the war for it must bring enormous prices. Everything seems to
     be getting high. An ordinary horse-a common plough-horse- will bring even
     <unclear>hire</unclear> a hundred and fifty dollars, and if the government continues to impress
     the teams of the farmers they will be be higher after the war than they are now. Our <abbr
      expan="General">Genl</abbr> Johnson is in Richmond on a short Furlough &amp; <abbr
      expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> John Baldwin is in command on the Mountain. There are about three
     thousand troops out here in all, as much as is necessary now &amp; as many as can be
     supplied at this time. You must give my love to Aunt Sally all the Children and all others at
     Saratoga &amp; Mill-brook, and I would be glad to hear from you as soon as you can
     convieniently write-just mention the name of the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr>-44<hi
