<p class="p10">December 1st</p>
<p class="p10">Buffalo, Va,</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">I have your welcome &amp; dear letter of today. I
                    was thankful to hear of your safe arrival home. how much I did miss you my love
                    &amp; I wished with all My heart that you could have stayed longer with me but while you were riding home I was here
                    thinking of you &amp; loving you. I was disappointed to read in your dear
                    letter that you cannot come Saturday but I know you would <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> enjoy
                        yourself much more to be here when we can be
                    with each other &amp; not so much company to divide our time with. I know I
                    should, my thoughts will be with you my love. I shall miss you sadly it will be
                    the first Sabbath for me to spend at Mountain Palace without your dear society I
                    shall not know what to do with myself without you my love it will seem lonely
                    here in my new home next Sabbath not to see you, but I must wait &amp; if we
                    both live you will come next week the time will be very long to me in passing
                    away. I will love you &amp; think of you every hour &amp; wish I was
                    with you who I love so devotedly. Hamie was <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> delighted when I told
                    him that you had commanded pay from Mr. Stanley for the loss of his whip. he
                    said "you were the business gentleman to please him." I was very sorry to hear
                    of Mr Johnson's &amp; Hoge's loss by fire but glad it did not extend further
                    &amp; others made to suffer. fire is a dangerous element one cannot be too
                    careful with it. My dear papa has been trying to improve the <u>beauty</u> of Mountain Palace since his return. I do not
                    know what you will say about it when you come Have you seen my discarded King
                    Louis the fifteenth just to think that I should discard a King for your sake. I
                    love you more <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
                    than all the crowned heads in the world or their
                    fashions I will not wear anything you do not
                    admire. I love you &amp; love to look well in your dear eyes if I please you
                    I do not care what others think or say of me I wish always to be just as you
                    want me to be to you in dress as well as in disposition. I love to please you
                    &amp; I want you always to give <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> if I wear what you see is not becoming I thank you for it
                    because I know that your taste is fine &amp; artistic &amp; I love you
                    the more for being so. I wish I could see you my love &amp; how I wish you
                    were coming Saturday I long to be with you more than I
                    can tell. I love you with all the deep devotion of my heart &amp; soul,
                    &amp; ever shall while I live You are more to me then all on Earth, one
                    look, one word from you is dearer to me than the praise
                    of all others living. I will write to you it is a sweet pleasure my love to
                    answer your dear letters. All send love. Write soon to me I love you with all my
                    heart &amp; soul. God bless you my love &amp; grant that you may soon
                    come to one who loves &amp; thinks only of you I send you a loving kiss.
                    Goodby my only love. Write soon</p>
