<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">It gives me great satisfaction to recommend the
                    enclosed petition for aid. I have known Banjamin
                    Frazier
                    colored for some time, he is Crippled, and has a
                    large family depending on him for support, he is a sober industrious man but
                    owing to his condition, his labor is not sufficient to clothe his family and I
                    know them to be in a suffering condition. If you have any power to help any, I
                    know him to be entitled to some aid, and hope you will give it your early attention, he has four small Children, I hope you
                    will pardon the Liberty I have taken in addressing you.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jacob H. Wissler<br>Formerly Corp. Company B
                        195 Regiment
                        Pennsylvania Volunteers
                        United States Army</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Should you desire any further information you can
                        address me at Sherando, Augusta County Virginia.</p>
