<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct. 9, 1870</p>
<p class="p10">New York [City]</p>
<p class="p10">My dear, dear Miss Annie.</p>
<p class="p10">Won't you be amazed when you open this, and see from its date that I am still
                    here in this abominable city? When I wrote you last I was on the point of
                    departure for &amp; then in New York to attend to
                    some important business for my brother Frank. On my return I found him here, and
                    he is still with me. He is a large shipper of railroad
                    ties to this city, and is in danger of losing several thousand dollars by the
                    suspension of his Commission Merchant here, and I am remaining to give him such
                    assistance as I can <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to secure himself - and we have been so far
                    successful that I don't think his losses will exceed $950. And we may even save
                    that this week. This unexpected detention in New York
                    has been very annoying to me, and is calling down the wrath of Col. Flournoy
                    upon my devoted head - he wishing me at home &amp; at work on the
                        N.&amp;Y.W.Railroad line.</p>
<p class="p10">I wonder if it provokes any wrath with somebody else of more consequence to me
                    than Colonel Flournoy? I wish I could know whether you
                    feel any <u>disappointment</u> at my non-appearance at the
                    promised time. If I could only hear that <u>you</u> were <u>mad</u>, and <u>unhappy</u> because I
                    had not <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>returned, it would make me as happy as a lord - for then I
                    should feel sure that I had fond a little place at least in your heart. But if
                    you don't care <u>when</u> I come, or <u>whether</u> I <u>even</u> come, it would worry me more
                    than all these annoying perplexing delays possibly can do. I have had no reply
                    to my last letter sent up to me from Richmond, though my letters are forwarded
                    every day. I can only account for this from the interruptions of our mail, that
                    the dreadful freshet has caused. I shall hope from day to day for a letter till
                    I get away. In addition to my brother Frank's claims upon me you will see from
                    an enclosed advertisement that <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>my company business is also engaging
                    much of my time. We have not yet raised <u>all</u> the
                    capital we want, and I am working diligently to get it. How I wish I was a rich
                    man and free from all business cares that isolate me from those I love. I have
                    not even seen my children with the exception of one single night since the 1<sup>st</sup> of last May. My daughters are out of all patience with
                    me at this long separation - and I don't wonder at it. They are still in the
                    Valley waiting my return to Richmond. I have not yet confided to them fully my
                    hopes and purposes in Mecklenburg. I cannot do so on paper as I wish. I must
                    have them by my side &amp; my arms around them when I tell them what
                    happiness I believe is store for <u>us</u>
                    <u>all</u> if my hopes can be realized.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>If you see the Richmond Whig you will see there a letter of mine
                    copied from the New York Herald last week in regard to
                    aid for our suffering people along the James &amp; Shenandoah. In the
                    engrossing cares of personal &amp; public business here, my heart is in our
                    dear old state, and the great distress of so many I feel calls upon me to do
                    what I can to assist them. Already my letter has been the means of sending a
                    some thousands of dollars to Governor Walker to buy
                    provisions. Dreadful as the calamity has been it is a great relief to know that
                    it has not reached <u>your</u> part of the state.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>My own immediate family are considerable losers. My brothers are
                    damaged not less than $2000. And my old father, near 80 has had all his corn
                    crop destroyed, besides other losses. And many of my nearest friends have been
                    nearly ruined. This will spread and general distress has for over a week
                    occupied so much of my thought that I have felt it was almost wicked to think
                    only of my own individual happiness as I had been doing ever since I parted from
                    you. And I have therefore spent several evenings in writing letters to others
                    instead of to you, to give them such comfort as I could. <br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br> What a
                    relief and what a happiness it would be if I could tonight transport myself to
                    your guest house and there spend a week with you that might decide the whole
                    future of my life. But I cannot do it, nor can I for a day or two decide <u>when</u> I will "depart hence."</p>
<p class="p10">Of one thing be assured that nothing but the most dire necessity, and
                    uncontrollable circumstances could have kept me away from you so long. Although
                    only about 6 weeks since we parted, it seems to me a year. And when I <u>now</u> look forward to our meeting the uncertain number
                    of <u>days</u> intervening, seem like so many months.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br>My detention here has been so long - and so much beyond what I
                    expected that I have been ashamed to write to "Sister Lou" till I could say "I
                    am off tonight for Virginia." Bless her dear, good heart, when I do write it
                    shall be a letter that will compensate for this apparent neglect. Please when
                    you write give her my love &amp; tell her why I have not written her. Now my
                    little darling, puzzling sweetheart, goodbye once more. Making love to you on
                    paper is "loves labor lost." You are unmovable &amp; imperturbable. Well
                    I'll try another way soon. With kindest messages to all</p>
<p class="p10">I am as ever devotedly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
<p class="p10">Reply to Richmond, as I am sure I will be there
                    soon.</p>
