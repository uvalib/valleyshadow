<p class="p10">Sept. 13th 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">Dear friend</p>
<p class="p10">I seat my self this morning for the purpose of dropping you a few lines. Yesterday the 12th we were on Picket &amp; the enemy's
                    cavalry attacked us. And I am sorry to inform you
                    that your brother was taken prisoner, also Sargt
                    Hays, James Trotter, Samuel A. Lightner and James Hutcheson, we were on picket
                    at Waidsville on the Occoquon river one &amp; a
                    half miles from Brucetown; only thirty men of the 5th Regt was there a very small force to contend with two brigades of Cavalry, We held them in check
                    for about three quarters of an hour. When about two Hundred charged across the
                    ford getting into our rear, we all clumped together
                    &amp; fell back about two Hundred yards, When the cavalry that had got in our rear charged us calling loudly on us to surrender, But the little band heeded them
                    not but <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>continued pouring volley after
                    volley into their
                    midst, almost every shot taking
                    effect. one charged up within six or eight yards of me whirling his sword around
                    one of company D who threw down his gun &amp; surrendered, he then called on me to surrender, the boys kept hollering to me to shoot him but unfortunatly I had
                    just shot out at the bulk when he rode up I pretended to
                    have my gun loaded &amp; ready to shoot him if he moved. Several of the boys
                    fired at him &amp; the balls coming so unpleasantly near him he whirled his horse &amp; made tracks we soon
                        perceived we were getting them demoralized &amp; we charged them, driving them
                    from our front, we hadn't got more than three Hundred
                    yds when they
                    were reinforced &amp; charged us again in which our boys ware taken. They
                    were trying to get to a small bunch of timber; seeing
                    they could not reach in time they whirled &amp; fired into <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the
                    advancing foe &amp; kept loading firing until
                    they
                    wer all mixed up with the foe, Seeing thay were overpowered &amp; a further attempt to whip the
                        enemy
                    useless, they surrendered.
                    Several of our boys seen them going back under guard, all of us that made for a
                    deep ravine got out safe, one overtook little George Hutchison just as he got to
                    the ravine &amp; ordered him to surrender George said he was almost scared
                    to death at the old sword whizzing around his head but he jumped into the brush
                    &amp; shot the Yank dead off his horse, our loss in
                    killed &amp; wounded was very light One of Comp. H was mortally wounded
                    &amp; died in the evening his name was
                    Strausburg, a brother to the Strausburg in our band. One of Comp K. received a flesh wound in the arm. Our loss was the
                        heaviest in prisoners. Some twelve or fifteen from the regt. The enemy mostly used<i>[deleted: e]</i>
                    their sabers I am certain they
                    didn't
                    lose less than forty in killed &amp; wounded. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Jake was enjoying very good health I hope he may meet with kind
                    friends &amp; mild treatment also the rest of our unfortunate friends. Again
                    we are left without an officer in our Comp. It is reported that Sam Hays is on
                    his way down to the Comp. I think the rest of Comp. E will have to go to fort
                    delaware to recruit, we have Eleven here yet &amp; I
                    am sure we can whip twice that number of Yanks. My health is very good &amp; hope this may
                    find you enjoying the same. There has been a great deal
                    of wet weather down here It has been raining all morning
                    this is a very cold rain. It will not be very long until we will need our over
                    coats. I heard from both of my Brothers C is at Camp Elmira New York &amp; J
                    at the hospital in Baltimore J can begin to use his arm &amp; is enjoying
                    good health, I must close write soon. May heavens richest blessings shower
                    around thee. My love to all,</p>
<p class="p10">From one that think of thee often &amp; loves thee devotedly</p>
