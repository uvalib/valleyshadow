<p class="p10">October 28 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Monterey<br>Highland County
                            Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I will State to you that since I was at your office in Staunton I have returned
                    to my house in Highland and have gotten into a right Serious difficulty which I
                    will State. Some of the facts. My Brother and Myself were attacked on the road by Some Rebels who threw Rocks at us and
                    pursued us to the house and Commenced an attack upon
                    us there. They broke
                    open windows threw rocks into the house. They kept up
                    the attack for some time hurraying for Rebels and
                    Cursing yankees. My Brother was badly injured from being struck in the face with
                    a Stone. One other man and Myself were Slightly injured the
                    <i>[unclear: dips]</i>: an other union mans house was Stoned the Same night we
                    got a warrant and had one man by the name of Ratcliff arrested he said the Reason why we were treated So was because we
                    were claimed Radicals he gave bail for his appearance at
                    Court but I have no idea that he will be punished and
                    him and others I understand have been making Threats against union men. I wish
                    to know of you if we Cant get some protection by the Military. I think after
                    having Soldiered for the Union I deserve protection
                    in it. I wish you to write to me immediately and
                    let me Know what to do. I Think that I am well able to prove that David Hicks was engaged in this thing the man that you saved
                    from punishment last summer he is now Threatening union men.</p>
<p class="p10">I am able to prove to you that <i>[deleted: the]</i> he is nor never has been
                    a loyal man and Charges against him is Correct and he never was employed by the
                    government and I advise you to let the civil law have its
                    affect upon him. I am able to Substantiate what I have Said in this letter by
                    Reliable men. Please write immediately and let me
                    know what to do </p>
<p class="p10">yours truly</p>
