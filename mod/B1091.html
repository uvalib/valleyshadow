<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">February 8 1867</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">In my examination befor Captain
                    McDonnell, in the case of charges against F. S.
                    Tukey Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau at this
                    place, I neglected to say that, at the time Lieutenant
                    Cook was relieved several Freedmen in conversation about a petition then in
                    circulation for the restating of Lieutenant Cook told
                    me that they had no objection to Mr Tukey, what ever one, (Reverend Ephraim Lawson) told me that he was opposed to
                    the thing, that Mr Tukey had always been kind to the colored people and that he
                    had shown a great deal of interest in the School for Freedmen &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">I will also say that I repeatedly heard that while Lieutenant Cook was here as an officer, he spent a great deal of his time
                        <i>[added: in business hours]</i> in the Billiard Saloon
                    in company with citizens who usually frequent such places of amusement.</p>
<p class="p10">William Howard a freedman, who lived with me and was a scholar in the School,
                    quit, giving to me as a reason that the Teachers (except Mrs. Dunn) were
                    inattentive and that consequently he was not learning -- he is about 17 years of
                    age, and very sprightly.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H. Risk</i></p>
