<p class="p10">August, 24th, 1857</p>
<p class="p10">Poplar Hill</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend Mary</p>
<p class="p10">I cannot see why I should set and stitch away all day and neglect my good friends all of
     them, when I have no <u>little</u>
     <u>ones</u> and indeed yet without the first encumbrance a <u>husband</u> glad to still to give you this bit of
     information. I say I cannot see why I should be so energetic and economizing every moment of my
     time to make a <u>fortune</u> when I can take nothing with me, and have
     enough to do <i>[illeg.]</i> whilst here. With this consideration the sewing is laid aside and
     I resume this pen once more</p>
<p class="p10">I have been doing but little writing of late and really It is a
      task for me now. "Procrastination is my besetting sin" Before I
     proceed to <i>[illeg.]</i>, I must thank you for your good and highly prized communication
     which reached me this day week, and offer an apology for my remissness.</p>
<p class="p10">I did not think you <u>insane</u> when you said you expected a reply to
     the note you sent me by Josie I undoubtedly would have looked, "Do unto others as you would
     have them do unto you." --This maxim I endeavor to keep indelibly stamped upon my
     memory.---------</p>
<p class="p10">The reason Mary Anna I did not answer that note was I heard that you intend sending me a
     letter which kept me looking for weeks, "Long looked for come at last" <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Josie is not
     at home this afternoon, gone to that "Twisted Gap" Do you rember how you would repeat this
     after me when here? Oh! those days I think of them often and live them over in imagination. The
     Pic-nic the strange and quickly manufactured horse which is this moment in demand for I am <u>
      literally
     </u> out of snuff and know not where to go or what to do. "Mary Anna let us have a Dipp"
     "Well" and here would come the <u>old thing</u> slipping up to the tub, what
     pleasure that was! how strange this is <i>[unclear: corenlated]</i> to strengthen the links of
     affection and it is evidently the case.</p>
<p class="p10">Yes Mary I love you very much a great deal more you have any Idea,
     think of you often and wish so much to be with you, and do Mary intend spending a good long
     time with you all when I go down again. I have much to write you, and Oh! that we could speak
     face to face. I am in truth almost dead with the blues this evening and I can't tell why it is--------I am looking this evening for a letter from you know who I
     love best of all, <u>Hilder</u> and this will cheer my drooping spirits-----</p>
<p class="p10">Here comes Joe creeping along just as If I wasn't all anxiety for
     this letter. I am revived enough from a terrible shock, and take this pen up again, "Where is
     my Hilder letter Joe" "None come" My soul, almost <u>swearing</u>, "but here
     is one from Fannie it will fill the disappointment" Not so at all, It is a <u>poor</u>
     <u>substitute</u>. Well well one trouble never comes alone. I am sad oh!
     worse than <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> ever no letter from Hilder, can It be he has forgotten <u>m</u>e? Am I, <u>one who loves fondly</u>, but forgotten
     and forsaken by <u>h</u>im? Oh! no this cannot be! How reluctantly hope
     leaves the human heart. Dont think gone entirely deranged.</p>
<p class="p10">Mary this brings to mind a mistake that you are labouring under. I will endeavor to remove
     any <u>person</u> or <u>persons</u> that informed <u>you</u> that I had captivated <u>Mr Clippinger</u> are
      <u>grandly</u>
     <u>mistaken</u>. <u>Pledge</u> you my word I have not
     seen <u>Mr C</u> for five weeks This looks much like captivation. If <u>yo</u>u are a <u>fri</u>end of <u>min</u>e you will set your foot right on this now You believe me I
     know. I think <u>I</u>
     <u>a</u>m <u>scandalized</u> most shamefully, Tho Mary
     none of this I intend for you</p>
<p class="p10">Mr R your friend and minister preached for us on last Sabbath week <u>and
      did well</u>. He did not <u>condescend</u> to call and see us "<u>Amen</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Our quarterly meeting commences the 5th of September Saturday
     week. In few words let me say I will look for you and Kennie <u>both</u> or
     one anyway to attend it Come do I will look - Dont disappoint us - Let me hear by mail whether
     you will come, nothing to prevent one If not both.</p>
<p class="p10">I was in Solon one day and Sunday as it was If I had not had company and the children to take
     care of I would have gone over though looked for you and that good
     sister of yours every moment, and was obliged to return without one look at you. I was sorry and disappointed<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">The evening has passed and night is here. Josie, Willie, and myself are seated around this
     table. Josie writing to her friend Mr Ewan, Willie reading and I am going to try and finish this imperfect letter --I had to take a good cry this eveing and now my
     heart feels relieved. Is there any one like me? "Even in laughter
     the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness"--I laugh many times when I feel
     like crying, "every heart knoweth his own bitterness"--For every smile a tear with me.
     sometimes I wish I could never laugh I have naturally a desponding disposition and I know I
     cherish this feeling too much, and feel it's no use to try to change nature. I wish I was in
     Heaven, I long to leave this world. I feel less attached to the world and worldly pleasures
     every day - I must make an effort to be a better girl You agree with me dont you? We have been attending a meeting for two days, only a
     mile from here. I think much good will be done. I did not feel like going out tonight I wish you were here tonight I feel
     as If a little chat with you would do me good</p>
<p class="p10">How is Mattie and all? When you see her tell her the dress is done, and I come across some
     more of dear little Idea's clothes since she left will send them all <i>[unclear: home]</i>
     the first opportunity. my love to her and say to her that I still feel indignant towards her
     for taking my little girl from me. I had to cry after Idea left when twilight come something
     was missing and I had no little dear pet to undress rock and sing to sleep.</p>
<p class="p10">Last though not least, you say there is some talk of a company going to Weyers Cave. I <u>will</u>
     <u>certainly</u> accompany you, If you will let me know in time, and <u>wish</u>
     <u>my</u>
     <u>company</u>. Dont do as we all did about the Bridge trip fall through.
     Persevere to the end <u>I am</u> so anxious, and have said positively I will
     never accede to any arrangements they see proper to make for another
     trip any where. Just let me know in time and I'll go. In three weeks from now will suit me well
     and a pleasant time for a trip -- That is If this time will suit you all - our meeting will be
     the present and only obstacle with me.</p>
<p class="p10">Cousin Lavenia sends much love to you she frequently speaks of you affectionately. My love to
     your Ma, Pa Kennie Ella and all the rest. Willie has this moment left the room walking
     backwards telling me to say this that and the other for him, sends his love and <u>respects</u>
     <u>to</u>
     <i>[illeg.]</i>, and positively declares you shall never complain of his passing without
     calling If he is in the <u>
      Steam cars
     </u>.</p>
<p class="p10">I must stop for want of space. I am like the boy, "when I get to going I cant
     stop"---------Write soon as you can tell me all, Particularly all about the trip when you think
     you will go and If you and Kennie will come to the meeting. come do, Kiss dear Ken for me I
     love her very much and your Ma too. Ma seems to think the Music Box will become rusted If you
     dont soon return to Poplar Hill I often look at it and laugh and
     think of poor Mary Anna--</p>
<p class="p10">With affection fond and true<br></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Ella</i></p>
<p class="p10">Good morning Dear Mary Goodness Isnt it cold A fire I would have If it
      did'nt look so bad Though a lovely day, melancholy season is coming -- I am feeling quite
      badly This morning can hardly sit up, enjoying <u>splendid</u>
      <u>music</u>, Truly yours Ella<br>Has your Ma gone to Page yet? I had
      intend sending you the pattern by Mattie and forgot it. Do you Dip yet? I do and got out the
      good stuff this evening and Joe and I both are looking <u>Mad</u> Let no
      one read my <u>letters</u>
      <u>mind</u> - If you do I wont write to you any more Good bye Affectionately
      <u>Ella</u></p>
