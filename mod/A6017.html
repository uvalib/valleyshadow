<p class="p10">Dear Lissa</p>
<p class="p10">As I had forgot to let you know that Joseph Grass was killed at the fight at Gettysburg. I
     first heard that he was only wounded but since I have that he was killed. I want you to show
     this to William Grass. All the creek boys is well. I don't know where James Padgett is. He came
     to us when we was at Winchester and they kept him with the Regiment until we got to
     Shepherdstown and then I don't know where he went. We have marching orders. They have taken all
     the guards in from peoples houses...</p>
