<p class="p11"><b>January, 1859
      
     </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>1. Sat.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">It rained all last night &amp; this morning till 10 O'clock, then cleared off cool. God
       in his abundant energy has spared the lives of myself &amp; family to see the Beginning
       of another year, in circumstances of great mercy. My own health now may be said to be good.
       It has been very imperfect for several months, &amp; that distressing eruption on my back
       &amp; especially on my <u>legs</u> has harassed me. But Providentially
       I was led to use Allum Water &amp; rain water &amp; small doses of Salts &amp; it
       has entirely disappeared. In other respects I am as well as a man of my age can expect to be.
       Preaching fatigues me but little.</p><p class="p10">M<sup>rs</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Farland enjoys remarkably good health
       &amp; is a great blessing to me. Mary Lewis's health is also good. Frank very well
       &amp; Mary Louise improving -- seems to be in <u>good health</u>, very
       cheerful &amp; can walk briskly on her crutches. The <u>"curve"</u> in
       her spine seems to be diminishing &amp; the abscess to be discharging less.</p><p class="p10">Robert &amp; James are at home &amp; have undertaken to carry on the farm without
       my hiring a man by the year. They behave well &amp; are a great comfort to me. Francis is
       in Washington City -- says he is reporting the proceedings of the Senate of the U.S.United States I know not what for. I feel more anxious about him than any of my
       Children, for he is in no regular employment that will last.</p><p class="p10">New Year's day continued.<br>Betsey &amp; D<sup>r</sup>
       Humphreys have been perplexed about a change of Residence. They have
       concluded to remove from Marion, in Lonyth Co.County &amp; board at a
        M<sup>r</sup> Shannon's on the Turnpike from Wythevile to [blank space] But they
       &amp; their children are well.</p><p class="p10">Thus we have numerous mercies for which to be grateful. But the subject of my greatest
       anxiety is about the Spiritual interests of my Sons. None of them are Professors of Religion;
       &amp; although two years ago Francis professed conversion in Harrisonburg, I have great
       fears about him.</p><p class="p10">May God, for Christ's sake grant me the joy of seeing them, before I die the devoted
       Disciples of Jesus Christ. And O, may He pour out his Spirit on my Charge. This I desire
       above every thing earthly.</p><p class="p10">Roxa Bent is now with us.</p><p class="p10">Today we are all at home and I am in my quiet pleasant study preparing to preach a New Year
       Sermon.</p></p>

        Congregation. but not with as much liberty
       as I sometimes have. Subject the constraining influence of the Love of Christ.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The morning mild. I took the opportunity of visiting some sick persons. Rode on horseback
       to William Cochrans. His son William has
       been very ill with Pleurisy &amp; Pneumonia but is recovering. His daughter Margaret is also very feeble &amp; in a strange way. Called at M<sup>r</sup> Merritt's, &amp; visited M<sup>rs</sup> Via, who is very
       low &amp; certainly cannot live long. Came home very much fatigued.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Jan. 8. Sat. continued</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This is my Birthday. This night I have completed my 71 year &amp; blessed be God I am
       in tolerable health &amp; crowned with his mercies. Of late I find my strength has
       declined, but I think it is the effect of imperfect health. If that were restored to its
       usual state (&amp; it is nearly so) I think my strength would be all I could expect at my
       age. I find I cannot bear fatigue or exposure as I once did.</p><p class="p10">I hear that some of the most judicious of my people are saying that they do not see that I
       am at all failing in my preaching. May God grant me strength of body &amp; vigor of mind &amp; fervor of Piety to
       preach <u>Christ</u> as long as it will be for his glory &amp; the
       edification of the Church. Amen.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 4. Fr. continued</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Received a letter from Francis.</p><p class="p10">M<sup>r</sup> R. Tate Wallace &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Pilson came
       &amp; spent several hours with us. They informed me that several friends of mine had
       agreed to raise a sum of money for me to enable me to buy a pair of horses &amp; they
       paid me in cash <u>Three Hundred Dollars</u> $300.00 of which M<sup>r</sup> James Bumgarner gave his Check for <u>$100</u>.</p><p class="p10">This is by far the largest present I ever received, &amp; it was entirely unexpected.
       And it seems that M<sup>r</sup> Bumgarner proposed that he would give $100. if the
        Congregation would give another hundred,
       but they thought it was too little for the purpose &amp; resolved to raise $200. more.</p><p class="p10">I regard this as a wonderful event. I need good horses indeed, but I could have managed
       with economy to have bought them. But God has directed this, I trust, to increase the
       affection between me &amp; my people. It encourages me to hope that there is a feeling
       towards me, that by God's blessing may greatly increase my usefulness. I pray that fruit may
       abound to their account. God knows I have coveted no man's silver or gold, &amp; yet I do
       esteem this gift more than I would double the sum from any other source.</p><p class="p10">(continued.) I marvel particularly that M<sup>r</sup> Bumgarner -- not a pious
       man, should be foremost in this matter, &amp; give so much. And I learn he said he gave
       it as cheerfully as he ever sat down to eat his dinner. O, that God would make me the
       instrument in his Salvation.</p></p>

       he had allowed them temporarily to use.</p><p class="p10">Then perhaps two months after -- on the 12 of September I think
       I went to see her, to satisfy her if possible that she had just cause of complaint &amp;
       to induce her to return to Church. She introduced the subject when she &amp; I were alone
       at the dinner table <br><br>[<i>page 15</i>]<br> and became much excited &amp; spoke so of Colonel Tate &amp; how badly they were treated that I thought it my
       duty to Say M<sup>rs</sup> Antrim You are not manifesting a Christian Spirit on
       this subject; why on this principle you would not be willing to go to heaven unless you got a
       high seat there. Meaning that if she would not agree to go &amp; worship God in his house
       unless she got a choice seat there, the same principle would lead to the result I named. For
       she told me in so many words "we are not going to sit <u>any where</u>."
       With very much more to the same purpose.</p><p class="p10">She was greatly offended at my plainness, and now insists that she said nothing to provoke
       my reproof, and charges me with saying other things which I never thought of.</p><p class="p10">M<sup>r</sup> Antrim &amp; Alexander Brownlee &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Merritt were present today. I opened the meeting with prayer, but very soon it was manifest
       that such was her spirit that <u>I</u> could
       accomplish nothing. Therefore after saying what I could &amp; seeing no hope of doing any
       good I left her with M<sup>r</sup> Merritt &amp; M<sup>r</sup>
       Brownlee. There was not the least evidence of a Christian Spirit in this whole interview.

<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>7. Sat.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Mild &amp; pleasant. Engaged as yesterday. During a debate I rose to speak &amp;
       had the floor clearly-but Reverend Peyton Harrison rose after me
       &amp; went on in his loud manner, regardless of me-I stood till he was done &amp;
       then said My brother Harrison goes on without noticing any one. This produced a smile. But
       after the Assembly adjourned he came by
       where I was, &amp; said I had publicly insulted him,
       &amp; he was not going to suffer it; &amp; that he was aware of my course towards him
       heretofore. I said, why what does this mean Brother H. I intended no
       insult, but this is your habit in the Judicatories to begin &amp; go on, no matter who
       has the floor. He denied it. (D<sup>r</sup>. Ramsey &amp; D<sup>r</sup>. William Brown sustain me in this.) I said I never in all my
       life intentionally wounded the feelings of any brother. Well, he said you have wounded mine.
       I said I must have an explanation of this. <br><br>[<i>page 170</i>]<br> He said I will give it some time. We
       then parted. I related the matter to D<sup>r</sup>. Ramsey, who expressed wonder
       that offense should have been taken.</p><p class="p10">In the evening I went to consult D<sup>r</sup>. Brown. When I had finished my
       statement of the affair to him, M<sup>r</sup> Harrison came into his room on an
       errand. I insisted that he should sit down, &amp; he did so after some hesitation. I then
       with much feeling, protested that I had no intention of wounding his feelings, &amp; then
       asked him what he referred to in my former conduct toward him. He said it was a letter I had
       written to the Board of Education, when he was talked of to succeed D<sup>r</sup>.
       Van Rensselaer, that it had been industriously circulated, &amp; that although he did not
       want the office, the letter had defeated his election. That I had represented him as old=66
       when he was only 59 &amp; that he was feeble. He had not seen the letter, but understood
       that I had spoken of him kindly which he regarded as so much the worse. I said I had very
       much forgotten the contents of my letter, but it was written conscientiously. I thought he
       was then unable to preach which I <br><br>[<i>page 171</i>]<br> regarded as a serious disqualification for
       the office. He said he was able to preach at that time. I said, if he wished it, I would
       incidentally bring the matter up in the Assembly &amp; explain. He said, No, he did not
       wish it-that he was satisfied; &amp; so the matter ended.</p><p class="p10">It is painful to me to think that he has been entertaining those feelings towards me in
       regard to that letter, altogether undeserved &amp; yet meeting me everywhere just as
       formerly. He is a man to whom I have never had an unkind feeling, but the sincerest
       friendship. Whom can I confide in?</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Day cloudy, damp and gloomy. I am better than yesterday, but not well. God in Mercy has
       permitted me to see another New Year in the flesh, very probably the last. And although I am
       very infirm &amp; suffer a good deal, I have numerous mercies for which I here record my
       fervent gratitude to God.</p><p class="p10">I have also much to be thankful for in regard to my family. My dear wife enjoys pretty good
       health. My son Francis is still in Richmond &amp; connected with the Newspaper
       Press-health not very good. James is at home, managing the farm-in good health &amp; I
       hope will be a great comfort to us.</p><p class="p10">Mary Lewis also at home in pretty good health, except occasionally her nervous system
       becomes disordered. Frank enjoys fine health &amp; goes to school to Miss Pringle at Mint
       Spring. Mary Lou is now apparently suffering nothing from her spinal affection &amp; is
       going to the Augusta Female Seminary in Staunton. D<sup>r</sup>. Humphreys
       &amp; his children are well.</p><p class="p10">Wrote to General Patterson &amp; Reverend D<sup>r</sup>. Joseph Smith.</p></p>

       agonizing-they were less so at the last. What a tide of reflection rush through my mind
       embracing the whole history of the deceased. What numerous anxieties about him from his
       birth, what care, what watchfulness, what labor &amp; expense
       &amp; how many anxious prayers. And now the whole is closed up for the Judgment.</p><p class="p10">I deeply regret that he was so influenced as to join the Campbell Church in Richmond,

       wished. The body was then buried in the presence of a large number of people. I feel grateful

       acceptable services to us.</p><p class="p10">Out of Eight children we have but two left. But, blessed be God, those which have died in

       humour which produced the Eruption now occasions a very troublesome itching in my back. I am
       gaining strength but my lungs are so liable to Bronchitis that I dare not expose myself at
       all in a cold atmosphere. During the last year, I have regularly taken my breakfast in bed
       with the exception of perhaps a dozen times.</p><p class="p10">My wife &amp; Daughter &amp; Son James &amp; Mary's children enjoy their usual
       health. D<sup>r</sup>. Humphries &amp; his children who are now here enjoy
       good health. For all this I would render most hearty thanks to the God of mercy.</p><p class="p10">On the 21<sup>st</sup> of July last my poor Son Francis was taken from us but
       blessed be God, we have hope in his death. Thus we are becoming very few on earth</p><p class="p10">I have preached very little the last year from sickness, &amp; I fear shall be able to
       preach but little more. The Congregation must have another Pastor.</p></p>
