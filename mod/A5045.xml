                <p>I now seat myself to inform you that I received your kind and unexpected but by
                    no means unwelcome letter from the hand of Mr. Kern on Friday evening and was
                    truly glad to hear from you I am sorry to say that I had almost forgotten that I
                    had a cousin in the world. I hope that you will forgive my negligence and I will
                    try to do better in the future. I am happy to inform you that I am now enjoying
                    good health since I have been in camp. We have good times here now. All are in
                    good spirits, have plenty to eat and good cabins to stay in and not much to do.
                    The Guard duty is not very heavy now. We are only required to furnish Four men
                    for guard per day. I have not seen cousin John Baylor since I received your
                    letter but he is well and looks as fat as a "pig." James Cook is well he was in
                    our cabin this morning but I did not see him. Lewis Dull is well and in good
                    spirits he sends his respects to you all. He is a good soldier and a good
                    companion but not worth a cent to "cook," but it would not do to tell him so.
                        <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> John Lambert has not returned to camp
                    yet. I have not heard from him for some time. Our men are nearly all here now.</p>

                <p><pb n="2"/>While I was writing the other side, Corporal Zimmerman came into the
                    captains cabin and drew a pint of "Summerdean" and of course for politeness I
                    did not refuse to taste but you need not be uneasy about me getting <orig
                        reg="tight">tite</orig> for I do abhor a drunken man. "Liquor" demands an
                    enormous price here now and there is a great quantity of it used here.</p>

                <p>There is nothing more that I can think of that would be of interest to you
                    therefore I shall come to a close. Give my love to all inquiring friends and a
                    portion to yourself. Write soon, Direct your letter to -</p>
