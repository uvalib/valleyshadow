                    at the present term of our Circuit Court to Three years confinement in the
                    Penitentiary - The petition which she will lay before you sets forth, so far as

                    Painter, one of the gang who for many years have infested the South bottom in
                    Rockbridge, he has not been long enough a resident of this section to have
                    acquired a <abbr expan="general">Genl</abbr> character - His testimony was <orig
                        reg="very">verry</orig> remarkable to say the least of it. He said he was
                    sleeping in the same room with two other persons, one of them in the same bed
                    with him all men <unclear>grown</unclear> &amp; <unclear>stout</unclear>
                    there were other men sleeping in the same house all in the employment of the man
                    of the house - That after 12 o'clock at night he went out in his night <pb n="2"
                    /> clothes to see about the horses of which he had the care, upon going out of
                    the house he saw a free negro man whom he knew very well coming out of the <orig
                        reg="smokehouse">Smoke house</orig>, with a piece of bacon in his hand -
                    that he stood still &amp; presently the negro returned &amp; went again
                    into the <orig reg="smokehouse">Smoke house</orig> &amp; carried off another
                    piece of bacon that he then saw the negro &amp; M<hi rend="super"
                    >c</hi>Mullen come out from behind the <orig reg="smokehouse">Smoke house</orig>
                    with each of them a bag of bacon upon their backs - during all of this time the
                    witness said he stood perfectly still &amp; did not make any noise <del
                        hand="h1">Th</del> he then returned to his bed and said nothing to any of
                    his fellow lodgers - the next morning his employer missed his bacon - but now
                    Painter remained as dumb as an oyster upon the subject of his midnight discovery
                    - &amp; never said <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> about it for eight
                    days although his employer was making every effort to discover the thief.</p>

                <p>McMullen I have known for several years - &amp; he has always borne the
                    character of an honest man of steady habits &amp; very industrious <pb n="3"
                    /> His family are poor but of proverbial honesty in Bath County - You no doubt
                    remember M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Mullen as the driver of the stage from
                    Lexington to Goschen for several years &amp; know <orig reg="something">some
                        thing</orig> of his character - Knowing him as well as I do - I <orig
                        reg="cannot">can not</orig> believe him Guilty of the charge preferred
                    against him by Painter - I hope and <unclear>trust</unclear> you may grant the
                    prayer of his poor wife, and believe that the act will not in any degree weaken
                    other sanctions of our criminal code</p>
