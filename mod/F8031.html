<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Honorable
                        Simon Cameron</p>
<p class="p10">Some of the persons who have been acting with me against McClure have been very
                    urgent on my going to Harrisburg It appears Alex McCullough received a letter from M<u>r</u>
                    Barr giving your views to some extent <i>[unclear: unnerving]</i> McClure
                    &amp; he &amp; some others were <i>[deleted: very]</i> desirous of
                    knowing if I heard from you. I informed them I had not, but expected to see you
                    at Harrisburg shortly some of them are not as prudent or judicious as they might
                    be, my intention was to watch McClure closely &amp; see that he intended to
                    act in good faith to yourself and then assist him in his election at the proper
                    time, Therefore if any person calls to see you before I have an opportunity I
                    would not commit myself for or against McClure but say that you were opposed
                    &amp; willing to give your influence<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>against his nomination but as
                    he is the nominee of the party it might be improper to oppose this election and
                    give a majority in the senate to the <i>[unclear: national]</i> administration,
                    I expect to be at Harrisburg Wednesday evening &amp; will call &amp; see
                    you</p>
<p class="p10">yours truly</p>

                    </i></p>
<p class="p10">I learn some of them intend visiting Harrisburg to gather
                        evidence in the libel Suit between the Valley Spirit &amp; McClure, the
                        attorney Stumbaugh &amp; McCauley who are <i>[illeg.]</i> for the
