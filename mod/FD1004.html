<h4>Franklin County: Diary of William Heyser (1862-1863)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About William Heyser:<br></b>William Heyser was born in Pennsylvania in 1796. A
shopkeeper in Chambersburg's South Ward, Heyser also
supervised his family farm until he sold it in 1862. He
remained in Chambersburg with his wife, adult children, and
grandchildren until his death on November 5, 1863, just after
this diary concludes. His diary provides insight into wartime
life on the Franklin County home front.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>SEPTEMBER 29, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and dry. Death of Matthew Gillan. One of the first
volunteers to meet the call to arms, but remained a short
time. Returned, in worse shape, and declined thereafter. He
was a kind, goodnatured man, and will be missed by his
family.</p><p class="p10">Death of Jacob Oyster, a pillar of the Methodist Church,
and a staunch citizen, much respected. One of our last
citizens of the older generation.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 1862


</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 1</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">John Mull and I visited one of the hospitals of wounded
soldiers in the Academy Building. About 100 of them, mostly
wounded in their lower parts, but some with their arms and
legs off. They are well taken care of and plenty of supplies
for their wants.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 3</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rain, which we need badly. We see untold thousands of
dollars drained from our Treasury by unscrupulous men using
the war to further their personal affairs. We have several
cases in our town that did not get their wealth honestly, but
robbed by men in official stations.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 4</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our town has greatly changed by the events of the war--
business is so good, our small town is taking on a city
appearance of activity. We hear the Rebels plan a retreat from
Staunton. McClelland at present has control of Winchester.
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation denounced in Richmond.
Some here do not think wisely of it as many abolitionists are
so wild they would change our Constitution. Some of the
wounded here are Masons. One who died at the home of Burnet, I
read the Masonic service for his burial. He and several others
then taken to the cars where they will be transported home for
interment. There was quite a number already received, filling
up a car. Quite a rush of females to view the deceased, there
being a glass opening in the box.</p><p class="p10">The crowd at the depot very large, from there to the
hospital, near the jail which I visited to see some
acquaintances, and perhaps offer a little help some way. To
view this brings the war awfully near and deep sympathy for
these poor suffering men.</p><p class="p10">To my farm, find it too dry to plant anything. It will be a
loss this year, for a good crop if there is no immediate rain.
The engines and cars are very busy taking supplies to
McClelland on the Potomac. They are running night and day.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 7</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and pleasant. Every day we hear the sad strains of
marshal music as the hearses pass carrying the dead from some
distant battlefield to be buried at their home. The hearses
are draped with flags and the procession partly military.
Every day the cars bring from 20 to 30 dead through our town.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 8</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Pleasant. Left to visit my mountain land. Saw many turkeys
and partridges, but didn't have my gun.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 10</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rain today. A great saving for the farmers who were facing
a great drought. Business is flourishing in town. The Rebels
are in Mercersburg, and on the way to Chambersburg from St.
Thomas. This evening they entered our town, demanding its
surrender. Some 1500-2000 cavalry, with some artillery. They
immediately took possession of the bank and telegraph office.
Also requisitioned provisions, clothing, etc. as to their
needs. It has all happened so quickly, we all felt safe
knowing the Union Army was in Williamsport, Maryland. The Confederate troops all look
well fed and clothed, and so far, conducted themselves
orderly. They will be busy stripping our stores and gathering
up horses. I have sent my three off with Proctor, I hope they
got away safely. I did not go to bed until after one o'clock,
watching what may happen after all retire. So far, all quiet.
Secreted some of my most valuable papers and went to bed,
slept soundly until morning.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 11</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and pleasant. Rose early and to the square. Saw Major
General Stewart and General Hampden in conference. The stores
were all closed. Broke open Isaac Hutton's shoe store, helped
themselves freely. Then to the depot and confiscated a large
shipment of arms and clothes. Afterwards, set fire to all the
buildings and left town by the Baltimore Pike. They had fired
the building of Wanderlick and Nead County which was used as a storehouse for
government ammunition. The succeeding explosions of shells and
powder was tremendous. The loss must be very great. All the
machinery and present locomotives destroyed at the shops. This
was all the fault of A.H. Lule, superintendent of the railroad shops. He
should have sent the war supplies back to Carlisle, instead of
keeping them here, being warned as early as three o'clock the
past afternoon. However, this saved our stores from being
pillaged as they got enough at the depot. Everybody out on the
streets seeking news.</p><p class="p10">About mid-day, a large scouting party of our troops came
through producing a great sensation.
We hear of another group at Waynesboro, marching towards
Gettysburg hoping to head them off. All in all the invasion
was a very orderly one. The troops were well disciplined and
polite. Not a single house or person injured. They were more
orderly than troops of ours that have passed this way. Outside
of their plundering of Isaac Hutton's shoe store, nothing else
occurred to criticize them. Many people from the country came
into town in search of news and carried home relics of the
Rebel Invasion, as shells, balls, saberparts, parts of muskets, etc. Nearly every man and boy
had some souvenir.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 12</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and pleasant, the Sabbath. All is calm, who would
suspect that so much excitement had prevailed yesterday.
However, there is much apprehension they will return. Some
2,000 troops from Maryland came this morning and encamped outside of town on the
Baltimore Pike. I knew not of their coming and arrival until
this afternoon. At three, attending a religious service at the
Hall among the wounded soldiers. Rev. Bausman conducted the
services.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 13</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy, a little rain. The encamped Rebels have moved on to
Fayetteville, and across the mountain to Cashtown. There they
went South through Emmittsburg and
Monrovia to the mouth of the Monocacy. Thus completely
avoiding the searching Federal forces, and disappeared into
Virginia. Their mission accomplished.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 14</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Pleasant. Out to my farm to ascertain the damage done by
the soldiers. Much fencing gone for fuel, and what corn they
didn't use, tried to burn. Many farmers without horses and at
a loss to do any work. We find no buildings burned or
occupants harmed.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 15</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Much apprehension about the Rebels returning as they have
camped along the Potomac. We can hear cannoning from the
vicinity of Hancock, perhaps some skirmishes.</p><p class="p10">The Rebels had found little at our bank of value, but did
not complain. They were looking mainly for horses. I had
previously sent mine with my man Proctor to Waynesboro, some
16 miles distance, for safekeeping. Many others not as
fortunate as they delayed. They did take eight young colored
men and boys along with them, in spite of their parents
pleading. I fear we will never see them again, unless they can
escape.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 24</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our church has decided on the final adoption of the much
discussed Liturgy as a book to be used in our church and
family worship. I am glad this had been decided, we were much
divided.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 25</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Pleasant. Business at the bank, rode to my farm to inspect
the new seeding. Home early in the evening to do some writing.
Agreeable to the solicitation of Doctor Wilson, an artist, I
sat for my portrait. He noticed some of my landscape work,
which he commended. I suppose my work would improve with
practice, but it is now too late in life to hope for much
proficiency. Some cavalry here this evening, to secure horses
for General McClelland's command.
They hope to find two hundred by tomorrow evening.</p><p class="p10">I fear Lincoln is a tool in the hands of the Abolitionists.
We need a man of Jackson's iron will in our present emergency
to hold our National Government together.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 27</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Our town filling up with drafted men to be sent to
camp for training. Visited a wounded Mason (Captain Miller
Moody from Ohio) who lost one of his legs at Antietam. He is
very low in spirits and much emaciated, his wife and sons are
visiting him. Spent some time with Wilson, the artist.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 28</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and pleasant. We had a sale of the Rebels worn-out
horses, left here by Stewart's cavalry. Spent some time with
Mr. Wilson, the artist.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 29</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Beautiful weather. Out to my farm for inspection of the
seeding. Nearly opposite there is an encampment of the drafted
militia under Colonel George
Wiestling, who is to get them in military trim. They are a raw
set of men. It is hoped to get at least 600,000 men for
another army together to crush this rebellion. Meanwhile our
national debt is staggering, some 640,000,000 dollars. The
expenditure of a million and a quarter a day to keep this war
machine going.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>OCTOBER 30</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Beautiful weather. At the bank, called to see Captain Moody
who is improving, but very weak. Spent most of the afternoon
with Jeremy Wilson, the artist. In the evening, took Captain Moody some fruit. Rev. Bausman
called and stayed until about ten. He feels that I should do
more visiting among the members of our congregation.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>November 1862


</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 1, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Fine weather. Visited Captain Moody who would like some
fresh fish. He is improving. Called then on Barney Minnich, an
old fisherman, to procure some for me. Attended to Sabbath
school and Bible class activities.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 3</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Weather cold and rough. There was quite a change last
night. The sky is overcast with dark clouds and the wind has a
wintry feel. It sighs around the corners as in mid-winter, and
creates a melancholy feeling-for me, it is music. I can sit
for hours and listen to it with pleasure.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 4</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Business good at the bank, we declared a 5% dividend on the
past 6 months business. The stock is $10 above par. We have a
surplus of $42,000.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 5</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cold and rough. At the farm to plant some grapes.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 6</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Captain Moody's condition turns for the worse. I called on
him to discuss the salvation of his soul. Asked Doctors
Richards and Senseny to look in on him, but too late. Sent for
the undertaker. Wife and two small sons very distressed. I do
my best to comfort them.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 8</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Snowing hard, already 5 or 6 inches. Called on Mrs. Moody
to offer some comfort. Assisted her in making preparations for
her trip home with the body. We gave him the last Masonic
Service.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 11</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cold. A rumor that the Rebels were again in Mercersburg,
and marching upon us. Sent everyone into a stampede of
activity, to hide their goods. The rumor proved false. We all
feel those at Washington are doing little to protect its
citizens. Too much in activity by our military leaders. They
seem to not know what to do. The removal of General McClelland of the Army of the
Potomac creates some despair.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 13</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Visited Colonel Weistling at the
camp outside of town. He was much dispirited over
contradictory orders and no equipment. Making little headway
in training his men.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 14</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Beautiful weather.<a href="#heyser1">1</a> How human
it seems. He once knew springtime of his life, his autumn
years are past, now I am in the winter of my years. How all
dies and decays, but to be reborn again.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 16</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Winter has now set in, and everyone changes his living
habits. This is the time of year that brings families closer
together. The great war raging now casts a pall of gloom over
it all.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 20</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cold and rough. Feel unwell, very depressed. I need
something of a change. At the bank until noon. Came home and
gave some directions to Mr. Wilson the artist, who is painting
my deceased daughter, Harriet's portrait from a photograph.
The war news is bad, mostly from the indecision at Washington.
They must play politics first, and then decide the course of
their plottings. Much controversy over McClelland being
relieved of his command. We feel Lincoln but a tool in his
party's hand.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 22</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rough weather. At the bank a few hours. Home to attend to
the painting of my daughter, Hattie, it grows with interest as
he paints it. A most striking likeness. This work affords me
much pleasure. To the farm this afternoon with Mr. Forbes, a
barn builder, perhaps in the spring I will put up one.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 27</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Moderate weather. Decorated the church for Thanksgiving.
The gallery and pillars ornamented with spruce. The pulpit
lamps and walk behind the pulpit beautifully ornamented. Two
flags handsomely draped in the background. The whole effect
enhanced when the gas lights turned on. Our efforts were a
huge success in that all were surprised as well as delighted
with our arrangements.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>NOVEMBER 28</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Snowing. Spent an hour with Doctor Wilson, the artist, who
is doing a piece for a lady in Harrisburg. My old creative
feeling came over me and though it is 40 years since I've
painted, feel I could paint again.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>December 1862


</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 1, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy and unpleasant. Visited a few sick friends.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 4</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Moderate. Rode out to the camp to see Colonel Mikibbon about payment for straw I
furnished. Visited my farm, find one tenant back with his
work. The other progressing well. The camp shall move soon, it
is not a good influence on our local boys. I remember my
associations with camp life in the War of 1812, so know what
these young men go thru.<a href="#heyser2">2</a>
Everybody feels McClelland's removal a great mistake, even the
English newspapers against it.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 5</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Army of Potomac resumes the battle, now before
Fredericksburg. Visited William Jude,
a stocking weaver, to have some made, a very interesting shop
and man.</p><p class="p10">"This afternoon I visited Mr. Jude, an Englishman, who is a
stocking weaver by trade. I went for the purpose of having
some stockings made. The shop is quite a curiosity in its way.
It is not more than six feet square and about six feet high.
The door of entrance is so small that stooping is necessary to
get in. On the right as you enter in the corner, is his loom,
about four feet wide, on the West is a small counter to which
is attached a small vise and some other weaving tools, such as
boards upon which to stretch and put in shape his stockings.
On the South side is his spinning wheel. On the left is his
reels and spools with a couple of small boxes, which I
observed were locked.</p><p class="p10">"On entering his shop, I could scarce refrain the laugh. On
the seat of his weaving loom lay his daily companion, a yellow
striped cat called Peter, who amused himself trying to catch
the spool of yarn while he was weaving.</p><p class="p10">"'How do you do Mr. Heyser. I was wondering if you do not
want some stockings. I weave many a pair for you. Come Peter,
behave yourself' speaking to the cat. 'I'm just weaving these
for a particular old lady, maybe you know her, Mrs. Hare in
the Row.' You mean Mrs. McElhare. 'Oh yes, that's her. She's
stout.' Could you fit you? 'Oh yes. I told her to show me her
foot--faith, said she, will do that and my leg too--if you
want to see it. I had no trouble to get her measure.' I said
to him you must be happy in your palace here. 'Ah,' said he,
'wool is dreadful high, but if you get me the yarn, I weave
then at journeyman's wages, Just 31 cents.'</p><p class="p10">"The shop is a curiosity--truly it is not the size of the
shop or house that makes contentment, this man appears to be
satisfied with his lot, and he is in some respects, like his
shop--he is small, somewhere about five feet, old, and pretty
near worn out. He sits the picture of habit. An old white hat,
with the crown knocked in, and from its looks, might have seen
twenty summers, adorns his head. His coat and other garments
are in keeping with his hat. His pipe would seem to have
consumed a vast amount of the weed, his spectacles too, bear
the stamp of age. While he stopped his loom to converse with
me, his companion, Peter, coiled himself up on his lap to take
his rest. A place doubtless much occupied when his master is
at work. This little shop has a latch outside and inside, and
thus shuts out the world. He is a widower, and although he has
children, seems to be alone.</p><p class="p10">"I feel well compensated for my visit; I have never seen
business done in so small a compass."</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 6</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cold and stormy, with dashes of snow. Have just heard of
the death of John Goteman, a baker by trade and a retailer of
ale. After some years, commenced a small grocery
establishment. After some years of a successful run of
business, amassed considerable property. He was vain of his
possessions, having been nicknamed, Rothchild. With his
increase of property, he grew in dimensions himself, for he
was a great lover of ale. When I last saw him, he was quite
disfigured from its use, a perfect bloat. His wife is equally
defamed from the same cause. Her face wears the appearance of
the full moon, almost twice its usual size and full of
blotches. It would seem impossible that human beings could be
so disfigured by drink. I am told he is almost a petrified
mass, and can scarcely be handled. He is a Lutheran, but paid
little attention to the interests of his soul. His son is
rapidly following in his foot steps.</p><p class="p10">Sitting before my comfortable fire, I reflect on the
miseries of the world, and the less fortunate which causes me
to think of friendships, of which there are very few that are
true ones. Let a man become degraded by no fault of his own,
and see how few recognize him. But let his prosperity become
evident, and he has countless friends.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 7</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy and cold. Feel indisposed, a bad cold, can scarcely
talk. The cold penetrates everywhere. Sorry to miss my Bible
class. I shall remain at home-meditate and write.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 10</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Weather more pleasant. Slept badly last night. My cold still troubles me, cough
much. Jeremy Wilson the artist called, we walked up to Jude's
establishment as he was anxious to see it. I hadn't noticed
before how precarious his chimney was built. Without mortar,
and the stove pipe just stuck in. The movements of his loom
made it all tremble. Wilson thought it quite a curiosity. Came home feeling the worse
for my outing.</p><p class="p10">The war news tells Fredericksburg has been taken. The
Rebels taking up positions behind it. A fearful battle is
shaping up. Reflection on the war and governments that control
them, and that all lose in the end. The poor victims killed,
giving the most.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 15</b></p>

sore from coughing.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>DECEMBER 22</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy and rough. Buried John Ligget and James Kirby today.
News from Washington very perplexing, opinions so conflicting
nothing gets resolved. This war has opened up a system of
speculation never seen before. It has turned fine honest men
into plunderers of our government. It seems no one is immune
from this greed. I believe this war will continue as long as
it is profitable for these scavengers.</p></p>

well. Rev. Harbaugh has three colored boys in his class.
Brought back from Virginia as contraband by our volunteers.
They came here totally illiterate, now know their letters.
Read well and cipher satisfactorily. One has been admitted
into the church and the others promising. It was a pleasing
sight to see these poor outcasts, far from their native soil
pursuing the light of liberty. I hope they do not fall under
the influence of many of the debased Africans now filling up

Town crowded with country people keeping New Year's Day. This
day Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation. I think it
will do more harm than good. Little can be done with it, but

$25.00 in treasury notes, and $100.00 in other paper. I took a

now demands back interest on the account. He shall be paid,
but I shamed him on the unjustness of conducting his business
this way. More talk of our bank going out of business. It
would be a sore loss to our country. We are in good shape and
have very competent officers. These are times that the selfish

more people to hell than to heaven. It makes more miserable

always kind to me, and looked after my interests. During the
last years of his life, lived on the farm with me. The last
six months of his life was confined to his room and bed. I
spent much time with him, resting in a large chair by his
side, that I might attend him, I was all he had and gave him
all the comfort that I could. He loved to gaze out the

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Left home this morning with Rev. Bausman and Fisher for
Martinsburg in Huntingdon County to attend a meeting of
classes. We traversed some beautiful mountain country with
stately stands of trees. The vegetation is lush, and as far as
eye can see, an unending verdant carpet and canopy of the
forest. How simple a life can people live here, free to many
city temptations and illnesses.</p><p class="p10">What a magnificent view we had from the top of the
mountain. A great panorama
stretched out before us, McConnels Cove, and turning, a view
of the Cumberland Valley. Now it impresses the heart and mind,
we could scarce tear ourselves away.</p><p class="p10">Descending, we took dinner in McConnellsburg, and made our
way to Sideling Hill at McEvanes. A change in the temperature
is greatly noticed. People had large fires burning in their
hearths, which made it pleasant indoors. Our party consisted
of Dr. Schneck, Dr. Fisher, Rev. Bausman, J.J. Brown, John
Rebo, H. Detricks, and T.J. Apple, Elder William Heyser, William Bopart, Daniel Miller, James Cook,
and David Berger, making quite a company. The evening passed
pleasantly, before retiring, all assembled in the main room
with the landlord and his family, who took devotional services
with us.</p><p class="p10">After an excellent breakfast, we prepared to pursue our
journey. I was very much vexed that we did not have morning
prayers before departing. We passed Sideling Hill and
approached Bloody Run, where we briefly rested. Here the road
runs parallel with the Juniata River. The banks are covered
with splendid hemlocks and spruce. Here we take the road to
Pattonsville. The Yellow Creek takes its course through excellent scenery of rocks and
trees, whose nature have been unchanged these thousands of
years. A most delightful and romantic spot. I could dwell here
some time on its beauties.</p><p class="p10">At Pattonsville, we could find no accommodations at the
Inn, being a small mean place. A worthy citizen, noting our
plight, invited us to dine with him. An enjoyable experience.
He was a Mr. Dietrick, a Methodist.</p><p class="p10">Leaving here, we passed through
Harrisonville, arriving about five o'clock at Martinsburg.
This section of Morrison's Cove is a most fertile and
beautiful section of the county, Martinsburg occupying the
center of it. The people here are very hospitable and
intelligent. Their houses are neat and well furnished. Fashion
is beginning to make inroads on the backward way of life,
among the Dunkard Sect, which is predominant. The younger
generation has set in motion ideas that will change these
crude notions about peculiar methods of life. Already we see
much of this in evidence.</p><p class="p10">We welcomed the rest of our members as they arrived, and
started our exercises. Rev. Bausman preached the opening
discourse.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Morning is quite cool. Fire is agreeable. We meet to agree
on some debatable issues of our procedures the next few days.
Isaac Rhodes invited us to dinner at his place, a beautiful
farm about 2 l/2 miles from Martinsburg. On the adjoining
farm, the yearly meeting of the Dunkards is to be held, some 8
to 10 thousand will attend. Vast preparations are being made.
They will come from all sections of America and Canada.</p><p class="p10">A meeting in the evening of our missionary societies. Much
discussion of various view points as to how we administer our
decisions.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>MAY 19</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cool. We are bringing our classes to a close here, after
electing several groups for the different Synods to meet next
year. Even here, we have petty politics among religious groups
to vie for honors to represent their views of ideas. I was
much honored and congratulated on my writings and method of
conducting prayer services, often mistaken for one of the
clergy. Why did the Lord choose the business world for me,
when I was better fitted for the church?</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>MAY 20</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and warm. We leave for home by the same route.
Stopped in Pattonsville where we had dinner with our former
friends. Proceeded to Bloody Run, where we watered and then to
Mackelwanes, where we put up for the night, first having a
good meal, and then religious exercises before retiring.
Schneck and myself fortunate in getting the same room. Bausman
and Apple roomed together in the same bed. Had quite a cat
accident about midnight. A loud scratching and thumping
awakened them, the noise coming from a nearby cupboard.
Opening it, a howling cat jumped out, which ran under their
bed where it discharged its bowels creating a horrible stench.
Apple could scarce retain his stomach. Got up, lit a match,
but no other place to sleep. Finally turned the mouth of the
chamber pot upon it, so got through
till morning. The incident created a hearty laugh in the
morning.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>MAY 21</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and warm. Had breakfast and services, and so
departed. On Scrub Ridge, we came upon an old stager who had
planted himself in the center of the road, tying up some seven
carriages. We all finally got by, very fortunate there were no
females in the company.</p><p class="p10">The rest of the way was dusty and hot. Had dinner at
Mullins, at the foot of Parnells Knob. Rested awhile and
proceeded home, arriving about six. Glad to find myself home
again.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>MAY 23</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Warm and dry. Great preparations being made in town to
receive the 126th Regiment, the nine months men from this
county. Reception marred by the huge clouds of dust. Huge
crowds of people passing back and forth, until late in the
evening.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>MAY 25</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Awakened by the pealing of all the bells in town.
The chimes were a blend of all the different tones, a most
delightful sound. It was occasioned by the fall of Vicksburg.
The streets filled with excited and anxious men. But this war
is far from over, our debt is increasing at the rate of 2 1/2
millions of dollars a day. Where will we all end.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>MAY 26</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A young soldier, by the name of Henderson, one of our
provost guards, was thrown from his horse last night and
dragged to his death. It seems he and a friend were racing on
the turnpike, he attempted to jump over a cow that was laying
in his way, but at the critical moment rose up, throwing the
young man's horse, which dragged him a short distance. He
never rallied, and thus passed into eternity. He is of
respectable parents living in Baltimore, who will be called to
mourn over the death of a wayward son.</p><p class="p10">Talk of re-electing Lincoln for our next President. I do
not feel his re-election is possible, after all his failures
so far. He has not the ability of statesmanship to wield the
destinies of our government. When this conflict is over, we
will need a most able man to solve larger problems, than we
have now--particularly those of the African race.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>MAY 27</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Warm. Our house is very quiet today, with all the children
away visiting. Time for reflection and silent communion with
those we knew-gone forever. How much of our past life was good
or profitable, and how much was wasted. Have we done our best
and how wisely? How little influence does one life have on the
great stream of civilization, as it gushes onward. So it now
is evident in Washington. With all this attention on President
making, rather than the interests of the country. Stanton,
Chase, and Seward are busy laying the hopes for their chances
of occupying the White House. I think all three are destined
for defeat.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Decorating the church for Sunday's celebration of the
Heidelberg Catechism.</p><p class="p10">Death of Rev. Feete's daughter. She will be interred
tomorrow at six in the evening. Rev. Feete has lost his last
remaining comfort. Without a charge, means, and dependent on
friends, his situation can well call forth all the sympathy of
those that know him.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear but windy. I rise early, but feel drowsy. I overtaxed myself yesterday. Age
is laying its heavy hand on me, as my increasing years tax my
vigor. I find myself reflecting on the past too much, this is
not good, yet it affords me pleasure that I made some small
accomplishments in the various departments of life.</p><p class="p10">Death of old Mrs. Caesman, a German, died milking her cow.
She was a vender of fruits in season, a cheerful woman, but
poor. Was quite a fixture in our town, and will be missed.</p></p>

are making rapid progress. Weeds are like sin, always giving
trouble, and hard to exterminate. Worked all day and now am
stiff and tired. Work goes hard with me. This evening assisted

Greencastle, that he may have a horse to my liking.</p><p class="p10">I am somewhat annoyed with thoughts and feelings that were
unpleasant to me. I endeavor to banish them, the temptation

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. B. Wolff and myself spent a couple hours in the
Lutheran graveyard where an interment was being made. This
churchyard is in much disarray and scattered about. Many of
the graves are lost through
negligence of friends and the church. Part of John Maderia's
family is in one place, and part in another. A Mr. Humphrie's
lay beside Mary Maderia, then John Maderia. Then a stone with
the inscription, "Our Sister". This was Catherine Maderia, one
of their daughters who was a little backward, and received
little attention from the family. She was kept out of society
and led a life with the servants. I knew her well in my
boyhood days by the name of Kit. I believe the sin of this
injustice was visited upon the rest of the family, for none of
them prospered in life. Reading her epitaph finds only the
word Sister, someone who knew her history wrote beneath in
pencil, "When my Father and Mother forsake me, the Lord will
take me up." May she have that rest beyond this life, which
was denied in this.</p><p class="p10">This evening attended a meeting of the lodge where some

ride is beautiful and enjoyed my walk up through the glade, a most delightful spot,
full of nature's beauty. It is an hour and a half ride home.
Feel greatly relieved from my anxieties, taking this little
excursion. Rain all evening. More talk of an impending
invasion of our valley.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 14</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and unpleasant. Reports of an engagement near
Winchester. Our town in an uproar. Government property being
loaded up and taken away. The drum calls for volunteers.</p><p class="p10">All the army stores have been packed up and sent to
Philadelphia. Little attendance at church and Sabbath School.
Much of the news is false we hear, but it serves to upset the
people. We all feel Pennsylvania will be invaded. Many
families are hiding their valuables, and preparing for the
worst. Some preparing to leave town. Tonight we have many
sleepless eyes, the houses all shut up tightly, but the
inmates astir.</p><p class="p10">The stores are packing up their goods and sending them off,
people are running to and fro. Cashier Messersmith is sent off
with the books of the bank and its valuables. The cars are
crowded to utmost capacity. The colored people are flying in
all directions. There is a complete state of confusion.</p><p class="p10">After twelve we got word the Rebels have entered
Hagerstown. The stores are all closed, and the streets crowded
with those that can't leave. I am urged to leave. As President
of the bank, might be held responsible for its assets, which I
doubt, anyhow I shall stay to defend my property best I
can.</p><p class="p10">At 8 o'clock a number of contrabands entered our town,
fleeing from Martinsburg with the Rebels not far behind. These
were followed by a wagon train, many on three wheels, and less
being dragged and pushed as fast as possible. The street is
crowded with horses and wagons, all in the wildest state of
confusion. Upon asking one of them as to their plight, said
the Rebels are not far behind.</p><p class="p10">Suddenly about two hundred more wagons, horses, mules, and
contrabands all came pouring down the street in full flight.
Some of them hollering the Rebels
are behind us. Such a sight I have never seen, or will never
see again. The whole town is on the sidewalks screaming,
crying, and running about. They know not where.</p><p class="p10">The road into town is almost impassable by the teamsters
cutting loose their wagons and fleeing with their horses. This
further jammed up our town, some of the horses fall in the
streets from sheer exhaustion. One
soldier was killed by the fall. After the panic subdues, the
teamsters that had cut loose their wagons went back for them.
At twelve the excitement is beyond conception. I am again
urged to leave. Mr. T.B. Kennedy sent me a message, feeling it
was a good idea. I have consented against my will-packing up
my valuable papers and at two, left with Mrs. Heyser in my
buggy, for Carlisle, committing the house to William, Proctor
my colored man, and girl. After I left they did not stay, but
put off for the mountains. Had difficulty passing the wagon
jam on the road and answering questions, arriving at Stoughs
town about 6 in the evening, where I shall wait for news.</p><p class="p10">About midnight, awakened by the news that the Rebels were
at Shippensburg. Dressing, we immediately left for Carlisle at
midnight, being so dark and the roads jammed with wagons, made
dangerous situation that I regretted leaving home in the first
place. However, thanks to Almighty Providence, we arrived
safely in Carlisle about 4 o'clock in the morning. Tried to
get more sleep, but impossible, excitement here is
mounting.</p><p class="p10">We got a bite to eat, the horse fed, and left for
Harrisburg. All along the way the news had preceded us, people
out securing and leaving with their goods. Driving away their
horses, and all shops shut up.</p><p class="p10">Stopped in Mechanicsburg, a prosperous, but now excited
town, to learn of fortifications being made for Harrisburg. We
were advised to stay here, but decided to press on. On
approaching Harrisburg, I could see the fortifications with a
large number of men working on them. The railroad cars were
filled with troops on their way to Chambersburg with artillery.</p><p class="p10"> We crossed the river without difficulty and found
Harrisburg, in wildest confusion. Merchants shipping away
their goods, families their furniture, and people fleeing in
all directions. Almost laughable scenes some created.</p><p class="p10">Stopped at Harris's Hotel. See few females, mostly men
moving furniture and stores, the streets are almost
impassable. The excitement is greater than Chambersburg. All
the records of the state have been removed under the
expectation that Harrisburg will be burned. Our state is doing
nothing to defend itself against invasion. Governor Curtain seems to be paralyzed and unable to act. We need
decisions badly, and can't expect them from Washington.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 17</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Very warm. The city is filling with volunteers and
delegates to the Democratic Convention. Rumors from
Chambersburg that our ships and stores have all been plundered
and that the public building may be burned that houses army
stores. Appeals made to the Governor
for troops to protect the state, but unheeded.</p><p class="p10">My son-in-law, J.A. Eyster, came this afternoon from
Philadelphia. Reports my daughter, Elizabeth and the children
well. News that the Rebels have left for Hagerstown, after
having done a minimum of damage to the town.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 18</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Warm. The Rebels have left Chambersburg taking with them
about 250 colored people again into bondage. Governor Curtin
is presently very unpopular. Left Harrisburg for home about
two o'clock, in the afternoon, by way of the turnpike.
Traveling through very beautiful and
fertile countryside. Had tea in Carlisle, pressed on for
Stoughs town to spend the night. Here we encountered many
colored people fleeing the Rebels, as not all have left the
area. These poor people are completely worn out, carrying
their families on their backs. Saw some twenty from
Chambersburg that I recognized. Some men from Shippensburg
urged us to turn back, that danger was not past, but we
decided to press on, even though the night was black, stormy,
and the road dangerous. We were glad to see the lamps of
Carlisle. Little did we know of the perils that had been in
our way, Almighty Providence led us through safely. It will be a journey my
wife and I will never forget. I suggested she write a book
about our adventurous journey. Weary and tired, we went to
bed.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 19</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Pleasant, heavy rain through the
night. Much rumor-one knows not what to believe. All is still
alarm. The stores are still all closed and business at a
standstill. Unexpectedly met my man, Proctor, who had made for
the mountains, worked his way to Newville from where he got to
Carlisle. Of Fanny, our colored girl, he knew nothing.</p><p class="p10">The papers are now calling for McClelland's recall. Without
him we cannot succeed.</p><p class="p10">Troops are coming in from neighboring states to support our
few that we can bring some order to our situation. It is
ridiculous that 800 Rebel troops can paralyze the Southern portion of our
state without opposition. This invasion had been expected for
months, and totally ignored by our government.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 20</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Left for Shippensburg where we found things much in
panic as before. Large stampedes of men and horses from all
parts of the country. Dreadful accounts that the Rebels are
still active about Chambersburg, and are robbing and stealing
as before. How much of this is true, I cannot say as in times
as these, exaggeration is rife. Each small episode is
magnified a thousand times.</p><p class="p10">Decided to stay over night in
Shippensburg. Rained very hard. The town is packed with
people. I luckily found a bed for my wife and I. A New York
regiment stopped here very disgusted as they had yet to see a
Pennsylvania Company on the job. One I talked with said,
"Damn your State, we came here to
protect it, where are your Pennsylvania soldiers!" If they
don't soon appear, we shall go home.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>SABBATH, JUNE 21</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Rose early, about four, to get an early start. Road
almost deserted. The New York Regiment encamped a short
distance from Shippensburg, along the road. Arrived at home
little after six, found my house still, silent, and musty. I
never felt so lonely, sitting in my own house without anything
to eat and no one about. Mrs. Fisher invited us over to have
breakfast, a kindness we shall not forget. Never again, under
any circumstances, shall I leave my home again. Just about
Sabbath School time, the town thrown into another state of
confusion, that a column of Rebels were advancing. This proved
to be just a poor man leading a few horses in town from his
farm. So it goes, what is fact and fancy, we continued with our worship, the
excitement subsided.</p><p class="p10">In the evening, troops came in from New York for our
protection. Reports that the Rebels are in Greencastle. I feel
certain that Lee will bring his army into Pennsylvania.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 22</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear. Troops arriving from Harrisburg. Four Dalgreen
pieces of ordinance arrive and taken out to the end of town to
be set up. The citizens have formed a few companies for
defense, but how effective could they be?</p><p class="p10">More troops have arrived, perhaps a thousand here now. We
breathe a little easier.</p><p class="p10">Our hopes are short lived. The troops have all been
recalled to Shippensburg, the small battery is run out of
town. Excitement is again intense in town.</p><p class="p10">A meeting is held of prominent men, to face the enemy, if
they should come and surrender the town on the best terms we
can get. Again there is a general
stampede to leave town with valuables. The road to
Shippensburg is again packed with fleeing citizens. There is
not a Negro to be seen in town. At 11 o'clock, the streets are
deserted. I did not go to bed until
about one. All is quiet, but it is a sleepless town.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 23</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear. Rose early. A small local cavalry force rode out,
but soon returned. Wagons were sent out to secure the tents
and baggage the New York volunteers left behind in their
flight to Shippensburg.</p><p class="p10">Our squads of cavalry are leaving, a bad sign. We soon find
out as we make our observations behind drawn shutters. A large
squad was seen advancing at the German Reformed Church, coming
down the street, filling the whole space, moving at a slow
pace, their guns in position, ready for instant firing in case
of attack. About 300 entered the town as cavalry, the others
took up positions in fields in sight of town. Those entering
proceeded to the public square
where they immediately cut down the telegraph wires at all
points. After this they placed pickets at all points to
prevent surprise.</p><p class="p10">Our Committee met them and given to understand private
property would be respected, but they were to furnish
provisions for 1,500 men. The Rebels behave very well. Not a
citizen molested or a house visited. We complied very well
with their demands.</p><p class="p10">This afternoon they opened the warehouse of J. Allison
Eyster, and made off with $4,000.00 worth of bacon, salt,
beans, coffee, crackers, etc. They also opened the warehouse
of Oaks &amp; Linn, and took almost 300 barrels of flour belonging
to Jacob Stouffer. They broke in the heads of 20 barrels of
whiskey, which they poured out. At Miller's Drug Store, they
poured a barrel of brandy into the gutter. Captain Fitzhugh
gave orders that if any of his men were caught molesting a
citizen, they would be severely punished. I must admit they
were a thoroughly disciplined lot of men.</p><p class="p10">About 4 o'clock they moved towards Shippensburg, leaving a
guard on the wagons behind. At 9 they returned with their
artillery to their camp at the South end of town. We don't
understand their plans. Neither do we understand why the State
hoards all those soldiers about Harrisburg, leaving the
Southern portion to the invaders.</p></p>

there being nothing left to do but strip us all of everything.
About 9 o'clock Ewell's corps passed through, probably some
10,000 men with an immense train of artillery and army wagons. Among them
many farm wagons and teams they acquired along the way.</p><p class="p10">The men looked well, but lacked uniforms, being an array of
all shades and colors. No two hats alike, and their shoes
could hardly be called that. It was hard to distinguish the
officers from the men, except those of high rank. They sang
and cheered lustily as they marched along. About two, the
pillage of our stores began. Not a place escaped, never in the
history of our boro was there such a scene. The merchants were
compelled to pack up the wagons with their goods, which is
being sent to Richmond.</p><p class="p10">The streets are crowded with Rebels who try to interrogate
our lesser citizens as to where
things are hidden or sent to, and also as to the movements of
the Federal troops that had left. By now, all of our stores
have been ransacked.</p><p class="p10">My neighbor, Widow Murphy, who kept a small store,
dispensing Queens Ware and shoes, nothing of value to the
Rebels, did succeed in having her place exempt from being
robbed. Some of the Rebel officers were very considerate.</p><p class="p10">My son's mill and warehouse has suffered much from
confiscation for which they gave him $800.00 in Confederate

locusts begin to swarm again. On each side of the street, they
stop and make further requisitions. There isn't much left to

Evidently new orders have been directed as they are packing up
and securing their stolen goods as fast as possible. Officers
are riding off in all directions.</p><p class="p10">At seven, we have reports of a skirmish near Carlisle
driving back the Rebels. Jenkins, Ewell, and Rhodes have
returned to Chambersburg with the intention of crossing over
to Gettysburg. The drums beat-calling their men to camp and
hunting the stragglers. All indications point to readiness for
a march.</p><p class="p10">Tonight there is not a Rebel to be seen. We are not sure
what caused the move, we do know large forces were now built
up in Harrisburg, ready to march South. McClelland is supposed
to be there, but so far Washington refuses to use him,
politics being behind this. With his skill and knowledge, the
war could have been ended, but the power in Washington will
not admit him.</p><p class="p10">The streets tonight are deserted and still. Not a soldier
to be seen except the posted sentinels. I remained up until
one.</p></p>

streets until after breakfast, when the advancing corps of
Gen. Johnston appears with waving flags and stirring music, as
they approach the public square. Three cheers went up for the
Southern Confederacy. They passed on column after column, for
hours. Next their batteries, army wagons, and ambulances,
presenting a fearful sight. I have mixed feelings of
indignation and humility. The passage of the army created a
consternation among the people. Many feel all is lost, after
seeing this show of power in the face of our inadequate
defense.</p><p class="p10">At about three o'clock, the rear of Johnston's corps is
passed, making about 15,000 men, rank and file, 72 pieces of
ordinance, 350 wagons, about a regiment is left to guard the
town. The large school building has been taken by them for a
hospital.</p><p class="p10">Requisitions have been made on all the innkeepers for
mattresses, blankets, quilts, sheets, etc. for the Rebel sick
and wounded. It is expected the like orders will be given the
citizens.</p><p class="p10">This evening a part of their army has advanced near the
town on the Baltimore Pike, and on the Western Pike, occupying
the fairground.</p><p class="p10">They say they have entered upon a desperate enterprise, and
will make Pennsylvania the battleground, instead of Virginia,
that they will conquer or die! All say the heaviest battle of
the war will be fought in this Valley. We all tremble as we
have no news from the outside, being completely cut off.</p><p class="p10">Portions of the Cumberland Valley and Franklin Railroads
have been torn up. The bridge at Scotland, just rebuilt, has
again been demolished.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>SATURDAY, JUNE 27</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Rebel troops commence their forward movement and
continue without interruption until dark. We estimate by
actual count nearly 35,000 men, officers and all, 165 pieces
ordinance. I notice many of the gun carriages had the U.S.
mark upon them, having been captured from our army.</p><p class="p10">About 11 o'clock General Lee
passed with his staff. He is fine looking man, medium size,
stoutly built, has the face of a good liver, grey beard, and
mustache, poorly dressed for an officer of his grade. He wore
a felt hat, black, and a heavy overcoat with large cape. His
horse appeared to be rather an indifferent one, for a man who
reputedly is fond of fine stock.</p><p class="p10">Hill is a tall red-headed man, not over thirty-five.
Longstreet and Ewell I did not see, nor Johnston. Many of the
officers were fine looking men, and rode fine horses.</p><p class="p10">During their passage, I noticed their ever watchfulness on
every side. The citizens were crowded along the sidewalks and
doors, observing their passage; the rest, inside, behind drawn
blinds, watched unobtrusively. There were many remarks and
exclamations, but all in a subdued tone of voice or whisper.
All had one thought in mind, "Were these soldiers to be our
conquerors, and if so, what will be our fate?"</p><p class="p10">Occasionally a German would stop me and complain in his
native tongue, as if I could help this situation, or was
responsible for it.<a href="#heyser5">5</a></p><p class="p10">Lee offered to place a guard for the protection of the
town, but the sheriff could not be found. Later in the day,
General Hill and Longstreet passed
through with part of their army. They were far less
respectable lot, and constantly shouting, singing, and hooting
at females that showed themselves at doors or windows. They
were loud in their denunciation of the Union, and insulting to
citizens on the sidewalks. Shouting, "Boys, this is
Pennsylvania. We should destroy her as they did in Virginia,
damn the Union. Harrisburg will be
ours, Hurrah for the Southern Confederacy, and Jeff
Davis."</p><p class="p10">Every brigade as it passed sent a file of soldiers around
to examine the stores and places of business, requiring them
to open up. This continued all day. These men were called the
Louisiana Tigers, a forbidding-
looking set of men that would take your hat or remove your
boots for their own use.</p><p class="p10">Rev. Schneck was relieved of his gold watch and $50.00. He
complained to get it back, but to no use. Robberies are now
common on the street, particularly where they are
unguarded.</p><p class="p10">Decharts hat store was cleaned out today, not a single item
left in stock. They opened up my son, William's store today,
and started to help themselves. We are powerless to stop them,
and can do nothing but watch and complain to the commanding
officers. They refer to the same treatment our soldiers gave
the Confederacy in Virginia.</p><p class="p10">I finally found a Colonel Greene
that listened to some reason and had the men removed and the
door shut.</p><p class="p10">While the troops were passing today, I was sitting by my
door, the victim of many insulting remarks. One even attempted
to take my hat. He withdrew when I offered to resist, as I
would have struck him. Were it not for the rigid discipline
they were under, I shudder to think what our lot would have
been. There are exceptions, many of the Rebels are gentlemen,
and act as such. Mostly, those from Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, generally speaking, are a
band of cutthroats.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 28</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. The troops are moving through town again, a
continual procession until evening. The drug store of J.
Spangler was visited today by Lieut. Todd, President Lincoln's
wife's brother. He finally had to be ejected by the provost
marshal as having no business being there. Reports come in our
neighboring farmers are being robbed, one being shot. Many of
these robberies are committed by vagabonds or camp followers
in search of booty. The Rebels try to check them, but can't
catch them all. One farmer was shot and the body hid in the
manure pile. These robbers are mostly after money. The poor
farmers are defenseless.</p><p class="p10">All of business places are pretty well stripped, all that
is left now are the private houses to be broken into.</p><p class="p10">Up to this evening, the whole number of troops passing
through Chambersburg is about
43,000; 180 pieces artillery,
3,000 wagons and ambulances. Indications seem to be they are
about to leave Chambersburg. It is now 11 o'clock, my mind is
weary, sad, and gloomy. So much I cannot even form an
opinion.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 29</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Streets are clear until about eight. My son, Jacob,
meets Robert Reynolds of Georgia. I knew his father well.
Robert had his own horse and servant along. He is a conscript,
wish I could have talked with him.</p><p class="p10">Fearful outrages in the country about us. I hear the Rebels
mail has been cut off from Richmond. They are apprehensive of
trouble.</p><p class="p10">Stouffer's mill has been taken over by the Rebels and is
running for their use. There isn't much food left in town now.
If the Rebels remain much longer, I do not know what we shall
do. The country side is rapidly losing all its livestock. Much
had already been driven off and hidden in the mountains.</p><p class="p10">About 4 o'clock, about 5,000 men took up their line of
march for Greencastle with 18 pieces of ordinance. I think
they are clearing their lines to get their wagon trains back
into Virginia. They are now riding about our alleys looking
for harness and gear. I removed the wheel from my wagon and
hid it, making it unfit for use.</p><p class="p10">About the close of the evening, they are busy tearing up
the sills of the railroad and burning them to bend the rails
over, making them unfit to use.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JUNE 30</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Variable weather. Sunshine and rain. A large wagon train
today takes its course towards Gettysburg. Lee's headquarters
are still here. He keeps his troops in constant movement that
it is hard to say what he is planning for his principal
move.</p><p class="p10">About 9 o'clock a large train of wagons are withdrawn from
the direction of Harrisburg, and put on the line of march for
Gettysburg. It took 4 hours for the line to pass here. The
troops are busy destroying the Franklin Railroad at both North
and South ends of the County. Along with sills of the road,
they pile on all the fence they can find to heat and twist the
rails.</p><p class="p10">Another force of about 500 men have been sent to destroy
the railroad depot and buildings, starting with the large
turntable. It is so soundly built of iron castings, their
fires had little effect on it. The engine house was pulled
down after an immense amount of work. So they went from
building to building, a senseless thing to do, as the
structures were of no importance to us as we could not use
them. I tried to reason with a nearby officer about the wanton
destruction. Their answers are always the same, "This is in
retaliation for your troops' work on the South, particularly
Fredericksburg."</p><p class="p10">Leaving this scene of destruction, which appears to be
their last act. I went up to the belfry of the German Reformed
Church to see if I could trace any damage to my farm, but
could not, so much timberland intervening. You could mark the
line of the railroad by the smoke of the burning ties. From
what I can see, there is little damage to crops and
grassland.</p><p class="p10">This evening, there is much activity. Troops are withdrawn
from all parts to march to Gettysburg. Reports that already there has been an engagement at
Cashtown. Their cooks are busy preparing rations for the next
few days.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>July 1863


</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 2, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy and very hot. The Rebels are leaving Chambersburg
for Gettysburg. About 3 this morning, I was awakened by the
rumbling of heavy wagons. There were about 60 of them,
followed by a large body of troops, requiring about two hours
to pass. They were quite jubilant in their passage thru town,
pulling my bell at the door and hooting at me.</p><p class="p10">After their passage, all was quiet again, except squads of
cavalry passing to unite with their
companies, all in the direction of Gettysburg. Somewhere near
there is a heavy engagement. About ten, the town is vacant.
The Rebels leaving their sick behind for us to nurse and care
for. A few stragglers are to be seen, but the worst is over.
We congratulate ourselves that we still have a roof over our
heads. About 12, in the company of two other men, I walked out
to my farm to assess the damage. Everywhere were holes cut in
fences and grain trampled down by the exercises of the
cavalry. I sustained a great amount of damage, nearly 4,000
men have encamped here. All of my fence gone, about 40 acres
of oats and much damage to all other crops. My houses were all
robbed of clothing and any kind of gear with which to work.
The report was circulated that I was a Colonel in the Union
Army and now made to pay greater than my neighbors. How unjust
even your supposed friends can be. In passing over the fields
and woods where they encamped, there is already a great
stench.</p><p class="p10">I found two Rebels hiding on my farm and would have taken
them back to town. They would have been willing prisoners to
obtain their parole, but a large body of Stewarts' cavalry was
passing near and I advised them to hide. One gave me his
bayonet, which I brought back to town. Back home, more reports
come in of a battle near Gettysburg. All night long, more
troops pass through town, their
yelling is terrific. I keep indoors.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 3</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Very hot. Our streets are deserted. An occasional Rebel is
seen, just a few stragglers. A Rebel soldier riding up Market
Street was fired upon by William
Etter, one of our citizens. We feared a reprisal for this sort
of thing and put a stop to it. We see more and more deserters.
The town being clear of Rebels, the doors are opening again to
promenading females. Nothing can stop them, many of them show
little respect for their character and standing. They expose
themselves, as if intentional, to be out late at night
unprotected.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 4</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Showers of rain. Reports of terrible fighting at
Gettysburg. Captures are being made all around here of Rebel
cavalry and infantry which are sent to Harrisburg, their
horses and guns being confiscated. The country people are
coming in now with their marketing with terrible accounts of
outrages that were committed upon them. We were fortunate that
the Rebel officers were mostly gentlemen, and tried to hold
their savage troops in check, but many could not. I suppose we
are fortunate to be alive.</p><p class="p10">Ewell is at Carlisle and demands its surrender, throwing
some 40 shells into town, which did little damage. They burned
the gas works where the Carlisle Deposit Bank had hidden its
records, now gone. General Smith
appeared and Ewell fell back towards Gettysburg. We hear of a
great battle at Gettysburg, but as yet no particulars, except
the Union forces were victorious. Some public spirited
citizens seized the mail (Rebel mail) going thru Fayetteville.
Soon a detachment of cavalry was back looking for it, and took
18 prisoners locally for some hours before releasing them; on
pain of death if it happens again.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 5</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Much rain. About three, 12 wagons of wounded from
Gettysburg were routed by mistake through our town, leaving them here at our
hospital, a wonder they were alive, thrown in heaps in rough
wagons. The wagons were captured by John W. Taylor and sent to
Carlisle. This is the Sabbath, all is calm and still. Few
persons on the streets.</p><p class="p10">I notice that most of our birds have gone since the
appearance of the Rebels, and that flies and insects are more
numerous.</p><p class="p10">Only 5 persons attended prayer meeting. About 6, part of
Gen. Milroy's cavalry of about 300 passed thru town at full
speed brandishing their swords and responding to the cheers of
many spectators. They rode South in the direction of
Greencastle. No word yet from Gettysburg.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 6</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. General Milroy was
dispatched to Greencastle to protect a large wagon train. We
hear a decisive battle was fought at Gettysburg. That Lee is
withdrawn towards the Potomac and that enormous amounts of
supplies and prisoners have been captured. The news gave rise
to the ringing of bells and general convivial in the streets. It appears
the contest raged for 3 days and was the most desperate of the
war. As Lee withdraws towards the Potomac, we hear of
skirmishes along the way. One over near Waynesboro and
Smithburg. Reports that the Pine Stump Road is filled with
broken Rebel wagons and caissons, filled with ammunition much
of which is thrown in the mud with a view of destroying it.
Also many dead and wounded lying by the roadside, indicating a
hasty retreat.</p><p class="p10">There is a report the Rebels are forming at Marion to meet
Pleasanter's cavalry which is
expected to attack them. Also it is said a cannon was found
buried by the Rebels near the place on the roadside.</p><p class="p10">I met Doctor Gamble today. The Surgeon Rebel in charge of
the hospital here. He tells me most of the best men of the
South were in this battle, now most of them gone.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 7</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Much rain. The grain is in danger of spoiling. About 200
Rebel prisoners were brought in today. Many are deserting, Lee
is making a desperate attempt to escape Mead's army. Our
stores are reopening and cleaning up.</p><p class="p10">General Couch's division is
following the end of Lee's army through Greenwood on what is called the
Pine Stump Road. We are hoping Lee's army will be captured. If
Mead allows him to escape, it will indeed be folly.</p><p class="p10">We hear the Rebel lose at Gettysburg 30,000 men, the Union
20,000. My sons, Jacob and William, just returned from the
battlefield. It is a fearful sight. The fields full of dead,
by all the roadsides dead are hardly covered by a thin layer
of mud. Wreckage everywhere, the implements of war fast
disappearing by souvenir seekers. Soon the cultivators plow
will cover it all and put an end to military glory.</p><p class="p10">If Lee is allowed to escape this struggle will be
prolonged. We hear of only skirmishes all along his route to
the Potomac.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 8</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Much rain. General Couch is
raising more men at Harrisburg with a view to following Lee.
We hear Lee's army is crossing at Williamsport. Our town is
quiet now, a few straggling soldiers to be seen. They now
attract little attention. I feel very unwell this evening.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 9</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Awoke with all the bells ringing, report confirmed that
Vicksburg has been taken. I have kept to my room most of the
day. Some companies of New York cavalry and infantry creating
a disturbance by their drunkenness. We saw none of this among
the Rebels.</p><p class="p10">Reports that Lee is using the canal boats at Williamsport
to ford his sick and wounded. Our town is now stirring with
activity again. Many who left are returning and the stores re-
opening with what they have left. The night closes in quiet,
and being unwell, go to my bed.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>JULY 10</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Clear and warm. Still unwell today. The Rebel army busy
crossing at various points on the Potomac. Lee's headquarters
still in Hagerstown, but the troops going to Williamsport and
Shepherdstown. We hear much of Lee's equipment has crossed
over together with much livestock.</p><p class="p10">Some troops come in this morning and moved towards
Greencastle. About 3,000 passed through Mercersburg. The town in
confusion. Many of our females show little self-respect. You
see them bareheaded, mingling with the crowd, and a number of
them hanging on the arms of strange soldiers. It is amazing
that the parents allow this to take place. Perhaps it is
condoned under the guise of patriotism, but this usually ends
in the ruin of these daughters. Tonight, General Couch arrived amid much cheering.
The speeches they give are politically slanted and do nothing
toward ending the war and healing our wounds. END William

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy. Left home for my mountain land, taking with me six
little girls, some my grandchildren. They were a merry lot and
made me feel better. I had taken an open spring wagon, filled
it with hay and spread a buffalo robe over it. We left about
three for home and all had a fine time, except for the heavy
shower of rain. We were well provided with umbrellas and
shawls. I think all will remember that day of merriment. Those
in our party were: Betty Eyster, Ellie Heyser, Mary Eyster,
Nellie Eyster, Ellie Eyster, Georgie Shuman.</p><p class="p10">Spent the evening reading and writing.</p></p>

An interesting visit, but felt very unwell. Disappointed to
find much politics and log rolling among the young aspirants. Other speeches
and complaints, many out of order.<a href="#heyser8">8</a></p></p>
