                <p>Imboden complains that Annie has not written to him for several days. He then

                    importance of marriage to a man's happiness. He suggests that he will return to

                <p>If you are the dearest and sweetest little woman in the world don't you think I
                    am the most patient and kind hearted old gentleman of all your acquaintance?
                    Think of it, this is the <hi rend="underline">fourth</hi> letter, at long
                    intervals, since I have had a reply to one of mine. Just three weeks ago to day
                    I parted from you, and that night wrote you from Keysville, and that is the only
                    letter to which I have <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> a reply. Couldn't you
                    have sent me a little note from Laurenceville? I <orig reg="won't">wont</orig>
                    scold. I never scold, but if you could know with what avidity I read every word
                    you write me, and how anxiously I look forward always to hear from you, I am
                    sure you would admire my pa-<pb n="2"/>tience and my philosophy.</p>

                <p>My darling is all the world to me now. I love my children as dearly as any father
                    ever did, and they are as lovable, but there is in the human heart a capacity to
                    love that is not gratified by mere paternal affection. A large part of my life
                    has been one of the deepest and tenderest love for woman. I <hi rend="underline"
                        >know</hi> how glorious it is to be master of a woman's whole heart, and to
                    feel that she is mistress of mine. Long years of the purest pleasure in that
                    holiest of all earthly relations husband of a true and noble woman, has taught
                    me that outside of it, there is little worth living for. When I first met you I
                    was almost indifferent to the world. I did not know that it any longer contained
                    any one whom I could love again, as I had loved in the past. Ere I had known you
                    three days, I saw that I had found a woman at whose feet I could lay my whole
                    heart, and then my anxiety was to know how I <pb n="3"/> could win yours. You
                    know how earnestly I labored <del hand="h1">the</del> to accomplish that result.</p>

                <p>Providence favored my suit &amp; you gave me your young &amp; noble
                    heart. Ever since I have felt how blest I am. I feel the pain of separation
                    every day, I am sure more keenly than you, because the wreck of my happiness
                    that has occured more than once in the past, has prepared me by a bitter
                    experience, to appreciate the infinite pleasure of the Constant <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">presence of</add>
                    <del hand="h1">pleasure of loving</del> one's heart's idol. But as a certain
                    period of separation is inevitable, I long to alleviate its pain as much as
                    possible by frequent communication with you. And had you a daily mail I would
                    write to you every night. Therefore you must pardon me for complaining a little
                    at your long silence. When you are at home again, please, as you value my
                    happiness, never let a mail leave without bringing to me a letter from you - a
                    long sweet letter - or if that may not be, even a little note will be prized.</p>

                <pb n="4"/>

                <p>When you are my dear little wife I may spoil you, if petting can do it, for I
                    feel that the debt of gratitude I owe you for making me so happy can never be
                    paid off by all the endearments I can bestow on you.</p>

                <p>This week I will probably know when I may expect to return to <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">Virg<hi rend="super">a</hi></abbr>. I expect <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Flournoy tomorrow. Indeed he may now be here, as
                    I wrote urging him to come on yesterday, or as soon afterwards as possible. I
                    suppose our company affairs will require me to spend some weeks of the winter in
                    your County &amp; Brunswick. If so <hi rend="underline">where</hi> would you
                    advise me to make my head quarters? especially to spend my Saturdays and
                    Sundays? Do you know any pleasant place in Mecklenburg where I would sometimes
                    be a welcome guest? I will be guided mainly by your advice.</p>

                <p>I have not a line from sister Lou sisnce her first short &amp; hasty note and
                    not a word from Sis Ella - will quarrel with them.</p>
