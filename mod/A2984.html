<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Amanda C. Armentrout,
                    April 10, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William writes to Kate of camp religious life, his belief that he won't have a
                    furlough unless he becomes sick or the Yankees get him, and his continued love
                    for her.</p>

<p class="p10">April 10th</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Randolph</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 21st on the sixth; I failed
                    in receiving your letter in time to write to you
                    before you would leave home, Thought it best to wait a day or two then direct to
                    Lexington; There never was a letter received with more pleasure, or perused with more
                    interest; When Abe returned to camp we were on picket
                    &amp; didn't get to camp until the 4th; I believe my letter was enclosed in one of packs he gave it to me on the 6th I hope you will not be
                    low spirited when this reaches you for I do not feel as if I could interest you
                    this evening. I spent part of the forenoon of this blessed day at our little chapel; there was a large
                    congregation all seemed <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to pay strict attention
                    to the word of life; oh how I do wish all our soldiers would become pious men I
                    am sure then our armies would be invincible I sometimes think your brother is
                    trying to be a better boy. I pray I may be right for I hope to see him a true
                    christian I need not ask you to make him a special
                    object in your secret communings for I am sure you
                    do; There is no news in camp worth your attention.
                        Everything is quiet as far as I know The weather has been very inclement for the last two weeks; first snow then rain my darling Kate
                    you said your face could not wear a joyous smile, until you could behold my face, Cheer up my ever faithful one I hope the time will soon hasten round
                    when we may meet, But I pray thee not to put off smiling
                        until I come, but rather try &amp; be cheerful &amp; happy
                    darling I am sorry that my last letter brought with it sorrow to thy <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>noble heart; God knows I would not purposely give
                        thee trouble. Would that I were so situated that I could say to the idol of
                    my heart lean upon my <i>[deleted: heart]</i> arm and I
                    will support thee through life with a willingness that
                    would know no end. That dream of yours oh that it was a
                    reality I'm my happiness would be complete, Often in my nightly slumber you are by my side &amp; I
                    wake finding my arms around my friend Trot -- oh! Dear Kate I fear you have some
                    clue that will be injurious to your kind sisters happiness in the future I would be sorry if anything should occur to cause her to be sorry for her change in life. I
                    have heard rumors but I hope thay are all false My wish is that she may be happy
                    throughout her days, You need not look for me this summer without sickness or
                    the Yanks give me a furlough. The detail I was at home on counted as a furlough
                    I would be satisfied if I was sure you were
                    happy, Abe told me you desired me to direct your letter
                    in the care of your friend Rachel I think we had better continue <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>to
                    direct as we have in the past for if your parents should ever find out you were  corresponding with me in a secret way their anger would be increased against both of us while
                    they do not positively object we had best write
                    openly dear Kate what can I do to alleviate your troubles, I love you yes
                    passionately &amp; if you think you have ever treated me wrong I forgive thee, &amp; will if you will permit love and
                    cherish thee more than I ever did, I believe my own coldness brought on our troubles
                    about but I believe they will <i>[added: be]</i> a blessing to us both I am sure it has drawn thee nearer
                    to me, I can only say speed on sweet day when I may meet thee. I must soon close
                    My health is very good &amp; I hope this may find you enjoying the same with
                        cheerful spirits. Give my love to you sister
                    &amp; write soon It is getting so dark that I can hardly see how to write I
                    have not heard from Bro. Charles only by your letter
                    Sister is well She desires to know your name I will give it to her in my next
                    letter, Now may the blessing of a great &amp; good God be with you</p>
<p class="p10">from your true friend</p>
