    </opener>

    <p>I wrote you a few lines several days, that is two days ago, saying that we were on our way to
     the Blue Ridge, having turned off from the McAdamized Road at Harrisonburg Friday P.M, and the
     army spent the night 6 miles from <abbr expan="Harrisonburg">H-g</abbr>, and the next day at 2
     A.M. the army was in motion and came to this point -- I was sent on by the Gen. with 150
     cavalry to burn the bridges on the Shenandoah River below here -- I rode on 10 miles to the
     first bridge and then left a strong picket, and had the plank taken up at once at one end and
     preparation made for burning, I went on with the rest of the men <unclear>6</unclear> miles to
     the next bridge, concealed my men at Haneyville, though I had much trouble with Jordan's men
     some of which as well as himself were drunk. I then had the bridge carefully reconnoitered and
     it was reported that no enemy was to be seen, then I sent 3 men with a captain to burn the
     bridge and ordered the rest of the men to feed their horses 3/4 of a mile off, the men went
     forward to burn the bridge and had put hay in the mouth of it and set it on fire, when a column
     of the enemy appeared and fired a volley and their dragoons charged, a messenger at once
     reported that they were coming and I ordered the men to their horses and told Jordan to front
     his men -- and I went forward to reconnoitre, when <abbr expan="Jordan">J.</abbr> followed me
     instead of attending to his men, and the enemy came charging up and firing when our men broke
     at once except some 3 or four, and a perfect stampede of them took place, the enemy pursuing
     for 3 miles, every attempt to rally was unavailing, some actually throwing away their guns,
     many their coats, blankets &amp;c &amp;c -- I never saw a more <pb n="2"/> disgraceful
     affair -- all owing no <unclear>doubt</unclear> to the state of intoxication of some of the
     men, and to the want of discipline -- One of our men was killed, one wounded and we have not
     found out how many were taken prisoners -- I went on when I found the men could not be rallied,
     and looked after the party I had left behind and with them brought up the rear -- most of the
     others having taken to the woods &amp;c--. The enemy now hold the lower bridge, but we have
     burned the upper. Our escape was providential considering the panic of the men and the rapid
     retreat over a rough road. I suppose you all thought you were abandoned when you heard that we
     had left the Valley, but now you see that we saved the Valley by that very movement, for the
     enemy at once fell back. We shall be reinforced in a day or two I suppose, and a battle will no
     doubt be fought before many days, and on that may hang the fate of our country, and I do pray
     that it may be favorable to us. Gen. Ed. Johnson of Alleghany was here last night and went back
     this morning, so concert of action will be secured by the union of our Generals in council. The
     weather is still bad -- very bad and the mud deep, making it very disagreeable for our troops.
     There was some skirmishing at Yorktown a few days ago -- favorable to us, and I suppose the
     great fight must soon come off -- The varied success of war has been our fate, and I suppose
     will be, but of our ultimate success there cannot be the shadow of a doubt if our rulers and
     people do their duty, and I think they will, though we must be tried in the school of adversity
     before we use our strength as we ought to -- and be -- willing to be disciplined -- Of course
     it is not my business to tell what I may happen to know is to be done, for such things should
     not be made known <pb n="3"/>
     <unclear>I</unclear> am somewhat stiff and sore today from my long ride and exposure yesterday,
     but am perfectly well -- We are quartered in a house, and therefore are secure from inclemency
     at night. I am sorry, truly sorry, that Jordan was in such a condition yesterday, and I do not
     know what may come of it to him, but I am sure the Gen. will see that he is properly looked
     after -- when Ashby's men are with him they behave gallantly, but when they are away they lack
     the inspiration of his presence, and being undisciplined they often fail to do any good -- only
     a few days ago a company of 50 of them were taken prisoners through a lack of care in guarding
     themselves. The excitement was intense along the line of our march this side of Harrisonburg,
     and many left their homes -- I suppose they will return now -- But I do not look for quiet for
     some time to come, the war is only begun and Heaven only can tell what the future has in store
     for us -- but the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, and he will do right, and if we are right we
     shall surely prosper, no matter how dark the heavens may now appear they must become brighter,
     and through the thick gloom I think we may see the glimmerings of a brighter dawn -- God grant
     it may soon come. Give my kind love to relations and friends, and kiss my spared children for
     me -- I wish I could see you, but the Gen. says I may not be spared now -- Send this up and let
     Brother and family read it, as I have not time to write him now though I desire to -- I have
     been busy all day, though it is Sunday, by order, and may I be forgiven for it. Send your next
     letter to Staunton, care of Capt. Bell <abbr expan="Assistant Quarter Master">A.Q.M.</abbr> to
     forward by Gen. Jackson's courier -- if we are not back into the Valley before you get this. I
     hope the children have gotten well and that all things work together for good -- May God grant
     that they do and bless you all -- </p>
