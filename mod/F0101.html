<p class="p10">Dear Jennie </p>
<p class="p10">next time I write I will likely be able to give you some of my adventures in
                    Lovettsville for I have been detailed to work in the Lov. Bakery at that place.
                    I was down to town this afternoon and seen some very pretty ladies who will
                    likely get acquainted with this chicken before many weeks roll around But now Jennie you must not get jealous for I am resolved
                    not to fall in love with any of them, only just for the occasion.</p>
<p class="p10">You asked my advice as to how you should spend your next summer - I am really
                    surprised to think you would ask me what <i>[deleted: had to]</i> to employ
                    yourself at when you are better able to judge for yourself. you know your circumstances better than I do. So my advice
                    is to do the best you can<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Now Jennie dear as it is getting late you
                    must excuse me for not writing more tonight I must go to the bakery early in the
                    morning so good night dear girl Good night</p>
<p class="p10">Very Affectionately Yours </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Lucius P. Mox </i></p>
<p class="p10">Please write now to Lucius </p>
