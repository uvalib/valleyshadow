     Confederate States of America Head Quarters Forces at Staunton, Va.

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sept. 4th, 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">General-</p>
<p class="p10">Your order to Col. Baldwin commanding 52nd Regiment Va. Volunteers was recd &amp; he
      has been pressing to get a portion of the Regiment ready to leave by
     Friday or Saturday. I write to suggest that if it is not <u>absolutely
      necessary</u> that a portion of the Regiment should leave here on Friday or Saturday, if you
     will order the whole Regiment to leave here on Tuesday next. I think I can safely say, you can
     rely on it that our whole Regiment will be at Monterey on the fourth day after Tuesay next. I
     think it very desirable all should move together. Please answer by return express.</p>
<p class="p10">Capt. Otey's Company from Bedford Co. is here. A very fine Co. Number 127 men. Waiting here
     for 4 pieces of artillery and Major Gorgas informs me he cannot get them for three weeks. Would
     it not be well to have him join you with his Company armed with muskets &amp; his artillery
     could follow him. Capt. Morrison's Co. is also here from Rockbridge--it can be ready in a few
     days. The arms for a portion of our Regiment will reach here on Monday from Richmond. Yours
     very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10">M.G. Harman Major, Comdg.</p>
