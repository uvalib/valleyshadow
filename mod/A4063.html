<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Nov. 30<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp 3 miles below Verdiersville, Orange Co -- Va</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Though it is quite late, My darling -- I am weary, yet I know you will be anxious to hear
     from me &amp; that you have often thought of me this day -- with all the hearts devotion of
     a loving wife - especially as this is my birthday -- but I cannot speak of that - We are still
     confronting the enemy on opposite sides of the Mine Run some 14 miles N of E from Orange Court House we have thrown up a long line of strong entrenchments
     &amp; await their coming -- in some places the lines are not more than 200 yds apart -- and
     today we have had some heavy artillery firing from the enemy -- to which we did not reply much, reserving our fire -- they did us some damage -- a few
     wounded by uselessly exposing themselves &amp; 3 or four killed -- whom I did not learn --
     the enemy has been moving to our right &amp; we anticipate a fight tomorrow -- some little
     skirmishing has been going on too -- Mosley fell on the Yankee trains at Brandy &amp;
     destroyed a number of wagons &amp; brought off prisoners -- &amp; Stuart fell on the
      <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>rear of Sedgwick's Corps below here &amp; took a number of prisoners --</p>
<p class="p10"> Today has been very cold &amp; chilly -- a keen north wind, but our men endure all
     without a murmur, models of patience &amp; fortitude -- God must bless our arms -- for
     there is so much devotion in our Army &amp; so much reliance on the justice of our course
     --</p>
<p class="p10"> All are in fine spirits &amp; hope for the best --</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye &amp; God bless you -- All my loved ones at home --</p>
<p class="p10">Write as usual -- &amp; I shall get it -- </p>
<p class="p10">Yours &amp;c</p>
