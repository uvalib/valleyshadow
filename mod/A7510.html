<h4>Augusta County: James H. Blakemore to Mary Anna
                    Sibert, September 11, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Blakemore describes his dejection after hearing of the fall of Atlanta but
                    reports that he is now as optimistic as ever. He describes the various ways in
                    which he passes the time in camp, including performing in a musical group and
                    mischievously encouraging an epistolary romance between his Sergeant Major and
                    Mary Anna Sibert.</p>

<p class="p10">Yours of the 27th of Last month <i>[unclear: Inst.]</i> came safely to hand
                    Yesterday, and I Will reply at once. you can only imagine how greedily I devoured its contents. And indeed it was a
                    rich Treat to me. It gave me a great deal of pleasure to
                    peruse it line by line; Every Word was Interesting and cheering to me, For I
                    must confess, it <i>[unclear: arrived]</i> in a very good time, for I was very
                    much down in the mouth about The fall of Atlanta. Just before, I had been raised
                    to the very highest pinnacle that imagination could
                    place a man, on the peace question. With the hopes that, Atlanta could hold out
                    This campaign, but alas! all my bright visions of
                    peace was blasted. My hopes of the pleasure of
                    meeting my old friends as a Freeman and enjoying my
                    self as of years gone by, in their company. then, to give up all, I admit it was too much for me, but
                    your cheerful letter cure me<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to brighten
                    up again, and bring back the old cheerful smile on my
                    pug. I Soon banished all despondency, and now, I am Just as hopeful as Ever, and
                    about the Same old <i>[unclear: Sort]</i>. I heard Good news from Georgia <i>[deleted: ]</i>. Soon after, I heard that Hood had Whipped The Yanks good.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Well]</i> miss Mollie our Division had a Smart little fight on the
                    3rd at Berryville only 3 Brigades was engaged, the other did not get up in time
                    We fought 2 corps of Yankees, charged their breastworks &amp; drove them out &amp; held them until We left the 3rd day. the Yanks would not fight. So we Would
                    not Stay any longer, our loss was very small considering the great advantages
                    the Yanks had over us. We had to charge through a open field of half mile under
                    a heavy fire but our whole loss was only 175. our Div was all the troop there.
                    the Yankee paper admit a loss of 300. We Just cleaned them up. I was a spectator
                    of the whole It is an <u>awful</u>
                    <u>Grand</u>
                    <u>Sight</u> but <i>[illeg.]</i> is something<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>fascinating about it We came back to Winchester on the 5th. I found the
                    Stonewall Brigade in camp in Sight of our camp of course. I had to go over to
                    see the boys. I found them all well &amp; in fine Spirits. all hopeful of
                    speedy peace. the old Brigade is gone up the Spout. very
                    few of the old boys here. It was here, that I learned the whereabouts of Your Bro John. Oh, I know it must
                    have taken a great load of uncertainty off the minds of
                    your family. I know I felt very much released. For I did not know if he was dead
                    or not. I am Truly Glad it was no Worse God grant he may be permitted to return
                    to the bosom of Those That love him. I Should love to
                    see John. I hope to meet him in Solon. I Wish I was there now. I know I Should
                    enjoy myself <i>[unclear: finly]</i>. I think I may get home Some <i>[unclear: tim]</i> this year. This is a Beautiful Country
                    Oh, I Should love to live in this County. Well Miss Mollie I had a good laugh at
                    the Sergeant Major When I told him what you
                        wrote<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>he is such a modest young man, it made him blush. he is
                    perfectly carried a way and if you send many more such messages to him he will
                    go up the Spot. but I have not much fears about you &amp; his Lordship <u>getting married</u> for this reason. he
                    is so very diffident and your shyness of man; Will
                    make it a matter of impossibility to get up a match With out calling in the
                    Third person &amp; of course that Will be my self, of course, and of course,
                    you Will find out that I will do all in my Power to break up the match as I have an interest in
                    your future Welfare myself. Perhaps more than you dream of and can't bear the
                    idea of the Sergeant
                    <i>[unclear: carrying]</i> of the prize, for then I should go up the spout, But
                    If We <i>[unclear: Come]</i> up the Valley, I shall bring him along, &amp; Will give him a fair chance I Will stand off
                    &amp; Say Nothing, but Will keep an Eye on <u>him</u>,
                        <u>haha</u>. <u>Now don't</u> you go
                        <u>in Love with</u>
                    <u>him</u>, haha<br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>You spoke of some young lady in Mt
                    Solon going to take a <u>Hu</u>sband but did not say who the
                    fortunate Genl was, or (unfortunate) as the future Will Show) you Wish to know
                    if I was like the rest of Man kind. I have a poor Opinion of the ladies
                    faithfulness to man Well, Miss Mollie, I Will be Candid. There are some few
                    women in the world who are devoid of a particle of love or honor, but thes are
                    very few but all Women have loved Somebody I do not look upon the whole class of
                    Women &amp; being heartless, because one has
                    Jilted me. If I am so unfortunate to place my affections on an object &amp;
                    and I find it is misplaced why I must just do the best I can, &amp; not
                    curse the whole human race for what that woman done, no I will not do that for I
                    Love the Ladies; I could not think what young Lady you <i>[unclear: spoke]</i>
                    of as my sweet heart. I did not know I<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>was so fortunate as to have
                    one, for I have been a long time since I had a sweet
                    heart. I Will Come up and find out who her Ladyship is. I know I shall be
                    perfectly happy in her Love. I will trust her. I have <i>[unclear: quite]</i> a
                        merry tim with my Sergeant Major I <i>[unclear: hav]</i> got him all Right. Now, I will
                    have him dream of Beautiful Eyes &amp; <u>Beauti</u>fu<u>l L</u>a<u>kes</u> &amp; <u>pleasant Boat Rides on Said</u>
                    Lakes &amp; the very pleasant Moonlight walks over
                    Many Romantic paths around our desolate litle
                    village, but he think it is one of the most beautiful Spots in Virginia I have
                    Just painted the Ladies &amp; (y<u>ours</u>elf) &amp;
                    the town and the country in the most Glowing colors
                    that imagination could <u>paint</u>. I know it is wrong but
                    Miss <u>Mollie</u>, I must have something to pass away the
                        time. I have nothing to read no place to go, only
                    once in awhile, then I am uneasy all the time, for fear the
                    <i>[unclear: Rgt]</i> may move. I was out serenading last night &amp; had a very pleasant
                    time Sometimes I go out with the Prof. he plays on the
