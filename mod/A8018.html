<h4>Augusta County: Alexander H. H. Stuart to His

</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Stuart tells his brother of political infighting in Richmond, and that with all

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 15th 61</p>
<p class="p10">Richd</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">William H. Clarke of Halifax wishes you to send him a barrel of your best
                    Whiskey, care of I. Pannell Shockoe slip Richmond--send the very best--Nothing
                    was said as to price--</p>
<p class="p10">You have doubtless seen with pleasure that Wm. Stuart has distinguished himself
                    at Bethel. I understand that he was especially complimented in the official
                    dispatches.</p>
<p class="p10">He is very much in want of a horse. How would our young Brown Mare answer? If she
                    will do, let us give her to him--If she will not, then let us get one that will
                    suit, &amp; send him to William. Get Byers or some good judge to buy one.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather is awfully hot here. I have rarely felt it so oppressive--We cannot
                    tell how long our session will last--Possibly we may adjourn next week--possibly
                    not for six weeks.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I should be delighted to get away.</p>
<p class="p10">What of Placo? If he comes down, send me a few bottles of best whiskey for my
                    friends here--</p>
<p class="p10">I have not received a line from home since I arrived
                    here. The Post office seems to be abominably managed.</p>
<p class="p10">I paid a visit to Toombs a few nights ago--the other dignitaries, I have not yet
                    seen--I will call on them after a while.</p>
<p class="p10">Troops are constantly coming on, but not as fast as I could wish--The enemy are
                    in great force, &amp; augmenting their strength daily--We have no news
                    today--There will be big battles before long--one is expected near Yorktown,
                    &amp; there will probably be one at Harpers Ferry or Manassas Gap.</p>
<p class="p10">My Committee on Constitutional reforms met last night--I think they will sanction
                    substantially, my recommendations with the exception of election of Governor by
                    the Legislature. They prefer<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the election by the people--I hope
                    before the convention adjourns, we shall have a good constitution.</p>
<p class="p10">We have a most miserable spirit prevailing in the Convention--a spirit of carping
                    &amp; bitter hostility to Letcher--Such men as Harris, Ambler, Garnett seem
                    disposed to assail him on every frivolous pretext--Their purpose is to organize
                    a party of extreme men to monopolize the offices! They are a sorry
                        <i>[unclear: creed]</i>!</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you will write some &amp; let me know how every thing is getting on.</p>
<p class="p10">Love to Sandy &amp; any of my folks who may be with you.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alex H. H. Stuart</i></p>
