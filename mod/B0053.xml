                <p>In a letter written by her son, Sarah Craig disputes the claims of a former

                    <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>yesterday Archibald Smith came for the things that Ellen Taylor had left in my
                    care until she sent for them; these I let him have &amp; such other things
                    as I could spare.</p>

                <p>I too was greatly astonished, when I saw the letter from you, concerning the
                    wages of said Ellen as I thought we were square. As to the crop of <hi
                        rend="underline">Corn</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Potatoes</hi>
                    raised by Toby Taylor (Ellens Husband) I will say that I had to study awhile
                    before I knew what it meant; then I recollected that told Toby that he might
                    have a piece of corn (about an Acre) if he would attend to it; but unfortunately
                    for him he took sick and died before the corn was gathered.</p>

                <p>I also told him he might have a piece of ground for <hi rend="underline"
                    >Potatoes</hi>; he planted them, <del hand="h1">and died before they came</del>
                    but they were never gathered in, they rotted in the ground. This you see was
                    before the negroes were free (in 1864) so I think I am clear of that.</p>

                <p>As to <hi rend="underline">Ellen's</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">wages</hi>, I told her when she first was set free that I
                    would give her her victuals &amp; clothes if she would stay with me. She
                    stayed until about 2 months ago, when she left; and now I think it would be
                    great injustice for me to have to repay her.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I sent you a note by A. Smith stating that I would be in town in a few days
                    &amp; see you but other arrangements makes me write this to you instead. I
                    hope this will make all things right.</p>
