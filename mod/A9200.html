<p class="p10">Dear cousin</p>
<p class="p10">I received my box the 12 I was very glad to get it I would of written yesterday but yesterday morning before sun up
                        the yankees came on us
                    They had us
                    very
                    near
                    surrounded
                    There was three 1000 yankees and about 14,100 of our men
                        We had two fights the yankees
                        divided and went two ways
                    our Regiment was in the ditches I was in front of the
                    battle the whole time the yankees had the advantage of our men they got
                    in the tree tops behind logs and behind stumps so that we could not see them when <i>[added: 
                        we
                    ]</i>
                    would look over the bank they
                    would shoot at us I was very
                    near give out when i got to the ditches it was the
                    first time I had been out any
                    distance for some time I had <i>[added: no]</i>
                    orders to go but I went and took good aim at the yankees but I can't say that I
                        killed
                    any the balls fell like hail the
                    yankees killed a good many of
                        <i>[added: our]</i>
                    officers
                    They
                    killed<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Captain
