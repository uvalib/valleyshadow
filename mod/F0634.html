<p class="p10">Stevensburg Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your most kind &amp; loving letter yesterday evening containing two
     Photographs which I think looks very natural. I sent one of them to W<sup>m</sup>
     this morning. we have had a very rough time of it since the 15<sup>th</sup> until the 17<sup>th</sup>. we drove the rebels from the
     rappahannock river to the Rapidan river.</p>
<p class="p10">On the first day we drove the rebels from brandy station to Culpeper and from there to the
     rear of Slaughter mountain. on our next day we drove them across the Rapidan river. There the rebels<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> was entrenched all
     along the river side but we kept up a very steady fire on them all day
     and the same night our regiment tied our horses in the woods one mile from their breast works and we crept up to the rebels breast works on our hands and feet
     when daylight appeared the rebels was walking along on their works. then we got up and let terrible
     fire on them. the rebels dropped in their
     holes. Then they opened on us with there artillery and we was so close to them that we
      used to drive their canoniers from there
      pieces every time they would show themselves. we had to lay and watch them all
     day if we would undertake to get back that day they would rake us all to pieces: and we stayed there until dark then we came back. the day following they<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>charged on the 4<sup>th</sup> N.Y.
     Cavalry and took one squadron prisoners, and our reg<sup>t</sup> charged on them on
     foot down a hill. the rebels opened on us with all
     their artillery but we drove them back across the river again and kept
     them there until yesterday till the infantry came and relieved us. So you can judge that we had some hard fighting. The
     saddles were not off of our horses from the 13<sup>th</sup>
     until the 17<sup>th</sup> in the evening. we are fell back
     at the present to rest our horses and ourselves.</p>
<p class="p10">General Buford gave our regiment great praises for gallant charge
     we made on foot. had it not been for our Regiment they would have
     captured General Buford and all his staff eating supper in their tents General Buford is commanding our<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Division. General
     Kilpatrick is commanding the 2<sup>nd</sup> Division
      <i>[illeg.]</i>
     General Greg is comanding the 3<sup>rd</sup> Division and
     General <i>[unclear: Beasenton]</i> has got command of those three divisions. Those are all
     Cavalry.</p>
<p class="p10">You can see the details of the fight better
     than I can tell you. we have done our share in this fight now we leave
     the infantry to finish it.</p>
<p class="p10">from your Affectionate Brother</p>
