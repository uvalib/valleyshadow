<p class="p10">July 9/60</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John.</p>
<p class="p10">I got home from Richmond Saturday evening &amp;
                    found your letters here- I purposely delayed writing to you till I could do so
                    Satisfactorily- I <u>have</u> made a contract with the
                    Waddells- I paid them $500. for the <u>exclusive</u> right to
                    Sell their invention for 5 years throughout the United States- I am to pay all
                    my expenses and account to them for 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of the amount
                    of Sales, every three months,- They binding me not to dispose of my 1/3<sup>rd</sup> interest to any one during the 5 years- I have been to
                    Richmond- Have had a number of these Couplings made for trial- They will be put
                    on the Central road today, and worked up on the mail train West, tomorrow- I
                        have<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>no doubt of its entire success- I now make you this
                    proposition Take any State you choose except Virginia &amp; Maryland (&amp; <u>here</u> you may still have the Virginia &amp; Tennessee
                    Railroad) do your best at it and after paying your
                    expenses first out of the 1/3<sup>rd</sup> I am entitled to from the
                    Waddell's divide equally with me- And then, if after you have made this
                    experiment, you are willing to go on with other States, on the same terms--it's
                    all right- By this arrangement I don't ask or expect you to pay any part of the
                    $500- If you agree to go into it, come over and we will fix all the necessary
                    papers- The Waddells were not willing to sell to any one but myself
                    individually- &amp; would not contract to sell to me till I agreed not to
                    sell out- But under their deed to me I can employ any agents I choose on any
                    terms I please- &amp; under this clause you &amp; I can arrange matters-</p>
<p class="p10">Ritchie &amp; <i>[unclear: Dunnarant]</i> are Lithographing it for me, so
                    that a circular may be sent to every Railroad office in
                    the United States- I am greatly encouraged by what has
                    been said of the invention by Railroad men. I have made
                    arrangements to put it on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad in a few days- I have no doubt of a sale to them-</p>
<p class="p10">Gill must be mistaken when he says McDaniel has seen this coupling. I am sure he
                    never has- He has seen one invented &amp; patented by an Alexandria man
                    about the same time- I have examined it- It will <u>couple</u> pretty well- but there is no provision made for <u>uncoupling</u> the cars- It wont answer at all. He has it
                    in Richmond, but mine knocked it into such a <i>[unclear: cocked]</i> hat that
                    the fellow left-</p>
<p class="p10">I write in much haste-<br>Give our love to Cousin
                    Liz-<br>Mary's Sisters are here-</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
