<p class="p10">May 12<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Barnesville </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister! </p>
<p class="p10">Having some leisure moments this evening i will write you a few lines, which i
                    hope may find you in as good health as i enjoy at present. I wrote you a letter
                    while we were encamped near Hampton, but i have not heard from you since. We
                    left Hampton on sunday the 4<sup>th</sup>
                    instant and marched to Yorktown at sunset. we
                    encamped there that night, it began to rain about midnight and our beds got
                    pretty well soaked again <i>[illeg.]</i> morning as we
                    had no tents along. on monday morning i went through<br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br>the forts and
                    camps around Yorktown which the rebels evacuated on saturday night. they left
                    most of their camp equippage and a great many cannons. as i came back towards
                    our camp two men had just been blown up by shells which the <i>[added: rebels]</i> have buried all around their works in the ground
                    and which explode if any body treads on them.</p>
<p class="p10">i had walked through the gate three times where one man was blown up but fortunately did not happen to tread on any of them. on
                    Tuesday night we were in line of battle all night, as the rebels had outflanked
                    our left wing. they were coming towards Yorktown again, but when they found that
                    we were ready for them they retreated again. on saturday morning we marched from
                        Yorktown<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and arrived at Williamsburg in the evening, where a
                    battle had been fought on monday. the town is full of wounded soldiers and rebel
                    prisoners. the most of the women stayed in the town but there are not many men
                    to be seen. we encamped about a mile beyond Williamsburg for the night and
                    started off again on sunday morning at 4 O'clock. we
                    marched as far as Barnesville about two miles from west point where we are now
                    encamped, but i expect we will go on further before many days; one company of
                    the 6<sup>th</sup> regular cavalry, who are brigaded with us, had a
                    scrimmage yesterday. they routed four companies of
                    rebel cavalry killing 18 and wounding 35 which they took prisoners, beside them
                    that got away; today two of our men were found in the woods<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>tied to a
                    tree and brains blown out. i do not know what regiment
                    they belong to. I am in hopes that the war will soon be over, for i think the
                    rebels will give up after we get Richmond. the weather has been good this while
                    past, but it is getting very warm down here. i must now close my letter with my
                    best respects to you all and all inquiring friends. i should like to hear from
                    you soon.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Brother </p>
