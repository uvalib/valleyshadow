<p class="p10">Dear Giney</p>
<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to drop you a line to let you know how and
      where I am through the blessing of a kind
     providence I am in the enjoyment of tolerable health at this time hoping if this reaches you it
     may find you enjoying the same blessing. I have not heard from you
     for some time owing to circumstances over which
     we have no control though I hope it will not
     continue so long this note I expect to send by hand to <i>[illeg.]</i> do not know
     whether you will get it or not but I thought would try it thinking
     you would like to hear from here I have heard
     from the neighborhood of Swoops since the raid, from what I can
     learn you have not suffered this time though I have not heard the
      particulars<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Well Giney Since last writing to you we
     have left our old camp moved more to the left of the line we are now in the regular breastworks a little
     to the <i>[deleted: right]</i> left of Petersburg 8 or 10 miles from where
     we
     <i>[illeg.]</i> before it is about 2 miles from here to Petersburg.
     this is a better country around here than where
     we
     were before but our quarters are not so good as they were this is what they call living in the ground our Pickets are in talking distance
     with the Yanks sometimes they trade
     <i>[illeg.]</i> for Tobacco, they call us Johnny rebs sometimes they
     say come over Johnny and get some coffee
     we can see all their works and men can see the
     cars running Well Giney I do not know how I
     may like the change but think it no worse it is likely we may stay here
     awhile, write to me whenever you can</p>
<p class="p10">So I close by remain yours <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.P. Dull</i></p>
