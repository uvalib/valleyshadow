<p class="p10">Camped front of rebels</p>
<p class="p10">dear wife</p>
<p class="p10">I set myself this morning to let you know that I am well at present and I hope
                    these lines will find you all well. I was out on picket on Sunday night and monday and I saw lots of
                        rebels
                    where we stand picket and farther from the rebels there is this <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and was five rebels
                    come    over and said that they couldn't stand it much longer and were laying
                    at <i>[unclear: the]</i> breastworks. we are not in
                    very much danger.</p>
<p class="p10">Hally I would like to see you and
                        the
                    little
                    onesbut I don't suppose that I
                    will for awhile but I want you
                    to send me your likeness and I want
                    Mary's and Annie's and if
                        thereis anyone<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    taking likenesses there any
                    place I want you to get yours
                    and little Joseph on one plate and send them as soon as
                        you can for I think long to see
                    them. Philip is well and the rest of the <i>[added: the boyes]</i>. Philip sent his <i>[unclear: clothes]</i>
                    home and I sent you to <i>[illeg.]</i> and some
                    knives and my neckerchief and you can get them
                    there. Hally I dream about home nearly every night. I dream that I was talking to you and you were
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>. I want you to send them likenesses as soon as you can for I think long to get
                    them. I wrote two letters to pap and I wrote you one and I haven't got any yet but I think I will get
                        one soon.</p>
<p class="p10">I can set in my tent and see the steeples in Petersburg. See them very plain. We
                    have moved about 5 miles from the camp that we was at when I wrote to you
                    before. There was a man shot in our regiment. He was shot by one of his own men.
                    He was on picket and he went to relieve him and he halted him and he did not
                    stop. Nothing more at present but write and write as soon as you get this
                    letter.</p>
