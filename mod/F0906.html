<p class="p10">March the 26<sup>th</sup>, 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Camp In Front of Petersburg<br> Army of the Potomac</p>
<p class="p10">Well Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I feel it my duty this pleasant Sabbeth Evening to inform you that
     I just came from the hospital from seeing your husband and he requested me to write you a
     letter to let you know how he was and what had happened him. the Rebs did make a break in
     through the picket line about one mile from this yesterday morning and we was called out about
     5 o'clock and about 6 o'clock we was in
     line of battle in front of the enemy and we had just gave them two volleys when Sylvester and
      I<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> was both wounded. Sylvester is wounded through the leg
     but I guess the bone is not fractured any at least he thinks so.
     He was in very good spirits today and I
     think that it won't be sore very long. I got a
     slight tap through one of my fingers on the left hand. Mine is a vrey
     light wound but it is pretty sore today. Sylvester was taken to the
     Hospital just shortly after he was wounded and I came back to camp. There was eight wounded in
     our Company and one killed. The rest of the boys are all out yet lying at the breastworks. There was some of them had to go on picket last night
     but they will come in this evening but we drove the rebs back and they lost a good many men. They had taken two or three of our <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>forts before we
     got to them but we soon took them all back and the report is that we took fifteen hundred
     prisoners. There was over three hundred of the rebs filled and our loss doesn't exceed more than three hundred killed wounded and missing. The 100<sup>drth</sup> Reg and the 200<sup>drth</sup> Regt, 207<sup>th</sup>, 208<sup>th</sup>, 209<sup>th</sup>, 211<sup>th</sup>
     was in the fight. Old General Lee told his men that they would go to City Point again. Eleven
      o'clock when they started but the old fellow missed that game but if
     they would had one half hour more they would been at Meads Station and that is on the City
     Point railroad. Well I must soon bring my scribling to a close
     for I will have to get at and get supper for Phillip and Will Sibert so I have it ready when they come in. So nothing more at present<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> But before I
     close I will give you the names of the rest of the boys that was wounded in our Company. There
     is Corporal Samuel G. Smith, Corporal Daniel T. Ritter, David E. Saylor, Sergeant Smith, William Hull and George Emory had part of the sole shot off one of his shoes
     but did not touch his foot. And Corporal Shull was killed. So now I
     will close which I do in good health with the exception of a sore finger.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully yours</p>
