<h4>Augusta County: Margaret Ott to Enos Ott, December
                    6, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter to her brother, Margaret writes of efforts to start a petition to
                    get Enos out of the army as well as the efforts of neighbors to harvest their
                    crops. In the postscript, she mentions Confederate efforts to impress slaves
                    from citizens and her refusal to send their slave, Alf, off to them.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">we are all well and doing very well consider<i>[added: ing]</i> every thing. Jinnie and I received your letter saturday I was at the
                        office when the stage came
                    I saw John W. Henry and Frank M<sup>c</sup>Nutt come home last
                    saturday evening on detail for 20 days and I think
                    very likely he can get his detail extended. he got it
                    to come home and bail his hay and get up his corn and gather up all he can. Elec went home last week he brought a man down with him to help put up corn or to do any thing we have for him to do he is not very smart he
                    never says any thing with out we ask him questions. they
                    are putting up corn every day the weather will admit.
                    Old Peet and Barkley won't work half the time we expect to butcher tomorrow. Frank M<sup>c</sup>Nutt was here yesterday he says Miss Ann R. McNutt is not well she has sore throat Doctor Bill has moved in M<sup>r</sup> Robert M<sup>c</sup>Nutts house <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>M<sup>r</sup> Black and
                    James Cooper went to town to day with your account book. we had been talking
                        about
                    getting up a petition and
                    sending down to Richmond to get you off. I was very
                    glad to hear that you got your box we were very fearful that some one might brake it open, but
                    it was a very common looking box they thought
                    there
                    wasn't
                    much in it. well I must close hoping to see you home
                    soon.</p>
<p class="p10">yours most truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Maggi H Ott</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS they are drafting the negros they notified me to report Alf last friday I got M<sup>r</sup> Black attend to it for me I told him I could not spare him Doctor M<sup>c</sup>Chesney went to town
                        saturday to hire a hand we under stood he did not get
                            any I do not know what they're going to make of it. Henry says positively Alf is not to go. Jinnie and
                        Charlott send
                        their love to you. Your sister Mag.</p>
