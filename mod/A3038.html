<h4>Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris, April 4, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Pastor writes to ask why Annie has not written him lately. This is a very common theme in
          his letters to Annie (and in her letters to him). He mentions meeting with Yankees on the
          picket line in his postcript.</p>

<p class="p10">Camp Winder</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10"> As Jim Buck is going to send a letter by Ms. Fulton to you in the morning, I will take
          the privilege of dropping you a few lines. I wrote you immediately after my return to camp
          but from some cause or other, I have (as yet) not heard from it. Don't know whether you
          got it or not. Perhaps I mistreated you in some way other, If so, I ask your pardon. You
          know we promised to write every two weeks, which I fully intended doing. But if it is <u>your</u>
          <u>desire</u> (which I trust is not the case) to cease corresponding I of course submit. I thank you very kindly
          indeed for the interest you manifested in my welfare. I will
          close for the present, As I only write to know the cause of your silence. And if I have
          done you injustice I trust you will forgive me</p>
<p class="p10">With much respect I remain your true friend and wellwisher.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Tony Pastor</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. <br> We have just returned from picket where we enjoyed
            ourselves very much indeed. Talking to the yankees, Fishing, &amp;.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
            Sabbath morning<br> How are you this beautiful morning? Well
            I hope. I must tell you my dream last night. I dreamed that you and I were married, the
            war over, and all at home having a good time generally. What think you of this dream? Is
            it good or bad. I Shall expect to hear from you in a short time, in reply to this
            note.<br> Tony Pastor </p>
