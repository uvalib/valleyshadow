<p class="p10">Gettysburg</p>
<p class="p10">My dear friend--</p>
<p class="p10">I am very sorry I did not have an opportunity of seeing you when in Gettysburg. I wanted to talk to you about several matters,
                    but was compelled to <i>[unclear: leave]</i>. <i>[illeg.]</i> this is a very
                        <i>[unclear: -ful]</i> matter. I am severely thinking of getting married!
                    Foolish, you think. Go and do likewise and you will be wise, some of your
                    friends would say. Ned, if it be possible, I would like you to give me a helping
                    hand in that occasion -- the last day of <u>May</u>. I want
                    John Morris and yourself. It will occupy but little of your time. You can reach
                    York by leave <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    Washington at noon, and can return next day if necessary.
                        <u>Alice Bayler and Mary Watson</u> will be the
                    bridesmaids. I know there might be <i>[unclear: contingencies]</i> in which it
                    will be difficult to <i>[deleted: not]</i> leave, but if it be possible I
                    would like very much to have you present The ceremony will take place in <u>the church</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Please write me in response to it, and if you have time let me have a little
                    political consolation in matters and <i>[illeg.]</i> in the <u>East</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>WH Buehler</i></p>
