     <salute>Dear Brother</salute>
    </opener>
    <p>I received yours this morning of the 12<hi rend="super">th</hi> Aug<hi rend="super">st</hi>
     and am happy to find that all are in enjoyment of good health as i am the same there are a
     great many sick of our reg't just now there is one Lieutenant and a private laying dead in the
     hospital at the <orig reg="present">presant</orig> time we have very few officers belonging to
     the Reg't just now we we have no Colonel no Lieutenant Col or Major last friday we were ordered
     to hold ourselves in readiness to march at four <orig reg="o'clock">oclock</orig> next morning
     with seven days rations we were out at the appointed time waiting for orders but they were
     countermanded and we are still here on duty every day either on guard or fatigue I am glad to
     hear that they are so ready to enlist in <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Penna</abbr> so they need
     not draft but they will get tired enough before their nine months are out our Reg't was one
     year in service on the 20<hi rend="super">th</hi> Aug and i would not care if it would have
     been three it is very tiresome laying at one place so long although i dont<pb n="2"/> care
     about going farther north before spring being as were kept down here in the heat of summer we
     are now pretty well used to this climate and it would go very hard for us to stand the winter
     of virginia it will soon get cooler here the nights are cool and very heavy dew falls during
     the night we had a great <unclear>seine</unclear> fishing last week we were just preparing to
     haul in with the <unclear>seine</unclear> when the sailors saw us they said we should let them
     fish for us as we <orig reg="didn't">did'nt</orig> understand it we <orig reg="allowed"
     >alowed</orig> them they hauled in but could not drag the <unclear>seine</unclear> out we had
     to assist them we caught about five barrels of fish the first haul in about two hours we had as
     many as the whole Reg't wanted the fish resembles a large <orig reg="heron">herron</orig> and
     some Cat fish we mostly catch the cat fish with hook and line i cannot content myself fishing
     down here i would like to get alongside the <unclear>Codornis</unclear> once again. Stevens is
     well at <orig reg="present">presant</orig> Give my respect to Sisters father and all <orig
      reg="inquiring">enquiring</orig> friends </p>
