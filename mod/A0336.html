<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">Sir I Received your letter on the 15th and was glad to hear from you all at home
                    but sorry to hear that you have a sore hand again you stated in your letter that
                    if I needed any thing to write I would like to have a pair of winter Boots
                    Harvey Fry wrote a few lines to John Plecker to have a pair made for himself and
                    me we have not received any answer yet if you will see him you would know if he
                    can make them or not he has my Measure for fine boots I suppose he could guess
                    at and make the allowance I want them made tolerable large if he can make them I
                    would like for you to see him soon if he cant make them maybe you could get me a
                    pair some where else We can draw as many shoes as we want but no boots as we
                    expect to make our winter quarters here I would like to have a good pair of
                    boots I have a pair of buckskin gloves in my over coat pocket upstairs you might
                    send along if you will as I think I will need them here this winter in the
                    mountains Fry and me had intended to have our things sent together here maybe
                    you can fix it that they can be sent together that is all I want sent now we got
                    our blankets the other day and expect our overcoats in a few days we are making
                    preparations to stay here this winter we intend building log cabins to stay in
                    this winter we have also made preparations to fortify we have cut down about a
                    hundred and fifty acres of timber along the greenbank road we intend having a
                    battery on that road we look for Captain Millers cannon here in a few days he is
                    drilling his men very day here the artillery drill he has two pieces of wooden
                    cannon here they go through the operation of loading and firing and so on he has
                    one stationed on an old stump and one on an old two wheeled wagon he picked up
                    out here with one fore and one hind wheel on I was it is about eight or nine
                    miles from here to Greenbriar river I and some of the boys was down at the river
                    last Sunday looking around we seen where the cannon balls had struck about in
                    places that house on the river bank close where the Churchville Cavalry were
                    encamped had ten cannon balls shot through it and the tents where the cavalry
                    stayed in had cannon balls shot through them and a great many of the tents
                    throughout the encampment on the hill had balls shot through six pounders were
                    used the Yankees fired a great many shots but did not do much damage. they fired
                    three times as many shots as our men did our men are well fixed at Greenbriar
                    river now a getting better fixed every day they have three batteries there now
                    they are blockading and fortifying all about there the news come yesterday
                    morning for us to be in readiness at a minutes warning that the Yankees were
                    crossing Greenbriar river our men seemed very anxious for a fight were ready
                    right off we waited in suspense till towards evening the news come that the
                    pickets had a fight amongst them that one of our men was shot in the calf of the
                    leg and five or six Yankees were killed that is all. I know about the fight the
                    most of our men seem to think that they will hardly attack us at Greenbrier
                    river any more than they are trying to slip around towards Petersburg or some
                    place else I got the word that Mother sent me too that if I needed anything to
                    write I have plenty in the way of cloths I have three pair of good pants four
                    shirts four pair of good socks fatigue shirt and 2 uniform coats. boots and
                    gloves is all I want now. we have two good blankets apiece and expect our
                    overcoats every day I think we can keep from freezing any how if we stay here
                    this winter I am well and hope these few lines may find you all enjoying the
                    same state of health Jacob Harvey is well Junius Craun and Adam Craun have the
