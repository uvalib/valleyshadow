                <p>I have received last week two letters from Harpers Ferry giving me the cheering
                    news of your continued health. I have written to John last week, I sent it to
                    Staunton to be sent from there to <abbr expan="Harpers Ferry">H.F.</abbr> by
                        <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Harman. I do not know whether you received
                    that letter; if not I wish you would enquire of your principal Officers for it -
                    or if you see <abbr expan="General Harman">Genl H</abbr> ask him for it. There
                    is no news of interest about Goshen - the War and incidents connected thereto is
                    the all absorbing topic. There are several volunteer Companies now drilling in
                    the County, awaiting orders to march, making an <orig reg="aggregate"
                    >agregate</orig> of Several Hundred beside what has gone. Old Rockbridge is
                    thoroughly aroused and prepared to contribute a full share in resisting the
                    Military Despotism now operating at Washington. We are all well here at home and
                    our hearts as well as your friends about here beat with anxiety for you, praying
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> you may escape unharmed from your Campaign. I want you to
                    write to me as often as possible giving me some account of your Camp Life, how
                    you fare, in Eating, Sleeping &amp; Lodging, anything connected with your
                    situation will be received &amp; read with pleasure. I also wish you to give
                    me a direction how to address my letters so you may get them and I will write to
                    you as often as I can. Tell Charles to write also, and then I will be kept
                    advised of events as they occur. Sallie B. wrote to you did you get her letter
                    write soon &amp; often and the prayers of your Mother &amp; friends will
                    continually rise in your behalf. Abraham send his love to you and the children
                        <pb n="2"/> also desire to be remembered to you both tell Charles I am
                    extremely anxious to hear from him and want him to write to me immediately. The
                    weather is cool &amp; windy more like the month of March than May. Crops
                    look well with a prospect of abundant harvest, farmers are planting Corn in
                    great abundance together with other things that we hope will give plenty to all.
                    Write soon. And a Mother's love &amp; prayers attend you.</p>
