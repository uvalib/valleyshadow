<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to Roswell
                    Waldo, October 28, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>R. M. Manly asks Waldo to notify a Methodist congregation that while they can use
                    their building for religious worship, the school that also uses the building
                    must remain non-denominational.</p>

                    Bureau Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands,<br>Office Superintendent of
                    Education, District of Virginia,
                    Roswell Waldo<br>Assistant

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 28 1868.</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I am directed by the Assistant
                    Commissioner to write to you in reference to the
                    school at Waynesboro, referred to by you in your communication to Captain McDonnell of the 20th inst.</p>
<p class="p10">Referring to the original application of Reverend
                    William C. Echols for aid in erecting that house I find
                    that he expressly states, in so many words, that the building would be used as a
                    house of worship for his church and as a school house "<u>for
                        all children without distinction of sect</u>." On these terms the grant of
                    $150 was made. It appears therefore that the Methodist Church has the right <i>[added: to]</i> the use of the house for Religious worship
                    and that the <u>Public has the right to it for school
                    purposes</u>. Please inform the church of this fact, and <i>[deleted: inform]</i> say to them that <i>[added: the]</i> Bureau
                    expects they will do themselves no discredit and their people no harm by trying
                    to make the school in any way denominational. Baptist and Methodist churches
                    have in many instances been aided in precisely the above manner. </p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>R M Manly Superintendent of Education
                    </i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
