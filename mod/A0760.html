<p class="p10">Dear papa </p>
<p class="p10">I saw Tip Griffin yesterday who told me that you were very uneasy about me. I got
                    to the Regiment Saturday the 9 and would have written yesterday but the mail was carried off before I
                        knew it. I wrote to you once from Columbia and again
                    at Ashland. Tell Ma I am a better hand to take care of my self than she thought.
                    I flanked the Yankees until I got across the James River
                    and please don't be so uneasy about me in the future.</p>
<p class="p10">
                    <i>[unclear: Col]</i> M &amp; Judge say that they think it best for me to
                    join the Wise Troop for three very good reasons. 1 that Captain Steptoe is willing to take me in his mess. 2 you can get
                    nearly twice as much for your horse to eat as a general
                    thing in a small Company than you can in a large &amp; when they issue corn
                    you get a bag for each company and if the company is small you get as much more.
                    3 and best reason you will fare better in that line yourself. You can buy any thing you want from the government at their
                    price with his consent.</p>
<p class="p10">The mail is about to leave and I must close. Love to all the family &amp;
                    Cousin Kate. Direct your letter to Orange
                    Court    House. </p>
