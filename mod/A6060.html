      <u>Dear Cousin Thomas</u>
     </p>
<p class="p10">You have no doubt come to the conclusion that I have forgotten you as I have not written to
     you sooner <u>but not so my good Cousin</u>. Your letter was written the
     27th of June came to NewPort &amp; has lain there until yesterday. I was glad to receive one more letter from my good but absent Cousin. I should like
     very much indeed to hear from you all this evening but was sadly disappointed that I did not
      receive a letter from some of you all today. S H Runnels &amp; John M<sup>c</sup>K both owe me letters. <i>[deleted: but]</i> perhaps they have forgotten I am yet alive. You can tell them I am still
     alive &amp; well. they need not think<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley29b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley29b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      the Republicans have advanced so far as this already. but we dont
     know how soon we may see them perhaps they will have an army around one of these days
     compelling us to take the oaths of allegiance as one of your company did. but I tell you if I
     ever take the oath it will not be binding as I never will consent only to save my life. We are
     all well &amp; getting along very well only we are very much excited about war. We hear
     very little news about anything else &amp; to tell you the truth we don't  feel much interested on any other subject. I don't anyhow
     Cousin Thomas I heard you were ill but dont know whether it is really true. Your Ma &amp;
     Pa have been very uneasy about you as they have not heard from you for some time unless they
     would get a letter today. Ma spent the day at your Pa's one day this
     week found them all well. Your relations in this neighborhood were all well yesterday I suppose
     you have been in an engagement with those notorious Republicans<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley29c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley29c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      that is if you were not sick. We have heard so many results from
     the battle that we scarcely know which one to believe. But if I was a man I would take none of
     the <u>Negro Lovers</u> prisoners I would do my best to kill the last one of
     them. The Newport Militia have lost their <u>little Union Captain</u> the
     oath was administered to the company yesterday and he &amp; Mr Spacy refused to take it so
      they threw him out of office &amp; elected Captain I H Hite in his place. I think it was well done as I never would have mustered
     under a Union man as long as they have done. He said he would remain their Captain if they wished but if he was called to battle he never <u>could fire</u> I think he &amp; the rest of the Hutchen clan had better
     go &amp; be under Lincolns or some other Yankees control awhile</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose friend Beard is looking to tomorrow with feelings of sadness as that is the day
      appointed for him to leave home. He spent the day here last<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley29d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley29d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      Friday had a great deal of pleasure with him he is quite an
     entertaining young man. You can tell him I say I have fallen in love with him since he came
     home &amp; am sorry very sorry he has to leave I think he has improved considerable since
     he left home I told him I thought he had grown better. John R Berry seems quite well now at
     least he looks so &amp; has been working ever since harvest began he has not been visiting
     much since he came home I am afraid he will get out of the way of visiting if he don't follow it up more closely Cousin Tom you spoke in your last letter to
     me about friend Baxter you said he was often talking of the pleasant times he had spent with me
     last winter I am glad to know that they were pleasant times I did in fact spend some <i>[deleted: as]</i> pleasant times with him enjoyed myself as well with him as I ever did with
     any one. You can tell him so. I am as ever one of his friends. I want to know if either you or
     Baxter ever engage in any plays that you have to stoop to let the girls put their arms round
     you. I have often laughed at how you all had to do but I tell you I like to see tall men if
     they do have to stoop occasionally to accomodate the girls. I can't
     bear to see a little bit of a man you know we have several of them about here Cousin Tom I must
     close as it is now getting dark &amp; I can't see the lines When
     you see my friend Baxter Please present<br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<a href="../papers/images/Smiley29.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/Smiley29.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     my good wishes tell him Miss Harriet is not at home yet I suppose
     he knows more about her than I do as I imagine he writes &amp; receives letters from her frequently My best love to Lieutenant M<sup>c</sup>Kemy S F Caison D Henger D F Miller S H Runnels &amp;
     all my other acquaintances not forgetting my good Cousin
     Jimmie M<sup>c</sup> Please write soon as nothing gives me more pleasure than to
      receive a letter from a Soldier The family all send much love to
     you</p>

<p class="p10">Cousin Tom we heard the other day that you were sick in Martinsburg
      &amp; the Yankees had taken you what a story someone did tell I felt very much like
