     <salute>Miss Mary:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>Your very <hi rend="underline">very</hi> welcome letter came to hand on the evening of the
     day before yesterday and deserves my heartiest thanks. I was rejoiced at your punctuality and
     am endeavoring to imitate your example by writing at the earliest <hi rend="underline"
     >possible</hi> hour. I received your letter too late on Monday evening to permit of my
     answering it that day and yesterday I started to Harper's Ferry about six O'clock and returned
     about eight or nine last night. So you see it has been really <hi rend="underline"
     >impossible</hi> for me to write sooner. The length of your letter was if possible even more
     gratifying and though I may not be able, when I am encumbered by military duties, to attempt
     any successful emulation in that respect, yet I must exhort you in the language of the bible
     (now don't look so astonished. I read it sometimes) "not to grow weary in well-doing." I have
     always since my earliest remembrance had an especial admiration for long letters and when I
     have time am rather fond of writing them.</p>

    <p>I have at last succeeded in getting Ma's consent to my joining the army and my name is down
     on the roll of a rifle company which will <orig reg="organize">organise</orig>
     <orig reg="tomorrow">to- morrow</orig>
     <pb n="2"/> and will probably be in camp by the first of next week. I am beginning to feel "as
     savage as a meat <unclear>axe</unclear>" and am afraid before I am in the army long, if I am
     not shot I will get to eating Yankee <orig reg="steak">stake</orig> for breakfast.</p>

    <p>I must <orig reg="confess">confes</orig> I do not think your reasoning on the subject of my
     going to war, entirely logical. I think now that Virginia is invaded it is becoming that every
     true Virginian should shoulder his rifle and march to the rescue. I should have enlisted sooner
     but disliked to go without the consent of my Parents and now that they have very reluctantly
     consented I am preparing to hurry on as fast as possible.</p>

    <p>I had the pleasure of casting the first vote of my life last Thursday and was happy to give
     it in so good a cause as that of ratifying the ordinance of Secession. Our county gave 902
     majority in favour of the Ordinance. We have several abolitionists here round us but I can't
     get any one to help me hang them. I wish I could.</p>

    <p>Is Chum dead, or has he enlisted in the army? I have only received one short note from him
     since I came home and if he is not dead he had better be before I see him again.</p>

    <p>I spent about four or five hours at Harper's Ferry yesterday. It is almost impossible to find
     any one you want to see. I tried to find the Augusta Rifles Capt. Grinman, but could <pb n="3"
     /> not. I had to enquire of about fifty persons before I could even find out where the Cadets
     were stationed.</p>

    <p>You need not have the slightest apprehension of my being disappointed in your letters; if
     they are any thing like the one which I am making a desperate attempt to answer, I would
     consider myself an ugly fellow with dreadfully poor taste if I did not appreciate them.</p>

    <p>You ask me what I think of Carlisle. I think about as well of him as of Scott; he is worse
     than Seward because a Virginian and a thousand times worse than Lincoln because poor fellow he
     don't know any better. Nature has not been unusually bountiful to him with regard to brains. By
     the way the Republicans attempted another of their base strategems in Alexandria. I heard from
     my cousin a day or two since, who was in the army there he said that on the morning the city
     was taken the ships which brought the troops down sent a boat on shore with a flag of truce and
     gave them until nine O'clock to evacuate the city promising not to enter the place until that
     time then as soon as the messenger returned they commenced landing and attempted to surprise
     our troops and take them prisoners. But fortunately they were on the alert and all of them
     escaped except one Fairfax company. Such another cowardly and direct breach of faith is not <pb
      n="4"/> recorded in the history of civilised nations.</p>

    <p>I feel unusually dull this morning, but it is useless to tell you that for you must have long
     since discovered from this disconnected <hi rend="super">&amp; tiresome</hi> letter that I
     am either either unusually or usually boring. Tell Miss Ella I was looking at her "ambrotype"
     last Sunday in church, my cousin admired it very much, indeed I am afraid he will fall in love
     with it which would certainly be quite unfortunate as she is engaged. (I hope her sister is
     not). I will also your question also. I do very often think of her sister. I have treasured
      <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the cockade for though it will not be needed to make me think of you, yet in
     future years when I am forgotten it will minister consolation by reminding me of the time when
     once you agreed to accept my friendship and promised sometimes to think of me. But you know the
     greatest of Poets has said "Woman thy vows are traced in sand." Although my letter is not <hi
      rend="underline">quite</hi> so long as yours I must close, as I have to make preparations for
     leaving.</p>

    <p>By the time you write again I shall probably be in camp in Leesburg so please direct to that
     place, And write me another <hi rend="underline">long</hi> letter <hi rend="underline"
     >very</hi> soon. I hope you will. I am conscious of not being exceedingly deserving but hope
     you will be accommodating nevertheless.</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>I am most truly, Your sincere friend,</salute>
