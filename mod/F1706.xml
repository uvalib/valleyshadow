                <p>H. C. Kendrick, a soldier in the Confederate Army camped near Culpepper,
                    Virginia, writes to his mother about the conditions in camp, and the likelihood
                    that the army will move into Union territory soon. Kendrick discusses what he
                    feels would be justifiable retribution, including burning homes, against the
                    North for the damage wrought in the Confederacy during the war.</p>

                <p>Having moved from the place of my last letter, I deemed it very necessary that I
                    should write to you, as the letter I wrote last, gave the impressive news, that
                    we would have to fight soon, or that a fight would take place soon in <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">Va</abbr>. You will find in the first part of my letter,
                    that we expected to go to Culpepper Court <abbr expan="House">H</abbr>. The
                    place at which we are now <unclear>encamped</unclear>. We arrived here day
                    before yesterday about 2 O'clock in the after noon_ having marched 16 miles, we
                    lay down quietly until the next morning when orders came for a review of the
                    Cavalry and infantry. 5 brigades of cavalry were on the field together with 4
                    brigades of infantry. The infantry did not march on the field any at all.</p>
                <pb n="2"/>
                <p>The cavalry charged a battery of I don't know exactly how many guns. The sight
                    was certainly full of grandeur and military beauty; but rendered somewhat
                    unpleasant by the great quantity of dust, the weather having been dry for
                    sometime. There were a great many citizens, both ladies and gentlemen, to see
                    it. Why it is there are so many Cavalry soldiers in this vicinity I am not
                    entirely prepared to say, but will dare say, they will make a raid in yankeedom
                    before long. I think we will stay at this point some 2 or 3 days longer, perhaps
                    a week. I am still inclined to think, we will invade the enemy's country this
                    summer, as they will doubtless get a great many more cavalry then they now have,
                    and finally make this war a war of pillaging <pb n="3"/> plundering, and
                    destroying private citizens' property. I feel like retaliating in the strictest
                    sense. I don't think we would do wrong to take horses; burn houses; and commit
                    every depredation possible upon the men of the North. I can't vindicate the
                    principle of injuring, or insulting the female sex, though they be never so
                    disloyal to our Confederacy and its institutions. Could I ever condescend to the
                    degrading principle of taking from a female's person, a piece of jewelry? Shall
                    I ever become so thoughtless of my character, or forgetful of my raising? God
                    forbid. But mother, I would not hesitate to take, or burn up any thing belonging
                    to their government or that belonged to a citizen who was loyal to the U.S.</p>

                <pb n="4"/>

                <p>Mother, since I commenced writing, the brigade has been out on drill, but before
                    they got well in it, orders were received to cook up 3 days rations. I suppose
                    we will move in the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of the morning. We will go to the
                    Rappahannock river. I think we will certainly find the enemy after a while.
                    Mother, I wish you would ask Pa, if he can, to please have a hat made for me. I
                    will require the favor. I had rather have a wool hat if he can get one of that
                    kind. I don't need it just now, but will want it by fall.</p>

                <p>Ma, please make me a coat for next winter. It may be, that I will fall on the
                    battle-field, but if I should, my clothes can benefit some of my brothers. I
                    know this is calculating further ahead than I have any assurance of living, but
                    if I fall, be you well assured, I will sacrifice <pb n="5"/> my life upon the
                    alter of my country.</p>

                <p>My beloved friends at home, are no doubt somewhat uneasy about me, as the
                    military is usually more active in <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, than any
                    where in the Confederacy, but this is one of the principle reasons why my
                    friends should not be uneasy about my situation; because I have been in almost
                    as bad places as I ever will be again, let the war last as long as I do. I don't
                    regard the jeopardy attending any move at all, but my chief thought is, whether
                    I am doing my duty as a soldier or not. When I feel that I am doing my whole
                    duty, both to my-self and comrads, then it is, I have a clear conscience; a
                    conscience void of any remorse. Mother, I get plenty to eat, and have it well
                    prepared to eat. I have a man in my mess who cooks my and his rations. We get
                    plenty of fat meat out of which, we get the grease to put in our bread. We put
                    soda in it too which makes it very <pb n="6"/> palatable. Sometimes, I get
                    plenty of good milk to drink; this, you know is good living for a soldier. I
                    spend about all of my money for something good to eat. My wages are 20 dollars
                    per month.</p>

                <p>Mother, as I have nothing more to write of interest, I will close. My health is
                    good. Write me soon,</p>

                <closer>
