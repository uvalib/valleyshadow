</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>E. refers to the approaching death of a Mr. Ramsey and expresses her concern for
                    Edward McPherson's father's declining health. She also discusses the Gettysburg
                    Presbyterian Church's problem with a Mr. Van Wycke, noting Edward's fondness for
                    the man. </p>

<p class="p10">December 21<sup>st</sup>, 1857</p>
<p class="p10">Frederick</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Edward</p>
<p class="p10">I have just been sick enough for the last two weeks to make letter writing, too
                    much of a task for me to undertake, &amp; this is the reason you have not
                    heard from me since your last was received. I took cold, but unlike the
                    prevailing influenza, which runs its course in a few days very severely,
                    &amp; then is over, mine has been obstinate, attended by slow fever, loss of
                    appetite &amp;c all symptoms I had four or five years ago, since when, my
                    lungs have never been strong. I feel better for two days just &amp; if there
                    was not so much dampness in the atmosphere would venture out. But I must be very
                    prudent. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>John is also in the house with a bad cold &amp; our
                    neighbor Dr. Dorsey is very low with pneumonia. Lizzie came last Thursday night
                    &amp; to our great disappointment without Lizzie Law, who wrote she could
                    not possibly get away from Virginia before Christmas.--Her young female friends
                    &amp; all the beaux besides ourselves are filled with consternation. Mr.
                    Williams cannot be here until Thursday night &amp; then must return to
                    Georgetown on Saturday -- business always before pleasure with him -- this is a
                    good sign in these degenerate times, don't you think so? Lizzie will remain
                    until the last day of the year when her Mother &amp; Father expect to go
                    with her; the latter on his way to Annapolis once more to try his fortune. So
                    John &amp; myself will be reigning monarchs. Mr. Ramsey is expected to die
                    every day. For the last five or six weeks there has been a very favorable change
                    in the state of his mind: from being very fretful &amp; rebellious, he has
                    become very <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>gentle &amp; submissive -- peacefully &amp;
                    calmly waiting the great change- his Bible his constant companion. Nannie was
                    just here she desires her love &amp; says she will write soon. She has been
                    suffering with a gathering in her ear. We are truly glad to hear, that Aunt is
                    as well as usual again- but much grieved to hear Uncle is so much more feeble. I
                    have so much desire to see him once more, &amp; hoped at the last, it would
                    be my privilege to assist in ministering to his comfort. But there is no need of
                    me, &amp; there is comfort in that to me, since Providence seems to have
                    tied me down now as regards health, &amp; in other ways. C. Mchaffey, will
                    of course, be on soon &amp; Kate also, if she can leave her little charge,
                    so that, you will not feel so lonely. I often think with sad pleasure of the
                    many little social chats, he &amp; I had the fall I was there, sitting by
                    the light of the fire. No matter how feeble &amp; wearied he was, whenever I
                    entered the room, he always <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> looked up &amp; gave me such a
                    pleasant welcome which made me feel that I <u>could</u>
                    contribute somewhat to his pleasure when so lonely during your absence. What you
                    mentioned respecting the Winrott's gratified me exceedingly &amp; is just as
                    I expected he would feel &amp; act. In the end, what does all this
                    alienation &amp; bitterness of feeling amount to? It invariably brings
                    sorrow &amp; regret at last, after having caused much that is painful
                    &amp; unpleasant through years that have past, however justifiable the
                    course pursued. I am very glad you like Mr Van Wyck-- There will always be some
                    disaffected ones in a congregation -- yet it is very unfortunate -- at least, so
                    it seems to us-- As to Mr. McClean's step, if only proven that his
                    Presbyterianism was not <u>very deep</u>, &amp; such are
                    never a very great loss. Tell Aunt I intended to address this letter to her, but
                    did not think of it when I commenced-- We wish we could meet with someone going over at Christmas to send your father some jelly-- All join me
                    in much love to you, Uncle &amp; Aunt with all friends.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>E</i></p>
<p class="p10">Accept the compliments of the season-- We regret so much
                        you cannot be with us at Christmas -- </p>
