<p class="p10">October 24, 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Mt Solon, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. D.H. Evans,</p>
<p class="p10">Your dear <u>short</u> letter of Tuesday was truly welcome as
                    it was from you I read it with thankful pleasure. It told me just what I was
                    most anxious to hear that you were well, happy &amp; loved me. I was so glad
                    to know you are still cheerful &amp; happy I do hope you will always be so
                    that nothing in the future will drive from your heart its new found joy. I know
                    how very delightful it is to be happy. Oh I am so glad you are coming down
                    Saturday for I am so Eager &amp; impatient to see you again it seems to me
                    so long since you were here last two long &amp; dreary weeks but the time
                    seems much longer than that for me not to see you. I
                    like your last arrangement for leaving Staunton you will then not be so late
                    riding by your self. Now this time you may be sure to find a warm supper, <u>bright</u>
                    <u>fire</u> &amp; glad welcome for I believe you will
                    come if you live. it shall not be as it was when you came the last time, no
                    fire, &amp; no Mary to meet you. all shall be just as will please you
                    &amp; make you feel contented &amp; happy. It makes me so happy to have
                    you come to my home &amp; know you love to come. I love to have you here.
                    wish you could be here always with me. I told John Noon to<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>tell you
                    cousin David Sibert was here on Sunday he asked me if I had no other messages to
                    send you I told him I had just written all I wanted to say to you that time. he
                    then wanted to take my letter to you I told him "no," Magnus would see you
                    first, so we parted. John is a good boy. I like him because he thinks much of
                        <u>you</u>. he said "he was going to tell you I went to
                    church with Mr. Pemerton." "I told him he would tell you a story for I went
                    &amp; came back with Magnus." Mr Estill called Tuesday Evening eat supper
                    with us asked if he might go with me to church that night I declined going. I
                    love you &amp; do not want the attentions of other gentlemen Mr John Ferror
                    &amp; Mr. James Coyner called the same Evening. Rennie said she was going to
                    tell you how the gentlemen came to see me when you come down Saturday. I told
                    her [page torn] I would tell you myself. I have done <i>[unclear: so]</i>[page
                    torn] before she has the chance. she knows I [page torn] them politely &amp;
                    never go with them any <i>[unclear: w]</i>[page torn] know too that you would
                    not care if I[page torn] I do not for I don't want the love or [page torn] any
                    one in this wide world but <i>[unclear: y]</i>[page torn] none but you
                    &amp; will be true to <i>[unclear: tha]</i>[page torn] gentlemen say
                    &amp; think what <i>[unclear: thi]</i>[page torn] my coldness towards them.
                    I <i>[unclear: h]</i>[page torn] to tell you when I see you
                    <i>[unclear: aga]</i>[page torn][only a small fragment of the final page
