<p class="p10">Oct. 20, 1870</p>
<p class="p10">New York</p>
<p class="p10">My dear dear Miss Annie</p>
<p class="p10">I am sure my reputation with you is almost gone, as a wave of truth and fixed
                    purpose. But never since I came on here have I had it in my power to say when I
                    would get away. At one time I was about ready to go when my brother's affairs
                    got tangled and delayed me two weeks. During that time I became involved in
                    matter of my own of so much importance that I could not let go and return to
                    Virginia. Now all is arranged so that so far as business is concerned I could
                    &amp; would start home on Saturday. But this week the admirers of General Lee have held several preliminary meetings and
                    resolved to hold here on Monday night a Minister meeting to do honor to his
                    memory. I was appointed chairman of the committee on resolutions, and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>last night reported what I had written, which was received with so much favor
                    that I was unanimously approved to present the paper to the Mass Meeting at
                    Cooper Institute on Monday night. I begged to be let off, but no excuse would be
                    taken &amp; I was compelled to consent to do so. I enclose you a copy of
                    what I wrote. It was a difficult thing to prepare anything that would be just to
                        General Lee's memory and yet not offend these
                    people. I am told I have succeeded. I shall sail from here for Norfolk on
                    Tuesday's steamer. Reaching there on Wednesday I may have to run over to North Carolina for two or three days &amp; then up
                    to Richmond. This will bring me so near the State Fair that I will not have time
                    to go to Mecklenburg before the fair and stay as long as I wish. I regret this
                    the less since receiving a letter from <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Colonel Flournoy this week that he has certain propositions from Brunswick,
                    Lunenburg, &amp; Mecklenburg people about land, that he wishes me to go
                    there and attend to in November immediately after the Fair. It will take me from
                    2 to 4 weeks to attend to it, and I am arranging in my mind a plan for
                        <i>[unclear: work]</i> at after this Fair ends. That I will take a good
                    horse &amp; buggy from Richmond &amp; I make my headquarters at Lombardy
                    Grove &amp; branch out from there in all directions returning two or three
                    evenings in the week to spend a night there. I like that prospect for instead of
                    one short visit of a few days it will give me 10 or 15 visits of a night at a
                    time, and if I can't in that time make some impression on you, I will despair of
                    ever doing so, and will leave Mecklenburg forever a wiser &amp; a sadder man
                    - wiser by teach<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>ing me the folly of asking one so young, so sweet, so
                    good to love me - and sadder because I shall go out into the world again a man
                    denied.</p>
<p class="p10">There is another reason I do not regret this delay. My daughters will reach
                    Richmond November 1<u>
                        <sup>st</sup>
                    </u> and I will have a full and comfortable conversation with them about my
                    hopes and intentions. I wish you could be at the Fair. I want them to know you
                    as well as I do, and am sure they will love you as tenderly.</p>
<p class="p10">Your last long sweet letter to Richmond was sent to me yesterday. A thousand
                    thanks for it dearest Miss Annie. I hope this will not be 8 days in reaching
                    you. So the Post Master at Boydton guesses your New York correspondent does he? &amp; caught you so
                    nicely. Love to all. And God bless you. I will now soon see you I hope.</p>
<p class="p10">Devotedly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
<p class="p10">By my plan in November I will
                        catch some of your other friends there &amp; see how things are going.
                        You can hardly keep them away a whole month. You might for a week.</p>
