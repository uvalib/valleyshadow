<p class="p10">June 2<sup><u>d</u></sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">New Providence Manse</p>
<p class="p10">Dear D<sup>
                            <u>r</u>
                        </sup> M<sup>
                            <u>c</u>
                        </sup>Farland</p>
<p class="p10">We have determined to have our summer communion on next Sabbath week (3<sup>
                        <u>d</u>
                    </sup> Sab. of June). I expect to have Brother Walker
                    with me during the meeting, which will commence on Friday; but the Session
                    expressed a desire that I should write &amp; ask you also to be with us.
                    Some of your old friends wish very much to see &amp; hear you again. Mr
                    Morrison I know would be greatly gratified to meet you. He was out yesterday,
                    but I did not get to speak to him. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I believe he is in his usual
                    health.</p>
<p class="p10">Brother Harris would supply your pulpit for you I have
                    no doubt.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember me kindly to Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Farland &amp; your family.
                    If you come bring her with you &amp; make us a little visit. Hoping that you
                    will be able to comply with our request.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain yours truly in Christ</p>
<p class="p10"><i>E.D. Junkin</i></p>
