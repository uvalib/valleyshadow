    <p>I have been so busy for several days that I have not had time to write to you, for after we
     got to Winchester, we started on down to Charlestown &amp; went to near Harper's Ferry
     where the enemy had posted himself on the <abbr expan="Maryland">Md</abbr> Heights across the
     River &amp; there was no such thing as doing anything with him there, so we started back,
     but our movement had alarmed Old Abe and he recalled Shields &amp; McDowell from towards
     Richmond &amp; sent them to cross the Blue Ridge one towards Front Royal &amp; one
     towards Berryville, and also he had sent Fremont to Strasburg, intending to cut us off from up
     the Valley but, we got wind of all the <orig reg="moves">moes</orig> &amp; moved up rapidly
     -- we got safely through all his <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> -- but it took stirring I went down to
     Charlestown after the First Brigade, which had been there on duty, and brought them up to
     Winchester the same day by 9 P.M., after a weary ride and a weary march to the men, &amp;
     then we had to move up lively to Strasburg before the junction of Abe's forces, we then offered
     them battle, but they would not come &amp; fight, so we moved on back before Shields got up
     to cross here from towards Luray, and now we are encamped here at New Market -- how long we
     shall stay I know not, we may <pb n="2"/> go somewhere tomorrow, &amp; we may fight Fremont
     who is in front of us, and who is another Banks, those of his men that we have taken say. Ashby
     killed some 25 or 30 yesterday of the Yank cavalry with some straggling soldiers. I saw Col.
     Sterrett today but was too busy to write by him, I saw Mr. Hornrick today, he lives at
     Parnassus, and he promised to buy some 2 or 300 pounds of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for you -- he
     promised to send it over -- it is getting too dark to see so I must close --</p>
    <p>Write to me -- God bless you </p>
