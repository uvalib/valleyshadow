    <p>I take the <orig reg="pleasure">pleashure</orig> to <orig reg="address">adress</orig> you
     with a few lines hoping to find <orig reg="you">yous</orig> all well. I am well and in good
     health at the present. we had quite a <orig reg="jolly">joly</orig> time with the rebels this
     week. our Brigade captured a lot of rebels and two thousand Pounds of <orig reg="tobacco"
      >tobacko</orig> and 25 <orig reg="barrel">barels</orig> of whiskey. the <orig reg="tobacco"
      >tobacko</orig> and whiskey was <orig reg="all">al</orig> given to us for our good fighting
     and well behavior through our fighting since the<pb n="2"/>
     <orig reg="invasion">invation</orig> of Pennsylvania: our cavalry has <orig reg="whipped"
     >whipt</orig> the rebel Cavalry in every engagement since the Battle of <orig
      reg="Chancellorsville">Chancellersville</orig> and a good part of <orig reg="their"
     >there</orig> infantry along with <orig reg="their">there</orig> cavalry.</p>

    <p>our company was on picket at the mouth of the <orig reg="Rapidan">Rappaden</orig> and we
     captured 250 turkeys &amp; geese I had 9 turkeys which gave me as much as me &amp; my
     horse could carry. we also had plenty of cabbage &amp; potatoes. we lived well during the
     last week with our turkeys potatoes cabbage and whiskey.</p>

    <p>I dreamed last night that we was fighting the rebels in abington and in newton township and I
     thought I seen mother as we was coming back. if I ever get home I can tell you many a tale of
     our fighting in woods from<pb n="3"/> hands and feet along the <orig reg="Rapidan"
     >rappaden</orig> river at <orig reg="racoon">rackoon</orig> ford and we <orig reg="kept"
     >keept</orig> the rebels on the <orig reg="opposite">oposit</orig> side for four days until our
     infantry came up to us and <orig reg="relieved">releived</orig> us. we had our horses <orig
      reg="all">al</orig> tied up in the woods during the time of 4 days. we have just received two
     months pay and here is ten dollars at the present &amp; I will send some in my next.</p>
