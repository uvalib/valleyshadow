                <p>I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> your letter a <orig reg="few">fiew</orig>
                    days since. and it was with pleasure to me to open it &amp; peruse over its
                    contents. It was with sorrow that I read of the death of Miss Kate Hall
                    &amp; Miss Sarah M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Cadden but our loss is <orig
                        reg="their">thare</orig> eternal gain. Miss Kate was my most intimate friend
                    while I lived in Greenville. I saw a piece in the Newspaper Composed about Miss
                    Kate I Judged that Mr. Monroe was its <orig reg="author">auther</orig>, it was a
                    very good piece. Your Brother John has been sick for three or four days
                    &amp; has <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> to the hospital in Winchester. I hope
                    he may soon recover his former health. I think he is taking the fever. Your
                    Cousin Abe has been complaining for some time past, but looks <orig reg="hearty"
                        >harty</orig> at present. Brother John has returned from the hospital, he
                    was sent to Richmond, I was very glad to see him as I <orig reg="couldn't"
                        >could'nt</orig> hear from him he had the Typhoid fever &amp; looks
                    quite thin yet he has not reported for duty yet. I got a pass to go to
                    Winchester the other day <orig reg="every">evry</orig> thing is very <del
                        hand="h1"/> The town <pb n="2"/> is not crowded like it was in the spring.</p>

                <p>I will try &amp; give you a short account of our march to the Valley. Our
                    Company was on <orig reg="picket">piket</orig> that morning had very little or
                    nothing to eat; we <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> orders about ten <orig
                        reg="o'clock">oclock</orig> A.M. to pack up &amp; march to camp a
                    distance of two miles when we got <orig reg="there">thare</orig>
                    <orig reg="every">evry</orig> thing was packed up &amp; ready to march. We
                    had to carry our <orig reg="blankets">plankets</orig> &amp; overcoats. The
                        <orig reg="regiment">regaments</orig> was formed at half past twelve
                    &amp; took up the line of march at one <orig reg="o'clock">oclock</orig>. We
                    got to Manassas about five o'clock &amp; rested <orig reg="there"
                    >thare</orig> a while, then marched to the Junction &amp; loaded our <orig
                        reg="baggage">bagage</orig> on the cars. We <orig reg="didn't">did'nt</orig>
                    get started before nine we <orig reg="were">ware</orig> packed in the cars like
                    cattle we had no seats but the <orig reg="baggage">bagage</orig>, and those on
                    top of the cars <orig reg="were">ware</orig>
                    <orig reg="exposed">exsposed</orig> to the cold &amp; Sam one of <orig
                        reg="Captain">Capt</orig> Roberts men fell <orig reg="off">of</orig> the
                    cars &amp; was <orig reg="bruised">brused</orig> so that he died next
                    morning it was said that he was drunk &amp; walked <orig reg="off">of</orig>
                    the top of the cars, we got to <orig reg="Strasburg">Strawsburg</orig> about
                    daylight unloaded our <orig reg="baggage">bagage</orig> cooked of our breakfasts
                    &amp; started for Winchester it rained hard all day. I do believe that one
                        <orig reg="fourth">forth</orig> of the <orig reg="regiment">regament</orig>
                    <orig reg="were">ware</orig> drunk we had gotten in about three quarters of a
                    mile of Winchester when we <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> orders to turn
                    round &amp; go a mile &amp; camp <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp; officers
                    refused to obey <pb n="3"/> the order, the Colonel swore he would be obeyed
                    &amp; drew his <orig reg="sword">soard</orig> &amp; ordered his Brother
                    to <orig reg="forward">foward</orig> his <abbr expan="Company">Comp</abbr>, but
                    he would not move so the Colonel ordered him under arrest &amp; told <orig
                        reg="Sims">Simbs</orig> to take the Command of the <abbr expan="Company"
                        >Comp</abbr> &amp; the <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> refused to
                    obey the order. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Harman then went out and
                    talked to the <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> he had understood that we had to
                    go back to Newtown a distance of five miles. As soon as he learned better he
                    ordered his <abbr expan="company">comp</abbr> to <orig reg="move">moove</orig>
                    <orig reg="off">of</orig>, &amp; the <orig reg="regiment">regament</orig>
                    followed. I was smartly excited at the time of the <orig reg="fracas"
                    >fracus</orig> the <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> struck one of Harmens men,
                    with his <orig reg="sword">soard</orig> a <orig reg="great">grate</orig> many of

                    tired of this <orig reg="uninteresting">uninterresting</orig> letter. My health
                    has been very good till late. I have had the head ache with chills &amp;
                    fevers. I hope though it may soon <orig reg="wear">ware</orig>

                    happiness. Excuse me for not writing sooner &amp; I will try and do better
