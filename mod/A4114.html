<p class="p10">Feb. 14<sup>th</sup> 1870 (10 P.M.)</p>
<p class="p10">Lexington Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Ever Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I am sorry that I am not at home today to congratulate you upon the anniversary of your birth
     day and to wish you many happy returns of the same -- I hope your "ills" have all left you and
     that you have had a pleasant day and that the little family circle has been in a cheery mood -
     - group I should say, not circle, for I fear that I am a disjointed and lone fragment of
     something that is incomplete without my portion and my fragment
     is a waif without the rest -- and now, when I wish I were there, but know that I cannot be, the
     sense of loneliness that follows almost provokes to tears -- I have been thinking how you all
     look &amp; what you are all doing tonight -- how I think you have all retired -- you keep
     better hours when I am away -- but I think I had <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the picture as it was an hour ago
     -- only I don't whether Anne played "Shoo Fly" or "Capt. Jinks" at the
     close of the entertainment -- You all looked over the paper to see if "Pa" had any "notice" and
     know what the "Salons" are doing at Richmond -- news that we will get at 9 P.M. tomorrow -- I
     intended to send you a Valentine, but as you could not get it today I thought best to keep it
     until I come "a courting", which will be ere long. I had a letter from Mr. Effinger, dated the
      10<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> -- I only conclude you are well from a P.S. which says "I met your daughter on the street
     yesterda, she was looking very well &amp; as charming as usual" -- I <u>suppose</u> that was Anne on her way to school. I have been intending to reply to Nelly's
     excellent letter every day since it came, but I have the pen in my hand so much during the day
     that I dread to take it up at night -- then I am so deeply interested in some scientific books
     I get here &amp; that I cannot even see elsewhere, that forget the claims of duty in my
     desire <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>to get the benefit of treasures I have longed to handle &amp; read from
     my very boyhood -- Now, My Dear, don't be jealous of the old books -- for though I may go with
     them to "dream land" I am sure to come back to my daylight senses and wish for the
      "<i>[unclear: living]</i> epistle" in my home casket -- I have just been, tonight, to Dr.
     Sampson's lecture on Palestine, Egypt &amp;c -- it was deeply interesting -- I would have
     given much if you could all have heard him -- he has been all over <u>"the
      lands"</u> and speaks of what he has seen -- I don't know what Anne
     &amp; Stiles would have done if they had heard him tell how the little boys in Egypt climb
     up by the tails of the buffaloes to get on their backs &amp; he said the buffaloes do not
     even say "Shoo fly"! He had the dresses of the people of Egypt &amp; dressed up as a boy
     &amp; he looked exactly like the pictures of Arabs in Lynch's Dead Sea -- He spoke of the
     observations of Herodotus -- saying he was a wonderfully accurate observer &amp; writer (By
     the way I think Nelly would find a good deal that she would like in that old book -- she will
     find it in my Bohn series) -- Dr. Sampson had bits of mummies, <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>images &amp;c -- he lectures two nights more -- he preached last night, at the
     college chapel on "sincerity the basis of Christianity" -- a very fine discourse very
     suggestive &amp; learned -- Mr. Holland preached or rather lectured to the Cadets Young   Men's Christian Association the Sunday night
     previous on "What will he do with it" -- i.e. the soul, body &amp; spirit given to a young
     man, what will he do with them -- . This is an interesting feature here - so many able
     lecturers are brought here &amp; they have so many here that can &amp; do lecture --
     But I must stop this garrulity, for I see the bottom of the page -- Gen. Lee says the "young
     ladies must come up and spend some time with them" -- I have had some fun with Allan about a
     young Alabama widow here -- . The weather continues very warm, too warm -- I am very well -- I
     hope you have heard from Ma before now -- how is she -- I heard from Ellyson -- they are well
     -- So far as I know my prospects are tolerably good at Richmond -- I <u>think</u> it now lies between Mr. Ruffner &amp; myself -- if no chance for him I get his
     vote &amp; vice versa - More anon -- Write to me -- A kiss just here, for birthday </p>
<p class="p10">Love &amp; a blessing for you all -- As ever your loving </p>
