<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: S. E. Colburn to F. N.
                    Clark, February 29, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Colburn reports on a meeting he had with Cyrus Bannister, who explained that
                    problems with his wife compelled him to leave his family three years earlier,
                    although Colburn reports that Bannister intends to return to his family in the
                    spring.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">In reference to your communication dated 20th ultimate
                    concerning Cynis Bannister, I will state that I visited him this morning, read
                    him your letter. He stated that there had been some difficulty between them
                    which induced him to leave, has been absent about three years.</p>
<p class="p10">I endeavored to impress upon him the importance of caring for his children. He
                    directed me to say that he intended to return this spring, perhaps about a month
                    hence.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
