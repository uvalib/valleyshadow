<p class="p10">January 28, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Waynesboro</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">During the battle of Fredericksburg, I took a violent cold, and it followed with
                    a very severe attack of <u>Typhoid</u> fever, after laying
                    two weeks in camp. I was sent home for furlough, bearing date Jan. 27th for 20
                    days. After arriving home, Dr. James Brotherston kept me in bed for 14 days, as
                    soon as I was able to get out, I proceeded to Chambersburg, and reported myself
                    to Dr. Senseny-who has charge of the hospitals there. He examined me and it was
                    his opinion, concurred by Dr. Hamilton that it could take me six weeks to
                    recover sufficiently to return to my command and he gave me a certificate to
                    that effect. Enclosed find a copy of the same with orders to send it on to Brig.
                    Gen. L. Thomas, Adj. Genl. U.S. Army. <u>Since then I
                    have</u> heard nothing in regard to it, I am still very much reduced and from
                    weakness + nervousness my system has been considerably <i>[illeg.]</i>acted and
                    it will take at least that time before I will be able to return. Will you do me
                    kindness <u>to be that I am all right</u> + whether my papers
                    are sufficient I should not fancy being <u>"absent without
                        leave</u> arrested, courtmartialed +c +c
                    on my return to duty. I leave my company in command of Lieut. G. W. Walker with
                    all confidence that he will do his duty when called upon to lead my company when
                    ever ordered.</p>
<p class="p10">If you will do the kindness to attend to this for me, will confer a favour upon
                    yours. Most truly +</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. W. Walker<br> Capt. Com. Co. "E" 126 Regt Pa.</i></p>
