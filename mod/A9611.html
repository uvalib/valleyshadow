<h4>Augusta: John D. Imboden to Annie Lockett, December
                    30, 1870<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Imboden writes to Annie of his difficulties with the land and railroad business
                    and his desire to return to Virginia, both to marry her and to get away from the
                    crowds in New York. He also expresses nostalgia for antebellum Virginia.</p>

<p class="p10">Friday night Dec. 30<sup>th</sup> 1870</p>
<p class="p10">New York</p>
<p class="p10">My little darling-</p>
<p class="p10">I have had to wait ever so long for a letter, but have been fully compensated
                    today by yours of last Saturday - the 24<u>
                        <sup>th</sup>
                    </u>. How often I thought of you that day, and the next - Christmas, and wished
                    I was with you. I am even vain enough to believe that <u>you</u> would have been happier for my presence. We spent a very quiet Christmas here. And all this week has been unusually
                    dull to me. Indeed I have been rather "under the weather" with a wretched cold,
                    which became so bad as to lay me up all day yesterday in my chamber. Today I am
                    better. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I think it would be a most unfortuate thing for me to be
                    taken sick where you are, before our marriage, for it makes me so cross
                    &amp; crabbed generally that you would discard me right away &amp; send
                    off to Texas for that despairing youth who has gone there to forget you
                    &amp; his sorrows.</p>
<p class="p10">So next Saturday the 7<sup>th</sup> is your birth day. Why are the
                    fates against my being with you then? It does seem to me that all my
                    calculations upon other people miscarry. Do you know that up to this time I have
                    not been able to get Colonel
                    Flournoy from Danville to New
                    York, and <u>must</u> have him here before I can go home. I
                    wrote <u>two</u> letters to him yesterday. Colonel M<sup>c</sup>Kaye too is still in
                    Europe. I am frank to say I am not pleased with the present condition of our
                    Company affairs, both railroad &amp; Land Company.</p>
<p class="p10">Complications are springing up that will perhaps take a great deal of time
                    &amp; labor to untangle. I am trying by all means
                    in my power to put the "machines" in good running order, at great labor and infinite trouble and annoyance. I really think
                    it was well that we did not <u>fix definitely</u> on <u>March</u> for our marriage, as my engagements and affairs
                    do not now promise to be in such shape as early as March, as would enable me to
                    take the season of leisure for several weeks I
                    propose on that happy occasion. It may yet be, that within a couple of weeks
                    when I hope to return to Virginia, I will get them so arranged, that we can even
                    then have time to agree upon March as I originally insisted - if not then I must
                    acquiesce in your original <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> proposition for a later, and to all
                    except me, a more pleasant month.</p>
<p class="p10">But I will not tire you with the discussion again of a matter we can only settle
                    properly &amp; satisfactorily when I am with you.</p>
<p class="p10">So our engagement is <u>generally</u> known and discussed in
                    the County. Why not? If it does not annoy you I am sure I feel proud that your
                    good people know how blessed I am to be the accepted lover of the sweetest girl
                    in Eastern Virginia. Why did you not give me Doctor
                    Alexander's opinion, as you say it would amuse me. I know the Doctor is not a marrying man and I suppose he thinks I am
                    one most emphatically. Thank Miss Lacey for thinking so well of me as to tell
                    you my presence would make you happier. Assure her that whatever might be the
                    effect on <u>you</u> I should certainly have been very happy.</p>
<p class="p10">It was very sweet in Ella to send me that kiss through such a channel. I shall
                    certainly have it delivered with interest. I hope her going further south is not
                    from any increase of her malady, but only because this winter has been so cold
                    even away down South.</p>
<p class="p10">Is it not delightful to know that Sister Lou is coming on to see us married? If
                    anything in addition to the main event of the day could add to my happines then,
                    it would be to have her present. I know how much I owe her for my good fortune,
                    and I wish above all things for her presence to see the hopes I expressed to her
                    crowned with fruition.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope I shall have but few more letters to write to <u>Miss</u> Annie Lockett from New York. Continue to
                    reply to me here until I notify you of the day of my departure, which I will do
                    the very moment I can see my way clear to leave here and not return soon again.
                    You speak of the dull quietness of the Country. You cannot imagine how I long to
                    enjoy it with you. I am tired to death of this great crowded city. I so long for
                    a few weeks back in old Virginia - not in Richmond - but in the depths of the
                    wilderness of Mecklenburg. You make it an Eden to me. And when I get there you
                    shall not be <u>sad</u> - I won't allow it.</p>
<p class="p10">With love to all, and a heart full for you, I am devotedly<br>Yours
                        only,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
<p class="p10">Don't miss a mail if you love me. <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br> I had one
                        of the sweetest letters this week from Miss Parke about her poems you ever
                        read. I will send it to you to read with a copy of two of her pieces as soon
                        as I get them from the printers. She refuses to let them appear in a
                        Magazine &amp; I am having them simply printed for her. She writes
                        beautifully.</p>
