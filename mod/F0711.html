<p class="p10">July 21<sup>th</sup> 1862.</p>
<p class="p10">Waterloo on the   
 RappahannockFauquier County, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My old friend Harry<br>  
 Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have<br>   
 been writing and writing and writing to you ever since I am in the<br>   
 army, and at last I've wakened<br>   
 up all of a Sunday morning to<br>   
 find myself sealed behind a whole<br>   
 sheet of foolscap, trying to make it<br>   
 look like a letter to old Southampton.<br>  
 I would make an awful long yarn to<br>   
 tell you everything that has happened<br>   
 since I left home, in fact, it would<br>   
 make a young history, so will try<br>   
 our hand in the condensing line &amp;<br>   
 squeeze out all the little things retaining only the big facts.  After our<br>   
 regiment had been encamped on the sacred<br>   
 soil of Virginia   
 for several weeks near   
 Munson's Hill, we were attached to  
 General Duryee's<br>  
 brigade then lying near Alexandria, and<br>   
 our regiment. was accordingly  
 moved thither.<br>  
 Next our regiment was detatched from the<br>   
 brigade for awhile to guard the Railroad   
 from<br>   
 Alexandria to Manassas Junction.   
 From this<br>   
 we went 12 miles beyond Manassas Junction<br>   
 to what is called Catlett's Station,   
 but when<br>   
 Banks retreated, we fell back on   
 Manassas<br>  
 to defend that place. Here Ord's and   
 Shield's<br>  
 divisions soon came pouring in like bees<br>   
 and advanced thence to Front Royal<br>   
 in pursuit of Jackson,   
 at Manassas our<br>   
 regiment or rather our brigade was  
 attatched<br>  
 to Ord's, now  
 Rickett's   
 division.  I suppose<br>   
 you've read the letter describing this march<br>   
 in the news. I was not along with the<br>   
 regiment on this march, but  
 got sick at<br>   
   
       
   
 
 <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitKin1c.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitKin1c.gif"></center></a><br><br>  
 
   
 Manassas,   
 and was sent to Washington, After Jackson  
 disappeared our<br>   
 divison fell back again on Catlett's<br>   
 Station where I rejoined my regiment   
 after<br>   
 an absence of about 3 or 4 weeks. Thence<br>   
 we marched to Warrenton, County seat<br>   
 of Fauquier, and from that again a  
 distance of 8 miles out here on the   
 Rappahannock.    
 We are now in Pope's great<br> army of   
 Virginia. The men have great   
 belief in him and his energetic policy,<br>  
 and all desire and expect that he will<br>   
 soon give us a chance to distinguish<br>   
 ourselves. We all regard his late stringent<br>   
 orders as just the thing, and all are<br>   
 down on slow coach   
 McClellan, who<br>   
 marched his army into the swamps of<br>   
 the Chickahominy, and kept  
 them intrenching and digging, while they were dying<br>   
 by the thousand, and all this time<br>   
 made no attempt on Richmond.

 He occupies a splendid position on<br>   
 the banks of the James, but why   
 didn't<br>  
 he go there in the first place. We expect better things of Pope   
 who has already<br>   
 proved himself no ordinary General   
 in the<br>   
 Western Campaign. Our Colonel  
 (Ziegle) died<br>   
 the other day. McAllen is too sickly to<br>   
 take the command, so the Governor   
 I suppose<br>   
 will appoint us a Colonel   
 Jake Gish just<br>   
 got back from Washington last night<br>   
 with his commission as 2<sup>nd</sup>   
 Lieutenant We<br>   
 have bully officers. MacThompson   
 is a<br>   
 clever Captain,   
 McPherson is clever, but<br>  
 Gish is the best man of the party. The<br>   
 boys all like him because he makes himself so common. Write and give me all<br>   
 the news of Southampton,   
 Shippensburg, the<br>   
 schools, your studies, &amp;c.
