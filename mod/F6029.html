<h4>Franklin County: Lauramann Howe Russell to Serena E.

                    Serena, describing Sabbath School and entertainment at the hospital. He also

<p class="p10"><i>[illeg.]</i> 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        62</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Academy Hospital Pennsylvania<br> Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Daughter Serena</p>
<p class="p10">Having just returned from the Sabbath School I am
                    thinking that I want to write to some of my folks and
                    as you have not written to me for some time as I to you now is a good time.</p>
<p class="p10">As I was saying I have just returned from School. it is half past two o'clock
                        Though you may think it rather late but it is not
                    so. the Sabbath School takes the place of the afternoon service the Church
                    meetings being in the morning and evening.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> The Church is some five
                    minutes walk from the Hospital on the Main
                    Street and a nice looking building. The
                    <i>[unclear: vestry]</i> is about the size of ours altogether but there is a
                    partition through the center which makes two rooms for
                    the different departments of the School. The infant school is upstairs
                    where the meetings are held, The
                        room that I was in was very nicely furnished with
                    pews &amp; I which was much more convenient than ours. The services were
                    nearly the same as I had been used to. Opened with Singing &amp; Prayer.
                    Closed with singing. I have not been to a Sabbath School
                    before since leaving home, It was at the <u>German Reform
                        Church</u> I was conducted to a seat with a class of young men and had the
                    chance of<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> hearing this explanation of the Chapter that contained the
                    lesson. it did not differ from our version of the same texts.</p>
<p class="p10">Some young ladies have come to the Hospital to sing for the entertainment of the
                    wounded inmates and while I am writing are performing in the hall, there is no
                        bass and it does not
                    interest me much although they are very good singers,
                    Common tunes do not sound very well without the bass it
                    is different with a duet.</p>
<p class="p10">My hand is getting a little better, I think and will be well in a few weeks.</p>
<p class="p10">Do you hear anything from Benjamin or John I have heard nothing in particular since being here-- I had a few spare
                    minutes yesterday and I went into a <u>paper mill</u>. it was where they
                    made <i>[deleted: this]</i> straw paper and it was a very curious operation. the straw is first ground then mixed with
                    water and some other substance<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and taken by machinery from the trough and run between
                        rollers in thin sheets to press the water out. It
                    is then cut in <i>[deleted: sheets]</i> squares about 22 x 30 and put up to
                    dry. The building was about one hundred feet long by sixty wide and four stories
                        high including the basement. the basement was used
                    for manufacturing the article the other three stories for drying it---- This is
                    the most quiet town I was ever in. there is nothing going on in daytime or evening excepting Church going other then
                    the ordinary business of the week but it makes
                    little difference with me for I should not be the wiser for them.</p>
<p class="p10">I cannot write more this time. I hope to hear from you
                    in due time. Tell me all the news that you can think of---- Enclosed you will
                    find a little piece of change do with it as you think best only make a good use
                    of it.---I was thinking yesterday how you &amp; Ellen got along with your
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>, will you tell me when you write?--- - Remember me to all
                    the rest at home-- It is a very warm and pleasant day I hope it will continue so
                    for weeks yet to come. What is Williams Witherber &amp; Charley W. and the
                    Loring boy that were in the band doing these times-</p>
