<p class="p10">Lexington</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara --</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you did not freeze last night -- it was a stinger -- woollen blankets alone saved me
     -- &amp; then I had to find the warm side of them several times -- I dreamed of you --
     Capt. Sole goes down this morning &amp; offers to take my satchel so I send it -- I will
     have to put off my coming to the week of the S.S. Convention -- for I cannot come next Sat.
     &amp; then too -- I had made arrangements for you to come here a week -- thinking the fine
     weather would last &amp; then come down with me -- Col. Harman said he would give you a
     free ticket &amp; if it moderates &amp; gets warm again I wish you would see if you
     cannot get someone to stay with the children -- &amp; you come up here for a week, by way
     of variety &amp; then go back when I go. The prospect now is that W. W. Walker a stump
     speaker, Methodist Episcopal Preacher, Ci devant Prof. &amp;c
     from Westmoreland Co. may be elected Superintendent as a reward for
     party services -- Ruffner went down last night &amp; wanted me to go &amp; I had a
     ticket offered me but did not think it would pay considering the exposure after so much warm
     weather -- If you can come write to me &amp; send down to Capt. Sole to the Va. Hotel
     &amp; he will send the stage for <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>you &amp; arrange all -- . I have only a
     moment to write -- Nelly's letter came &amp; I will reply -- Love in abundance for you all
     -- Don't expose yourself </p>
<p class="p10">Your loving husband</p>
