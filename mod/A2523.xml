     <salute>My <abbr expan="Dear">Dr.</abbr> Wife:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I have just <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> your brief note saying that Nelly is out of
     danger -- I am truly thankful that a merciful God has spared us the sad affliction of depriving
     us of our first born -- praised be his name that has granted it. I have written to you that I
     am now on Engineer duty again, and have a good place, though no rank as yet, simply <abbr
      expan="Acting  
 Topographical Engineer">Act. Top. Eng.</abbr> on Gen. Jackson's staff, have a
     wagon assigned me for my transportation &amp; a good driver, and can get along without much
     exposure, though I shall have to ride about considerable reconnoitering the country. I have a
     very nice chief of <abbr expan="Engineers">Eng.</abbr> Lieut. Boswell -- belonging to the
     regular corps, he is a fine fellow, &amp; I suppose we will form a mess together. Yesterday
     I was down in front of the army though Ashby's Cavalry was far in the advance -- Ashby is a
     gallant fellow and always keeps <pb n="2"/> the enemy at bay. I saw Mason a few days ago, he is
     looking finely -- says he considers himself a poor man now -- so may of their slaves have run
     away, and their fine farm in Fauquier has fallen into the hands of the enemy -- he has raised
     240 cavalry and will be made a Major I suppose. Yesterday the order came from the <abbr
      expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> to draft all the militia into the Volunteer companies now in the
     field, so as to make 1000 men in each regiment, with 10 companies, and now there is much uproar
     among the militia, this will throw all the officers into the ranks as privates -- I am sorry
     for some of them, for they are good men, but it will be a fine thing for some of them for they
     will thus learn what the duties of a soldier are. I am glad that I have made my escape from the
     militia before this proclamation, for I <pb n="3"/> had labored very hard to get them fixed up
     &amp; had got them so supplied by strenuous efforts that they were very well satisfied, and
     expressed great regret at parting with me &amp;c &amp;c, &amp; I should have been
     very sorry to have to take part in disbanding them -- especially as they wish to stay as they
     are. Gen. Jackson regrets that this order has been issued, as he was more than pleased with the
     way in which the militia of Augusta has conducted itself. Yesterday was very raw &amp; cold
     and last night it rained &amp; sleeted The militia were the only troops that had any tents,
     all the others having been sent back to Harrisonburg, and the poor fellows suffered much --
     Today it is raining too and the trees <orig reg="are">a</orig> completely crusted over with ice
     -- I am keeping a sort of Sunday, abstaining from work -- The work of last Sunday turned out so
     disastrously to us that <pb n="4"/> that I suppose we shall try and keep more Sunday hereafter
     -- <orig reg="though">tho'</orig> it is almost impossible to keep the day as it should be there
     are so many contingencies to provide for -- but of the four great battles of this war that have
     been fought on Sunday, the attacking party has lost the day.</p>
    <p> I hear with regret that Gen. Ed. Johnson has been ordered back from Alleghany and is to come
     here, leaving the <orig reg="Alleghany">Alleghny</orig> line entirely undefended and I fear the
     enemy will soon come to Augusta -- We hear that the enemy has fallen back to Alexandria from
     Manassas, it is supposed to aid in an attack on Fredericksburg. I wish you would write often as
     you can -- I hope you will all get along well. I may come home after some maps -- the only way
     I can possibly get off -- My love to all May God bless you. Have you got your sugar yet --
     Write to Mt. Jackson -- to me as <abbr expan="Acting  
 Topographical Engineer">Act. Top.
     Eng.</abbr> of Gen <abbr expan="Jackson's">J's</abbr> staff -- </p>
