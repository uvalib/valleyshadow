<p class="p10">January 27/64</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Hester</p>
<p class="p10">Having an opportunity I again write you but have
                    not much to say I am well in health but my afflictions bother me considerable,
                    but do as well as can expect</p>
<p class="p10">I received your reply to my request to purchase some articles &amp;c but am
                    not in the condition you think (Crazy) but if should be so unfortunate I have
                    the Asylum close at hand and will try &amp; take advantage of its
                    convenience</p>
<p class="p10">We have the house open at last. we have a fine sum of travelling customs house
                    full every night keep it in good order receipts $1000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> per day everything going on smooth. We have all
                    things fixed in running order need some linnens blankets comforts &amp;
                    groceries such as coffee &amp; tea But I shall not
                    ask you to send me anything more except a few articles I need at once viz a
                    young lady of about 36 years old slender light hair fair complexion &amp;
                    blue eyes &amp; 4 little <i>[unclear: flax]</i> head fellows one boy
                    &amp; three girls I desire these goods &amp; chattels sent through to me
                    at once with their clothes &amp; bedding</p>
<p class="p10">If I had you all here with me I would be much better satisfied &amp; think
                    you would be too we get plenty of supplies but at quite high prices rates $15 pr
                    day Can't you manage some way to move out if it <i>[deleted: the]</i> be at the risk of our property no matter I think we can
                    make something here but if come bring all<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> kinds of clothing you may
                    need as it is scarce &amp; high just here I think I will be out of the
                    service between this &amp; spring &amp; can be with you constantly My
                    impression is that we will do a good business here now I am anxious to make some
                    money here as we have lost so much since the war Porters brother-in-law wants the Porter property. I think
                    I will let him have it it has not been paid for &amp; he can take it at
                        $900<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> lift the notes &amp; pay you the ballance if I do conclude to let him
                    have it I will make deed here &amp; you can acknowledge it there before Notary
                    public but do nothing in the matter unless I give him the papers.</p>
<p class="p10">I have much to say to you but cannot say it on paper but hope soon to see you. I
                    have just got 2 Shirts 1 per shoes 2 per socks &amp; 1 per drawers which will
                    be a great benefit to me now</p>
<p class="p10">If I only could have gotten some collars I would have been glad. Do try &amp;
                    write me fully all about private matters I am so anxious to hear from you tell
                    me how the little fellows get along and all domestic matters. I learn the mill
                    has been released</p>
<p class="p10">from what I learn John must be about frightened to death He seems quite anxious
                    about the property &amp;c just say to him he need not fear about any money I
                    may owe him. if all we have there is lost I hope still to have enough here to
                    pay him &amp; all I owe<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> any person &amp; then keep my family
                    well These chicken hearted people won't do. These times persons must have nerve</p>
<p class="p10">I hope that all these croakers will in the end be disappointed They seem to
                    deprecate my position losses risks &amp;c &amp;c but I hope to come out
                    right in the end You keep perfectly calm don't grieve or
                    be concerned about property. This is but dross. My greatest ambition now is to
                    be with you all I have written to you so often on this subject that I have but
                    little else to add but hope it will not be long until we meet</p>
<p class="p10">Do the best you can with the property whilst there &amp; if leave put it in
                    the hands of some good person</p>
<p class="p10">Freddy I hope you are a good boy &amp; attending to businiess for <u>ma</u> going to school &amp; taking care of your
                    little sisters. don't run about with bad boys nor ride
                    strange horses this is dangerous you keep close about home and be a good boy</p>
