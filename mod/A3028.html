<h4>Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris, October
                    19, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Pastor describes falling back and fortifying in a new, advantageous position in
                    the face of news of a very large army of Yankees approaching. He reports rumors
                    of Yankees pouring into Kentucky and predicts a major battle there, too. Many of
                    the men seem to be sick. At the end of the letter, Pastor has just received
                    orders to strike his tent and prepare to march away.</p>

<p class="p10">Oct. 19<sup>th</sup> 61</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Centerville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Anni,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter a day or two since, but as we had just arrived at this
                    place &amp; had not got fixed up, I could not answer it as soon as I would
                    have liked. But I suppose it will make no difference to you. I will be able to
                    give you more news now, than I could have done then.</p>
<p class="p10">We have passed through many hardships since I last wrote you. Have been on picket
                    one week, but did not see any Yankees. We have fallen back about fifteen miles
                    from Mason &amp; <i>[unclear: Memsonip]</i> hill where we were<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    first on picket. On the first place we fell back to Fairfax C.H. to give them a
                    chance to come on; but they didn't seem to show any
                    fight, for they would not come out in any numbers.</p>
<p class="p10">We have now fell back to this place &amp; are fortifying as fast we can. This
                    is the best place to have a fight that I have seen since we left Winchester. We
                    have heard <i>[illeg.]</i> cannonading all morning in the direction of Falls
                    Church. The Yankees are said to be advancing in large numbers, &amp; it is
                    thought that we will have a fight at this place probably in a few days. We have
                    news this morning that there are upwards of 200,000 marching in this<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    direction. If this is so, you may expect to hear stirring news from this point.
                    in a few days "sure" - We have late intelligence that the Linconites are pouring
                    into Kentucky in large bodies &amp; it is thought that there will be a big
                    fight there shortly. I tell you they seem to be coming in all around, with a
                    full determination to subdue. But I trust <u>they</u> will be
                    defeated. We place too much confidence in our Generals to think for one moment of being defeated; &amp; believing as
                    we do that we have God on our side - &amp; "if God be for us who can be
                    against us" Well I must hasten on to a close, for fear that I will prove<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> wearisome.</p>
<p class="p10">Liet. M<sup>c</sup>. wishes to be kindly remembered to you &amp;
                    all the girls of his acquaintance. I would like to see you all with your
                        "<i>[unclear: lively]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: wasley's]</i>" on, or your "___ _______".</p>
<p class="p10">there are 22 of our boys off on the sick list. I don't know whether they are all
                    at home or not. Buck is one of the number. We have just this moment received an
                    order to strike our tents &amp; get ready to march. so I'll have to stop for
                    the present.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste - </p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>Tony Pastor</u>
                    </i></p>
<p class="p10">Direct to <u>Manassas
                        Junction</u><br> In care of H.L. Williams as heretofore</p>
