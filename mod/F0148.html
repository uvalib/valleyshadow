                    many sick in the regiment we have lost but one man out of our company and he
                    shot himself when on guard one night he pulled out his shoe and stocking and
                    pressed the trigger with his toe our Capt served us a nice trick he resigned and
                    left us Lieutenant Young is our Captain now i think it will go better as M<sup>c</sup> Intire was a real tyrant on his men but he never
