                    from you a short time since we are all well and have been since you were at
                    home. I was glad to hear from you and to hear that you had gotten home safely.

                    been here to see me yet nor I don't expect she will come. I got a letter from
                    John last week he is well he has left <i>[unclear: Thermund]</i> and gone into
                    the store with Mr Paxton at Clifton Forge. I havent much news to write people in

                    school. Mr Bell has employed Phebe to teach up there this fall she will she will
                    board half her time at Joseph's and the other half at Wms. I still have my visit
                    in view and I want you to have my quilt pieces gathered up if there is any made
