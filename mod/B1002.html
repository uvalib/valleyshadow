<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to R. S.
                    Lacey, June 30, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook gives a negative assessment of the attitudes of the local white population
                    toward free blacks in Augusta County, noting that juries frequently go against
                    the law in cases involving freedmen. He also discusses the registry of free
                    blacks and the problem of vagrants.</p>

<p class="p10">June 30<sup>th</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following report of Bureau affairs in the Counties
                    of Augusta and Highland for the month ending June 30<sup>th</sup>
                    1866.</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta County</p>
<p class="p10">In this County I have received during the month quite a
                    number of complaints from freedmen in regard to sums due them from their
                    employers - mostly for small sums, but in the present undefined position of the
                    authority of Officers in Civil Cases I have been cautious in interfering - I am
                    at a loss how to advise them - if the matters are handed over to the Civil
                    Courts it will require money to prosecute them
                    successfully even then months will elapse before any benefits can be realized
                    even supposing that just trials can be obtained.</p>
<p class="p10">Magistrate and Circuit Courts on Criminal trials <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>of Freedmen, are
                    inclined to give fair and impartial trials so far as the presiding Judges are
                    concerned - in case of one colored man, the Jury found a verdict of guilty after
                    being charged by the Judge to the contrary in the plainest terms possible the
                    Judge even remarking to the Jury that he wished he could instruct them otherwise
                    - the Court granted a new trial - the man will be convicted in a new trial as
                    the indictment will be made good, still it shows
                    the feeling of the Jury to have been against a strict compliance with Civil law.
                    It is very difficult to get a local Magistrate to attend to complaints of
                    Colored men, I have yet to hear of an instance in which the complaint of a
                    freedman against a white man has been taken up unless under instructions from
                    this office.</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular number 11 CS from Headquarters
                    Assistant
                    Commissioner State Virginia I have registered during the month 544 couples of
                    freedpeople as married by the State Act of February 27th 1866 - making a total
                    of registry for the County of 721 couples-- Total
                    number of children recognized by the Father as his 1986 or an average of 2 3/4
                    children to each married <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>couple-- The total slave population before
                    the war was 5617- the total registry amounts to 3428, which with licensed
                    marriages, illegitimate children, and the floating population not reached by the
                    State Law, must with the losses to the County from the
                    emigration of Colored people during the war include nearly all those required to
                    be registered by the Law.</p>
<p class="p10">Stringent measures should be taken with a <i>[unclear: numerous]</i> class of
                    freedpeople who congregate in towns, and live - no one knows how - or shift
                    about through the country changing employers upon the most frivolous pretexes or
                    often with no reason further than their own inclinations - the forfeit of the
                    wages does not affect them in the least, though a final compensation to the employer, who is often during the pressing,
                    busy season obliged to seek other labor, with perhaps the same result, as the
                    better class find employment by the year.</p>
<p class="p10">Highland County</p>
<p class="p10">In this County the General <i>[unclear: Lands]</i>
                    Department of Virginia issued an order through this
                    office dated May 27<sup>th</sup> 1866 directing that proceedings in
                    certain cases - <i>[unclear: "Burkit &amp; Guhin"]</i> refugees <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>be stopped and the property in question be restored to them at once - this
                    order was promptly communicated to the Common Wealths Attorney of the County but Mr. Burkit informed
                    me on the 23<sup>d</sup> inst. that he had been unable by personal
                    application to get the property in question and the lawyer of
                    <i>[unclear: Guhin]</i> since informed me that his <i>[unclear: Ch]</i> was
                    still held to answer the charges against him.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient Servant</p>
