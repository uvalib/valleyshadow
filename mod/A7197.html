<h4>Augusta County: Mary D. Williams to Samuel Hunt, May 1, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Echoing the sentiments of other AMA teachers, Williams complains about the Association's inability to find enough teachers to sustain the ever-growing freedmen's schools during the summer months.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
Rev. S. Hunt 
Staunton 
</b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 1<sup>st</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">There has been such an entire change in the schools since the last report was made out that I hardly know what to say in regard to the progress made in my department not having yet learned the names of many of my new scholars.  The average is small from the fact that twenty six of the number have entered school for the first time within a fortnight.  New ones are added almost daily.</p>
<p class="p10">It seems a pity that the large number who have been under instruction but a few weeks should be so soon turned out by the breaking up of the schools.  Could not one department be continued through the summer?  The climate would allow of it if the rules of the Society do not forbid.</p>
<p class="p10">We all regret that Miss Dewey finds it necessary to leave before the close of the term.  The Association used to send out teachers in the spring.  Do they refuse to do so now?</p>
<p class="p10">The people are making a great effort to pay for their church and will doubtless be able to do so.  There is some religious interest + a number connected with our schools are rejoicing in Christ.  All are regretting that the teachers are to leave so soon and hope they will return in the fall.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>M. D. Williams</i></p>
