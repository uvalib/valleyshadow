<p class="p10">March 25 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Hospital Department 16th Pa Cav, Turkey Run, Va </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 15 <sup>th</sup> &amp; 18<sup>th</sup>
                    were received this evening &amp; I feel sorry
                    for the little folk who are sick. I can't be much help
                    to you &amp; hope you may get along without much trouble. I expect you had
                    better have Dr. Davidson to see Josey &amp; he can tell I suppose what
                    causes the pain in the side &amp; what you had better do for it. Give Josey
                    as nourishing diet as you can to keep up his strength, milk &amp; eggs if
                    you can get them. Nurse his appetite with anything nourishing you can get him to
                    eat. I got a letter from Father last Sabbath. Lizzie was about well &amp;
                    Susie had been sick 4 or 5 days when they wrote.</p>
<p class="p10">On Wednesday morning we had about 8 inches of snow on the ground. Yesterday was
                    bright &amp; beautiful. This evening it is raining &amp; has been for
                    several hours &amp; there is not much prospect of it ceasing soon. It is all
                    quiet here. The rebels
                    don't disturb us any. Our pickets near Bealton pick up
                    one every now and then.</p>
<p class="p10">I hear that General Grant came down to the Army of Potomac yesterday &amp; as
                    soon as the roads are fit I suppose he will have us on the go again.</p>
<p class="p10">I sent you today a history of our regiment for its first years operations. I wish
                    you would not let it get destroyed as it will be interesting to look at when I
                    get home. </p>
<p class="p10">I would be very much pleased to cut your wood this evening &amp; take my pay
                    &amp; some of Lucy's molasses. Nothing could afford me more pleasure. Then I
                    could do something for Josey &amp; have my helpmate at hand!</p>
<p class="p10">You speak of settling Ambless note. I expect that will be the best plan owing to
                    the distance he lives from Good Intent. There is some talk of the paymaster
                    coming around before long. Let me know how you get along with your money. In
                    regard to the office you may rest assured that I will make every effort to get
                    it but you see others have a say about it. Dr. Hermann was at Harrisburg this
                    week talking to Dr. King about his own &amp; my case. Dr. King promises him
                    as soon as there is a vacancy would occur he would procure a furlough for me so
                    that I can go to Harrisburg &amp; be examineed. Dr. H. will also go to be
                    examined for Surgeon as he is now only an Assistant. He &amp; I will go together as soon as Dr. King says so.</p>
<p class="p10">If we get some more recruits I will get the position in this regiment as the
                        Colonel has as much as promised to use his
                    influence. If our regiment is not recruited up I will have to wait until Dr.
                    Hermann is promoted Surgeon to some other regiment. Then I will get his place
                    here. So we must have patience. It is late bedtime &amp; I will not close my
                    letter until morning but go to bed asking the choicest blessing for my wife &amp; family that their lives may be
                    spared &amp; enabled to honor God in all that they do. Good night.</p>
<p class="p10">Saturday March 26<sup>th</sup><br> Nothing new this morning. All
                    Quiet. I wonder how you all are this morning. I hope Josey is better. We had
                    about 20 recruits come in a few minutes filling up a little. It may be we will
                    get enough before long to give me an Assistant
                    Surgeons position. I will be rejoiced for your sake if it is so. I can get home
                    to see you &amp; have more means for your comfort at home. I am very busy
                    with reports today &amp; can't answer your two
                    letters as well as I would like to do but remain with unchanged love</p>
<p class="p10">Your most affectionate husband </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S.M. Potter </i></p>
