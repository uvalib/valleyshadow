                <p>I arrived here safely last night about 1, &amp; stopped at the St. Lawrence.
                    This morning after breakfast, I went to the Mint -- <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> before it
                    Sunday <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp;
                    inside a crowd of probably 200 in a row; each waiting his turn.-- The officer
                    politely invited me to take my place in the rear, informing me that it would be
                    2 o'clock before I would get through.-- Of course, my back rebelled at the idea
                    of such a martyrdom.-- I went to the office, talked with the clerks &amp;
                    discovered (what I now recalled having read in the circular of the Director of
                    the Mint) that the <unclear>Adams</unclear>
                    <unclear>Express</unclear>
                    <pb n="2"/>Company would deliver cents in quantities of $50 &amp; upward
                    free of charge on all the notes.-- This is done by arrangement -- the Mint
                    paying the <orig reg="expense">expence</orig>.-- I will go at once to the office
                    of the Company, deposit the money with them with proper instructions, take
                    receipt &amp; have <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the box sent to my address, <abbr
                        expan="New">N.</abbr> York - to be there called for by
                    <unclear>Stockholders</unclear>. This will cost the <orig reg="bank">Bank</orig>
                    less freight <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> than if I had the box to take home with me.
                    &amp; is a better plan.-- I was glad to be reminded of the possibility of
                    this, for it at once releases me of what <pb n="3"/> would prove a tedious
                    detention. I will go also to the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp;c. this morning,
                    &amp; do all the business I can.--</p>

                <p>Our <abbr expan="committee">Comte.</abbr> meeting will be full, from appearances.
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> is here.</p>

                <p>The Injunction will be argued <hi rend="underline">here</hi> next Tuesday. <hi
                        rend="underline">
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    </hi> will represent the company. The public appear to anticipate a refusal, but
                    I have no reliable information.--</p>

                <p>We found Mr. Drexel an agreeable companion as far as York <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> day. I expect to call in a moment to see him.</p>

                <p>Sarah found all at home about as well as usual.</p>

                <p>I hope Aunt <unclear>Polly</unclear> has <pb n="4"/> recovered.-- Give my love to
                    her &amp; mother.</p>

                            <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>.-- He preferred decidedly the picture taken in <abbr
                            expan="Philadelphia">Phila</abbr>, thinking it would make the best of
                        me. The magnifying glass revealed the superiority of the former &amp;
                        the defects of the latter, very clearly. -- They think the <orig reg="bank"
                            >Bank</orig> should have a <unclear>steel</unclear> plate. The
                        additional cost is but $50 &amp; it will last while the Bank does.-- I
                        will go back to the Mint in the morning. This has been supply day for the
                        city, &amp; the crowd has been greater than usual.-- Adams Express men
                        think I can have the cents forwarded more promptly dealing directly with the
                        Mint than through them.-- In either event, the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> expense to York. I hope to effect an arrangement, and there
                            <del hand="h1">will</del> may be some delay in getting the money.-- I
                        was at the stationer's &amp; have everything fixed.-- The blanks will
                        not cost over $5 a ream on an average.-- The envelopes $3.25 per 1000. I
                        ordered 1000.-- I have Mother's Gelatine &amp; corn starch &amp;
                        after dinner will attend to other small matters.--<lb/><abbr expan="Edward"
