<h4>Franklin County: H. W. Freedley to Maria Hiester,
                    June 18, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Freedley tells Hiester of the army's movement and predicts an imminent clash with
                    Confederates. He mentions the isolation of soldiers from news and their
                    immersion in rumors; and he wishes that he could visit Hiester.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Maria</p>
<p class="p10">I have taken this opportunity to write you a line I ascertained yesterday that my
                    last two dispatches were intercepted at Army Headquarters. We are now near Leesburg after the rebel army. I expect we
                    will soon have another engagement. I do not know the news and we hear a variety
                    of rumors. I have not seen a paper for a week and intercourse is entirely
                    stopped. Our letters do not reach their <i>[deleted: 
                        informal
                    ]</i> destination I hope you have left <i>[unclear: Millmont]</i> and that you
                    are not exposed to the rudeness of the soldiers. I am so sorry that I could not
                    take advantage of my "leave" to see you before their "raid" for I do not know
                    when I will be able to come now. I will now endeavor to obtain a Pennsylvania regiment I'm so sorry that I could not
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> to these <i>[illeg.]</i> to defend the promotion.</p>
<p class="p10">Ever Your Friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>HWFreedley</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I wrote to your father at the Continental
                    Hotel</p>
