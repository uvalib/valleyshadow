<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter in post time and was glad to hear from you I am well at
                    present and hope these few lines may find you enjoying good health. There is
                    great excitement in camp tonight. we hear that our
                    troops are in possession of Yorktown. they
                    Evacuated their fortifications and retreated about <i>[unclear: 18]</i> miles
                    towards Richmond. they are <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> now stationed on Chickahom<i>[added: m]</i>ny creek. the 3 Pennsylvania Volunteer Companies
                    <i>[deleted: and the]</i> are following them up and capturing their men as
                    fast as they can. and Banks and M<sup>c</sup> Duvall are coming up in
                    the rear. I think against they get Richmond and Yorktown (our troops I mean) it
                    will be the ending of the war. I hope so anyhow. we have orders tonight to go to the fort tomorrow morning on some
                    business or other I don't know what. there is no use of
                    guessing for we won't know till we get there. some of
                    the rebels' gunboats were seen
                    off Crany Island today but they showed no sign of
                    fight. There is a report that they are Evacuated <i>[unclear: Senals]</i> Point
                    but there is no telling how true it is. for as I often say you can't believe anything you hear, until it
                    is proved. we were mustered for two months more pay on the 30 of last month. we
                    will be payed in less than 15 days. now<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> there is pretty good pasture
                    down here in some places. now we were out <i>[deleted: theday]</i> today
                    letting our horses have a little. it is pretty warm here. we are beginning to
                    try our luck fishing now some of the Regiment is out all the time. we catch
                    eels, cat fish, and spots, and sometimes
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        toad
                    ]</i>fish but it is rather early yet. tell Steward we have better times now
                    than him and me had at the old warehouse. Give my love to Jane. to Ben, also, my
                    love to Fred. tell old XJ I send my love to him. and I am looking for that woman
                    he said he was going to send me. tell him to hurry up, for I am waiting very patiently. tell old Jimmy I send my love to him.
                    tell old Jimmy that the one he had his eye on says he is no man at    all. this is about all. so I must stop writing.
                    Nothing more at present except I remain your<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Brother </p>
