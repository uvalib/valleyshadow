<h4>Franklin County: P. T. Zarhoviy to M. L. Brewer, April 18, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>P. T. Zarhoviy attempts to answer M. L. Brewer's questions about his grandfather's will and
     estate. Zarhoviy suggests that M. L. Brewer direct several questions to his uncle George W.
     Brewer. In relating his knowledge of his grandfather's affairs, Zarhoviy mentions "Old Negro
     Poll," as an heir, probably a daughter since she is later referred to as "your Aunt
    Pollie."</p>

<p class="p10">April 18<sup>th</sup> 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Bedford Monroe County, Michigan</p>
<p class="p10">M. L. Brewer Esquire<br> Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">It would be more than useless to make an apology for not answering
     your queries
     <u>much</u> sooner. I will however say, I forgot it from time to time until it is too back</p>
<p class="p10">I am not posted to answer your queries, I will however give you
     all I can recollect In the first place my administration on your
     Father estate
     compelled me to get a copy of your
      Grandfather's will, This I got only a short time before I
     requested to be released as administrator and Andrew Kershner was
      appointed by the Court administrator
     <i>[unclear: De Bower]</i> Now, and I gave up all papers &amp; credits in my hand to him.
     I recollect well that by your Grandfather's will all his children
     were mentioned even Old Negro Poll, and as your Fathers part was a set off against his legacy*
     I was compelled to know the worth of the will your Uncle
     George Brewer was executor in will and thus far only I became initated
     in the Settlement with George
     Brewer. Andrew Kershner however found it necessary to sell your Fathers
     lands. This is a matter I could never understand, as it appeared to me all might have been paid
     without selling all the land <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Your Uncles and aunts were all mentioned and cared for in your Grandfather's will, as said before, but as to the amount of each
     legacy, I am not able to say at this time Henry Brewer's Heirs are George Brewer, Henry Brewer, Emanuel Brewer Elisabeth Brewer-(Mrs
      <i>[unclear: Feidt]</i>) Polly Brewer (Mrs Troxell) Sallie Brewer (Mrs Herschberger) and
     Negro Pollie This is all I can say about the will &amp; Matter your only way is to have a copy of your Grandfather's will, and copy of the settlements
     made with the orphans Court. Also a copy of settlements made by your
      Uncle
     George, as administrator of your Aunt Mary
     Traxell This will show you all you need on the subject and all that will be of any use to you
     in the premises. I suppose you have done So already. I would do it at once if not done. If my recollection serves me right John Traxell could not get at his
     wifes legacy, But is so long since that I forget, it perhaps was a lieu on some real estate the interest of which fell annually to your Aunt Pollie. I know
     there were some kinks in reference to her
     legacy. Troxell was a shiftless man and <i>[unclear: ]</i> a guard against squandering by your Grandfather. I am sorry that I delayed this matter so long. Nothing
     however can go wrong by this as your course is before on record in Washington County Maryland in the Prothonotory office We are all well. My respects to you
     &amp; family write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours etc.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>P T Zarhoviy</i></p>
<p class="p10">P. S. Peter is anxiously waiting to hear from you on the Mill Situation
      for him, if any can be found near you <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br>*Your Father got his farm off his Father and was indebted to his estate, which had to be answered to your Uncle
      George
      Brewer executor in to will of your Grandfather Brewer </p>
