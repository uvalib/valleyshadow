<p class="p10">November 11th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Annie</p>
<p class="p10"> I embrace this my earliest opportunity of answering your <u>very</u> welcome, &amp; interesting letter, which I received before
                    leaving Centerville - We left there on friday about 2 oclock &amp; arrived
                    at the Junction about sunset - We then transferred our baggage to the cars &amp; took
                    the same for Strawsburg, where we arrived <i>[unclear: Sun]</i>day, <i>[deleted: ]</i> he D<i>[illeg.]</i> was any thing else, but a pleasant one;
                    from the fact that we<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> were so much crowded. I for one lay on the top
                    of the cars &amp; slept, but was nearly frozen all the time. Everything passed off very agreeably, considering -
                    no accident occuring save one - &amp; that was truly sad. One of Captain Roberts men fell off the top of the cars
                    &amp; got nearly killed. he lived about 2 hours after they got him on the
                    train. He was an Irishman by the name of OBryan, the rest of the Irish belonging
                    to the company <i>[unclear: after]</i> we got to Strawsburg got as "tight" as
                    they could get. (This you know is part of their<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> religion, or their
                    rule at least - which they strictly adhere to) Well, I can't say now, how long we will remain at this place or whether we will
                    go into winter quarters - this will depend entirely on the movements of the
                    enemy. It was reported before we left Centerville, that the <u>Yankees</u> were advancing toward this place. That there was a number of
                    them in Martinsburg &amp; <i>[unclear: Romney]</i>. Also Shepards Town. But
                    this has turned out to be false; except at Romney. There are about 5000 at that
                    place &amp; are busily engaged fortifying.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">I am <u>glad</u> to inform you that I am not as corpulent as
                    you heard, but still remain about the same - but not near so good looking as the
                    Gentleman you spoke of. Lieut M<sup>c</sup> says he <i>[deleted: would]</i> certainly would like to kiss <u>that</u>
                    lady &amp; you too. he sends his best love to <u>you</u>
                    &amp; all the <i>[unclear: girls]</i>. Mr Miller has recovered. Says he was
                    in the same fix but you can return my <u>love</u> good
                    wishes, &amp; To Maggie &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> tell them I would like to
                    see <u>them</u> so much, also all the rest. Excuse this short
                    letter, nothing more at present but remain yours as ever</p>
<p class="p10"></p>

                        don't show this is you please</p>
