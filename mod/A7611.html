<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, November 1, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and announces arrangements are going forward to open
                    the hotel he has purchased. He regrets his wife will not be able to join him in
                    Staunton, but suggests that perhaps Freddy should be sent as a cure for his
                    "reckless" behavior. He also discusses supplies he would like sent.</p>
