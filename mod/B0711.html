<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Roswell Waldo to John A.
                    McDonnell, December 17, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waldo reports that the Commonwealth attorney in Augusta County, James Bumgardner,
                    is a rebel sympathizer and recommends the importation of a qualified and loyal
                    man to fill the post. He does recommend that William Burnett remain in his
                    position as County Clerk.</p>

                    Captain J A McDonnell<br>Sub

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 17, 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Captain: -</p>
<p class="p10">In reply to your communication of 7<sup>th</sup>
                    instant requesting recommendations for the offices of
                    Commonwealth Attorney &amp; County Clerk in Augusta &amp; Highland Counties I have the honor to state that the present
                    incumbent of the office of Commonwealth Attorney for
                    Augusta (James Bumgardner) although never having taken an oath for any Judicator
                    Executive office before the war, is nevertheless a rebel in spirit &amp;
                    sympathy &amp; was a captain in the rebel army, &amp; in my opinion
                    should be removed but, (with the exception of one &amp; he declines the
                    office) I am unable to find within the limits of the County a man who is
                    qualified for this position, and</p>
<p class="p10">whose political antecedents and opinion are not of the most Conservative
                    Character and who was not in some way Connected with the rebel army or
                    sympathized therewith. - To fill this office to the best interests &amp;
                    satisfaction of the loyal Element of the County an attorney should be imported.</p>
<p class="p10">Relative to the office of County Clerk of Augusta the present incumbent (William A Burnett) although at one
                    time a private in the rebel army and feels that he cannot conscientiously take
                    the test oath, is, nevertheless a valuable &amp; able officer, Courteous,
                    Kind, obliging &amp; a gentleman of no political vindictiveness, and I
                    believe I speak the sentiments of all loyal citizens of Augusta, in recommending
                    his retention as County Clerk if possible.</p>
<p class="p10">In Highland the same difficulty exists as in Augusta - Both Commonwealth Attorney &amp; Clerk should, in my
                    opinion, be removed. There are but three men qualified for positions of Attorney
                    &amp; all bitter rebels - in fact the present incumbent (James N. Seig) is
                    the least objectionable. I cannot conscientiously, recommend any of these but
                    would favor importation.</p>
<p class="p10">After diligent inquiring, I can find no one to fill the office of County Clerk,
                    who can take the requisite oath. - Thomas H. Slavens
                        Postmaster is the only gentleman I could favor for
                    this place, but he cannot take</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully</p>
