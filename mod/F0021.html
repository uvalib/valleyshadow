<p class="p10">July 28<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Hospital Baltimore</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cynthia </p>
<p class="p10">Since I wrote you from Harpers Ferry Hospital I have been transferred to
                    Baltimore at my own request thinking while I was a little sick that I could get
                    a sick furlough, but after coming here I got so much better that they refused to
                    give me a furlough and dearly as I love to be with you at home I don't see how to get there at present so I will ask you to
                    be patient for a while longer &amp; I will, will submit to though I would
                    like so much to be at home with you and the children. The Doctor found me so
                    well yesterday he returned me to duty. I was in the Stuart Mansion Hospital
                    &amp; finding there would be no chance there for a furlough, I tried to get
                    transferred to a hospital in Harrisburg, hoping that I could get from there, but
                    the Doctor was in a bad humour -- some of the nurses had been out the night
                    before &amp; got drunk, so when I went to ask him for my transfer he
                    answered me as mad as a hornet. When I will leave here to go to the regiment I
                    cannot tell, as it is away down in Virginia &amp; the officers here don't know where it is. There are some men here who have
                    been well and hearty for a month &amp; not been sent off yet, so that I may
                    probably remain here for some time &amp; may leave today nobody knows. There
                    are a great many sick &amp; wounded soldiers here in Baltimore &amp; the
                    hospitals are conducted in the best manner. Everything must be clean about them.
                    The sick and wounded have the best kind of diet. Those who are not sick have to
                    live on a very plain diet and they growl a good deal about it although they get
                    plenty to eat. There are about 400 in this hospital none of them very sick, most
                    of them like me, waiting to be sent to their regiments. We have no special war
                    news here at this time &amp; I have nothing to relate of interest as taking
                    place here. It is very monotonous here. We have a fine view of the city
                    &amp; bay but that is all the good it does us now. We can't get out they are very strict keeping us in the hospital grounds
                    very close &amp; it is right enough as a number of the men if they would get
                    out would be disorderly drunk &amp;c. You need not direct your letters to me
                    at this place as I do not know how long I may remain. Direct them as you have
                    been doing to Washington to the regiment &amp; I will get them some day. I
                    hope this may find you all well. I would like so much to get a letter from you
                    as I can't get home for some time yet. Your last letter
                    took me home &amp; landed me on the porch beside you with the children
                    around us &amp; I felt very happy for a while &amp; cheerful. But do not
                    despair. The same Almightly power that has kept sickness from me so long
                    &amp; raised me up when disease took hold of me will in his good time and
                    way permit me to remain with my family if consistent with his will &amp; if
                    His will be otherwise let us say thy will be done. He still orders everything
                    for the best &amp; knows what is best for us if we do not know. So in any
                    case my dear wife let us put all our trust in him. It is very hard to part with
                    our best friends &amp; we may be disposed to murmur at it, but our Heavenly
                    father knows what is best for us. Give my love to the children kiss them for me.
                    Tell Josey &amp; Lucy &amp; Bell when I get home I will bake them
                    something nice. I still intend to keep trying to get a furlough. Remember me in
                    yoru prayers Cynthia &amp; I will pray for the choicest blessing upon you
                    all. May God keep you in his loving care &amp; his
                    spirit dwell with you. </p>
<p class="p10">Your most affectionate husband and father </p>
