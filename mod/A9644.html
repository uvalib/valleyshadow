<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 25th 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camped Near Liberty Mills</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I seat my self once more for the purpose of penning you
                    a few lines. I arrived safely in camp on the 21 and have
                    been improving in health ever since. We have a
                    very nice camp and the water is very good. Our Company
                    numbers sixty odd at present; more than we have had
                        present for some time past. I hope providence may
                    smile on our armies and bless us with health. I found Brother John looking badly again. I was fearful he was taking the fever but
                    think he is somewhat better today. Charles has returned to the camp at last he
                    was <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to see grand ma. he says he had a great
                    deal of pleasure. I tried to shame him for treat<i>[added: ing]</i> us all so badly by not writing. he
                    wrote home to day for the first time for the last six months I believe; We have
                    to drill twice a day. Mr. Robert Taylor received his discharge to day
                    being over thirty five years of age. he has been a good soldier and I am glad to
                    see him get off
                    honorably.</p>
<p class="p10">Our Regiment has a Chaplain at last he is a Baptist
                        there was prayer meeting last night &amp; night
                    before. I hope &amp; pray that his teachings may be a benefit to the Regiment &amp; that many may give them selves over
                    unto the true &amp; living God. Our Chaplains name is Wa<i>[deleted: r]</i>ters he is a very good preach<i>[added: er]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Kate I had a wonderful time Saturday night of the <i>[unclear: 19]</i> hunting
                    for deserters we all enjoyed our selves finely surrounding the houses &amp; charging <i>[added: the]</i> dogs. We arrested Frank Taylor &amp; brought
                    him as far as Peter Hights; and left him in the charge of Isaac Vines &amp;
                    George Hight until I could go home &amp; return.
                    About sun up he asked permission to go down to Mr Faubers, a half miles distant.
                    Hight granted his request &amp; Vines went with him. He had not been there long before he told Ike he wanted to go in another room to see Mr Fauber who was sick Ike thought
                    all was right &amp; let him go alone &amp; then he made his escape. Ike
                    after looking around for him returned alone. I had been
                    waiting nearly an hour. We all laughed at Ike and
                    told him he was a bad sentinel.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Kate I came away &amp; forgot my presents
                    but I hope and pray the day may not be very far distant when I may return
                    &amp; receive from thee a richer &amp; nobler
                    blessing thy hand &amp; heart. Oh dear Kate with out thee every thing would be dark &amp; dreary. I would rise up in the
                    morning &amp; lie down at <i>[added: night]</i> with out
                    having any one to whisper the breathings of a pure and humble heart. I must bring my letter to a close. Write soon. My prayer is
                    that you may be blessed with all the mercies of our
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> God.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your true and affectionate admirer</p>
