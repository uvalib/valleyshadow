<h4>Franklin County: James A. Carman to His Father, May
                    28, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carman writes that he has been moved to a prison in Macon, Georgia, while his
                    brother is imprisoned at Andersonville. He wonders why prisoners have not been
                    exchanged yet.</p>

<p class="p10">Macon Ga. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Your last was received. I was glad to hear from You and to learn you are well. I
                    am well and in excellent spirits. Since I last wrote you we have been removed
                    from Libby to this place here we are encamped in a fair ground with open air
                    exercise &amp; good water. the change is I think a healthy one. I have Sent
                    to Doctor Reid for a Box of eatables and Clothing. </p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard from Brother Frank since I last wrote.
                    he is some 70 miles from here at Andersonville Georgia. Father we are all
                    anxiously hoping for an exchange. I cannot see why it does not take place. Some
                    of us have now been prisoners over a year. Perhaps
                    when we least think of it the happy moment will come. When You write to Margaret
                    tell her I will write to her soon. <i>[added: I received her letter]</i>.
                    writing material is scarce here, fifty cents a sheet for letter paper. Father I like the climate down here very much, it is
                    just the weather for me. <u>Warm</u>. When You write direct
                    to Macon Georgia via Richmond Virginia. please remember me to all inquiring friends. write soon. no more
                    but </p>
<p class="p10">Remain Your Son </p>
