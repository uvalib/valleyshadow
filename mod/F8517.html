<p class="p10">Friday, July 27<sup>th</sup> 1854</p>
<p class="p10">Buena Vista Springs,</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">As we had a storm yesterday I feared you might be anxious to know how I managed
                    to get through it. And I did get through very well. When at the Church it first
                    came upon me.-- There being no house near I had to trip on for some time in a
                    very heavy rain at a pace no faster than a walk. After some time I came near a
                    house. I observed a barn leading up to the house from the road. Into this I
                    intended driving: but was prepared on riding to the beginning of the lane to
                    find a barn there which prohibited entrance.-- The choice was left me either to
                    press my journey or get out &amp; take down the barn. I of course chose the
                    former &amp; continued on through the storm which abated when I reached a
                    house on the road with a "little better" barn a mile from Millerstown, as the
                    man told me.-- The storm was very heavy as I suppose you in Gettysburg can testify. I put up the apron as high as I
                    could, but <i>[unclear: could]</i> not succeed in keeping off the rain entirely
                    from my face &amp; head.-- I arrived here, after tarrying almost 3/4s of an
                    hour in Millerstown, about six o'clock. By way of compliment to my writing I may
                    tell you that a boy who with very bad manners was looking at me when writing the
                    above gave up in despair, &amp; retired, remarking that I write a very <u>fine</u> hand.-- I have taken two meals &amp; a sleep
                    last night &amp; am able to form some idea of the house.-- And my opinion is
                    that it is the best house <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I ever stopped at on the Mountain.- The
                    table is very good. Things are nice well cooked &amp; palatable.-- The boarders have a table to themselves &amp; are not
                    made to eat with the hosteller or not at all.-- They
                    are waited on attentively.-- W. F.s family <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> sit at table with the boarders. The beds are very nice. Mine
                    last night had on two as nice sheets as I <u>ever slept on or
                        could ever</u> -- a nice coverlet and a blanket alongside to be used if
                    necessary.-- I am much surprised at the accomodations.-- Please give my
                    compliments to George MClellan &amp; tell him for
                    me that if "Frank is not a decent man he keeps a very good house, his table <i>[added: &amp; beds]</i>, being about as much superior
                    to Goodyear's or Buchman's his own, I believe is to Griswolds." The reason for
                    sending this message is he was trying to ridicule Frank &amp; his house
                    yesterday, I thought, in which he was assisted by others who tried their hand at
                    ridicule me <i>[added: for offering to go there]</i> too
                    until I gave them a cut or two which made them silent.-- The bathing
                    establishment - the building is not so good as Goodyear's but it is just enough
                    for all useful purposes. The warm baths fixture is something like this:--
                    Suppose this a little building:-- [hand drawn illustration of a bath fixture]
                    that inside fixture the bath tub, greatly larger, the outside mark a boiler
                    connecting with the tub by two tubes running though the side of the house into
                    the tub.-- The water in the cylinder when heated boils over &amp; flows
                    through the upper tube into the tub &amp; makes the crater in the tub of the
                    requisite temperature.-- The regular boarders here
                    are people Aikers, of Mt. St. Mary College &amp; Maryland University
                    &amp; his family in all seven. A party of about ten came today from
                    Muttontown.-- About 12 couples are expected from there tomorrow, so these
                    report. The town is near Hagerstown.-- His terms are not more than $4.-- I
                    expect not so much from what he told me last evening.-- W. F. &amp; I went
                    up to the spring he <i>[illeg.]</i> last summer about half a mile from this up
                    the mountain.-- It is indeed very large, the largest I ever saw.- It is larger
                    than our <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> pantry - and beautiful.- The house he erected last season
                    -- is unoccupied now. He expects to move it up to the road next spring &amp;
                    keep both going.-- Buchmans' is not making any progress. The foundation is up.
                    They are now burning the brick for it.-- I expect to be home some time next week
                    as I mentioned before I left.-- I may go from Hagerstown through Waynesboro over to the <i>[unclear: fham G.
                    Road]</i> -- &amp; to the Springs near Fayetteville -- about two miles
                    from the place we come out on the road.-- I don't know that I will but I may. I
                    understood that the other day 120 for dinner there-- Quite a crowd.-- I have a
                    bad pen &amp; worse ink.-- Love to all.--I don't precisely when I go to
                    Hagerstown</p>
