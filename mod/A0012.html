<p class="p10">To Miss Margaret Dunlap</p>
<p class="p10">well Mag I suppose you have heard that I have moved here. I heard the other day
                    that you were living at Mr Dulls, and I write this to know whether you will come and live with me a while. I would like you
                    would come if you possibly can. I want you to work as
                    soon as you get this and let me know whether you can
                    come or not and what you charge a week if you can come Mr. Cook will go for you.
                    I think I would rather have you as I am acquainted with you or used to be, it is
                    a long while since I saw you I have been looking for you to see me ever since we
                    came here I will have to close the stage will be here directly and I want to
                    send it if you get this I want an answer forthwith just as soon as you can write
                    it. for if you can't come we will have to try someone else.</p>
<p class="p10">your friend</p>
