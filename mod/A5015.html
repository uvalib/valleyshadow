     hear you had been so sick. We are sorry you will not able to come to see us this Spring, but
     hope you will soon be able to come. Uncle Jacob will be here this summer. We have had a great
     deal of sickness in our family every member has been sick. Ma has been quite sick for four or
     five weeks, but she is better now. We received the apples safe yesterday, but<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> they
     were nearly all rotten. We are very much obliged to you, for them. Our <i>[unclear: road]</i>
     this winter has been very stumpy, but we are getting along as well as we have any right to
