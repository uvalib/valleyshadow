                    Alderman <i>[unclear: hones]</i> + he + his party were defeated by as he says a
                    combination of the old <i>[unclear: Coon]</i> and the old

                    appointed a Committee to waite on Stine asking him

                    night that we might make some apology for not
                    answering him as we had stated in the paper of last week we should prefer to
                    punish him at <i>[unclear: Saw]</i> if we can sustain action vs him for libel,
                    or a private conversation would might
