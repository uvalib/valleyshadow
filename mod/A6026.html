<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 20th, 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">General-</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter in regard to horses unfit for service is at hand. When I wrote to you in regard
     to them I understood many horses were turned out as unfit for use. If the number that ought to
     be changed can be reported to me I will send out horses to take the places of those unfit for
     service.</p>
<p class="p10">On Thursday last I sent 7 loads of corn (4 horse) to Monterey. This morning 4 four horse
     loads of corn &amp; Saturday 7 two horse wagons of Capt. Miller's
     <i>[unclear: Battery]</i> with corn &amp; tomorrow morning I start twenty four horse wagon
     loads of corn &amp; 10 loads of clothing marked to Maj. J. L. Corley. I write to Capt. P.
     B. Hoge the Quarter master at Monterey if you desire it &amp; direct him to do so although
     the corn is invoiced to Monterey to send it through without unloading to Greenbrier River. Col.
     Scott who is now in my office says he does not think 20 loads of corn can be stored at
     Greenbrier River. Please advise Capt. Hoge what you wish done by express.</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday a train of wagons loaded with corn was started from the county of Rockingham to
     Monterey. It is most important the bags should be returned to us &amp; for that reason if
     there is not room to store the corn at the River I wish it stopped at Monterey. I hope you will
     not think me troublesome in writing to you about these details, but there has been so much
     mismanagement I think it is best to communicate with you direct until I get all in good order.</p>
<p class="p10">There are now 1000 men in the Hospital here and it is too much crowded. Surgeon Boatwright
     informs me he has 250 men on the road to this place. I have recommended to the Surgeon General
     to authorize me to contract for the use of the Rockbridge Baths 9 miles from the Central Rail
     Road &amp; will accommodate 300,and also to contract for Stribling Springs provided we need
     them &amp; I feel confident we will need both in less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully Your Obedient Servant M.G. Harman Lt. Colonel, Comdg. &amp;c..</p>
