<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John B. Watts to Orlando
                    Brown, October 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Watts, a lawyer in Staunton, appeals that Roswell Waldo's order to transfer to
                    Wytheville be revoked, observing Waldo's excellent performance as the Bureau's
                    agent in Augusta County.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    General O. Brown<br>Assistant Commissioner &amp;c

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I have just learned from Roswell Waldo, <i>[unclear: Esq]</i>, Assistant Sub Assistant Commissioner, here, that
                    he has been ordered to report at Wytheville for duty. And having been a close
                    observer of him, &amp; his promptitude in the dispatch of business involved
                    by his position, permit me to express my deep regret at his ordered removal from
                    the office here, and further, to express a <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>hope that the order will
                    be recalled, &amp; he continued in his place: I have reason to believe he
                    has given entire, general satisfaction, to all interests concerned.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been here for over thirty years, &amp; most of that time a member of
                    the Bar: And I do think I have a right to think I can with propriety make the
                    appeal herein, to you.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly, your obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John B. Watts</i></p>
