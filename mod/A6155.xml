     the 12 which found me enjoying the best of health hoping the same may be your present Condition
     of health when Those few lines reach you I have nothing to write that will interest you at
     present but Sincerely hope this will find you with plenty to answer I always thought you placed
     more confidence in my <orig reg="Sincerity">Scincerity</orig> than to think I would go with the
     yanks when they came through here they <orig reg="knew">new</orig> I was to strong a <abbr
      expan="secessionist">Cecess</abbr> to go with them &amp; I <orig reg="believe"
     >beleive</orig> I am a <orig reg="purest">pures</orig> one than ever they were the cause of a
      <orig reg="great 
 deal">greateal</orig> of excitement &amp; I <orig reg="believe">beleive</orig>
     <orig reg="a great">agreat</orig> many turned their long faces back to the Union but I never
     intend to do so as long as there yet remains one <abbr expan="secessionist">cecess</abbr> left
     &amp; I expect I will be the last one going into the Union. although I would do most <orig
      reg="anything">any thing</orig> to cause peace once more but it looks like we<pb n="2"/> will
     never again See the same times we once did we have some of the finest <orig reg="opportunities"
      >opprtuntys</orig> to have Sport making Apple butter but I can never enjoy myself as long as
     this war Continues I think we would all forget that times ever were to be enjoyed if this war
     lasts two years longer I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> think I Can ever forgive the Enemy for
     those they have killed I hope they will be made sorely repent for it but If they Continue
     fighting as they have recently <orig reg="there">they</orig>
     <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> be a great number left on either side You stated in your letter

     I will kill myself drinking I am going to save some that I may get drunk when this Cruel war is
     over I was coming from greenville the other day &amp; I met a soldier he was as drunk as
     people generally get he insisted on me drinking but I told him I never drank any If I had only
     been acquainted with him I would certainly have plagued him enough but I was too bad <orig
      reg="scared">skeered</orig> to talk much if they had only some person been along with me I
     would have taken his brandy like I was<pb n="4"/>going to drink &amp; kept it he begged me
     to Excuse him for being drunk &amp; I told him I would if he would do so no more &amp;
     he promised he would do better but I <orig reg="know">no</orig> the boys promises are like pie
     crust they are made to be broken when they can get liquor to drink they never think of a
     promise he said the reason he had gotten so they was a lady Expressed a wish to see him so
     &amp; he had promised her she should I told him he was very excusable if he was fulfilling
     a promise but I told him I <orig reg="believed">beleived</orig> it was because he liked the
     taste of it instead of that I will Close by asking you to excuse this badly written &amp;
     Composed letter &amp; Correct all mistakes</p>
