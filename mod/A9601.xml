                <p>I can not leave without a note to tell you how grieved I was not to have been
                    able to say a few words I wished to speak at parting. I left you at Miss Goode's
                    because I thought I discovered I was in the way, and that your friend was
                    present on our walk to deprive me of the coveted opportunity I sought, but could
                    not have; all the evening, for only a very few words of good bye. If I had <hi
                        rend="underline">known</hi> before we started <pb n="2"/> that he was going
                    I would have sent Miss Goode my apology by you &amp; not have made myself a
                    third party to the walk. Where one is so deeply attached as I am to you, without
                    any ground of hope to stand upon, even trifles are watched. And the Constant
                    presence of this gentleman with you all the evening <hi rend="underline">till I
                        left</hi>, when he also left and came to town in the same <del hand="h1"
                        >vehicle</del> ambulance with me, has alarmed me more than I can express. If
                    he alone is responsible for this Constant watchful presence, I would not attach
                    so much im-<pb n="3"/>portance to it, for it is natural he should wish to be
                    with you, but if it was your request that he should be a third party during the
                    last few hours I could possibly be with you, then indeed I am about to awake to
                    a reality I have all the time dreaded - that I am too late - hopelessly too
                    late. I do earnestly - Oh! so earnestly hope all this, <hi rend="underline">as
                        far as you are concerned</hi> was accidental. Forgive me for writing you
                    this hasty note, and for God's sake answer it to 257 Broadway <pb n="4"/> New
                    York, by the first mail and relieve my anxieties if I am laboring under a
                    painful, but I think natural misapprehension. God bless you and make you always
                    happy.</p>
