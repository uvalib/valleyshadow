                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of inspection of the
                    sub-districts of <abbr expan="Brevet Colonel">Bvt. Col.</abbr> G.B. Carse, and
                        <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Geo. T. Cook. Sub-district of <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Carse being Rockbridge, Alleghany and Bath
                    Counties. Sub district <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Cook Augusta and
                    Highland Counties.</p>

                <p>I visited the <abbr expan="Headquarters">H<hi rend="super">d</hi>qrs</abbr> of
                    each Officer and found them competent and efficient in the discharge of their
                    various Bureau duties. Having practical knowledge of proper manner of keeping
                    military records their official books and papers are in commendable condition.</p>

                <p>Both officers report the general condition of the freedmen in their sub-districts
                    as good. Occasional outrages occur while many employers refuse payment for
                    services rendered, yet in the main the freedmen are doing well though as a rule
                    getting very low wages.</p>

                <p>Justice will be given in the superior Courts excepting in occasional jury trials
                    yet in all cases as a rule before magistrates no justice will be given. Assaults
                    on freedmen result <pb n="2"/>in the offender being bound over merely to keep
                    the peace in trifling sums by the magistrates and have not in any instance yet
                    been carried before the grand juries for action of the higher courts while
                    complaints for recovery of wages or compensation of labor are not entertained.
                    Yet while the freedmen commit crimes and go before superior courts he stands a
                    creditable show. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Carsy's Register of Marriages
                    is partially taken while care has been used to carry out remaining paragraphs of
                    circular No. 11.</p>

                <p>The County authorities have assured him that they will care for all destitute but
                    have no means for so doing. Apprehends much suffering this winter. Supply of
                    labor about equal to demand.</p>

                <p>No schools have been established outside of Lexington. The freedmen have a
                    general desire for them elsewhere. Has not had an opportunity of getting full
                    data from Alleghany and Bath Counties. The introduction of schools will meet
                    with much opposition and can only be <unclear>enacted</unclear> and supported
                    through Government aid. He doubts whether a house can be obtained for this
                    winters use in Lexington.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook's Register of Marriages has been
                    taken in Augusta County though differing from printed blanks since sent him and
                    necessitating therefore a new registry which as soon as complete he will take
                    that of Highland. He has endeavored to enforce other paragraphs of Circular No.
                    11.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>It is the intention of civil authorities to care for destitute having levied a
                    poll tax for that purpose but which will not be in operation before spring. He
                    apprehends also much suffering through the winter if government supplies are cut
                    off as anticipated by order.</p>

                <p>Supply of labor equal to demand.</p>

                <p>Schools are in successful operation in Staunton and will be during the winter.
                    None elsewhere in his sub-district though desired by the freedmen. They could be
                    established if places could be obtained in which to put them. The opposition of
                    the whites to the education of freedmen by yankees renders establishment of
                    schools outside large towns almost impossible.</p>
