<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to R. S.
                    Lacey, October 26, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook responds to Irwin's letter to General Schofield. He provides more details on
                    the case to which Irwin referred, stating that he believes these particular
                    charges to be just. Cook does, on the other hand, concede that blacks must tread
                    very lightly around whites, and the abuse of blacks by whites is unfortunately
                    frequent.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 26th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Captain:</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with your endorsement regarding a letter written by one Nelson
                    Irwin (Colored) I have the honor to submit the
                    following statement:</p>
<p class="p10">The men referred to were tried before a Magistrate of the County, the "Bureau"
                    being represented by Mr. F.S. Tukey, late clerk in this office. The prisoners
                    had for their Counsels Alex H. H. Stuart, Esquire - the evidence against them was mostly <i>[added: given by]</i> freedpeople, they were committed by
                    the Magistrate and their Counsel having waived an examination at the September
                    term of the County Court, they were remanded to Jail and now await the session
                    of Circuit Court in November next.</p>
<p class="p10">The fact of their guilt seems from the evidence <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to be quite evident. I
                    do not think they either will, or ought to be cleared if crime is to be
                    punished.</p>
<p class="p10">In answer to the assertion that there are many Colored men in Jail, I will state
                    that there is but one, besides the two named in this letter -- confined at
                    present and he is a perfectly worthless man.</p>
<p class="p10">As to the "reign of terror", although overdrawn, I think there is more foundation
                    for the assertion than there should be. A black man, to live peaceably must be
                    very careful the whites seem very jealous of them, and any show of impertinence
                    or independence, in so many instances leads to blows on the parts of the whites
                    - they say a Colored man must keep his place, and not be setting himself up as a
                    rival to the white, instances of blows and abuse are quite frequent -- the
                    Colored people generally submit quietly, as resistance, they are well aware, is
                    perfectly useless.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Geo. T. Cook<br>1st Lieutenant
                        Veterans Reserve Corps and Assistant Superintendent</i></p>
