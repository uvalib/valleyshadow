<h4>Augusta County: Franklin Davis to John H. McCue,
                    September 5, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Franklin Davis responds to John H. McCue's request for a "Nursery man." Davis
                    also asks McCue if he knows of a good foreman for his new place on the James
                    River.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your note of August 30<u>
                        <sup>th</sup>
                    </u> is before me &amp; as you request I will not send the trees ordered.</p>
<p class="p10">In regard to a Nursery man to work your grounds I may say that it would afford me
                    pleasure to recommend a competent man to you were any such within my knowledge,
                    that could be had I sometimes see persons advertising in our Horticultural
                    journals for situations but so many of them are not much <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>having, that
                    I should be very careful about employing unless I was personally acquainted with
                    them or they could produce <u>very
                    good</u> reference.</p>
<p class="p10">there is no doubt but a nursery on a small scale would pay well in your vicinity &amp; would probably be the best
                    desposition you could make or you could let it out to a competent person to work
                    for a share &amp; if I hear of anyone that I
                    think will suit you I will let you know. I am or will shortly be in want of a
                    Foreman as the one I have is going to attend to a place that I have purchased on
                    James River below <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Richmond we are going into fruit raising there on a
                    pretty large scale for the Northern Cities. I look upon it as the best paying
                    business that a man can embark in at present.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall be pleased to see you when you come to Staunton -- this fall.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Yours Respectfully
