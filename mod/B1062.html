<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Roswell Waldo to Orlando
                    Brown, November 30, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waldo reports no relevant cases for November, and states that he was therefore
                    unable to observe the attitudes and actions of local Magistrates.</p>

                    Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands,<br>Office 4th Division, 9th
                    Sub-District of Virginia.
                    General O Brown<br>Assistant Commissioner<br>Richmond

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">November 30 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">General:</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Par VI Circular No X - dated Head Quarters Assistant
                    Commmissioner Richmond Virginia March 12, 1866 - in
                    relation to the operation of the order restoring to the Civil Authorities
                    jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over Colored persons &amp;c I have the honor
                    to make the following report so far as said order pertains to this Division
                    (Highland and Augusta Counties).</p>
<p class="p10">My report under this head is necessarily brief this month from the fact that no
                    Criminal case has been tried by any tribunal during the month in which I had any
                    reason to believe injustice or partiality was shown to the colored party
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="p10">One case was referred from this office to a Magistrate for investigation which
                    resulted in binding <i>[added: over]</i> the accused (white)
                    to answer indictment <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>before the Grand Jury at March term of Court.</p>
<p class="p10">On account of the limited number of cases tried before Justices during the month,
                    no opportunity has been offered for observing any spirit of prejudice exhibited
                    on the part of these officers, therefore any opinion expressed in previous
                    reports under this head cannot be materially modified at this time.</p>
<p class="p10">No complaints have been made at this office by any party, arising from the
                    disobedience of the "Game Saw" referred to in Circular NO 24 CS. from your
                    office, nor have any instances in relation thereto come to my notice.</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully<br>Your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Roswell Waldo<br>Assistant Sub Assistant Commissioner</i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
