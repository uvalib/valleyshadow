<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, April 1, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and reports that he and Freddy are well. He is split
                    between closing up his business operation in Staunton and coming home, moving
                    his family to town, or continuing to live alone in Staunton. He explains that he
                    cannot take a loyalty oath to the Federal government as it would harm his
                    relationship with his friends. He also discusses the education of his children,
                    financial matters, and mutual friends.</p>

<p class="p10">April 1/65</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">As I have an opportunity I again write you hoping
                    it may reach you soon</p>
<p class="p10">I &amp; F are well &amp; still living here in the same way<i>[deleted: ll]</i></p>
<p class="p10">Times here are exceedingly dull nothing scarcely doing in any way I have for
                    sometime been on a stand to know what is best to do &amp; think seriously of
                    closing out &amp; returning home let the result be as it may I might not be
                    much interfered with in so doing. if I knew that fact it would take but a short
                    time to decide the matter</p>
<p class="p10">F is going to school &amp; learning fast Grammer, Geography, Latin grammer,
                    &amp;c &amp;c<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">I understand that the little girls are learning fast. this I am glad to hear
                    &amp; hope they may continue to do so. but don't let
                    them study too hard as their minds might be somewhat impaired in it</p>
<p class="p10">Keep yourselves supplied <i>[added: with]</i> what you may
                    need. don't stint yourselves on account of costs. in
                    using fund<sup>s</sup> hold back any <u>coin</u>
                    you may have until the last as it is the most valuable &amp; safest</p>
<p class="p10">I will soon determine what I will do &amp; I shall write you again soon In
                    the meantime can't you ascertain whether or not I could
                    return home to stay &amp; remain <u>without taking any
                        Oath</u> &amp; write me the result see A Bowman, A S Chambers
                    &amp;c &amp; ask them to ascertain</p>
<p class="p10">I would not consent to take any Oath now a part from my feelings<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> on
                    this subject it would in future be a barrier in my way with all present
                        friend<sup>s</sup></p>
<p class="p10">I sent a note to old W- did you deliver it, &amp; has he interfered any
                    farther with you <u>Answer</u> Have you the Tobacco safe yet
                    or was it interfered with if you need the fund<sup>s</sup> you can
                    sell Some for the purpose.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Moses <u>I have not</u> invested his fund<sup>s</sup> yet. There is no chance here for judicious investment in real
                    property but I have it so invested as not to loose it now &amp; will watch
                    it closely &amp; if have any good opportunity
                    will invest as he suggested James W the same I think northern fund<sup>s</sup> the best for them as they can use it there to advantage
                    I am still in the store with M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> H- and doing quite well<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> but rather be home. The money made here
                    takes so much to amount to anything. Prices are so high</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Mother &amp; all that I am well &amp; would be glad to hear more
                    often from them</p>
<p class="p10">F Still has his little pony &amp; enjoys himself in riding out often</p>
<p class="p10">I wish so much that I had you all with me &amp; am tempted often to ask you to move out but perhaps it is best for you to
                    remain where you are &amp; you are more comfortable than might be made here</p>
<p class="p10">Write me by return fully</p>
<p class="p10">God bless you all</p>
<p class="p10">good bye</p>
