<h4>Augusta County: Andrew R. Barber to Mary Anna
                    Sibert, August 30, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Barber writes to his cousin, thanking her for her recent letter and complaining
                    that no other family members have yet written to him. He describes the
                    unpleasant duty of reviewing applications for exemption from military service
                    because of injury and worries about the personal effects of long service, noting
                    that "My heart once so full of tender affection seems now to be drying up."</p>

<p class="p10">Thursday, August 30th 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Saltville, Washington County, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Cousin Mary, -</p>
<p class="p10">Your very kind &amp; excellent letter of 22 inst. was received yesterday. Allow me to return you my sincerest thanks for your
                    tender consideration of me. Though afar off from home
                    &amp; friends--among a cold-hearted, <u>bloodless</u> set
                    of strangers; your letter was the first line received
                    since I left you. Notwithstanding I have
                    been so prompt in writing my brothers, Sisters, Nieces
                    &amp; nephews &amp; friends, &amp; gave all my P.O. address before
                    leaving <i>[unclear: Easton.]</i> &amp; insisted upon their writing me,
                    &amp; in addition to this, have myself written nearly all my brothers &amp; Sisters &amp; Nieces,
                        <i>[unclear: East.]</i> yet not a line from one have I received since I left them. Then dear cousin let me
                    again thank you for your mindfulness of me.</p>
<p class="p10">Since I left you, I have been the "<u>grand rounds</u>"-- to
                    Lewisburg, Union, Giles Ct. House, Dublin, Newberne, Wytheville, Abingdon,
                    Saltville, Marion, <i>[unclear: Glade]</i> Springs &amp; then again back
                    here. At Each of the several places I was busily engaged @ several days, in the
                    execution of orders. I have done much labor &amp; feel quite broken down.
                    For last several days been here, examining <i>[unclear: Reviews]</i> for <u>Exemption</u> from service-- 'Tis no pleasant work-- to
                    see them coming with their walking sticks &amp; then to have to set (if one
                    would) &amp; listen<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to their <u>ten</u>
                    <u>thousand</u>
                    <u>"Ailments"</u> would worry one even of more patience than
                    your "cousin Andrew" But the work is well nigh over, &amp; soon again "I'll
                    be marching" to other &amp; as yet unknown fields
                    of labor. I yesterday received an order to hold myself
                    in readiness to take command of Rendezvous at Abingdon &amp; the Reserves of
                    West Va. When the <u>order</u> comes I am going to decline
                    it-- I am but <u>one man</u>, &amp; though having been disabled from active service in the field by Secretary of War, in consequence of wounds received in line
                    of duty, yet feel able &amp; willing to discharge the duties of one soldier
                    in C.S.A., but I am <u>tired</u> of <u>double</u>
                    <u>duty</u>, &amp; <u>mixed duty</u>
                    in Medical &amp; Military Department of our Army.
                    I want to perform duty in the Medical Department, or
                    am willing to return to the field &amp; take my command ss once I had it,
                    but I will not much longer, be a subject to obey orders in both branches of the
                    service.</p>
<p class="p10">I have made but very few acquaintances outside business transaction. I have met
                    with one or two pleasant Ladies-- spent one evening
                    in ladies' society since I left Lewisburg. Have heard
                    some fine music. At Wm Y.C. White's Abingdon. I care but little for making
                    acquaintances now. My heart once so full of tender affection seems now to be
                    drying up, or if refreshed at all, 'tis only by the memory of, &amp; sweet
                    dreams of happy byegones. I regret dear cousin that you seemed to labor before
                    getting a "<u>theme</u>" upon which to <u>write me.</u> Glad however, that when you <u>selected
                    it</u>, that you gave me such a fine essay on the subject that rules &amp;
                    governs</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse this letter-- I have written in great haste &amp; have frequently been
                    interrupted-- will do better next time. Here's a kiss, &amp; a loving
                    goodBye</p>
