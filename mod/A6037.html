<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">Having a good opportunity of sending a letter by Mr Kerr or Black I seat myself at this time
     to write you a few lines We are all quite well at present and hope you are also enjoying the
     same blessing. Mr Kerr starts this evening for camp <i>[deleted: at the]</i> on account of
     the earnest request of his son. I suppose he intends to take some provisions along. but we did
     not know of his going until this evening and so we did not have time
     to prepare anything to send you. if Grovy would have been willing, even to take it which I dont
     know for it appears to me as if they always act mighty sly about their going or sending
     anything. I have not time to write now for I guess they will be along shortly. I have no news
     to communicate. I hope you are enjoying yourself <u>hugely</u>. Pa has
     commenced cutting his grass this evening. The men over thirty five are getting home at least a
     great many of them. Andy Lucas has I believe got his discharge I wrote last friday and sent by
     mail to gordonsville I wish you would say if you please whether you get it or not. For people
     bring their letters here without directing them to any place &amp; I dislike the
     responsibility of sending. I have been sending to gordonsville the
     last few mails &amp; if they are not received I guess I will hear of it. Well the stage is
     coming and I must close</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate sister,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mary</i></p>
