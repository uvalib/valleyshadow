<p class="p10">February 2<sup>d</sup> 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Augusta Alum</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor of Jan 29<sup>th</sup> is received. The boy Jesse commenced work for me on the 8<sup>th</sup> of October last, having agreed to work by the
                        <u>month</u> from that date @ $8.00 per month; Sometime before his month was out he ran away
                    without giving me any notice or leaving me with anyone to supply his place thus
                    breaking his contract &amp; depriving himself of all claim on me. I was away
                    during the most of his stay here &amp; my clerk informs me that he was
                    utterly worthless &amp; did not earn his board</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.A. Hefelfinger</i></p>
