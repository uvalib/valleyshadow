<h4>Augusta: Jedediah Hotchkiss to J. Taylor Ellyson,
                    December 24, 1898<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Hotchkiss writes to thank his niece for gifts, mentions his health, tells her
                    that he is beginning work on his memoirs, and supports her decision to join the
                    United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    <i>[added: To]</i> Mrs. J. Taylor
                        Ellyson Richmond, Virginia
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 24, 1898</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia,</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Niece:</p>
<p class="p10">I owe you an apology for delaying to acknowledge the receipt of the
                        <i>[unclear: tracing]</i> of the Map of the Battle of Greenbrier River,
                    which came while I was especially busy. Please thank Nannie for her artistic
                    work in copying this map. I am also obliged about information concerning Boswelt's
                    notebook.</p>
<p class="p10">I take great pleasure in endorsing your application to become a "Daughter of the
                    Confederacy". Ann delighted that you have decided, at last, to do this.</p>
<p class="p10">Your xmas box came duly to hand, for which we all render many thanks, The only
                    thing yet seen in it is the fine "colored gentleman," Ellen caught sight of him,
                    as he was not concealed, and seized him <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> upon him with irrepressible delight. It has been a source of
                    much comfort to her during the past few days while she has been suffering with a
                    bad cold. Your aunt has been laid up with a bruised shin, but is now on the
                    mend. I had a gauty foot some two weeks ago, but soon got rid of that and am
                    getting along finely, gaining in flesh (now weight 170) and am improving
                    generally. Am working quite steadily on my Memoirs, getting materials into shape
                    &amp;c, so I may begin work on them with the new year.</p>
<p class="p10">I may run down, for a day or two, next week, for a change, and to pay you all a
                    short visit, as I do not expect any of you to visit us.</p>
<p class="p10">With a "Merry Christmas" and a "Happy New Year," and love to all the
                        kindred, I am, your loving uncle,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
