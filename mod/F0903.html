<p class="p10">Saturday, December the 17th, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp in Front of Petersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife,</p>
<p class="p10">It is with pleasure that I take the opportunity to answer your
                    kind letter that I got this morning and was glad to hear
                    that you are all well and there
                    was
                    one
                    dollar in it and some stamps
                    and I am well and getting
                    along
                    very
                    well and hope these
                    few lines
                    will find you all well. You needn't send me any more money
                        until I write for it for I
                        have
                    some of that I <i>[unclear: fetch]</i> a long. I have
                    three
                    dollars lent<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to some of the boys that I will get before long. I
                        put in for a furlough this
                    morning but I don't suppose that we will get them for awhile yet. I am going to
                        put a ring for miney and I
                        want you to let me know if you
                    get it and I am to make you one and about that saddle it is all right. I
                        want you give me All the
                        news. I want you to let me
                        know how the cow and sheep
                    is doing if the Cow has got a
                        calf yet and if Stribker
                    got that sheep at Dad's
                    or not. Hally I would like if you
                        would
                    raise the calf and you better
                    keep your chickens so nothing more at present but remain
                    true husband.</p>
