<p class="p10">August 19th 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall</p>

<p class="p10">As I have a few moments after helping cook our rations I hasten to drop you a few
                    lines knowing you will be anxious to hear from me. I
                    arrived safely in camp the 15th. found all the boys
                    well; They were all camped in line of battle at
                    Fishershill above Strausburg. We had a fine commanding position &amp; well
                    fortified: The enemy thought it prudent to make a retrograde
                    movement &amp; commenced retreating <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>&amp; had a slight engagement in the evening
                    near Winchester. Our Brigade never got close enough to fire at the Yanks; Some
                    of their leaden messengers came unpleasantly near us. The enemy was reported to have a large army from 40 to 50 thousand. We have
                    been reinforced by one Division of Longstreets corps &amp; two Brigade of
                    F.H. Lee cavalry. The enemy
                    destroyed nearly the entire wheat crop from
                    Winchester to Strausburg, burned many barns. We are now
                    lying in the woods near Bunkers hill, ten miles below Winchester have orders to
                    be ready to move at any moment none of us know
                    which way we will move next
                    some think in to Maryland I had a fine time coming down the valley; I've come down the back way; were
                    treated kindly at many places by the Dutch of Rockingham &amp; Shenandoah; all the objections I had to the girls
                    they were all barefooted &amp; as I thought awkward
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>in their manners; They would commence
                    talking Dutch in our presence, often I thought they might be talking about me. None that I
                    saw could I think half as much of as my -- I am sure. Do not censure me for not
                    writing sooner I fully intended writing the day after I
                    got to camp but was sent to the ordinance wagon &amp; coming back to camp I
                        stopped at a Battery
                    &amp; found my cousin R. Brand &amp; stayed nearly all day with him; he
                    is a nice young man; I think you would know him he is still redheaded &amp; freckles in his face. For a few
                    day after leaving I think I was a little low spirited probably you can account
                    for it I don't think it was leaving Lottie; though her
                    company was very agreeable. Since I have got with the boys I have been in fine
                    spirits &amp; have been enjoying the best <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>of health, I hope these lines may find you enjoying the same blessing Jake
                    is enjoying fine health. Abe &amp; Hunter the same Abe is now by my side
                    writing to his better half Be cheerful &amp;
                        happy &amp; pray that I may be spared to return
                    to thee once more Often I think I would not have nothing to live for if it was
                    not for thee; It is an evil thought but still it will
                    arise in my wandering thoughts I must soon close as it is getting so dark I can
                    hardly see how to write; My love to all Write soon, oh how glad I would be to
                    get a letter from you tomorrow excuse bad writing &amp; all mistakes I will
                    write again before long from one that has wished thee
                    happiness for years</p>
