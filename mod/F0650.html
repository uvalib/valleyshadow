<p class="p10">Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Springfield </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">As you know that <i>[illeg.]</i> I am sick and in the Hospital. I would suppose
                    that you are anxious to hear from me how I am getting and so on. Well I cannot
                    say that I am much better than I was when I wrote to you last although I believe I am a little better. I have still a pain in
                    the side of my head - somewhat like a neuralgia. I think it arises from a bad
                    tooth which must be extricated if it doesn't behave. I
                    had, also a pain on the breast but I had a blistering plaster, - a terrible hot
                    one, too it burned a little like
                    Greek fire - laid on my breast and that put a stop to that. I am not confined to
                    bed and when the weather permits I can run about through town. Emanuel
                        <i>[unclear: Carster]</i> is in the hospital, too.</p>
<p class="p10">I received a letter from Eveline the other day. Tell her I'll write as soon as I get a little better. She said she soon be at home
                    again. If my old red shirt is pretty good yet and you get a good chance suppose
                    you send it down Maybe Nathaniel will take a notion to come down and bring me a
                    Christmas gift. I wish he only could or poor us will have to do without a
                    Christmas again. I would not invite <i>[unclear: any]</i> women
                    <i>[unclear: down]</i> here because you could not get a place to stay over
                    night among so many secessionists.</p>
<p class="p10">I would like if somebody would see after that money that I sent with Joseph
                    Spangler ($60.00) and let me know as soon as possible if it arrived safely. If it is not at
                    <i>[unclear: Raineys]</i> or <i>[unclear: Pisels]</i> some one had better go
                    over to Spanglers and get it.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope to be able to go back to camp in a few days although my medicine keeps me
                    <i>[unclear: middling]</i> weak.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my well wishes to my dear parents, brothers and Sisters. Write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">I still remain your most affectionate<br>Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Hamer </i></p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you on the 19<sup>th</sup>
                        Mary Ann Hamer
