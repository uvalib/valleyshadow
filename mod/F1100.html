<h4>Franklin: John Smith to unknown, March 22 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Smith asks if his grandmother might send some money and mentions that he heard his
               family was well. He also mentions a recent cavalry raid, noting that he missed it
               because he was on guard duty. Finally, Smith sends his regards to Leah
               Brame--recently married--and he admits that he wishes she was still single (he finds
               solace in the fact that her sisters still may be).</p>
