<p class="p10">Camp Hamilton Crossing</p>

<p class="p10">i seat my to inform you that I am on the land amongst the live whilst many of my fellow soldier has fallen and gone never to return. my health is good and I thank my god for it and hoping that this may find you and all of our family, enjoying the same blessing and all of our friends and relations. I haven't heard from any of our relations since the battle.
     from what i can learn this battle has been one amongst of the hardest
      battles that has been fought yet. we moved
     back to our old camp last night and we feel
     like we was at home since we don't
     hear and see the bombshells falling in
     our ranks, although if i could be in old
     Augusta o how much better satisfied I would be
     where i could be with you and the children and hearthem pratel and i feel now like if i was at home a with you i could talk. well, i don't
     know how much more though than i can write now. i do pray that we all may soon get home.
     i do think that this ought to do for all men to quit fighting
     both north and south east or west and settle
     it up some other way. fighting never will settle it. we have been in line of battle for the last nine days and nights with orders to be
     ready at a moments warning for we did not know how soon the enemy would
     advance on our lines. we have or had been exposed to the enemies cannon all the time but there was only four killed and seven wounded out of our regiment and i thank god for
     his mercy and i pray that it may be his will not to cut any more down by balls and hope that he may see fit to stop this terrible
     war but o god thine will be done. our division was left here to hold the
     yanks at Fredericksburg which we did. 20 thousand crossed over along
     the banks the river but they didn't venture to our fortifications. we was too well fixed for
     them there. we had<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> some 4 or 5 thousand in all. the balance
     of the army marched some 12 miles above here
     where the main body of the yankees army
     was acrossing the river and there's
     where the greatest
     slaughter was. General Jackson lost his
     left arm in that fight. we regret the loss of our general very much but
     pray that god may be with him and protect in time of need but if god
     spares General Lee i think he will lead them yanks where they won't like to go. we have taken many prisoners from
     them and killed wounded many. their great General Hooker was wounded with the rest. i don't
     know what the loss is on either side but it is very heavy. that i know. i will write as soon as i can find out the particulars. it is thought that the yankees
     is a leaving from their old position on the other side of the river but
     they don't
     know
     where they are a going. i dont think they will try this place again
     soon. it don't pay. i talked with some of the wounded and they are 40
     thousand of them that their time is out may and they won't
     volunteer for no price nor they won't
     fight no more. home is their place. if all men
     would do that what a joyful time it would be. i hope it may come to
     pass soon as i won't have a chance to send for a day or 2.</p>
<p class="p10">i will wait until then before i close.</p>
