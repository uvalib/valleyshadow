                <p>I quite expected to find some letter here on my return; but can find none. I
                    infer you are all pretty well, and a little lazy.-- I left <abbr
                        expan="Harrisburg">Har<hi rend="super">g</hi>.</abbr> on Saturday Evening,
                    &amp; spent Sunday in Lancaster coming to <abbr expan="Philadelphia"
                    >Phila.</abbr> in this morning's early train Between Harrisburg &amp;
                    Lancaster, I had the company of Mr. &amp; Mrs. <abbr expan="Nathaniel"
                        >Nathl.</abbr>
                    <unclear>Ellmaker</unclear> who are returning from Bedford, Miss Sarah
                        <unclear>Mayer</unclear> from Lewistown, &amp; Miss
                    <unclear>Voorher</unclear> with her, &amp; the two Miss
                    <unclear>Muosers</unclear> who had been to the Teacher's Convention at
                    Chambersburg. One of these ladies was <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> bridesmaid at W. Runell's
                    wedding.-- We had a great deal to say, &amp; the time passed pleasantly.-- I
                    saw also in Harrisburg <abbr expan="William">Wm.</abbr>
                    <unclear>Herenton</unclear>.-- He came from <abbr expan="Bedford">Bedf.</abbr>
                    on Thursday evening, &amp; was on his way to Chambersburg-- I presume to see
                    after an importunate debtor.--He looks tolerably well, only. His wife is
                    suffering from a gathering in her heart.-- I forgot to ask him for his parents
                    health, or his child's, as breakfast was announced soon after we commenced
                    talking.-- Tell Lizzie Law that W. Hoff has been markedly attentive to Miss
                    Hale, that Miss Hale has received his attention with marked pleasure, &amp;
                    that Mrs. E. thinks they are engaged. W. Hoff talks as if they were, &amp;
                    everything indicated that fact.-- Tell her, to write a sympathizing letter to
                    Mr. <unclear>Horwitz</unclear> -- I was much amused at Mrs. E.'s earnestness of
                    manner, &amp; her <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> were certainly very strong.-- Very few of
                    our acquaintences re- <pb n="2"/>mained at Bedford. Miss Walker of Cincinnati
                    left on Sunday, summoned home by news of her Father's extreme illness.-- Mrs.
                    Budd was still there, &amp; very <unclear>gay</unclear>.-- A gentleman was
                    with her, whom Mrs. E. was told to consider as her beau.-- She had forgotten his
                    name.-- I saw Mr. Stevens yesterday afternoon.- He had returned on Friday <del
                        hand="h1"/> from Chambersburg.-- He joined his <unclear>case</unclear>
                    there.-- At <unclear>Hollisdayburg</unclear>, the other side took a
                        <unclear>non-suit</unclear>, <hi rend="underline">after</hi> the Jury had
                    come from their room and had agreed upon their verdict, but <hi rend="underline"
                        >before</hi> the verdict was given to the Court. The other side, by some
                    means, heard that the verdict was against them.-- Today, Court opens in
                    Lancaster. Bachman's suit is one of the cases for trial. Mr Stevens, being one
                    of his counsel.-- Bachman has lost a great deal of <unclear>flak</unclear>,
                    since his trouble began, &amp; he looked badly.-- Judge Vondersmith came to
                        <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Phila</abbr> in the same train with me,
                    acccompanied by his bail. I don't know whether he will soon be tried.</p>

                <p>Tell Lizzie that as I was going down Chest. Street this morning in an omnibus, I
                    saw <unclear>Wycke</unclear> to Miss <unclear>Ard</unclear>, who was walking
                    with a companion.-</p>

                <p>Simon Stevens told me he saw W. Mchaffey the early part of last week, in <abbr
                        expan="Philadelphia">Phila.</abbr> on his way to see his wife. I presume
                    from that, she has been ill; &amp; I feel quite anxious to know what
                    announcements have been made.-</p>

                <p>Tomorrow there is to be a meeting of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> politicians here, to raise
                    money for the campaign.-- Mr. <unclear>Judd</unclear> is in town, &amp;
                    insists upon definite action.- In this, he is backed <pb n="3"/> up by us all.--
                    We have announced a series of meetings for W. Wilmot, which will give him
                    something to do from next week to the election.-- The time fixed for <del
                        hand="h1"/> September 30--is a very suitable period--</p>

                <p>I write in haste.</p>
