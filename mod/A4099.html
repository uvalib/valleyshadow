<p class="p10">Tuesday Evening -- Oct 11<u>
        <sup>th</sup>
      </u> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">New Market Va.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>My Own</u> Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We are off again tomorrow &amp; I shall not be able to write to you for a day or two so I
     will write before I retire I wrote you a few days ago - yours of the 4<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u>
     Instant came a day after Mr. Robinson's 2<sup>
      <u>nd</u>
     </sup> "Sunday surprise" -- I wanted to surprise you the 3<sup>rd</sup> Sunday but
     "Old Jubal" said "no" so I had to moodily submit &amp; forgo a sweet day at home &amp;
     spend a cheerless one in camp but I trust such days will not last always &amp; that a kind
     Providence will permit us to spend many quiet &amp; happy years at home -- all the more <u>happy</u> because we have been compelled to spend so many away from each
     other &amp; have been taught to appreciate the more fully each the other's worth &amp; mutual benefit. I have just written to Allie &amp; hope to
     be able to send it in a few days -- I have told her plainly not to bring her sister with her,
     for she would not meet with a pleasant reception &amp;c &amp;c -- as I told you I would
     -- &amp; have advised her to come on by Winchester -- I wonder if Frank has had to go out
     under the last order calling out all "detailed men." -- Write me. It seems hard my Dear to call
     out the detailed men, but the next 6 weeks determine our fate &amp; every man <u>must</u> come out for that time &amp; do his duty -- if they do all will
     be well &amp; they can then go home in peace &amp; stay there with safety -- see what
     the reserves did at Saltville &amp; so they can do everywhere until this emergency is past
     -- <u>All</u> must put a shoulder to the wheel &amp; roll on to the end
     of <u>this</u> campaign &amp; I feel that the <u>end</u> will then come -- Our <u>men</u> in the field have lost none of
     their <u>accustomed courage</u>, their <u>leaders</u>
     none of their accustomed <u>skill</u>, but our ranks are depleted by the
     many bloody battles of this mighty campaign &amp; we must have our lines lengthened to
     oppose those of the insolent foe that has added thousands upon thousands to his from every
     household in the North -- The enemy is determined to do all that <u>numbers</u> can do this year &amp; we <u>must</u>, <u>
      <u>shall</u>
     </u>, &amp; <u>will</u> meet him with even numbers -- not even as figures tell it, but every as moral courage &amp; unconquerable will
     tell it -- So say for me, to all that they <u>must</u> cheerfully come <u>now</u>, and in two months <u>all</u> will be well -</p>
<p class="p10"> I have written to Maj. bell to attend to Jordan's case &amp; think it will be properly
     cared for -- there will be no getting off now I think -- hope so any how -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I have
     got Charlie here -- had my black horse stolen -- he is doing well -- I may sell him yet -- hope
     to get some more supplies for you and some things to trade on. I spoke to Reed to see about 20
     gallons of molasses when at the lowest -- you can see him -- I shall send William home to cut
     wood &amp; prepare for winter &amp; hope to be able to come &amp; attend to it
     myself -- </p>
<p class="p10"> Everything here wears a cheerful aspect, notwithstanding the reverse of last Sunday --
     Rosser drove the Yankees down to Fisher's Hill, killed &amp; captured a large number, got
     hundred of cattle &amp; sheep; wagons &amp; ambulances -- but there the Yankees massed
     all their cavalry -- on him -- 3 Divisions on two small ones &amp; charged him &amp;
     compelled him to retire rapidly &amp; his artillery horses were so <i>[unclear: jaded]</i>
     they could not pull his guns out on the rough road he was on &amp; the enemy captured them,
     but they got but few <u>men</u> &amp; he reformed &amp; drove them
     back again -- after they had forced Rosser back they massed on Lomax &amp; served him the
     same way and with the same result -- Our cavalry all of it that was there -- did its duty
     &amp; if the thousands that are improperly away had been their it would not have happened
     -- I trust we shall get an opportunity to retaliate -- Gen. Lee achieved a great success at
     Richmond on Friday &amp; Mosby played havoc with two trains the Yanks sent up the Manassas
     Gap Railroad They say Capt. Sam Chapman prayed over 50 of the Yanks
     that he sent to their long home in retaliation for some killing they did at Front Royal -- Sam
     is the 2<u>
      <sup>nd</sup>
     </u> in command with Mosby -- I am glad Nelly has resumed her studies &amp; I hope Anne
     has too -- they must be very diligent -- Mrs. Strager here gave me a good warm pair of gloves
     -- I suffered terribly from cold hands last Sunday -- It is very pleasant now -- Get all your
     flour &amp; eatables home as soon as you can -- get Mr. Reed to get a Bbl. of flour from
     Mr. Smith -- for you -- Pleasant dreams to you -- &amp; may Heavenly blessings descend upon
     the heads of all the "loved ones at home" -- Write soon -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
