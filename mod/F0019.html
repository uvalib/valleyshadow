<p class="p10">March 2<sup>nd</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp 16<sup>th</sup>
                            Pennsylvania Cavalry Near Falmouth Virginia
                        </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cynthia </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 21<sup>st</sup> has been received &amp; I am glad to
                    know that you are all well. Josey will take his medicine and get better I hope
                    so that he can welcome his Pa when he gets home. Pa will take Jimmy to rest Lucy
                    some day &amp; then take Bell upon his knee &amp; get them to sing to
                    him while Josey &amp; Lucy are playing. Well the horse that I have had for
                    some time is in the hands of the rebels &amp; I will tell you how it
                    happened. George McDavid &amp; a lot of others were going out about 6 miles
                    on picket duty. George had lent his horse &amp; it was out. So he borrowed
                    mine &amp; went out. Well on last Wednesday the rebels came in &amp;
                    took some of the outsides pickets prisoner &amp; then rushed in the rest.
                    The last account of George was that he, Newton Minton, a young Howell, Mattox
                    &amp; Will Chester &amp; some others that you are not acquainted with
                    were retreating behind the rebels when another party of the rebs came in at the
                    side between two of our men, a young Winget &amp; a man from Green County by the name of Boord who got shot in the
                    arm &amp; these two got away. The last they had seen of the rest George had
                    turned with his pistol to shoot those who were coming behind. They have not been
                    heard of since &amp; it is natural to suppose that they were taken prisoner.
                    The last account of James Roney was that he was retreating as fast as he could
                    with the rebs close behind when his horse stumbled &amp; threw James
                    &amp; he is a prisoner too I presume, as our men soon rallied &amp;
                    drove the rebs back found none killed on the ground for miles except a rebel
                    Private. The skirmish extended over a good deal of ground. &amp; there was
                    more fighting that I have not got a clear account of. The result of it was one
                    man in our regiment got shot through the chest &amp; died in a few days, two
                    men in Company K wounded in the arm, Boord &amp; a
                    Joseph Dunn &amp; one man wounded in Company I taken
                    prisoner the rebs got 47 of our men of our regiment &amp; most of their
                    hourses, while our men killed one rebel one the spot wounded a Lieutenant who
                    died the next day &amp; also wounded a rebel surgeon who died in a few days,
                    wounded one man in the leg who will probably die wounded one in the jaw who will
                    probably get well &amp; took a Captain prisoner so you see that although the
                    rebels were driven off they got more prisoners than we did. Well we are getting
                    along in the Hospital as usual the same routine every day putting up medicine
                    for the sick, looking into the cook house to see how they are getting along,
                    then go into the Hospital to see that the fires are kept up &amp; if
                    everything is in good order &amp; the sick get their medicine. I would like
                    to hear Joseys speech on the last day of school to see
                    him stand up &amp; speak right out &amp; when Lucy goes to Emma Bell in
                    the summer she can get a speech too &amp; say it on the last day of school.
                    I suppose Bell will be too young &amp; little to go to school in the summer
                    she can learn her ABCs at home I would like to hear them all reading. Can Jimmy
                    say his ABCs yet. Bell &amp; Lucy can teach them. Well Cynthia I don't know about getting home when it will be. Maybe I
                    will have a good chance to get off after awhile but until then I will be home
                    every night &amp; day in my dreams &amp; thoughts to hear my little ones
                    all say their prayers as they lay down in their beds &amp; to be with you in
                    your cares &amp; to share them with you &amp; to enjoy the pleasure of
                    your company &amp; endeavor daily to increase your happiness. Still carrying
                    you all to a throne of Grace </p>
<p class="p10">I still remain your most affectionate husband &amp; Father &amp;
                        brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. M. Potter </i></p>
<p class="p10">Sister Janey<br>You send me your love &amp; it is
                        still remembered. Kind sister may God bless you for your kindness. </p>
