<p class="p10">August 4th 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Mollie</p>
<p class="p10">Your dear and welcome letter of the 30<sup>th</sup> came safely to
                    hand and was read with pleasure. I do not blame you
                    for not coming to Staunton. I did not think you would come for I know it would
                    not suit you to pay Staunton a visit at this time I think I know your reason for not coming and if it
                    is what I think it is I don't blame you for not coming I
                    would rather you would not come although I would like
                    for you to come. I often think of the pleasant walks
                    we had last summer and the pleasant Evenings we spent
                        together they were
                    indeed happy <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> hours to me. I have often sat
                    alone and pictured to myself the pleasant walks we would have this summer in Staunton and the pleasant Evenings we would spend in Each other society
                    but alas that can not be unless your Pa moves to
                    Staunton which I hope he will do and then it would be much more pleasant to visit you at your own home. I know you are
                        anxious to come Staunton my love. I think it would
                    be best for you to postpone your visit until you move here which hope
                        won't be long. I am very sorry to inform you that it will be impossible
                    for me to pay you my regular visit next Saturday if I live I will be down
                    Saturday a week I am sorry to disappoint you my
                    love but Business prevents me from <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> going. Dr Arthur told me that he
                    was coming down with me Saturday a week I will let you know for certain in my next letter if he is coming. oh how much
                    I would like to See you this morning my love one who I love with unchanging
                    Devotion of heart &amp; soul and one who I love more than all others on this Earth</p>
<p class="p10">Ella was taken very sick on Yesterday She is much better this Morning. I hope
                    your Ma is Entirely recovered. My love to your Ma &amp; Pa love to all</p>
<p class="p10">I send a loving kiss to you and all the love of my heart my love is only for you
                    my love God Bless you Goodbye</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
