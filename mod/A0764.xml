                <p>In this letter to his wife Ellen, Ervine describes the route followed by his
                    regiment when marching in Virginia. He talks about civilians' kind treatment of
                    the soldiers and describes a battle in which a few Confederate soldiers held off
                    a large force while on a bridge. The letter also touches on the value of horses
                    in his company and on the friends he has seen while in the service.</p>

                </opener>

                <p>As we are not marching today I have another chance of writing, I shall write
                    again. I have not heard from home yet except by <orig reg="Andrew's"
                    >Andrews</orig> letter which was dated the 9th. I know you have written several
                    times but I have no chance of getting them. Yesterday was an exciting time with
                    us as the enemy was at our old camp (Camp <unclear>Clover</unclear>) &amp;
                    we expected a fight but they did not come, they retreated it is said to
                    Maryland. We were marched to Martinsburg early yesterday morning &amp; taken
                    in a corn field over a hill from the road &amp; was kept waiting for 7 or 8
                    hours dismounted with our guns in hand ready to mount at the
                    <unclear>word</unclear> &amp; two companies sent out to meet the northern
                    men &amp; get them to advance on us but they had not the spunk. There is now
                    8 cavalry company in this regiment all well mounted on the very best of horses
                    &amp; about 16 or 18 thousand infantry within a few miles at a little town
                    called Bunker Hill. Since I wrote to you at Winchester we have been marching all
                    the time. I will try &amp; give you the routes.</p>

                <p>About 1/2 hour after I finished my last letter to you we left that place to cover
                    the retreat of some troops from <orig reg="Shepherdstown">Sheperdstown</orig>.
                    Then to Charlestown to cover the retreat of the troops from Harpers Ferry. We
                    got to Charlestown early in the morning &amp; stayed there for several
                    hours, while we were there the road near filled with soldiers from the ferry as
                    full as you ever seen a road filled with stock cattle. I do not know how many
                    thousand this I can say the road near full for about 12 or 15 miles one regiment
                    after another as close as they could march for the baggage wagons. After they
                    got past we left &amp; marched about 30 miles taking a back road to a point
                    back of Martinsburg about 2 miles where we had to sleep on the ground with out
                    our tents so as not to be easily seen. Now we are about 3 miles from <abbr
                        expan="Martinsburg">Mburg</abbr> on the Winchester road. There was three
                    companies left here this morning to go down to see after the enemy &amp;
                    join Whites that was out in that part as a scout. I expect there will be a
                    skirmish today if they can find the boys. News come to camp several times today
                    that they had been plundering houses stealing negroes &amp; stock of all
                    kinds. Several family have moved by here today &amp; a great many persons
                    passing in vehicles of all kinds fleeing from the fiends.</p>

                <p>I heard that the <abbr expan="Rockingham">R-ham</abbr> Regiment had gone to
                    Romney but do not know it to be certain. I told <abbr expan="Captain"
                    >Capt</abbr> Yancey today if there was any more men detached from his company
                    for express riders I wished to be one as my chance for getting letters would be
                    better as I would go as often to Winchester as any other point. We are treated
                    with all the kindness that any one could wish by citizens. Everyone has water
                    and provisions ready for soldiers which is either sent to camp or handed out as
                    we pass. I have no idea which way we will go from here no more than you do
                    &amp; cant tell until we get out on the road which way we will go so secret
                    are the moves kept. I have been quite well since I left home &amp; did not
                    find it so hard to sleep on the ground as some did. I suppose the rest of the
                    family think I ought to write to them but I can't get the time to do so
                    &amp; they must not complain for I will not write to anyone unless I can
                    write to you oftener than I have done. I don't want you to imagine so many
                    things about me as you have done especially that I will be hurt in a fight for I
                    do not have any fears of being hurt if we do get in a fight. I have not thought
                    that anyone would be hurt after hearing from those fights where two men at
                    Romney <unclear>could</unclear> keep back several hundred. It is a bad show for
                    hard fighting with abolitionists is said &amp; believe to be true that 2 men
                    in a bridge there with several negroes to <orig reg="hold">hold</orig> for them
                    made several hundred retreat.</p>

                <p>We had our horses valued today &amp; at big figures as well as I can guess
                    the average must have been at $175. My horse was valued at $175 and saddle
                    &amp; bridle at 18. It is said by everyone that we have the best lot of
                    horses in the regiment. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Stuart said about 40 of
                    our men are the best mounted men he ever seen as good the <unclear><del
                            hand="h1"/> star</unclear> company is <unclear>here</unclear> the one
                    other said who had such fine horses. There was some 20 of our horses went to
                    &amp; over $190. The highest was 225, only one as low as a hundred.</p>

                <p>I wish you could see us getting meals. You used to think that we was dirty but if
                    you was to see the beef strewn about on the ground &amp; men cooking off it
                    you would think we did not care for dirt. Our fare is nought nothing but beef or
                    bacon &amp; wheat bread. The bread is baked. Coffee we have to toast
                    &amp; grind ourselves. We have had sugar all the time until a few days ago
                    the supply gave out.</p>

                <p>Tell grandmother I will write to her soon &amp; will try to give her all the
                    news in camp. Tell Maggie &amp; May for me the dear little things Pappa will
                    come back some day &amp; bring them candy &amp; will tell them so many
                    pretty story about little girls giving Pappa bread &amp; butter &amp;
                    pies. Tell Father I want him to get me some goods for pants as my pants is
                    getting somewhat worn and will not last me very long. Line the legs below with
                    something strong as they soon cut through with the stirrups
                    <unclear>tethers</unclear> &amp; send me ten dollars by someone for I may
                    want more money if I should get a chance to go home. I can't go on horseback as
                    they will not let a horse go out of camp unless on duty. Though I will not come
                    back without <unclear>Percey</unclear> unless he is killed or shot or I lose him
                    some other way. You must not try to send any provisions to me for I can't get
                    it. There is a number of boxes there now for our company in Winchester. When you
                    go home to your Ma's I want you to take Ginnie with you &amp; ride her as
                    much as you wish to do &amp; take good care of the colt. Tell me if Henry
                    Applegate will stay in our house until I get back &amp; when you expect to
                    leave &amp; how everything looks. </p>

                <p>All the ladies or most of them are leaving. I seen Miss Sue Pitman last Friday.
                    She said she would leave for Shenandoah the next day also said she was going to
                    write to Mary H. in a few days. She come to the gate &amp; cheered the
                    soldiers as they passed &amp; gave some of them water while two or three
                    servants did the same &amp; Mrs. Arch Pitman.</p>

                <p>I want you to give every soldier you see something to eat as I should hate to
                    have it said that you refused a soldier food when I have been fed by everyone
                    almost. I will stop. Tell Sister I will write to her soon. I want to hear from
                    Howard &amp; Sam when you write again. I will perhaps get some of your
                    letters tomorrow as Dr. <unclear>M<del rend="none" hand="h1"/></unclear> will send his
                    servant to Winchester for the mail for our company. If I should fail to get one
                    I will be badly disappointed worse than I ever have been before. I will now
                    close this. Give my love to all of the folks at Fathers. Tell Father if I don't
                    write to him not to think I don't want to do so as our chance for writing is bad
                    and mailing worse. I want you to kiss the children once a day for me until I get
                    home. Then I will get to take the job off your hands. Good bye,</p>
