                    <i>[unclear: rapidan]</i> river and that day the Battle commenced and was kept
                    up until the 13th when we left the front with <i>[unclear: about]</i> eight
                    thousand prisoners and took them Back to this place
                    This is the greatest lot of rebs I ever saw There was eight<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> days hard fighting while I was in the front but I had good luck this time I was <u>not</u> in the fight this time I am in the dismounted
                    Battalion we have no horses and were kept as rear guard
                    this was the hardest fighting I ever heard and the loss
                    is great on both sides but I heard that there loss is
                    greater than ours we are now encamped near Bell Plain landing where our boats are landing with our provisions further I let you know that <i>[unclear: Jarrmiah
                        Drudenbroth]</i> is wounded<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> in the leg he is now in the
                        hospital I also let you know that I saw Brother
                    John the day before we left camp at
                    <i>[unclear: perry]</i> Mountain I didn't hear anything of him since I <u>must</u> soon close for this time write soon I don't know how long we will
                    stay here but I think not very long the weather is warm and we have rain almost
                        every day I will also send you five dollars of
                    Confederate money that I got from rebel prisoner
