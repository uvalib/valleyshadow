<p class="p10">August
       <sup>the</sup> 20<sup>th</sup> A.D. 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Wells</p>
<p class="p10">My Friend Harry
     </p>
<p class="p10">As I have just now<br> got off of duty I thought that it was<br> my duty to inform you of
     some of<br> the proceedings. Friend we left 
      Harrisburg
     
     <i>[unclear: [illeg.]]</i>of day<br> at 10 O'clock A.M, and
     arrived at<br>
     Baltimore at 6 O'Clock in the evening where we were treated with<br> much respect by the
     citizens<br> The whole Regiment got their<br> supper at the Soldiers religious
     association; a place kept up by the<br> citizens of
      Baltimore for the benefit of the
     soldiers. Our supper<br> consisted of bread boiled ham<br> cheese, and plenty of first rate
     coffee,<br> but spreads we had none. And we<br> left 
      Baltimore
      at 9 O'Clock that night<br> and arrived at Washington City at<br> 1 O'Clock the next
     morning A.M.<br>
     
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitMar1b.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitMar1b.gif"></center></a><br><br> where we retired for the night<br> we all slept in the soldier's<br> retreat, a building put up for to<br> rest soldiers in
     the morning we<br> got our breakfast which was bread and<br> a hunk of meat and chocklet<br>
     with grease swimming on it a half<br> an inch thick. I had a great
     notion<br> to grease my shoes with it. We spent<br> a Tuesday
     forenoon in running<br> around through the City and about<br> 10 O'Clock we were marched to<br> where we now are. We are encamped about <i>[deleted: in the]</i> 7 miles<br> south west from Washington. We<br> were marched from the City to 
      Camp Wells
      7 miles with only 2 rests<br> of about 10 minutes each with<br> our knapsacks on our
     backs<br> and our guns and our haversacks<br> all together weighing about 50 lbs<br> and we were doublequicked part of<br> the
      way.<br>

<p class="p10">Last night was the first<br> night that I slept on the sacred soil of old Virginia and I<br> never slept better in my
     life.<br> Last night there was one of our<br>
     guards was out in the hand last night<br> as
     he was walking the beat there <i>[unclear: 
      <sup>at</sup>
     ]</i><br> was a man jumped out of the<br> bushes out of the bushes and cut<br> the
      guard across the hand pretty<br> bad I do not know whether<br> it
     was a rebel or not. 
      Henry
     <br> When you get married I want<br> you to send me word for I want<br> to be the
     second best or first I don't<br> care which. I heard that you were
     to<br> be married I like it first rate but<br> it is not the living that we get<br> at home.
     I will get along first<br> rate <i>[deleted: tw]</i>until winter
     commences when<br> singing and spelling are going<br> on then I will wish for home.<br>
     
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="../papers/images/BitMar1d.jpg"><center><img src="../papers/images/BitMar1d.gif"></center></a><br><br> I now must close for the present<br> for we must drill 9 hours
      tomorrow. Write
     <i>[deleted: sou]</i> soon and give<br> me <i>[added: all]</i>the
      <i>[deleted: all]</i> news of old 
      Southampton.
     <br> Give my love to all the Ladies of<br> old Franklin. Nothing more<br> at present.<br>
