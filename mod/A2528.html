     Sara A. Hotchkiss
    </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Tuesday April 14<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp at Rude's Near New Market Va ---</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours telling me that the children are better, for
     which I am truly thankful, and am sorry that I cannot be at home to relieve you of the severe
     burden of care that rests upon you and that I am fearful will make you sick too -- be careful
     &amp; get some one to relieve you as much as possible. I feel sorry for poor John Harman, he has lost two children and told me this morning that he
     expected two more to die today --when will the pestilence of Scarlet Fever cease from our
     county. I have just been reading the Spectator, it has a good deal of interesting news in it.
     We caged and ironed today the leader of the militia rebellion in Rockingham he is a tigrous looking fellow: also a Dutchman of a
      New York Regiment was brought in -- he had on him quite a
     number of letters, one from his wife, all in German, in which she berated him soundly for not
     writing to her, but got over her wrath before she ended &amp; wrote to him like a loving
      Frau - - she had come on to Alexandria to see him -- he had several
     letters from others in which they all spoke of being <u>infinitely</u> tired
     of the war and desirous of getting out of it. O! by the way Sam. Hernsberger, the tall young
     man from McGaheysville that went to school, is here in a Cavalry Co -- he was in Western Va.
     last summer with Wise and he has just told me that Brodt was in the army a member of a Kanawha Co, and furthermore that he was at Roanoke island and was
     probably taken a prisoner there -- good for old B-- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> that he proved true at last --</p>
<p class="p10"> It rains here all the time -- I hope you have a better spell of weather. We are kept in
     doors most of the time of late by it. I am very much pleased with Gen. Jackson and his staff --
     he is at times very chatty, but usually has but little to say -- Sunday he went out through one
     of the Brigades with a bundle of tracts and distributed them -- he stays by himself most of the
     time -- eats very sparingly -- does not drink tea or coffee and hardly eats any meat The Adjutant Gen -- Lieut. AS Pendleton, son of the Rev. Col. Pendleton of
     Rockbridge -- (the famous Manassas Artillery Capt.) is a young man of about 22 -- light haired
     -- has taught in Lexington, graduated at Wm Coll, &amp; was at the University of Virginia when the war broke out -- he is talented,
      an admirable talker &amp; man of fine sense &amp; acquirements
     -- he is the one spoken of in the Spectator as carrying off wounded men -- he says he did many
     things he does not remember, at Kernstown, but he knows he did not carry any body off the
     field, and Berkely, the Surgeon of the Regiment was not there Dr.
     McGuire says, so it is hard to tell who the surgeon was. Dr. McGuire the Medical Director is
     also a young man of fine talents -- is not more than 26 &amp; has been a Professor at Philadelphia &amp; also in New Orleans in a Medical College he
     is a son of Dr. McGuire of Winchester you have often heard of him.
     The Dr. is one of Bro. George sort of men, blunt good humor &amp; full of honest life. Lt.
     Col. Baylor is a good fellow -- first rate, good natured and accommodating -- he will, no
     doubt, be elected Col. of the 5<sup>th</sup>
     Regiment -- we shall miss him much, Lieut. Boswell, the chief of the
      Engineer Corps, is an excellent good natured honest Presbyterian of
      Alabama formerly of Fauquier County -- is
     well off -- has a sweet heart in Fauquier where the Yankees are and he talks much about her --
     he is my bed fellow -- is one of your good fellows that everybody likes and of course I like
     him too -- <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Lieut. Douglas is from Maryland and has lately been on the staff -- was
     a lieut. in a Company -- he is quite young but has been practicing law in St. Louis -- is one of your wide awake smart young men -- I like him
     too. Lieut Meade is from Clarke County he was <i>[unclear: a
     private]</i> at Manassas and lost his right arm -- he has had a Lieutenancy given him
     because of that -- and is a good negative sort of man, kindly disposed and willing to do all he
     can -- then there are two clerks detailed from the Washington Coll. Co. Logan and Laird -- they
     are good fellows too -- Sergt. Brown is engaged with the Engineer
     Corps -- he is Co. <i>[unclear: Surrey]</i> or of Jefferson, &amp; is an excellent
     surveyor, a big stout fellow -- accommodating &amp; pleasant, but a mass of facts -- a
     painfully matter of fact man, at times, painfully exact, but I really like him nevertheless --
     then add a half dozen darkies of all shades and natures -- &amp; put in your <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
     husband -- Mr. Lipkiss as one of the Dutch girls here calls me, Mrs. Rude says, that can't say Hotchkiss, and you have the General's
     staff described after a fashion. </p>
<p class="p10"> I will describe mine host if we stay here much longer. I have nothing of interest to write
     -- the enemy still at the same place, being reinforced we hear -- what a set of cowards they
     must be to want any more troops to oppose our small army. The militia have all been drafted
     into Volunteer Regiments, officers &amp; all. I have the same place I had last year with
     Gen. L. and am Topographical Engineer on Gen. Jackson's Staff -- I may get a commission as the Engineer Corps is to be increased -- I shall get the same pay I did before I suppose. We
     get the papers here every day &amp; the news often comes here from over the Ridge by
     express. I wish I could come in and see you all -- the little darlings -- kiss them for pa --
     Tell Allen to have a good garden well worked and everything done like a good boy that I hope he
     is. My love to all our relations &amp; friends -- read them my letter <u>or</u> send it up -- for I have not much time to write. Write often. God bless you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I send you the Dutchman's wife's letter to him</p>
