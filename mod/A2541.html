<p class="p10">June 10<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Lewis' -- Near Brown's Gap</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">We fought the enemy on Sunday and whipped them off the battle field killing many, that was
     half way between Harrisonburg &amp; Port Republic, then yesterday we came this side of the
     river, burned the bridge &amp; then fell on Shield's advance, 3 miles below Port Republic
     and smashed 2 Brigades all to pieces, capturing 6 pieces of artillery and pursued them 12
     miles, capturing some 800 prisoners, and we are now moved up into Brown's Gap, out of their
     reach having only our front to guard, and now I suppose the Gen will commence some more
     strategy, which may result in driving the enemy back out of the Valley -- we have been
     wonderfully preserved, our loss has been small, and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> we have inflicted some severe
     blows on the enemy, Providence seems to have favored us in all our movements, and we have come
     out of the very jaws of destruction several times, as it were -- The Yanks actually came into
     Port Republic while we were there, but our troops bravely drove them back and kept them from
     destroying the bridge --</p>
<p class="p10"> We did not get much sleep last night and I feel awfully stupid, so I will close this, but
     write soon -- I am very well, hope you are all getting along well -- May God bless you all -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband</p>
