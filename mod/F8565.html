                    Honorable
                        Edward McPherson
                </b></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 16<sup>th</sup> 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">In accordance with your polite and kind offer, I take the liberty to enclose to
                    you, <u>two</u> affidavits to sustain the claim of Mrs Mary
                    Duncan for Bounty <i>[unclear: Laid]</i> for services of her deceased husband,
                    Adam S. <i>[unclear: S.]</i> Duncan in <i>[unclear: War]</i> of '12. Hitherto
                    we had made no further progress in the prosecution of the claim <i>[added: (so far as proof of the services
                    went)]</i> than the filing of the affidavit of <u>John McFinney</u> which was rejected by
                    the Department
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> on the ground that the witness was a deserter and therefore
                    disqualified from testifying. We had <i>[illeg.]</i> witnesses on hand,
                    (Shiller) but how to render <i>[unclear: McFinney's]</i> affidavit competent or
                    find another witness has been the difficulty-- This we conceive is now entirely
                    removed by the affidavits enclosed. There is on file full proof of the marriage,
                    widowhood, identity of the applicant &amp;, and the death of the soldier,
                    and with the testimony which we have now been so fortunate as to obtain, we
                    cannot imagine any defect, irregularity or insufficiency to exist--</p>
<p class="p10">The number of the application is <u>280383</u>. The delay has been unavoidable, here as the proof could not be
                    sooner obtained.</p>
<p class="p10">Please have the enclosed affidavits presented to the <i>[illeg.]</i> of <i>[deleted: ]</i> and yourself informed of his action.</p>
<p class="p10">I found myself in such indifferent health, that I concluded I had better be at
                    home and left Washington on Wednesday evening. My
                    business with the foresaid was in a very unsatisfactory condition.</p>
<p class="p10">I beg leave to repeat my most sincere thanks for your very kind and <i>[deleted: ]</i> ongoing attention and highly valued good offices to <i>[deleted: ]</i> and myself when in Washington</p>
<p class="p10">My father is much obliged for the Directory and P. O. book you so kindly and at
                    no little trouble obtained for him.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>William Mc Allen</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Has anything been done by Congress, conferring
                        authority -- on the Secretary of the Interior to
                        issue <u>Duplicates of lost land Warrants</u>, or is the
                            Department still refusing to issue them? Your
                        answer will again much oblige me, hoping that you will not put yourself to
                        much trouble about the latter inquiry<br><u>Wm</u>Mc
                    A</p>
