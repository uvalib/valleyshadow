<p class="p10">March 17th, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Mt. Jackson</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Rate,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter some time since + would have answered sooner, but times have been too
     stiring for a while to spend much time writing letters. </p>
<p class="p10">We left Winchester on the 11<sup>th</sup>, of this month + fell back to
     Strausburg; we stayed there a few days, + we are now about to middle way between Edinburg + Mt.
     Jackson. Our encampment is a very pretty one, in a beautiful pine grove, on the bank of the
     Shenandoah River. The surrounding country is exceedingly beautiful rivalling any in natural
     charm that I have ever seen.</p>
<p class="p10">I felt sad when we left Winchester. although it is a very corrupt place in my estimation
     still there are a great many there who are true and loyal to the South +
     it was hard to leave them to the mercies of those who have no hearts to feel even for
     themselves or others. Some were laughing + some crying as we came through town + there were
     many sad partings too - Two companies in our regiment were
     principally made up in Winchester, + these were forced to part with those near and dear to
     them.</p>
<p class="p10">They were compelled to have mothers + sisters <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>+ wives, + little ones, who were all
     they had on Earth to love, + leave them too, without a hope of seeing them again + no prospect
     of hearing from them. I had to cry myself when I came through Strausburg. The doors + pavements
     were filled with ladies old + young + even the little children were weeping <u>forced</u> to do so by the tears of their Mothers + Sisters. Such scenes are
     romantic, but I envy them not their feelings, when they feel themselves cut off from their friends + left to the tender mercies of those <u>black
      hearted traitors</u>, who are strangers to mercy. <i>[unclear: ]</i> there is a time of retribution
     coming a time when we can relieve the broken hearted + lift them from the dust into which they
     have been trampled by the unhallowed foot of the oppressor.</p>
<p class="p10">Our last stopping place was between Woodstock + Edinburg; we stayed there one night. It was
     the most romantic place I ever saw. Right on the edge of a high cliff on the side of the
     Shenandoah River. The cliff is on one side of the turnpike + the railroad on the other side
     crosses a deep chasm on trussel work 130 feet high. I will send you some Spruce Pine that I got
     there. I must write some to your Ma.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.R.M.</i></p>
