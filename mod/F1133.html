<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham
               Rosenbery (father), April 14, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery writes about sending some pay home. He goes on to touch upon the weather,
               the possibility of his release from military duty, his hope that the war will end in
               the coming summer, and the possibility of his own death in battle.</p>

<p class="p10">April 14, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father---</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself to inform you that I am well at present...hoping that a few lines may
               finds you all enjoying the same blessings of health.</p>
<p class="p10">I was paid off today. I only received 2 months pay of which I will express you 20
               dollars. You will get in the express office in Chambersburg. The reason that I
               express it. I only have one bill to send and I may as well loose one dollar as to run
               the risk of loosing all of it.</p>
<p class="p10">I will write this in a hurry as I must get out on a 3 day picket. I would have sent
               the money in a letter but I know that you do not get all my letters that I write to
               you.</p>
<p class="p10">We have warm weather here. Rain nearly every other days. I
               have not heard from Brothers Abraham and Ashway for some time. But I hope they are well. The 9 month affair
               looks somewhat gloomy.</p>
<p class="p10">But sill I am in pretty good hope that is-if they intend to do us justice. I have
               been satisfied all the while that time will reveal all things.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I think that this summer will close this cruel war.</p>
<p class="p10">I have written you a letter a few days ago. I hope that you have received it.</p>
<p class="p10">The summer campaign will soon commence. Out settler and all
               are ordered out. So hereafter it will be hard to get letter paper and stamps. I have
               some paper yet but my stamps are all.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, about the money, you can get it. It will be here for you. When you get it let me
               know and what it cost. If Rachel needs any money you may give
               her some. Tell her I will write to her as soon as I get in from Picket...that is if I
               live. I wrote her a letter a few days ago.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon. Give me all the news that you can as I like to hear from home.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall now close.<br> So farewell for the present.<br> I will soon write.</p>
<p class="p10">Again your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
