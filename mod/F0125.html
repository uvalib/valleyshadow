<p class="p10">Brickersville, Pa</p>
<p class="p10">Peter &amp; Cyrus,</p>
<p class="p10">Once more I take pleasure in writing to you to inform you that I am at Present in good health
     and am a free Citizen and sincerely wish you could be the same. I am at home about a week now
     and am working as good as ever I have been binding Oats and hauling home the same and more I am
     raking one of the furnace fields for the half. There was a beer party at Moses Letters last
     Saturday but I was not there. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I have seen both your parents and spoke to them and
      Peter's father got a letter a few days ago I think if you go to work
     and make application for your discharge you may be able to get it, go to work thus tell the
     Colonel or whoever is in command of you and tell him that according
     to an order issued all troops whose times of service expire before the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 1866 are to be discharge and your time is up on the 16<sup>th</sup> of Oct 1865, and I actually believe that you will be discharged.</p>
<p class="p10">
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I have not much or any news. everything appears very dull a good many or most all
     the boys that have been gone are back except those one year new which are still at Staunton
      V<sup>a</sup> and don't know how soon they will be mustered
     out I have been to see some of my old duck and they do it as good as they ever did, there are
     any amount of young gals here at present. Tomorrow there will be a wedding M<sup>r</sup> Eckert is going to marry Harriet Matthews. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> There will be a party in
     Brickersville tonight and a picnic at Jesse
     <i>[unclear: Runabeckers]</i> on Saturday we have plenty of ways to spend the five cents we
     brought home I think I shall go to Illinois again before very long I wish that you could come
     back before I go I do very much wish to see you both I wish you all the luck and hope you can
     soon return home, I am well and hope you are the same,</p>
<p class="p10">I am as ever your Friend</p>
