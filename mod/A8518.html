                    Saw you in Staunton about the note I endorsed for you
                    which there was Suit brought on when you was here you
                    assured me that I would not be troubled
                    about it now there is an
                    Execution in the case &amp; which I will have to Suffer now if you had not
                        misled me I would have
                    had the case put off until I could have had a chance to meet it but now my
                    property has to go to pay it I want to know from you what
                    I am to depend on as I had confidence in you when I
                        endorsed your note &amp; as you told me all
                    along that I would not have no trouble about it don't fail to let me hear
                    from you about this matter</p>
