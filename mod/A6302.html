<p class="p10">My dear Mollie</p>
<p class="p10">Ella &amp; myself
                    arrived home safely without
                    any accident we got home at half past Eight O'Clock
                    much sooner than I Expected Magnus was waiting
                    patiently for us he said he
                    had given us out we did not stay long in Bridgewater Rennie &amp; David were
                    very glad to see us &amp; wanted us to stay all night they were both well I don't think Rennie is
                    looking as well as she <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> when she was at home a few weeks ago. Ella
                    &amp; myself had a great deal of fun on the road she will give you
                    a full description of our trip. I know she will
                    make you all laugh. David Sibert wanted to trade his Cow for Macon you ought to
                    have seen Ella look at him when he proposed to
                    trade. David will never forget the look as long as he lives but afterwards he
                    complimented Macon very highly. he did not mean what he said to Ella but was <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> only teasing her. I thought of you all
                    the way home &amp; after I got home too this last Visit just seems like a Dream to me for we did not see much of Each
                    other it won't be the case next time I come for I will
                    come by myself then I will not be hurried away from you my love I still love you with true Devotion
                    of my heart I love you more &amp; more every day of
                    my life &amp; never cease to love you as long as God permits me to live. I
                    have not felt very <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> well since my return home I have had a very
                    severe headache but better this morning. Ella
                    &amp; family are all well give my love to your Ma &amp; Pa tell your Pa
                    I wrote to him by today's Mail love to all the
                    Children. I send love &amp; a loving Kiss to you I love you with all my
                    heart God Bless you good bye</p>
