<p class="p10">July 28, 1864.</p>
<p class="p10">Headquarters 5th Cavalry
       Brigade<br> Haynesville near Williamson</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I do now know the precise day of the month but 'tis either 27th or 8. This is the second day
     we have been resting here. Tonight we move. Three Brigade of
     Cavalry start upon what is to be, if successful, the Raid of the War. Maryland, Pennsylvania and O., and also Northern West Virginia, will see us ere we again draw rein. That is
     unless some unexpected circumstance should prevent. We part with our wagons here and perhaps
     may meet them next in Greenbrier of Monroe. What the main army will do I cannot say. I leave Spence and Gran with all my baggage with the wagons. Spence has Brown
     Maud. She is too fine to be killed upon such a trip. (The one) I ride on very little account,
     belonging to Spence- captured. Shall swap her off if possible.</p>
<p class="p10">I have left in Spence's care the following list of articles.</p>
<p class="p10">7-1/4 yards
     cashmere
     Black<br>9 yards white flannel<br>5 pairs
     kid gloves, 2 cotton do.<br>5 boxes hair pins (gum) 2 papers pins.<br>4 sets spoons, 8 or 10
     spools thread.<br>8 pairs ladies shoes, two pair mens Do.<br>2 Bottles Clge.water, two Do. pomade<br>8 or 12 linen Handkerchiefs3 silk do.<br>1 pair flannel and one pair cotton
     drawers<br>One cotton one linen and 1 calico shirt<br>Several linen collars</p>
<p class="p10">
     <u>Yanks are upon us!</u>
    </p>
<p class="p10">False alarm, but we are moving northward. Good bye my own darling girl.
     May heaven guard thee! Am off on a long, long perilous expedition, but fear not. Thou art a
     soldier's wife. Comfort my mother. Kiss her and Mollie for me. My love to Pa, your Pa and
     Eliza.</p>
<p class="p10">I send many warm embraces, and my earnest love is always thine.</p>
<p class="p10">Your true husband,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Achilles.</i></p>
