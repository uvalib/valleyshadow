<p class="p10">Sunday March 18/66</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">Notwithstanding your entire silence since I left home I propose
                    <i>[unclear: to]</i> write you again.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been setting in my room this entire day desolate &amp; alone except a
                    doctor came in &amp; remained with me an hour or so I am ever
                        <i>[unclear: afflicted]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> my eye <i>[unclear: something]</i> better but by no means well
                    I have been blistering my temple today which is quite severe. In the <i>[unclear: ]</i>
                    here alone I assure you I have the <i>[unclear: ]</i> if there be such <i>[unclear: ]</i>. I am
                    anxiously waiting to hear from you to <i>[unclear: know]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: from]</i> M<sup>r</sup> P if it is best for me to
                    remain here until my <i>[unclear: cures]</i> are passed over or for me to
                        <i>[unclear: return]</i> at once. If not particularly to my advantage to
                    thus remain away I will return at once <u>even in this
                        condition</u>. I wrote you on Friday last <i>[added: also before that]</i> &amp; am anxious to know how all things are
                    going and to my surprise you have not written me since I left (<u>You must have another spell on you</u>)</p>
<p class="p10">If anything important is going on a Telegram will reach me here in few hours
                    &amp; an answer return</p>
<p class="p10">M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Riddle can give you all information as to his &amp; my affairs I wrote
                        M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> P. &amp; expect to hear from him tuesday In my last I stated fully
                    what G Kilmer had better do as to<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> moving farming &amp;c
                    &amp;c If George has not plowed any on your land
                    yet, under all the circumstances he may let it alone &amp; not plow it
                    unless he thinks he will have full time to plow that &amp; the land where he
                    moves. As he moves late I fear he may not be able to put it all in, &amp;
                    the both fields can be put in wheat in the <i>[unclear: fall]</i> &amp;
                    will pay better but if at it let him go on if he can accomplish it all in time</p>
<p class="p10">Now I am anxious to know all these things if you intend to write me &amp;
                    give me such information as you can do so And <i>[added: if]</i> you don't intend writing just drop me a note
                    saying so &amp; then I will not look for any, and not be disappointed. As
                    this course is to bad for any one to pursue</p>
<p class="p10">My love to all</p>
<p class="p10">yours ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS Since writing the above I have concluded to go to
                        Lexington tomorrow to be there at the selling of the Lexington Hotel Tuesday
                        If there is any bargain in it I may purchase it to move there. It is the
                        best stand in the state good schools &amp; every thing nice. &amp;
                        if don't like it there can return to West Virginia again<br> I expect to sell my interest in
                        Staunton before leaving for home view this favorably ever- John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch</p>
