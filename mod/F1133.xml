            </opener>

            <p>I seat myself to inform you that I am well at present...hoping that a few lines may
               finds you all enjoying the same blessings of health.</p>
            <p>I was paid off today. I only received 2 months pay of which I will express you 20
               dollars. You will get in the express office in Chambersburg. The reason that I
               express it. I only have one bill to send and I may as well loose one dollar as to run
               the risk of loosing all of it.</p>
            <p>I will write this in a hurry as I must get out on a 3 day picket. I would have sent
               the money in a letter but I know that you do not get all my letters that I write to
               you.</p>
            <p>We have warm weather here. Rain <orig reg="nearly">nealy</orig> every other days. I
               have not heard from Brothers <abbr expan="Abraham">A.</abbr> and Ashway for <orig
                  reg="some time">sometime</orig>. But I hope they are well. The 9 month affair
               looks somewhat gloomy.</p>
            <p>But sill I am in pretty good hope that is-if they intend to do us justice. I have
               been satisfied all the while that time will reveal all things.</p>
            <p>Well, I think that this summer will close this cruel war.</p>
            <p>I have written you a letter a few days ago. I hope that you have received it.</p>
            <p>The summer campaign will soon commence. Out <orig reg="settler">setler</orig> and all
               are ordered out. So hereafter it will be hard to get letter paper and stamps. I have
               some paper yet but my stamps are all.</p>
            <p>Now, about the money, you can get it. It will be here for you. When you get it let me
               know and <orig reg="what">whit</orig> it cost. If Rachel needs any money you may give
               her some. Tell her I will write to her as soon as I get in from Picket...that is if I
               live. I wrote her a letter a few days ago.</p>
            <p>Write soon. Give me all the news that you can as I like to hear from home.</p>
            <p>I shall now close.<lb/> So farewell for the present.<lb/> I will soon write.</p>

            <closer>
               <salute>Again your son,</salute>
