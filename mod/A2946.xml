                    days ago which found me quite well &amp; truly glad to hear from you
                    &amp; to hear that <del hand="h1">you with</del> your Fathers family were
                    well but I am very sorry to hear of your unpleasant feelings from the tone of
                    your letter you appear to be in a measure greatly troubled. <orig reg="Your"
                        >your</orig> language was such as would lead one to believe that you feel
                    like one forsaken, like one enshrouded with the dark <orig reg="shadows"
                        >shaddows</orig> of gloom wending this way as it were in some isolated
                    region amid trials &amp; troubles unspeakable with no one to cheer you.
                        <orig reg="No">no</orig> sound of a merry or well known voice to <orig
                        reg="break">brake</orig> the stillness of the midnight hour. <orig reg="No"
                        >no</orig> strong arm to shield thy fragile form in the hour of <orig
                        reg="apparent">apparant</orig> danger. <orig reg="No">no</orig> fond eye to
                    meet the steady gaze as <add hand="h1" place="inline">you</add> look to the dark
                    &amp; untried future. <orig reg="Dearest">dearest</orig> Kate, would that I
                    was capable to day of speaking to you with lanugage that would cheer your
                    drooping spirits, to <del hand="h1">clear</del> remove the dark cloud from <orig
                        reg="over">oer</orig> your way &amp; brighten your path with the
                    briliant sunshine of joy &amp; consolation, but as it is using one of your
                    expressions "You must take the will for the deed." I am exceedingly anxious to
                    have the full <pb n="2"/>causes of your troubles not that I could feel that I
                    would be able to soothe <add hand="h1" place="inline">you</add> in the least but
                    I would be very glad to know all that in any way gives trouble or displeasure to
                    my dear &amp; ever faithful friend Kate. If the secret of your discomfort is
                    not too profound I will be much gratified to know all about it, with a promise
                    never to divulge it to any one. <orig reg="Well">well</orig> for a change of the
                    subject I will give you a little of the news of the day. <orig reg="It"
                    >it</orig> is generally believed that our Government is about to send
                    commissioners to confer with the Federal authorities preparatory to coming to
                    some terms of peace. <orig reg="May">may</orig> the blessed Lord grant that they
                    may be able to come to some honorable terms of peace.</p>

                <p>The weather is extermely cold. <orig reg="We">we</orig> have a perfect ill
                    harvest just at this time. <orig reg="Well">well</orig> dear Kate you will have
                    to excuse my short letter. <orig reg="Please">please</orig>
                    <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> think I am getting careless about writing, for I
                    assure you that nothing gives me more pleasure than to write &amp; receive a
                    letter from you for you are the only constant &amp; <orig reg="faithful"
                        >faithfull</orig> correspondent I have. I hope when I hear from you again
                    that your letter may be teeming with good news, &amp; that you my dear
                    darling sister Kate may be your self again with my tender regards to the loved
                    ones at your home with much love for you dear Kate</p>
