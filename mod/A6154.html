     Houser received a wound in the recent Battle which has Called him home to rest, &amp; I
     truly hope although he gave no satisfactory evidence of his rest or assurance in Christ that he may Be numbered with the blessed.,
     His only request was to see his Pa but he died &amp; was buried
     Before his Pa arrived at the hospital he died in the hospital as Charlottesville &amp; was buried there He had every attention he required his suffer<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>ings were severe but did not last long. His Physician &amp; Minister told his Father He was

     Bachelors I don't
     know how we will do when they are all I think I will marry for riches
     &amp; marry an old Bachelor I believe I would sooner marry a young
