                <p>I seat myself this <orig reg="evening">evning</orig> to write you a few lines to
                    let you know that I am in the land of the living. I have not heard from you for
                    so long, that I do not know <orig reg="whether">wheather</orig> I writing to the

                    heard from him since the fight at Manassas I dread to hear from him. I have
                    heard of a good many from Augusta being killed but we have a hope if he is
                    killed that he will be prepared to meet death. I thought he had changed a great
                    deal. <orig reg="He">he</orig>
                    <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> here a week after he was wounded at port. I
                    thought he went back too soon before he was able for duty. Abe was <orig
                        reg="wounded">wonded</orig> at the Richmond fight by a <orig reg="Minie"
                        >minne</orig> ball in the side an inch more would have killed him he has got
                    well, he is staying in Staunton now but expects to start to the army next week
                    he came home yesterday <orig reg="evening">evning</orig> he had a statement of
                    the killed and wounded but it did not mention any thing about Daniel, but that
                    dont console me, for I know <orig reg="several">sevral</orig> who have been sent
                    home that were killed that was not mentioned on the paper <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Cap</abbr> Patrick was buried yesterday <pb n="2"/>but I suppose you will
                    see an account in the paper, it is a dreadful state of affairs many a poor soul
                        <orig reg="buried">burried</orig> in to <orig reg="eternity">eterny</orig>
                    unprepared. John hired a substitute papa would like to put one in for Daniel I
                    am afraid he <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> papa was <orig reg="here">hear</orig>
                    the other day he was anxious to hear from Daniel george is a big boy and can
                    talk any thing, I want you to send me a name for my little boy he looks like
                    george. he is 7 months old he can walk around a chair. it is late, I must
                    retire, good night.</p>
