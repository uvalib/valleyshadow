                <p>Nadenbousch writes his wife, alarmed by reports that necessity has compelled her

                    the family to Staunton. He instructs her on making arrangements and mentions
                    items he needs. He also reports on the management of the hotel and discusses his
                    pending resignation from service.</p>

                <p>Things here high &amp; scarce but we get plenty to do us</p>

                <p>Cousin Mary Might make some arrangements to take our house &amp; to keep
