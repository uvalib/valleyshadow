                <p>Alexander H. H. Stuart responds to the recent letter of Henry A. Wise (February
                    2, 1869), who requested that Stuart confirm the report of a speech recently
                    given by Stuart in Staunton (see the Valley Virginian, January 28, 1869). Stuart
                    supported the "New Movement" seeking to accept black suffrage in order to
                    restore peace in Virginia. His comments appeared to be critical of Governor
                    Wise. Also see Wise's response (February 8, 1869).</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Your letter of 3<hi rend="super">rd</hi> inst was received last night &amp; I
                    hasten to answer it.</p>

                <p>After quoting some passages from a publication in the Valley Virginian, of what
                    purports to be the substance of a speech made by me to the people of Augusta on
                    the 28<hi rend="super">th</hi> ult. you ask whether the report is in substance
                    correct or whether it is approved or sanctioned by me -</p>

                <p>The speech to which you refer was altogether extemporaneous, without the aid of
                    any note or memorandum &amp; therefore I cannot pretend to recall the
                    language used by me on that occasion - I presume, however, that the general
                    outline of the speech is correctly given, but the report is too meagre &amp;
                    imperfect to furnish an accurate presentation of what I said -</p>

                <p>Presuming that the purpose of your letter is to ascertain what I said in relation
                    to your own comments in regard to the movement, which was the subject of
                    discussion, I proceed to state it as nearly as <pb n="2"/>I can, in the language
                    which I used</p>

                <p>After adverting to the opposition which has made to the movement, &amp; the
                    criticism which has been indulged in, in regard to the course pursued by the
                    gentlemen connected with it, I referred to the opposite quarters from which more
                    criticism came - I stated that while we were in Washington we found ourselves
                    between two fires, one in front &amp; the other in the rear, &amp; that
                    these fires proceeded from parties holding the most antagonistic opinions,
                    &amp; having the most diverse objects in view - one party desiring the
                    adoption of the Underwood Constitution, whilst the other was unalterably opposed
                    to it - Thus while Gov Wells and his committee were assailing our proposition in
                    Washington, Gov Wise &amp; others, were attacking it at home - Thus extremes
                    seemed to meet, &amp; the singular spectacle was presented, of Gov Wells
                    &amp; Gov Wise, who probably held no other opinion in common, pulling
                    together as it were in the same team, in opposition to our scheme I also
                    referred to the fact that the Richmond Enquirer &amp; radical Journal,
                    which, on all other questions, were the antipodes of each other, were <pb n="3"
                    />yet in accord, in opposing our measure; &amp; that George Rye, Yankee
                    Allen, &amp; D<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bayne, found coadjutors even in
                    Augusta! -</p>

                <p>After commenting on this singular union of discordant elements, &amp; the
                    co-operation of persons who were looking to opposite ends, I said that such
                    alliances of men of antagonistic opinions - of carpet-baggers, &amp; fire
                    eaters, would be productive of no good, unless they tended to satisfy the people
                    that our scheme was the true one - I also referred to the fact, that Gov Wise
                    had written five letters, in opposition to the movement, but <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">I said</add> that I had seen but one of them, &amp; added
                    that I thought the history of the last eight years would prove, that Gov Wise
                    was not a safe <orig reg="counselor">councillor</orig> in public affairs -</p>

                <p>This I believe to be the substance, &amp; as far as I can recall it, the
                    language of that part of my speech which referred to you or your opposition to
                    the plan of the committee, with which I was connected.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Respectfully yours &amp;c</salute>
