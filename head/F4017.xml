                </opener>

                <p>I wrote you last <unclear>evening</unclear> that I had arranged for my Lumber. A
                    friend who is an old dealer, has kindly consented to supply me at cost, and I
                    will save much trouble &amp; some money by the arrangement.</p>

                <p><orig reg="I">i</orig> fully agree with you about the wisdom of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    Bains very high. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> was 22 1/2, &amp; the new one will be the
                    same. I would have made it 24, but for the fact that it will, <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    at 22 1/2, be rather too prominent for the House.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I am going to rebuild my house this summer also &amp; it is a fearful
                    undertaking. I am sorely perplected about it &amp; the more I study the more
                    I get confused as to what kind of House I shall build. Mrs <abbr expan="McClure"
                        >McC</abbr> &amp; I have agreed that the roof shall be on the top
                    &amp; the cellar under the House, but that is about as far as we have got.</p>

                <p>My grounds are such that I have but a certain amount of room each way, without
                    interfering with some tree or something else, so that I must locate it about as
                    the old one was &amp; cannot widen <pb n="3"/>out either way. I mean to
                    follow the general plan of yours which is something after the old one, <del
                        hand="h1"/> Library, Drawingroom, kitchen &amp; on one side &amp;
                    parlor on the other.</p>

                <p>I will go down to Philadelphia next week, if I can then meet <unclear>Jr
                    Rice</unclear> &amp; will stay there until I worry out a plan, &amp;
                    then I will dismiss the subject &amp; put the contractor at work.</p>

                <p>It is a jolly time to build. Home &amp; <unclear>Bain</unclear> will cost me
                    all of $20,000 &amp; then finishing is to follow.</p>

                <p>I think the war is ended, &amp; the Order is safe. In that there is no army
                    in <unclear>Vgnia</unclear> for <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to <pb n="4"/>fall back upon,
                    they will soon be compelled to abandon their occupation, as the will be hunted
                    &amp; shot down wherever caught.</p>

                <p>There will be <unclear>restagnation</unclear> in <unclear>answer</unclear> this
                    year. Gold will higher. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to 1866 than now, &amp; I doubt a
                    letter at <unclear>will</unclear> at any time in the next three years touch so
                    long a <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> as it did on Monday last.</p>

                <p>Our debt is now <unclear>$4,000,000,000</unclear>. It is all very well as long as
                    the <unclear>gvnmnt</unclear> delivers $4,000,000 per day: but when that stops,
                    the <unclear>severe</unclear> ordeal for government credit will be at <del
                        hand="h1"/></p>
