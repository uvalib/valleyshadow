                <p>Franklin (Samuel Franklin Carson) writes to someone, almost certainly Annie
                    Harris, describing life in camp. He explains that his unit recently retreated
                    across a river to Shepards Town and describes Yankee attempts to cross the
                    river.</p>

                    <unclear>us</unclear> so that we may get more room in camp. After the battle of
                    Sharpsburg of which I last spoke we fell back to Shepards Town on this side of
                    the river. The Yankees following us closely, we had scarcely got out train
                    across <orig reg="until">untill</orig> they <unclear>opened</unclear> from the
                    opposite side. They made a bold attempt to cross but this they could not do -
                    however that night they succeeded in crossing part of their forces at another
                    ford <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> attacked our forces left to guard the ford we had crossed
                    but they were driven into the river killing &amp; wounding some say several
                        <pb n="2"/>thousand - some <unclear>too</unclear> were taken prisoners some
                    of whom had been "paroled" a short time <unclear>before</unclear> - these are
                    the kind of men we are fighting - but I guess they won't fight us soon again.
                    Well I must close for the present hoping to hear from you soon.</p>
