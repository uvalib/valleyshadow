     <salute>Sir:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I have your letter The fact that Mr. <unclear>Pulz</unclear>
     <hi rend="underline">says</hi>
     <add hand="h1" place="inline">he</add> has no one to drive his impressed team but his son who
     has volunteered (or is at least subject to Military duty) is an excuse often made to get rid of
     the <hi rend="underline">military </hi><hi rend="underline">duty</hi> -- the Government will
     hire or impress a careful driver.</p>

    <p>Judge Thompson has refused a half dozen writs of Habeus Corpus during the last few days
     mostly from your county to cause the surrender of volunteers between the ages of 18 &amp;
     21_-- under 18 he grants the writ &amp; requires the surrender. Mr. Moore gives the
      <unclear>issue</unclear> interpretation of the Law but the Judge says that he has given the
     matter due consideration &amp; read all the reported cases carefully &amp; decides as I
     have stated -- an infant over 18 is compelled to perform military duty - &amp; being called
     into service he goes into a volunteer company as a choice over the militia.</p>

    <p>I must further say that if your<pb n="2"/>Countys quota is reduced and I apprehend it will be
     and the loss is not made up I am directed to again call the militia out - I hope you will so
     arrange it as to prevent the disagreeable necessity of such a step.</p>

    <p>I am surprised to learn from many of the applicants from your county that they were induced
     or seduced to join by improper and undue means; of this I know nothing and do not credit it,
     but it is bringing a change against your commands which ought to be <hi rend="underline"
      >desired</hi>, at least.</p>

    <p>Under the circumstances I cannot let off young <unclear>Pulz</unclear> to drive his fathers
     team - or from his volunteer company unless another <hi rend="underline">acceptable</hi>
     volunteer is furnished in his place.</p>

    <p>If the team is not sent I will be compelled to send a <unclear>force</unclear> for it which
     Mr. <unclear>Pulz</unclear> should not permit as there is a penalty attached to the offence.</p>

    <p>My instructions are <unclear>positive</unclear> to see that your quota is full. <add
      hand="h1" place="inline">The place of</add> every one exempted before they are marched away
     must be followed up or the militia must go <hi rend="underline">enmasse</hi>
     <pb n="3"/> is the order of the Governor -</p>
