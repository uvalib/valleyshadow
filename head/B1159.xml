                <p>I did not receive the communication relating to outrages until Thursday <abbr

                    simply dismissed it as an impossible thing to do. Generally, the air is full of
                    outrages on the Freedmen by the Whites, and will be until just laws are made and
                    executed, but I understand you to mean <hi rend="underline">violence</hi>, <hi
                        rend="underline">personal assaults</hi>, <hi rend="underline">cruelty</hi>,
                    of which very few cases have come to my knowledge, and then the facts were not
                    clearly established, because the freedmen dare not testify through fear of yet
                    greater violence. Sam Crawford, black, 60 <abbr expan="years">yrs</abbr>, living
                    with Andy Crawford near Mt. Solon, <abbr expan="Augusta County">Aug. Co.</abbr>,
                    says that in May 1865 Pat McCarly, white, living with A. Crawford, struck him

                    />while at work in the barn, he shows a large scar. Jane Walker, black, 20 <abbr

                        <abbr expan="Augusta County">Aug. Co.</abbr> who beat her with his fists,
                    and kicked her, and that his mother threatened to beat her with a shovel because
                    she said she wanted to visit a place instead of "Lucy" and that "Lucy might stay

                    McCoomby has threatened to shoot her if she went away and came back. Jacob
                    McCord, one of the town police of Winchester on finding some freedchildren
                    making a noise in front of his house threw a stone which struck Emily

                    >th</hi> 1865 there were several cases of supposed outrages but investigation
                    disclosed the facts that all the parties were more or less intoxicated through
                    the free use of Whiskey, and a sober witness could not be found to establish the
                    guilt of any of the parties implicated.</p>
