Dear <name>Ma</name>,</salute>
</opener>
<p>
After waiting and <lb/>
looking, a long time, for a letter <lb/>
from home, <name>Mary's</name> reached us a <lb/>
day or two ago, and gladly was it <lb/>
received and read, telling us all the <lb/>
news and that you were getting so <lb/>
much better.<ref n="2" target="n2">[2]</ref>
  I hope you will be <lb/>
careful of yourself, and still continue <lb/>
to improve until you are entirely <lb/>
well.  <name>Mary</name> said <name>Father</name> and <lb/>
<name>Uncle John</name> were
<hi rend="underline">talking</hi> of coming <lb/>
to see us.  I am very much <lb/>
afraid they will take it out in talk. <lb/>
However, I hope not, but will look <lb/>
for them before long.

  If they
<orig reg="don't">dont</orig> <lb/>
come, I hope <name>Emmett</name> will, as he <lb/>
spoke of doing.  I expect though <lb/>
he will not be so anxious to come <lb/>


<pb n="2" entity="Bro1k214" pid="uva-lib:502893"/>

here, as to <name type="place">Manassas</name>.
I wish he <lb/>
could have gotten there, to see <lb/>
the whole Army and its chief dignitaries. <lb/>
There is only one brigade here and <lb/>
a few militia, so there is not much <lb/>
to be seen, except a rich and very <lb/>
beautiful country.  The brigade <lb/>
(except our regiment) has moved <sic> has <lb/>
moved</sic> about five miles below <lb/>
<name type="place">Winchester</name>.  We go
<orig reg="tomorrow">to-morrow</orig>.
<ref n="3" target="n3">[3]</ref> <lb/>
There is, not yet, a sufficient number <lb/>
of wagons to move all the regiments <lb/>
in  one day. We <orig reg="haven't">havent</orig> been able to <lb/>
find out any thing of the policy or <lb/>
intentions of
<name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr>
Jackson</name>. Nor <lb/>
can we get any reliable information <lb/>
of the enemy.  One day we hear, there <lb/>
is a large force at <name type="place">Romney</name> and the <lb/>
next, that they have left
and are <orig reg="concentrating">concen-<lb/>
trating</orig> near <name type="place">Williamsport</name>:
that <name type="person">Loring</name> <lb/>
and <name type="person">Henry R Jackson</name> will attack them <lb/>
in the rear, and we in front: but <lb/>

<pb n="3" entity="Bro1k215" pid="uva-lib:502894"/>

still we see nothing indicating a <lb/>
movement of any kind. <ref n="4" target="n4">[4]</ref></p>
<p><name>General Jackson</name> sent
<name>Major Preston</name> (of the <lb/>
Institute) his Adjutant General, to
<name><abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Lovings</name> <lb/>
Headquarters, last week, but I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
 know for <lb/>
what purpose.<ref n="5" target="n5">[5]</ref>  He left the ground covered <lb/>
with snow. That army is having a very hard <lb/>
time, and will suffer this winter, if not <lb/>
carefully provided for.  We have had very <lb/>
high winds and cold weather lately. <lb/>
We burn a great deal of wood, build large <lb/>
fires at the doors of the tents, and manage <lb/>
to keep tolerably comfortable. <ref n="6" target="n6">[6]</ref> </p>
<p>If you <orig reg="can, send">can send</orig> us a comfort, a good wide <lb/>
one to cover us both.  Send the boots the <lb/>
first chance.  I'm most barefooted. </p>
<p>How did <unclear>Tobbin</unclear> ever have sense or <lb/>
courage enough to ask that girl <lb/>
to have him, or walk out on the floor? <lb/>
Nobody need ever despair of marrying <lb/>
after that; the most despondent and <lb/>
most often rejected can take courage.

<pb n="4" entity="Bro1k216" pid="uva-lib:502895"/>

</p><p>We expect to be paid off soon for July <lb/>
and August and probably for September <lb/>
and October too.  If we get all it will be <lb/>
quite a pile, about $70.  The Government <lb/>
is too negligent about paying up.  Most <lb/>
of the Company are out of money.  <lb/>
Send us the cost of all our clothing, that <lb/>
of each piece.  An order has been issued <lb/>
to send for all absentees, who are <lb/>
able to come into service.  </p>

<p>Will <name type="person">Uncle Andy</name> continue his <lb/>
business in <name type="place">Alleghany</name>? <lb/>
Much love to him <name type="person">Aunt Sallie</name> <lb/>
and <name type="person">Aunt Betsy</name> and all the rest. <lb/>
Has he found a name for his boy <lb/>
yet?  <name type="person">Mr. Reed</name> sends his love to <lb/>
<name type="person">Aunt Betsy</name>.<ref n="7" target="n7">[7]</ref>
  Why did
<name type="person">Dr. Walker</name> <lb/>
resign?<ref n="8" target="n8">[8]</ref>
  Is he tired of the service? <lb/>
If you all <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> write oftener, I <lb/>
think I can charge you all with <lb/>
carelessness as you have done us. </p>
<p><add hand="h1" place="right">I hope the Yankees <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> give
us a chance to fight them this winter.
If they dont make any more raids into Virginia I think there
is a chance of going into Winter Quarters, otherwise not very soon.

<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> Andrew Brooks failed
to include the month in which he wrote this letter.  However,
contextual clues, such as Andrew's discussion of the movement
of the troops and the day of the week, lead us
to conclude that the letter was written in November of 1861.
</p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p> "Mary" is Andrew's sister, Mary Susan Brooks.
Apparently their mother Eleanor Stuart Brooks was ill during 1861;
see also Andrew Brooks's letter of May 28, 1861, where he asks
if "she has improved."
</p></note>

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> In mid to late November of 1861, the Stonewall Brigade
proceeded from Manassas to Winchester in order to join
Jackson in defending the Shenandoah Valley.
Although the Fourth Virginia lagged behind the rest of the brigade,
perhaps because they were waiting for wagons to carry supplies,
they soon
set up camp at Camp Stephenson, which was four and a half
miles outside of Winchester
(Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 52).
</p></note>

<note n="4" id="n4" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[4]</seg><p>
Romney, West Virginia, located on the east side
of the South Branch of the Potomac River
thirty-five miles northwest of Winchester, was
"the eastern key to western Virginia," while
Williamsport, Maryland was an important
point at which to cross the Potomac (Robertson,
<hi rend="italic"> The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 58).  As Andrew
anticipated, the Stonewall Brigade would soon be called on
to aid in bringing the western part of Virginia into
Confederate control.
At the end of 1861, five thousand Union troops under
the command of General B. F. Kelley were garrisoned at Romney.
In January of 1862, Jackson easily captured
Romney, since it had been deserted by Union forces
(Bean 81-89; Robertson, <hi rend="italic"> The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 59-63).
In projecting future fighting, Andrew mentions that he expects the
participation of troops
commanded by
General William W. Loring, who
in 1861 led the Army of Northwestern Virginia,
and General Henry Roots Jackson
(http://home.earthlink.net/~atomic_rom/loring.htm).
</p></note>


<note n="5" id="n5" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[5]</seg><p>
On November 4, 1861, Jackson, who had been promoted
to major-general, departed from his
First Brigade as he proceeded to Winchester to assume
 command of
the Shenandoah Valley (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 166;
Turner, 113). Realizing that
the Valley needed a stronger defense, Jackson
sent Lieutenant Colonel J. T. L. Preston, who had
been a professor at Virginia Military Institute,
to Richmond to ask for reinforcements.
The War Department assigned the First Brigade to
defend the Valley along with
General
William W. Loring's troops, so
that
Jackson was separated from the First Brigade for only a
short time (Bean, 70; Robertson,
<hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 49-50).
General Loring's three brigades did not arrive
in Winchester until late December of 1861, so Brooks
is probably referring to some communication
between Jackson and Loring regarding the planned reinforcment
(Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 57)
</p></note>

<note n="6" id="n6" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[6]</seg><p> As Andrew reports, weather conditions
were miserable when the troops arrived in Winchester.
The soldiers shivered as they faced
 frigid winds and sleet (Robertson,
<hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 52).

</p></note>

<note n="7" id="n7" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[7]</seg><p> Uncle Andy, or Andrew Stuart, is the
the brother of Andrew Brooks' mother Eleanor Tate
Stuart Brooks (see also Andrew Brooks' letter of January 23, 1861,
where Andrew asks about his uncle's recent marriage to
the former Sarah McClure).
Aunt Betsy is probably Betsy Brooks, who is listed
in the 1860 Census of Augusta County as being twenty-nine years
old and as living with Silas and Apatia Brooks, not far from James Brooks' farm.
</p></note>

<note n="8" id="n8" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[8]</seg><p> Dr. Walker is probably George W. Walker,
who is listed as a physician in the 1860 census of
Augusta County.
