    <p>We are again on the Banks of the Potomac -- we drove the Yanks down to Harpers Ferry, spent
     two days in front of that place, then came away yesterday, leaving the 1<hi rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">st</hi>
     </hi> Corps in front of the enemy there &amp; came to this place, met all the Yankee
     cavalry on the road -- they said they were on the way to Staunton -- had three days rations for
     man &amp; beast -- commanded by Custer -- we met them at Leetown &amp; routed them
     driving them in every direction -- &amp; killed &amp; wounded a good many &amp;
     forced the rest back across the Potomac &amp; to Harper's Ferry, so nipping in the bud one
     of the biggest raids they have ever undertaken -- We lost but few but they were fine men --
     Col. Monaghan of the 6<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     <abbr expan="Louisiana">La.</abbr> was killed -- <pb n="2"/>&amp; Col. Wolf of one of the
     Western Va. Regts. Gen. Gordon was struck by a glancing ball, in the <orig reg="forehead"
      >forhead</orig> &amp; bled profusely, but was not much hurt -- he did not get off his
     horse or stop to have his wound dressed but pressed on after the enemy all sprinkled over with
     blood -- the very personification of a hero -- The Yankees say they lost 500 in the fight -- I
     suppose 100 will cover all our casualties -- Our cavalry went on to Williamsport &amp;
     today will cross the river We shall also move -- The Yanks will not get much rest here Gen.
     Early believes in motion &amp; keeping them well stirred up -- We never stay more than 2 or
     3 days in one camp -- The country owes much to Gen. Early -- &amp; his vigilance I think
     will keep this Valley <pb n="3"/>safe from incursions of the enemy - </p>
    <p> I hope my letter with the ribbons &amp;c in, my box with the cups &amp; saucers
     &amp; Tumblers &amp;c, &amp; the little bundle with the bonnet pattern in, have all
     gotten to you safely -- If you do not like the bonnet pattern you can sell it. I will get
     everything I can for you - rest assured my dear One -- I want to send you some money but the
     comunications are so uncertain -- I will send before long -- I have not heard from you by
     letter for a long time -- two weeks at least -- but Jacob Henger told me you were all well
     &amp; quieted my fears that you might be sick -- but do write -- I long to hear from you
     &amp; have an ardent desire to come home, but no chance while we are <pb n="4"/>so busy
     &amp; if we can only end the war I am perfectly willing to endure this season of activity
     -- the signs are brightening &amp; I still confidently <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> a conclusion of
     hostilities with the ending of "Old Abe's" reign -- I have not time to write more now -- Kiss
     the children for me, they must be good girls -- I hope Mary is doing all she can to please you
     -- if she is industrious &amp; <orig reg="diligent">diligint</orig> I will bring or send
     her a present, tell her -- Write to me often --</p>
