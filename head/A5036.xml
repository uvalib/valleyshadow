                </opener>

                <p>Your long expected letter came to hand on Saturday last, dated the 24th and it
                    relieved me my son of the greatest anxiety as I had not heard from you for three
                    weeks previous. As you had been so kind as to write so regular before and not
                    receiving a word from either you or Charles it was natural for me to feel some
                    anxiety on your account especially as you said in your last letter that you had
                    a bad cold - I feared you were sick and that alone caused me great uneasiness.
                    But as I heard from you I feel more composed and am happy to hear you are well
                    as also Charles - Your letter found us all well at home as also the
                    neighborhood. There is no news of any interest transpiring here now. Every
                    person old &amp; young Man Woman and children being anxious to hear the news
                    from the army of Harpers Ferry and other points. We are full of excitement and
                    prayers are daily &amp; hourly offered for the preservation of our brave
                    soldiers. The Election passed off very quietly &amp; old Rockbridge although
                    formerly <hi rend="underline">Union </hi>is now so <pb n="2"/>thoroughly <hi
                        rend="underline">Secession</hi> that to find a <hi rend="underline"
                    >Union</hi> man would be a wonder. There was only one vote in the County for
                    Union and that was <unclear>Zach. White</unclear> in Lexington, let his name be
                        <unclear>offered </unclear> to the Four Winds, to meet that contempt it
                    deserves. There was a Pennsylvanian living at <unclear>Millbors Tunnel</unclear>
                    by the name of <hi rend="underline">Strunk</hi> who voted for the Union ticket
                    and boasted of it, defying the Community in which he lived - he was seized, and
                    well <hi rend="underline">decked</hi>, then ordered to leave within 48 hours
                    which prudence and a whole hide prompted him to do by the next evening. There is
                    another in Jail in Staunton - an officer of Lincolns Army, he formerly was
                    tanner at Brattons and then Merchant at Millboro - he left his wife, having
                    married her over about Middlebrook, a Miss Thomas - he came back under pretense
                    of visiting his wife, but for the purpose of a spy - was nabbed - and would have
                    been Lynched - but the Civil Authorities placed him under charge of the troops
                    now stationed in Staunton where he now is. It is not known what will be done
                    with him but it is presumed he will get his deserts. His name is Edward
                    Randolph.</p>

                <p>Every person is putting his <hi rend="underline">house</hi> in order around here
                    so that when called by our Governor they will be prepared to take up arms in our
                    Common defense. Our Crops are looking <unclear>finaly</unclear> better than for
                    some years so that Mr. Lincoln will find it about as hard to starve us out as it
                    will be to whip us into terms.</p>

                <p><pb n="3"/>I was up to see Sallie on Yesterday, <hi rend="underline">Sunday</hi>.
                    Poor Sallie is lying upon a bed of sickness, she is very sick but desired me to
                    send her love to you and also to request you to write to her as she would like
                    to hear from you very much, she has written to you, did you get her letter. I
                    have also written two letters to you and you have never said whether you
                    received them or not. let me know when you write again. <unclear>I <orig
                            reg="received">recd</orig></unclear> your letter containing the ring
                    which was duly appreciated, and had thought that I had mentioned it to you in a
                    former letter. And my Dear son that ring calls to mind another thing that I wish
                    to make inquiry of both you &amp; Charles. It may happen as you both are now
                    about to be engaged in mortal combat that I may never see your faces again and
                    what I wish to know what disposition you had made about your business. Whether
                    you had settled it up before you left home. Your <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> clothing and
                    other property you each of you left behind in whose care have they been placed
                    and what was to be done with them. If it should please an overruling providence
                    to take you from me, being your Mother and nearest of Kin; and who feels more
                    for you than any other person possibly could do. I wished to know where they
                    were, so that in the event of your fall I could take possession of them and so
                    keep them, as to perpetually remind me of my own brave sons. I don't want you to
                    think I am too fast or avaricious to obtain what little you have possessed <pb
                        n="4"/><del rend="none" hand="h1"/> my dear sons. It is no more than
                    <unclear>what</unclear> others have done and being your Mother think that if any
                    person is to have them she ought and if any person could take care of them she
                    could. I therefore wish you and Charles to give me a list of all the things you
                    left behind you: so that if you never return, I may know where to find them and
                    what to receive. And also what business you left unsettled. Tell Charles I am
                    sorry he has neglected to write to me for this span of time, he can write to
                    others. I think his mother is or ought to be worthy of an occasional letter from
                    him at least. When you write I want you to tell me how you are all situated, how
                    you are getting along - and if you are brought into an Engagement to write me
                    forthwith if alive to do so. Abraham &amp; all send their love to you. As
                    well as your friends in this neighborhood. I hope John you will write as often
                    as you can, once a week at least, if you can write oftener it is the only
                    consolation I have, and if you knew the distress of mind I was in by not
                    receiving a letter from you for 3 weeks. I know you would write often &amp;
                    punctual. I also wish you and Charles to send me a lock of your <hi
                        rend="underline">hair</hi> I thought I had some but upon examination found I
                    had none, don't forget if you please. Well my dear son I will close hoping to
                    hear from you soon &amp; often. With my prayers for your safety &amp;
                    Gods blessing upon you both I will stop for the present</p>
