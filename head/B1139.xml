                <p>In his letter, James Paul of Augusta County describes how he helped capture a
                    fugitive from Lexington. There appears, however, to be at least one page missing
                    from the letter, as the story does not seem complete. Paul states that because
                    of his part in capturing the fugitive, Fitzgerald, he is entitled to at least
                    part of any reward.</p>

                <p>This forenoon <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Hunter called at my house, to try
                    to get a horse to hunt a man <del hand="h1">named</del> by the name of
                    Fitzgerald, who had murdered a Freedman in your place a few days ago.</p>

                <p>While at dinner a man called at my house filling the description of Fitzgerald
                    given me by Hunter, I questioned him very closely &amp; was immediately
                    satisfied that it was he and asked him his name which he gave me - I determined
                    to arrest him and in order to do so strategically I proposed to go with him a
                    mile or two (to Mr Hunters father who is on the district road to the place that
                    he (<abbr expan="Fitzgerald">F</abbr>) was enquiring for) &amp; put him in
                    the <hi rend="underline">right</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">road</hi> it was raining very hard &amp; I prevailed on
                    him to remain till it would cease a little, he did so, during which time he took
                    me apart from my family</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>and divulged to whole case to me making me his whole confidant seemingly as such,
                    seeing Mr. Hunter riding up I advised him to walk out of the porch into my
                    parlor (which is strongly protected) until I could get my horse.</p>

                <p>At this juncture Mr Hunter came up and asked me where he (F) was, I showed him
                    into my parlor where he arrested him without any resistance.</p>
