                <p>Montgomery, the Justice of the Peace in Deerfield, writes on behalf of the local
                    black school, which just opened. He writes that financial assistance is urgently
                    necessary to keep the school open and to prevent the teacher from poverty, as
                    the community is very poor and most students cannot afford the tuition.</p>

                <p>The colored school that I have been talking to you about at Deerfield, commenced
                    last week, with 25 scholars, and their number would be greater, had they any
                    thing to pay with, or had they a hope that through your efficiency, funds would
                    be raised for their help, the school commenced on their <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">own</add> responsibility (hoping for aid) I can't think that
                    one half of those that are now scholars could pay now, any part of their
                    tuition. Mr Willgar as the teacher in charge of the school, charges $125 <abbr
                        expan="cents">cts</abbr> per month for a scholar he boarding himself, which
                    I think very reasonable for these times. Willgar is an Englishman by <orig
                        reg="birth">bearth</orig>, he is a man of good education, reads well, writes
                    an excellent hand, strictly reliable, a member of a Christian Church, and I
                    would say he is the man as he has the confidence of the colored people of this
                    neighborhood. He is a poor man, makes his living be days work. I fear unless you
                    procure some funds, or assist, he will be the <unclear>loser</unclear>, which
                    will be hard on his family, but I hope for better things, I understood you to
                    say that Wm H Willgar should come well recommended, and that you would like for
                    me to sign it in my official character, that I will do if you desire it at any
                    time, if you will send me a farm, or if you wish it, you can get the many
                    respectable men in this neighborhood to <unclear>sign</unclear> it <pb n="2"/>I
                    superintended a sabbath school last summer and they numbered 66 old and young,
                    all anxious to learn to read, I <orig reg="suppose">suppos</orig> the school
                    will be resumed next summer, I do hope that you will be prompt in attending to
                    this matter, so we may know what to depend on. They are poor and in want of help
                    and through me they ask you for help.</p>
