                <p>You have no idea how glad I was when your dear letter was handed me. I thought I
                    was entirely banished from your memory but your kind letter gave me understand

                    day it looks and feels very much like snow it has been raining for several days
                    hope it will <orig reg="clear">cleare</orig> off soon for I get so tired in

                    one but there <orig reg="wasn't">wasent</orig> a present for me <orig
                        reg="wasn't">wasnt</orig> that too bad, but one consolation it was out of
