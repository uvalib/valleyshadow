                <p>Yours came duly to hand. You ask if I had <orig reg="written">writen</orig> you a
                    letter previous to the one which you answered? Yes I wrote the next day after my
                    arrival here. And put it in the Post Office myself.</p>

                <p>The reason I did not get a cockade with yellow pendants for Frank was because
                    there were none ready made at the time I mailed my letter. So I sent such <orig
                        reg="a">an</orig> one as I could get. It <orig reg="answers">answeres</orig>
                    all the purposes of one with the yellow and signifies the same thing. You ask if
                    things do not look more like peace. I think not the air is redolant with the
                    fumes of powder and I believe we will have war with the North in less than sixty
                    days. If Virginia refuses to go out there will be a revolution in this state
                    which will be the special wonder of the world and go down to posterity as the
                    bloodiest picture in the book of time. I have said before and I say now that I
                    will be free and will maintain my rights even though I have to fight "looking a
                    halter gallantly in the face." I am a man who knows my rights and knowing dare
                    maintain. One of those rights is secession but if the convention<pb n="2"/>
                    refuses to give us that there is another which I will maintain even at the foot
                    of the gallows and that is <orig reg="rebellion">rebelion</orig>. <orig
                        reg="Rebellion">Rebelion</orig> has its <unclear>
                        <orig reg="horrors">horrows</orig>
                    </unclear> so <del hand="h1">does</del> has any other war. But like that gallant
                    Henry who rose in rebellion <orig reg="against">aginst</orig> the mightiest
                    empire on earth my words are "give me liberty or give me death." Tell Frank that
                    I will have the tobacco sent up by the Express Friday morning so that he can get
                    it any time after your receipt of this. I am very sorry that I could not see
                    Mrs. McChesney. As I have the <unclear>

                    </unclear> to class her among the best of my friends. </p>

                <p>Give my respects to all and believe me your affectionate son</p>
