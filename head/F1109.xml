                <p>This morning I seat myself with pen in hand to inform you that I am well-<orig
                        reg="Happy">Happing</orig> that these few lines may find you all enjoying
                    the same blessing of health that I enjoy at present.</p>
                <p>I left Carlisle yesterday evening. We landed here this morning. This afternoon at
                        <orig reg="3:00 o'clock">3:00o'clock</orig> we leave for Washington and I
                    expect we go on to Warrenton, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr>.</p>
                <p>We will <orig reg="join">joine</orig>

                        >Regt</abbr>.</p>
                <p>Well, Father, I feel satisfied that I am doing the will of God. I feel glad that
                    I could so willingly yield to the will of God. I know that God is able to
                    deliver me safe and if I should fall in the field of Battle. I am glad to know
                    that God will save me forever in Heaven. I know that he that promised is
                    faithful and cannot lie.</p>
                <p>I take God at His Word. That if our conscious condemns us not not. Neither will
                    he as he is greater than our conscious.</p>
                <p>For instance you will <orig reg="ask">aske</orig> me how I know this. I answer
                    that I feel my acceptance with God. Yes, Father, I can say-Glory to God for the
                    hope of Eternal Life.</p>
                <p>I fear no gun or cannon. My faith is strong in the Lord. If I fall I will fall in
                    the arms of the Lord. If I should never see you on earth, Father and the family
                    all, Try and meet me in Heaven where there will be no pain-where our eyes shall
                    run down no more with tears, where the wicked cease from <orig reg="troubling"
                        >trowbling</orig> and the weary are forever at rest.</p>
                <p>Oh, the glorious thought of eternity and enjoying heaven as a home while eternity
                    remains.</p>
                <p>Now, Father, will you all-the family-promise to meet me in Heaven. Give my
                    respects to all <orig reg="inquiring">enquiring</orig> friends and take good
                    care of Rachel and the two little babes and you shall be rewarded for it.</p>
                <p>I wrote you a letter last week. I hope that you received it and I Must close as I
                    have not much time.</p>
                <p>I will write soon again. I have no importance to write at present. You may direct

                    to my company, I will give you a whole history.</p>
