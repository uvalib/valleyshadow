                <p>I received a nice letter from your Mother a few days ago, but as I was still
                    indebted to you, I concluded to address this to you, supposing, you are by this
                    time once more in Gettysburg. I was very glad to receive such a complimentary
                    article on <abbr expan="Honorable">Hon.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Edward">Edwd.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="McPherson">McP</abbr>-- I think he is a mighty nice fellow, <hi
                        rend="underline">notwithstanding his politics</hi>, &amp; I feel all the
                    joy &amp; pride, consequent upon the election to a high office, of one who
                    has such a large share in my affections. My sojourn at the North this summer,
                    has not made me think more favorably of that <pb n="2"/> great political
                    question of the day -- on the contrary, I am more <hi rend="underline"
                    >Southern</hi> than ever in all my feelings, while at the same <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">time</add> I saw &amp; heard a great deal, independent of
                    that matter, to remember with pleasure &amp; delight. I hope the "gentleman
                    from <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Penn<hi rend="super">a</hi></abbr>" will not
                    think the less of me, for this avowel.-- Rather more than two weeks ago, Lizzie
                    Law wrote her Cousin C.- of her engagement to <abbr expan="Captain">Cap.</abbr>
                    Howe, at the same time hoping we had not heard of it from any one else. But she
                    was too tardy for that, for between <abbr expan="August">Aug.</abbr> &amp;
                        <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr> a rumour had time to reach Texas
                    &amp; I heard it in <abbr expan="Baltimore">Balt.</abbr> just after she
                    passed through that city - of course, I did not speak of it first, as you were
                    all silent on the subject. That we were surprised beyond measure, you could not
                    wonder, did you know how she spoke of him to us, when here, &amp; afterwards
                    in a letter <pb n="3"/> to me from <abbr expan="Baltimore">Balt.</abbr> on her
                    way to Old Point. If we have any distrust, it is all owing to herself, for we
                    did not know there was such a being on earth as <abbr expan="Captain">Cap-n.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Howe">H.</abbr> until she spoke of him in such terms as I will not
                    now repeat. None will be more delighted than ourselves, if he proves to be all
                    she <hi rend="underline">now</hi> thinks him, for she is greatly loved by us
                    all, &amp; of course our interest in <orig reg="everything">every
                    thing</orig> that concerns her is very great. Whatever opinion we had formed of
                    him, is entirely her own. Kitty was in Georgetown when the letter came,
                    &amp; is still. She expects to be at home this week. We hope you &amp;
                    Aunt will not fail to come on whenever you can. We will do all we can to make
                    her comfortable. Lizzie came home last week &amp; spent two or three days,
                    while her Mother remained to take care of the little boy, who is represented as
                    a great <pb n="4"/> beauty by every one who has seen him. I am most truly
                    grieved at the state of things in your church &amp; hope Mr. Van Wycke will
                    not remain. I only wish he had gone some time ago. For his own sake, as well as
                    for the welfare of the church, for under such circumstances no good can be done.
                    Mrs. Tyler has been very ill, but is getting better. Tell Aunt I will write to
                    her very soon. Love to our friends- Mr. T. &amp; John join me in love to
                    Aunt &amp; yourself--</p>
