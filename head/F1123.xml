                <p>Rosenbery expresses his desire for the North to crush slavery. He goes on to
                    express his disgust for shirkers of military service, contrasting their behavior
                    with his own willingness to sacrifice his life for the nation. Rosenbery also
                    notes that he anticipates a big spring battle, and he requests supplies from
                    home.</p>

                </opener>

                <p>I use the present opportunity of informing you that I am well and am enjoying
                    myself well under the present circumstances.</p>
                <p><orig reg="Hoping">Hopping</orig> that when these few lines reach home they may
                    find you all enjoying good health and happiness and a strong faith that this
                    wicked <orig reg="rebellion">rebelion</orig> must soon close. I <orig
                        reg="cannot">can not</orig> last long if the men of the North only pull
                    together as they ought and show the South that they will tramp slavery down and
                    are determined to have a free <orig reg="country">county</orig> and a free
                    government.</p>
                <p>Father, I would like you to tell me how Henry Forister made out about paying his
                    fine and how the other <orig reg="skedaddlers">shedadlers </orig>are making.
                    Now, I would simply say that such persons as George Fleagle and others that are
                    trying to slip the draft. I say they are worse <orig reg="than">then</orig> the
                    Southern <abbr expan="rebels">rebs</abbr> if the draft misses them it is all
                    right.</p>
                <p>The Army is no place to be. Therefore it should be every honest man's duty to do
                    what he could if men would view this the way I do they would better have no home
                    as to have no <orig reg="country">county</orig>.</p>
                <p>Let all turn out that could come. This <orig reg="rebellion">rebelion</orig>
                    would soon be terminated. My opinion is this that we will have a <orig
                        reg="tremendous">tremendrous</orig> battle in the Spring or when the weather
                    settles. So that the <orig reg="artillery">artilery</orig> can move.</p>
                <p>If the men of the North would come out as they should. No doubt this <orig
                        reg="rebelliousness">rebious</orig> would end without a battle.</p>
                <p>I feel satisfied that I felt it my duty to come out as a man for my country. And
                    if it costs my life it is right.</p>
                <p>As I was going to say about Fleagle and some more in the Valley that could come
                    and will not. They are a perfect <orig reg="nusiance">nucience</orig> to the
                    country and would deserve hanging.</p>
                <p>Well, I must drop this subject or you will think I am crazy.</p>
                <p>Well, I only have 4 envelopes yet and 3 stamps. You might send me a pack of
                    envelopes by mail and my watch you may send it as soon as you can conveniently
                    send it by mail as I think it will come perfectly safe.</p>
                <p>I cannot say how soon we will get our pay.</p>
                <p>I hear nothing of my brothers. I know where that station is where they were but
                        <orig reg="whether">wether</orig> they are there yet or not I cannot say.</p>
                <p>We have <orig reg="a lot">alot</orig> of picketing to do that I <orig
                        reg="cannot">can not</orig>
                    <orig reg="go">got</orig> to see. I hope that I will see them some fo these
                    days.</p>
                <p>Well, as I have nothing of importance to write, I shall close by send my <abbr
                        expan="respects">resp.</abbr> to all.</p>
                <p>Let me know if my tools is at home yet or not.</p>
                <p>I will soon write to you again. Take care of your health.</p>
                <p>My prayers to God is that peace and freedom may soon prevail our land.</p>
                <p>No more but write soon.</p>
