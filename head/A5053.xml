                <p>This will inform you that we are all well at present I hope that you are enjoying
                    good health, at this time we started your Box weighing two hundred &amp; 30
                    lb, on the Day that I promised you by, &amp; in the care of Mr.
                        <unclear>Snyder</unclear> &amp; Mr. <unclear>McCamry</unclear>. They
                    were going to the Army: your pa saw Mr. Snyder on Tuesday afterwards &amp;
                    he said he delivered it to you on Saturday Night &amp; saw you but I did not
                    know whether it was so or not as I waited all last week for a letter from you
                    &amp; have gotten none yet, but as tomorrow is Mail Day I look for a Letter
                    &amp; hope I will not be disappointed, if so I will write on if I get one I
                    will write to you again, I hope that you have been enjoying the Contents of the
                    box that I so carefully packed up for you. Your pa has been to see your grand Ma
                        <unclear>Doke</unclear> &amp; has just returned, he saw Charles they
                    were all well Charles thought he would go back this week but I do not think he
                    is fit for the Army yet.</p>

                <p>I am getting you a flannel shirt knit, but so not know how soon I will get it
                    done. I hope you are not suffering yet for it Let me know how the shirt that I
                    sent you answered, &amp; how you were pleased with the socks. I will send
                    your new shirt when I get it knit. We have had three snows &amp; bitter cold
                    weather for three weeks. if its as cold there as it is here I fear some of the
                    poor soldiers would freeze I think of you at night when I lay down to sleep the
                    weather has moderated here now &amp; it will keep so for a while. Johnny you
                    must excuse this short note if I get a Letter from you tomorrow I will write
                    soon again. Your Pa has not been well for a Month is hardly able to so any thing
                    your pa &amp; all the Children send their love to you &amp; receive the
                    same from your Mother</p>
