                <p>Lest you should be alarmed at our safety, I write to say that we are indeed in
                    the midst of a frightful <hi rend="underline">panic</hi>, but I myself do not
                    yet apprehend any immediate danger. But more than half our people have left and
                    are leaving. Just think, I left for the <hi rend="underline">Far West</hi> a
                    week or 10 days ago -- got to Cincinatti in a similar confusion -- and on
                    Tuesday night last at Dayton, I heard of the contemplated (or rather, expected)
                    march of the Rebels from Hagarstown to Chambersburg. So I just took the cars at
                    midnight <unclear>east</unclear> and came here yesterday at noon. I found our
                    folks packed, ready to start with Mr. Kennedy in carriage and baggage wagon. But
                    the night has again passed, + now nearly the day, + things look rather more
                    favorable. Indeed, I doubt whether the Rebels will come here at all. I think
                    it's a <hi rend="underline">feint</hi> to draw troops from Washington. <hi
                        rend="underline">Should</hi> they come, we must just submit -- we are
                    defenseless -- I myself will stay, but the females will go first to Carlisle, +
                    if things prove worse, across the mountain into Perry County. These are
                    sorrowful times. Where is our boasting and glorifying now?</p>

                <p>I was so sorry I did not know that Daniel (your son) was at Harrisburg last week
                    when I was on my way West. <pb n="2"/> I had to visit 1 1/2 hours there + might
                    have gone for half an hour to see him. But I only found it out when it was too
                    late first from <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Edwards, and then from
                    good Mr. Kelker, who told me that he had seen him at Church + Sunday School +
                    was so well pleased with Daniel + in speaking with him found he was my nephew. I
                    felt proud to hear him speak so kindly + well from a sisters son of mine. Mr. K.
                    is a most excellent and prominent officer in the Reformed <abbr expan="church"
                        >Ch</abbr> in Harrisburg.</p>

                <p>I must close -- all confusion around us. Let one of the girls write to me and
                    tell me the Company, <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg<hi rend="super">t</hi></abbr> +
                    place of address of Daniel. I will then occasionally write to him + send him
                    papers etc.</p>

                <p>Rebecca and Kate send much love to you all, while I remain</p>
