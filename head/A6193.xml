                <p>Your dear &amp; welcome letter reached me by last night's mail I was so glad
                    to hear from you if your letter was brief. I did not care for that it told me I
                    was not forgotten by one I love more <orig reg="than">then</orig> all the world.
                    Yes I think of you Every hour of my life separation does not bind my thoughts I
                    am here, but my <hi rend="underline">heart</hi>, &amp; thoughts are with <hi
                        rend="underline">you</hi>. Oh! how much I wish I could see you <orig
                        reg="tonight">to night</orig>. If I was in Staunton I should be satisfied
                    &amp; happy for then I could see you often. Those who are dear to me I love
                    to have near me your separation for one day is more <orig reg="than">then</orig>
                    I feel willing to submit to. This is my parental home &amp; should be the
                    dearest spot on earth to me, &amp; here I should love most of all to stay.
                    It was all this to me once. I still love my home dearly <pb n="2"/> &amp;
                    its beloved inmates, but I love you more <orig reg="than">then</orig> parents,
                    sisters, brothers or home. I never believed that I could love any man more
                    fondly <orig reg="than">then</orig> my dear, kind, &amp; affectionate
                    father. my eyes fill with involuntary tears when I think another &amp; that
                    other a stranger has supplanted his faithful &amp; treasured affections in
                    my heart. It does not give me pain to know this truth of my new love for
                    another, only a gentle sadness tinging my new found happiness, for I do yet love
                    my noble father with a deep &amp; undying devotion &amp; my sacrificing
                    Mother. I love them all but love you best. You will not believe me. Never think
                    again that I was loving, &amp; <hi rend="underline">trying</hi> you on <hi
                        rend="underline">probation</hi> as you once told me, for had you not been
                    all I wanted you to be, true, noble, &amp; upright, I should have loved you
                    still. my ambition &amp; not my affection would have been lessened. You may
                    perhaps think I do not understand your <pb n="3"/> peculiar nature but I do,
                    &amp; admire &amp; love what may seem a riddle to those who cannot
                    understand you. Let that be as it may I care not, for all I love best, admire
                    &amp; love Mr. D. H. Evans. They know I love you &amp; they esteem not
                    for my sake but for your own I wish you could see me <orig reg="spinning"
                        >spining</orig> with my hair real <hi rend="underline">chignon</hi> style. I
                    find that floating curls &amp; trailing skirts are not convenient for <orig
                        reg="spinning">spining</orig>, but only suitable for the parlor &amp;
                    promenade. I'll hurry sure enough, for I'm anxious to get back to Staunton. Ma
                    says after I'm through with the yarn, I must help to make winter carpets for the
                    floors, then do the sewing for the children before the snow storms come. I think
                    she told you last Sabbath that I might go after I did the <orig reg="spinning"
                        >spining</orig>. Well I look for my holiday about Christmas if I live. I
                    hope to see Staunton before then, as I don't know what I shall do if I do not. I
                        <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a long letter from dear Ella yesterday
                    evening. she wrote for me to <pb n="4"/> come back. that she can't live without
                    me. I "must not let Mt. Solon's gloomy skies find me from her, &amp; her boy
                    "I want her to miss me but not sadly as <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> we were
                    parted forever, for if I live I am going back to stay awhile with her again
                    before long. My good papa &amp; Hamie left us this morning for California
                    Furnace. I feel doubly lonely since they are gone. May God bless them, &amp;
                    send them home soon. I miss papa so much &amp; so long. dear Ma seems so
                    lonely &amp; sad when her husband &amp; son both leave. I must do a
                    daughter's part &amp; try to cheer up her drooping spirits. Rennie is <hi

                    meditations were so deeply absorbing that you would forget one was near who
                    loved you with all her heart. I thank you for the kiss you sent me &amp; in
