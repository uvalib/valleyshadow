    <p>In this letter, Fleming discusses recent orders, recounts the burning of Chambersburg, tells
     of recent battle experience, reviews strategy, mentions life in camp, and describes the
     experience of being captured by "Yankees," after having been turned in by "the negroes."
     Fleming also writes about encounters with local citizens. Unfortunately, the letter has a large
     number of illegible words and sections. Nearly everything after the first few paragraphs should
     be considered "unclear."</p>

    <p>It has been a long time since I have had an opportunity of writing to you; &amp; now that
     our <unclear>prefent</unclear>
     <unclear>myself</unclear> of sending a letter to <unclear>this</unclear> mail, I have time to
     write only a line - Give to me before this doubtless heard all the particulars of our Maryland
     &amp; Penn; last, the burning of Chambersburg <orig reg="etc.">&amp;c</orig> - To give
     an abstract account of all our adventures meant consuming more time &amp; paper than I have
     to spare. <unclear>Nothing</unclear> exaggerated can be fair about the burning of Chambersburg
     - we we who did not <unclear>fire</unclear> it could form an approximate idea of the horrors
      <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> this occasion. I <unclear>intend</unclear> this Town (&amp; a beautiful
     place it is) <unclear>with</unclear> a<pb n="2"/> stiff nect &amp; stubborn
     <unclear>breast</unclear>, me, as much as I hate the Yankees, I could not stand it long.</p>

    <p><abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>
     <unclear>McCausland</unclear> commanded his two Brigades (his own &amp; <abbr
      expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">
       <hi rend="underline">l</hi>
      </hi></abbr> Johnson's)- His orders from <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">
       <hi rend="underline">l</hi>
      </hi></abbr> Early were to buy a tribute of one hundred thousand dollars in gold or its
     equivalent in Northern funds ($500,000) which money was to be paid to Gov. Letcher _Alex Butler
     &amp; owing to <unclear>indig</unclear>nify <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for the losses
     <unclear>Nety</unclear> had sustained at the hands of the Yankees.</p>

    <p>The citizens regarded this as an ample threat &amp; <unclear>favorably</unclear> refused
     to pay the tribute <unclear>voluntarily</unclear>
     <unclear>Mc'Causland</unclear> at once ordered the city to be laid in ashes. The scene which
     followed baffles all description. Shrieking children &amp; panic stricken men &amp;
     women running<pb n="3"/> In <unclear>every</unclear>
     <unclear>direction</unclear> begging assistance. I saw from a <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>

    <p>I believe somewhat in the old Mosaic law - an eye for an eye &amp; a tooth for a tooth,
     but when <unclear>somebody</unclear> is <unclear>shouting</unclear> for a <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> I
     think we are going <unclear>wrong</unclear></p>

    <p>The most <unclear>objectionable</unclear>
     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> along the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> affairs was the <unclear>manner</unclear> in which
      <unclear>Miss</unclear>

    <p>I think the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>

     his <unclear>Army</unclear> was s<unclear>toked</unclear>. soldiers <unclear>moved</unclear>
     <unclear>loose</unclear> upon private houses &amp; then the orders issued to burn. As soon
     as the citizens saw that <unclear>Mc'Causland</unclear> was in <unclear>coming</unclear> many
      <unclear>appeared</unclear> to hope that proper to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> this be in <del hand="h1"

     handed my watch to the lady of the house. It was very well that I did for I had not been long
