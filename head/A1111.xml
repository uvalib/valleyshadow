                <p>Your letter has remained already too long unanswered but I suppose I had better
                    answer it now than leave it longer, yours was received just as I was on the eve
                    of starting to the springs and since I have returned my time has been taken up
                    with one thing and another until I have put it off until the present, it is now
                        <orig reg="Andrew's">Andrews</orig> time to write but as he has some other
                    letters to answer I will write supposing that it makes no difference to you so
                    it is a letter from home; I am sorry to inform you that mother is again very
                    poorly she was taken on tuesday morning last and has been quite unwell since we
                    have had the <unclear>

                    morning we all went to bed last night we left a candle burning in the room

                    had rested pretty well until about 12 but since that time she has been restless
                    I concluded to stay up til morning, she bids fair to have a bad spell and I
                    think it impossible for her to stand a bad spell now as she is at best very
                    weak, I <orig reg="don't">

                    hardly since I left <abbr expan="Georgia">Ga</abbr> last spring a year. Mary was

                    Stribling springs I went down there on a tuesday and came back on Saturday and
                    as father wants to go to Crawfords I went out with him and wednesday and came in
                    on Saturday he <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> until last wednesday just a week
                    and came in on the <unclear>cars</unclear> I think you asked in your last what
                        <unclear>Pancoast</unclear> charges for the operation on his <add hand="h1"

                    surprised that we neglected to tell you as it was a question that was frequently
                    discussed in this <orig reg="neighborhood">neighbourhood</orig> and even persons
                    who we would have thought would never thought about it were perfectly indignant
                    at it and vowed they would never pay it, for my part I was not a great-deal
                    surprised it was only $500 five hundred dollars, they asked him a day or two
                    before they left what his charge was he told them they did not say <orig
                        reg="anything">any thing</orig> then but in thinking about it father said he
                    could not sleep for thinking about it he said that Pancoast had been very kind
                    to him and he wanted to compensate him but he really did not feel like he was
                    able to pay so much, Andrew in thinking about it was right out [MISSING SECTION]
                        <pb n="4"/>be satisfied Andrew told him that even that was too much he then
                    went and saw father and told him that if they would pay him $300 that he would
                    be satisfied they had but $200 with them they paid that and he told them to send
                    him another $100 whenever it suited him to pay it to take his own time about it.
                    Andrew says that he <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> send him another cent father
                    says if he gets to see pretty well that he will send him another $100 father

                    could before but with his reading glasses he can read very well his glasses for

                    perhaps he can get a pair for that purpose that will suit him better, their
                    tavern bill in Philadelphia was very moderate the Landlord and Landlady were
                    very kind, It is now daylight I will stop writing for a while will add more

                    not hear from one another awhile than to run the risk of catching the disease
                    though we are anxious to hear for fear the disease may get among some of our
                    friends</p>
                <p>I believe I will add no more at present hoping to hear from you all soon if there
                    is no danger in your going to the office, I believe the people of Summerville
                    would have been perfectly justifiable in killing that little stuffed
