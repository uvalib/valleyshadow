    <p>I sit me down to answer your <orig reg="very">verey</orig>
     <orig reg="kind">kinde</orig> letter <orig reg="which">wich</orig> I just received this
     morning. I was truly glad to hear that the children <orig reg="were">ware</orig> all well, but
     sorry to hear that you <orig reg="were">ware</orig> not well, but I hope you are well now, and
     do hope you all may remain in good health <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> I get <orig
      reg="home">hom</orig>, for it hurts me to hear that you or <orig reg="any">enny</orig> of the
     children are not well, and that I <orig reg="cannot">can not</orig> be there to see after you
     see that you get the attendance that you need, but I hope if you are not well that we have some
      <orig reg="friends">freinds</orig>, but <orig reg="don't">donte</orig> let <orig reg="trouble"
      >trobble</orig> be your complaint I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> want you<pb n="2"/> to <orig
      reg="trouble">trobble</orig> yourself about me not <orig reg="getting">geting</orig> home for
     thats <orig reg="alright">all wright</orig> I think I'<hi rend="super">ll</hi> get home pretty
     soon I think in two weeks from now I'll be at home if not before, the order is <orig
      reg="issued">ishuede</orig> to muster us out as soon as they can so it must hit us <orig
      reg="sometime">some time</orig> before long, and if you can make shift without money <abbr
      expan="until">till</abbr> then I'<hi rend="super">ll</hi> not risk to send <orig reg="any"
      >enny</orig>, some sends <orig reg="their">there</orig> money home in letters but there is so
      <orig reg="many">maney</orig> letters goes astray that I think <orig reg="I'd">id</orig>
     better carry it myself I do not think it will be <orig reg="any">enny</orig> longer than that
      <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> I will get home that money that I got from the butter man just
     let that stand as it is <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> I get home myself and then I'<hi
      rend="super">ll</hi> settle with him, and if you can shift without going to town <abbr
      expan="until">till</abbr> I get home do so then you can buy all you <orig reg="need"
     >neede</orig> and I'<hi rend="super">ll</hi> take you in <orig reg="right">wright</orig><pb
      n="3"/>away. so George W Foper thought he had better save his life and <orig reg="lose"
     >loose</orig> his money, but the <orig reg="scripture">scriptur</orig> says he that saveth his
     life shall <orig reg="lose">loose</orig> it, I think that was A nice cowardly off come for
     Poper so that the people would give him <orig reg="right">wright</orig> in leaving, but I think
     he had better <orig reg="stayed">stade</orig> and got his pay and an <orig reg="honorable"
      >onerable</orig> discharge <orig reg="which">wich</orig> he had so dearly earned for its
     something that may be throwed up to him and perhaps to his children, I always said that <orig
      reg="I'd">Id</orig> stay <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> I got that and if they would <orig
      reg="keep">keepe</orig> me <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> my time was up, I have had no
     letter from Mr Keller yet I wrote to him before we left goldsboro and have no answer yet but
     the next one I write he'<hi rend="super">ll</hi> answer I give him my <orig reg="address"
      >adress</orig> if I mistake not but he <orig reg="neglected">neglcted</orig>
     <orig reg="writing">writeing</orig> so long that he thought that would hardly do <orig
      reg="anymore">enny more</orig><pb n="4"/> he requested me to write and I did so and of <orig
      reg="course">corse</orig> I looked for him to to reply, but its hardly worth his while to
      <orig reg="commence">comenc</orig> to write now <orig reg="anymore">enny mor</orig> for if he
     waits about two weeks more he can talk to me if he has <orig reg="anything">enny thing</orig>
     to say for <orig reg="himself">him self</orig>, I'm glad you got the hay made, tell Abraham I
     am very <orig reg="thankful">thankfull</orig> to him that he sees that you have plenty of flour
     and <orig reg="feed">feede</orig> and he shall furnish you with <orig reg="flour">fower</orig>
     and feed <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> I get home, and then I'<hi rend="super">ll</hi> pay
     all and I want you to feed your hogs pretty well so that they make good hogs <abbr
      expan="until">till</abbr> fall, when you write again tell me where you put your hay and how
     the hogs looks, you stated in your letter that I should not let myself be led into bad <orig
      reg="habits">habbits</orig> you <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
     <orig reg="need">neede</orig> to be <orig reg="afraid">affraid</orig> god knows the army would
     never corrupt my <orig reg="morals">morrols</orig> I believe the <orig reg="longer"
     >longe</orig> I am in the army the more <orig reg="moral">morrol</orig> I get. for there is so
     much hard <orig reg="swearing">swarring</orig> and all kinds of bad works going on in the army
     that I get so disgusted against it so that it make me think about <orig reg="changing"
     >chaing</orig> my way of living and do better, you know that when I came home from the army
     before I did not <unclear>Swe</unclear> half as much as I did when I left but sorry to say
      that<pb n="5"/> got pretty well in the hang of <orig reg="swearing">swaring</orig> again
     before I left and swore by times yet if I get provoked but I hope god may give me grace to
      <orig reg="overcome">over come</orig> all such bad habits for we are raising A family and I do
     think we ought to <orig reg="change">chang</orig> our way of living for I <orig reg="find"
