                    your dear &amp; welcome letter which came to me a few hours ago I thought I

                    from me until next week. I was so glad to hear of your safe return home. You
                    don't know how much I did miss you Sabbath evening. I would have <pb n="2"
                    />given <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> if you could have staid until
                    Monday morning with me my love, for I do love to be with you.</p>

                <p>Oh! I did dislike to give you up so soon. I wish John Noon had told you that he
                    would go &amp; let you stay. Mr. Sam Ferror did not call. Did you think when
                    we met him coming up that I knew he was coming Sunday to see me? I did not know
                    it. he had not told me he was going to call. I just then supposed he would do so
                    to hear from pa that was all. You hope in your letter that I will <pb n="3"
                    />have a pleasant visit I will no doubt, but shall not be happy as I should be
                    were I going where I could see your dear face. I can love you &amp; think of
                    you all the time I am gone which will be sweet to me to think of you &amp;
                    love you only when with others I expect to return home before next Tuesday in
                    time to get your letter &amp; answer it by Friday if I live. You must write
                    I will be here to get it How much I would love to see you tonight &amp; if I
                    was only going to Staunton tomorrow my heart would not feel as <pb n="4"/>it
                    does now. how glad &amp; happy I would be with the thought of soon being
