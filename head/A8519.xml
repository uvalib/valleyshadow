                <p>Yours of the 15<hi rend="super">th</hi> came to hand yesterday, and found me in a
                    sad fix for lifting our note. I saw (<hi rend="underline">Our Brother</hi>!) D S
                    Bell <orig reg="today">to day</orig>, and he permitted me to renew it, which was
                    a godsend indeed, for I never in <hi rend="underline">all</hi> my life have been
                    so hard up. We are all in the habit of always complaining of hard times, but
                    without exaggeration I have never seen anything like it here. I have been
                    particularly unfortunate in obtaining means to meet the demands upon me. I have
                    not been able to get a Dollar from Imboden or <abbr expan="Samuel">Saml.</abbr>
                    Steele, and my hope of the fund in Kinneys <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                    >hands</add> upon which I chiefly relied, were dashed by his giving a Deed to
                    his creditors a week since, thereby tying up this fund, and probably causing me
                    serious loss in the end. <unclear>His</unclear> official Bond is not regarded as
                    covering his receipts for any other year than 52 -- which does not embrace my
                    fund. I could not induce Baldwin to conclude a settlement with him, &amp; I
                    employed Imboden to prepare for <hi rend="underline">me</hi> a notice for Kinney
                    during the last days of the court, which notice Brought the Deed.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>After pretty heavy settlements on his wife in Lieu of Dowry, he next embraces all
                    his indebtedness as <orig reg="Receiver">Reciever</orig>, the amount of which no
                    one seems to know. His assets are considerable, but whether <orig reg="they"
                    >the</orig> will cover his indebtedness as <orig reg="Receiver">Reciever</orig>
                    I have no means of ascertaining. Imboden thinks I will lose considerably. But I
                    am rather disposed to think that I will some day come out. This affair has
                    caused a great deal of "squirming" about Staunton, &amp; it is thought that
                    a considerable amount of this fund will be found in hands that will find it
                    inconvenient to fork over.</p>

                <p>Why have you not been over. I have looked for you for the last month. Your
                    Fathers treatment of you I think is outrageous, but <orig reg="entirely"
                        >intirely</orig> in Keeping with all I have ever known of him. The Almighty
                    Dollar is the power that governs all his actions. I am sorry that so serious a
                    rupture has occurred between you, but under the circumstances it was inevitable.</p>

                <p>The most important &amp; funniest piece of news I have to communicate is that
                    our sister Elizabeth is <hi rend="underline">going</hi> to marry <orig
                        reg="Colonel">Col.</orig> Bell. As winter approaches her "<orig
                        reg="rheumatism">Rhumatis</orig>" increases, and she has come to the
                    conclusion that matrimony is the only remedy for her stiff Legs &amp; other
                    infirmities <pb n="3"/>and I have concluded that the wonders of the world will
                    never cease. Sarah, &amp; myself have had some hearty laughs over this
                    affair and wish you could be here to join us. I have not heard the particulars,
                    but have ascertained that it will certainly be during the next month.*</p>

                <p>I am sorry you did not get over to see Meg. She is looking remarkable well, and
                    Prettier than in her younger days. her visit was not a very <orig reg="pleasant"
                        >pleasan</orig> one to her, in consequence of the operation on her little
                    Boy, which gave her a <orig reg="great deal">great-deal</orig> of anxiety
                    &amp; trouble. It was successful however, &amp; he goes home greatly
                    improved. Jno. Imboden has courted Miss M<hi rend="underline">c</hi>Phail,
                    &amp; will marry her, I understand, early in March. He has been gone all
                    week on a visit to her. We are all about as usual and would like very much to
                    see you all come over soon. Sarah joins with me in much love to yourself
                    &amp; Liz. Write me soon and Believe me as ever</p>
