                <p>Do not think I have forgotten to write or do not intend to answer your letter. I
                    should have written sooner I know, but <del hand="h1">we</del> the rest were
                    writing from home any way besides I did not know but you would be home soon. I
                    am glad to see by the tone of your letters that you have become better satisfied
                        <add hand="h1" place="inline">contented</add> than you was at first, not
                    that I think you should give over trying to 'get off' and settle down with the
                    belief that there is no use in your doing any thing more, that you <abbr
                        expan="cannot">cant</abbr> off any how, but I think it is best for a person
                    not to appear restless and uneasy. They should be determined, firm, but calm and
                    composed. I do think it strange that Adam Steele has succeeded in getting off
                    (whether on detail or how he did get off I do not know) and you cannot, but I
                    hope your time will come yet, and may be soon, some have taken away their wool
                    others are leaving it with the expectation that you will be home to card for
                    them yet this winter All seem to be astonished that <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">the</add> authorities have not let you off before now. I am
                    glad you have met with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Hull, probably he
                    can be of some service to you, he might know how to help you to get on the
                    'right track'. Please give him my Compliments &amp;c. <pb n="2"/>We started
                    a box for you last week containing your overcoat flannel shirt, socks, gloves,
                    and some eatables, hope you have <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> them before
                    this, the box was sent in care of Tyler &amp; Son. Jennie also wrote to you
                    at the same time <add hand="h1" place="inline">sent by mail</add> and told you
                    about your box &amp;c. She <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a letter from
                    you last thursday. Uncle H was at home a few days last week. He, Frank M

                    supplies they brought an army wagon with them for supplies (potatoes, apples
                    dried fruit beans &amp;c) but I think they did not get it very well loaded,
                    the people not being willing to sell for <abbr expan="government">gov't</abbr>
                    price when they can get so much more by selling to individuals they besides took
                    a private wagon with them pretty well loaded with boxes &amp;c for soldiers.

                    consider themselves in for the war but a great many think, (and I among the
                    rest, but you know I am always hopeful) that when the Army goes into Winter
                    quarters <del hand="h1">that</del> the detailed men will be sent home, but by
                    that time Army agents &amp;c will have all the surplus grain gathered up
                    hauled away, or destroyed, for from all accounts they destroy enough to keep a
                    small army some time, for the last two or three weeks the country has been <del
                        hand="h1">nearly</del> overrun with Army agents, (one came in just now
                    wanting hay) Some say that for every detailed man put in the field there are
                    three or four detailed from the army. I think the policy is bad, but I do feel
                    sorry for men when they are trying to get supplies and <orig reg="don't"
                    >dont</orig> succeed in finding <del hand="h1">any</del> much Uncle H wants to
                    get home to bale the Hay and haul it away. I do not whether he will succeed or
                    not. <pb n="3"/>Mr Junkin held sacramental meeting last sabbath <orig
