                        >ware</orig> well with all the rest of your brothers and sisters. My health
                    is very good and hope when <orig reg="these">theese</orig>

                    enjoying the same with all the pleasure this poor world can afford. I have the

                    letter as usual. Brother John &amp; Tom Graham got to disputing about a very
                    trifling matter. John was left out of his mess to get breakfast, and it not

                    <orig reg="of">ove</orig> drill Graham commenced cursing John when he had been
                    swearing as John thought long <orig reg="enough">enought</orig> he told him to
                    stop. Graham yanked up a <orig reg="stick">stik</orig> and let him have it over

                    <orig reg="interfered">intofeared</orig> &amp; sent Graham to the Guard
                    house. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> told John when ever he got a chance to

                    was at fairfax Court house when the Yankees came on them &amp; they had to
                    retreat back to Bulls run. Another of our old school mates was to see us, <abbr

                        >Montosella</orig> Guards, has a very nice uniform. Weeb &amp; Cousin

                    <orig reg="Cox's">Cox'es</orig> brigade. I have seen both my <orig reg="uncles"
                        >oncles</orig> since the <orig reg="great">Grate</orig> Battle of bulls run.
                    I shall <orig reg="now">know</orig> give you a short account of the Battle.</p>

                <p>We <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> orders about the dawn of day to march
                    down to the run &amp; to charge on a battery near our breastworks; we had
                    been <orig reg="there">thare</orig> an hour and a half when we recieved orders
                    to, Change our position we marched about three miles north our <orig
                        reg="enemies">enimies</orig> had been cannonading us for sometime at
                    different points</p>

                <p>at eight <orig reg="o'clock">oclock</orig> the attack became general. I can not
                        <orig reg="describe">disscribe</orig> the <orig reg="firing">fireing</orig>
                    of small arms at nine <orig reg="o'clock">oclock</orig> our brigade was ordered
                    to the <orig reg="scene">seen</orig> of slaughter on our way we met the Staunton
                    Artillery the men said <orig reg="they">thay</orig>
                    <orig reg="were">ware</orig> almost out of <orig reg="ammunition"
                    >amunition</orig> and <orig reg="were">ware</orig> nearly surrounded.</p>

                <p>We advanced in quick time to <orig reg="support">surport</orig> the Washington
                    Artillery on the right <orig reg="which">wich</orig>

                    <orig reg="excellent">exilent</orig> sevice in the engagement. We threw down a
                    fence and advanced a <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> paces and was ordered to lay
                    down and incessant fire was kept up by our <orig reg="enemies">enimies</orig>
                    for about ten or fifteen minutes. I believe if we had have raised up at one time
                    we would have all been wounded or killed the balls seemed to range about two
                    feet above the ground. The <orig reg="regiment">regament</orig> in advance of us
                    fell back in confusion but on <orig reg="passing">bassing</orig> our line
                    immediately formed again. We then <orig reg="were">ware</orig>
                    <pb n="4"/> ordered to advance in quick time to the old <unclear>home</unclear>
                    we then laid down waiting orders to fire we beg<add hand="h1" place="inline"

                    &amp; would not let us fire on them. We then commenced <orig reg="firing"
                        >fireing</orig> at three or four <abbr expan="Regiments">Reg.</abbr> in
                    front of us I gave them three rounds &amp; then we fell back some twenty or

                    we went up with them some of our boys went on &amp; never <orig

                    on our right fired on us <orig reg="but">put</orig> with little effect we
                    returned <orig reg="their">thare</orig> fire throwing them in to confusion for a
