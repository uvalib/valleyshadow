                <p>I will improve the few leisure moments allotted me in answering your kind and
                    ever welcome letter. We was happy indeed to hear from you once more, and to hear
                    that you were all enjoying so good a degree of health. Our family is all well at
                    present. Cousin Lyman how little did I think when I saw you at Mr <orig
                        reg="Alexander's">Alexanders</orig> that I should one day address you as
                    cousin but strange things will happen</p>

                <p>Tell Aunt Sarah that Mother Hunt has had a very hard time of it this fall Fathers
                    being sick and Sarah too She was first at Sarah's and then at home I would go
                    and take care of Father when she was up to <orig reg="Sarah's">Sarahs</orig>.
                    But she stood it remarkably well she will outdo any girl in Ill.</p>

                <p>We are having very cold weather here now, we have snow enough to make tolerable
                    good sleighing Now Lyman when you write again have your wife write some we want
                    to get more acquainted with her I must close for it is late</p>
