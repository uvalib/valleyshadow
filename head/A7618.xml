                <p>I am well &amp; doing as well as can well expect. I offered my resignation
                    again &amp; am waiting anxiously to hear the result which I hope will be the
                    final acceptance &amp; relieving me from duty, then I hope we can make some
                    better arrangement about living. I am sorely tired of this way of living I have

                    come here or I Come home. I am so anxious &amp; concerned about you
                    &amp; the children I have <add hand="h1" place="inline">had</add> but one
                    short note from you since I left home July last which seems singular. I have
                    written you a Bushel of letters I think. I still hear in general terms that you
                    are all well but this is not like getting letters detailing all our private
                    &amp; domestic matters do write me <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> write me
                    anything about service &amp; I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> see any

                <p>It would not do to come when there is any movement of the troops as could not
                    pass the lines &amp; would be unpleasant. If you do come when you get to
                    Confederate lines make yourself know to the Military <del hand="h1">&amp;</del>
                    <add hand="h1" place="inline">or</add> civil authorities &amp; you will be

                <p>Do try &amp; write me I sent by several for a lace stocking but have not yet
                    got one would like to have one or two for a change. I have plenty chances to
                    send down, so many moving out C S but see but few chances up this way I will
                    write you so soon as I know or hear from my resignation and then we will know
                    better what to do</p>
