                <p>Oh! how glad I was this evening when your dear &amp; welcome letter came. I
                    have been so sad &amp; troubled since Tuesday by not getting a letter from
                    you I was so much disappointed &amp; could not think why you did not write I
                    as usual imagined a thousand things but not once did I imagine the right cause I
                    never thought of John Noon being away. Your dear letter of <orig reg="today">to
                        day</orig> has lifted a heavy burden from my heart. I was sad last night
                    because I had <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <pb n="2"/> heard from you but <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig> I feel like a
                    new creature as I have your letter my love &amp; I know you love me only. I
                    thought yesterday when my heart was grieved with wondering why you did not write
                    what would all the whole world be to me without your precious love. I felt that
                    it would be nothing, only a desolate void which could never fill or satisfy my
                    heart I could never never be happy again if you did not love me. I would rather
                    have your love <orig reg="than">then</orig> all the wide world &amp; all it
                    contains they could not make me happy if you did not love me. I see &amp;
                    feel this to be so every day of my life. I should die if you ceased to love me.
                    I would not care to live without <pb n="3"/> your affections were all mine to
                    have as long as I live. Oh my love it is the daily cry of my heart that I may
                    always have your dear love &amp; always be entirely worthy of it, &amp;
                    I shall always be worthy &amp; keep <orig reg="myself">my self</orig> so
                    while I have life. I do hope you can spend the holidays at Mountain Palace with
                    me I shall not enjoy them without you my love but will be lonely &amp; sad
                    if you are <orig reg="away">a way</orig>. I do not wish to disappoint your
                        <unclear>Ma</unclear> but I am selfish enough to hope you will not go to
                    Winchester Christmas. I do so want you to be with me my love. Do just as you
                    think is right, but my heart wants you here. I am truly selfish in my affection
                    for you. I confess the truth <pb n="4"/> I am indeed I do not like for you to be
                    with <orig reg="anyone">any one</orig> but myself. forgive me my love I can't
                    help it I have tried to do so but can't. I am so glad you are coming up next
                    Sabbath if you live I want to see you more <orig reg="than">then</orig> I can
                    tell with my pen. The time always seems so short that you have to spend with me
                    it seems more like a happy &amp; pleasant dream <orig reg="than">then</orig>
                    reality after you are gone. I scarcely see your dear face before you must say
                    "Goodby" &amp; are gone. I wish with all my heart that I could see you now I
                    should be very happy then. We have been expecting pa all week. he has not yet
                    arrived. I hope he will come Saturday.</p>

                <p>I will send this letter in the morning to Swoope's Depot by Frank the black man
                    then I shall feel sure of you getting it. I love you with all the true &amp;
                    unchanging devotion of both heart &amp; soul &amp; ever shall while I
                    live. Come Sunday if you live. I wish you could come Saturday Evening I could
                    then be with you who I love more than all on Earth one Evening longer. Yes I do
                    indeed love you with all my heart &amp; soul &amp; love you only of all
                    living. I love to be with you &amp; love to think of you when absent come.
                    All send love I send a loving kiss. God bless you &amp; let you come My only
                    love.</p>
