    <p>I got here yesterday and found all well and also got my commission it had been here for some
     time Capt Patrick seemed glad to see me he had sent George Freed up to the Junction the day
     before yesterday to tell me Col Stuart would not let him send a man up to <orig reg="attend"
      >attent</orig> to me and for me to get on the cars and go home until I got well, but George
     did not see me and I knew nothing of it until I got here I told the Capt that I had a
     certificate for 30 days furlough he said I ought have stayed at home that it would have been
     all right I was very much surprised to find my commission here The Capt had it sent up to me by
      <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> but I did not see him if I had I could have gone back and stayed at home for
     some time but I think it was all for the best we call encamped here at the Court House with
     about 3000 or 4000 infantry and 1 company artillery all commanded by Col Stuart I am tolerably
     well. Tell Ma I <orig reg="got the">gotthe</orig> things she sent by George McKnight I stayed
