                <p>In his report, Waldo remarks that although he knows of no cases of actual
                    discrimination in the legal system, he observes a "spirit" of injustice towards
                    blacks and whites loyal to the Union government among Magistrates. Waldo also
                    reports that he continue to settle civil matters outside of the courts.</p>

                <p>In compliance with Par VI Circular No X- dated Headquarters <abbr
                        expan="Assistant">Asst</abbr> Commissioner Richmond <abbr expan="Virginia"
                        >Va</abbr> March 12 1866 - in relation to the result of the operation of the
                    order restoring to the Civil Authorities jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over
                    colored persons &amp;c I have the honor to make the following Report so far
                    as said orders pertains to this Division, Highland and Augusta Counties.</p>

                <p>But two or three cases of a Criminal character have been referred to the Civil
                    Authorities during the month, and those were withdrawn before coming to trial,
                    the parties concerned preferring to settle them amicably rather than subject
                    themselves to the costs that would accrue from a legal investigation. All these
                    being of a petit nature, I could not but approve of the action of the
                    complainant in withdrawing them.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>The political animosity of the Magistrates toward a Union man, of either color is
                    so great that I have reason to believe, he would do more injury to the
                    complaining party, if a loyal man, than justice to the party complained of, if
                    of the opposite sentiment. When a Justice of the Peace will degrade himself, and
                    his office by committing assualt and battery on a white man, without other cause
                    for aggravation and offence, than his loyalty tested, as was done in this place
                    but a few days since, I do not think such a man is too moral to manifest his
                    resentment against a colored applicant for redress in case the accused be of the
                    more popular stripe - a rebel - While I do not think all the Magistrates would
                        <unclear>demean</unclear> themselves to the extent here represented, it is
                    but a fair representation of the spirit engendered and personal feelings of
                    many.</p>

                <p>Although I am unable to recite any instances where actual injustice has been done
                    a Colored person by any Magistrate, yet this spirit of animosity courted by them
                    against a man white or colored with loyal proclivities, is so prominently
                    manifest that it is with a spirit of misgiving as to the
                    <unclear>result</unclear> that I <unclear>refer</unclear> the complaints <pb
                        n="3"/>made to this office to the Civil Authorities for adjustment.</p>

                <p>Many complaints have been made of the non-payment or partial payment of employees
                    for labor performed during the past season &amp; for other causes, in many
                    of which I have been successful in adjusting to the satisfaction of
                    complainants, but it serves to show the spirit manifested toward the colored
                    man, and the <hi rend="underline">honesty</hi> and <hi rend="underline"
                        >integrity</hi> of many whites by whom they have been employed.</p>

                <p>No complaints have been made at this office arising from the disobedience of the
                    "Game Saw" referred to in Circular No 24 CS from your office, nor have any
                    instances relative thereto come to my notice.</p>
