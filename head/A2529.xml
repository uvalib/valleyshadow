    <p>The enemy advanced at 3 A.M. today &amp; we have fallen back so far and are stopping for
     a day or so -- I should rather say for an hour or so, for I expect we shall have to move on in
     a few hours -- the <orig reg="enemy">enmy</orig> is pressing upon our rear &amp; Ashby is
     keeping them back. There was a little skirmishing &amp; one or two of the enemy were killed
     &amp; we lost one man -- a number of shots were fired on both sides, at a distance of two
     miles and of course "nobody was hurt" by that, <orig reg="though">tho</orig> the noise
     &amp; explosion of the <orig reg="shots">shotts</orig> was anything but agreeable. I went
     to where I had a good view of the Yankee troops drawn up in line of battle, from the hill top
     where I went to see them. They have <pb n="2"/> about 10000 men I <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> think and
     then Blenker is at the end of the Valley with about the same number, so Banks I suppose feels
     quite safe.</p>
    <p> I know not where we will stop; I suppose <orig reg="though">tho'</orig> when we get to
     Staunton for it seems to be the opinion that the inner line of the state is to be defended. We
     are now at the house of a Mr. Cowan -- one of his sons married a Miss Allabaugh of Bridgewater
     -- it is a very nice place -- but all the ladies leave tonight for Br -- except a young Miss --
     we were very sorry to leave Mr. Rude's <unclear>we</unclear> have had a nice time there Col.
      <unclear>Prestore</unclear> of the Institute is here now &amp; starts back tomorrow -- he
     intends to ask Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> to let me go alone, &amp; so come by
     Union, but I do not know what the <pb n="3"/> result of it may be, so I will write -- we are
     coming up so near that I am sure I shall get home before long -- on some excuse or other --</p>
    <p> I send a paper to Nelson and he will send it for you to see. I am so weary that you must
     excuse me -- for I have been in the saddle nearly all day and want to go to sleep -- and rest
     some before another start -- for we many have to travel during the night -- Jackson is very
     cautious and I do not think he will be caught napping -- I board with the staff and so do not
     need any provisions <orig reg="as">a</orig> yet. <orig reg="Though">Tho'</orig> I intend to
     board myself soon --</p>
    <p> Send this up so they may see it at the upper house</p>
    <p> God bless you all </p>
