                <p>Alexander McClure provides Thaddeus Stevens with details as to Lincoln's
                    appointments, saying that Cameron's appointment as Secretary of War seems

                <p>The Cameron men are somewhat <hi rend="underline">revived</hi>
                    <orig reg="today">to-day</orig>, and in their own confidential circles (to which
                    I have full access) they speak of his ultimate selection for <abbr
                        expan="Secretary">Secy</abbr> of War as probable. They have nothing
                    tangible; but that they are hopeful, there can be no doubt. Add to this the fact
                    that a well informed friend writes me from <abbr expan="Philadelphia"
                    >Phila</abbr> that renewed efforts are being made to keep Cameron in. Is he
                    playing a feint on you? Write me.</p>

                <p>Curtin has done his full <abbr expan="amount">amt.</abbr> to keep him out-- has
                    sent a crushing protest two weeks ago, which I think Lincoln cannot disregard.
                    He is not naturally for you; but assured Mann &amp; myself last night that
                    he <pb n="2"/> would join cordially in asking it of the Congressional
                    delegation, with <orig reg="Cameron's">Camerons</orig> cooperation, would move
                    with reasonable unanimity. He does not of course wish to move unless he can give
                    success to the effort. <hi rend="underline">He is right</hi>, &amp; we are
                    all about him now. He had been led to believe that you were <hi rend="underline"
                        >personally</hi> unfriendly to him at the time of the nomination was made;
                    but the assurances from him by Mann Slifer &amp; myself as to your active
                    cooperation with the State organization last summer when Cameron was seeking to
                    destroy it, dissipated his objections. He will move in exactly the right way
                    whenever he feels assured that the <abbr expan="Congressional">Con</abbr>
                    delegation have moved with <orig reg="Cameron's">Camerons</orig>
                    <unclear>approbation</unclear>. He of course understands that with Cameron at
                    war with the effort, it <pb n="3"/> would likely fail: for if Cameron were to
                    give the order for an attack, every friend he has would write Lincoln protesting
                    on every possible ground.</p>

                <p>I wish Hale would write either Curtin or myself stating that the delegation had
                    moved and suggesting that the administration can settle the matter. Can you have
                    that done. In the face of daily rumors that Cameron is still hoping &amp;
                    laboring, Curtin will hesitate about acting, lest Cameron should betray him into
                    an effort &amp; then defeat it. You see how it is.</p>

                <p>Our men in the legislature are hanging back hoping to get the Cameron men to lead
                    off, so as to get it unanimously. At noon today <unclear>Hustain</unclear> had
                    no reply <pb n="4"/> from Washington. Everything is set right here; only let
                    Washington start the thing properly. I have had a correspondence with Greeley
                    &amp; Sam Allen, assuring them that the administration would second the
                    movement in your favor.</p>

                <p>You can show this to any trusted friend who may need its statements to act
                    intelligently</p>
