    <p>Yours of the 23<hi rend="super">rd</hi> was <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> last evening
     late &amp; gave me some hope of Nelly's recovery, as she lingers on so well -- I gave up
     all hopes of hearing of her alive after your first letter that I <abbr expan="received"
     >recd.</abbr> We stood all day yesterday at the narrow passage waiting for the enemy to come
     up, but Ashby drove them back &amp; so we fell back to near Mt. Jackson -- the train was
     very long &amp; it was 5 o'clock when we started &amp; it was late when we got there
     back -- I got your letter after dark -- There are many that want furloughs to go home, but all
     are refused -- I have come up to town to ask for one by the influence of Col. Baylor but it
     will have to go to Woodstock for the Gen's Approval &amp; I am in poor hopes of his
     approving it as he wants troops so badly &amp; Baylor trusts the <orig reg="Battalion"
      >Battallion</orig> to me more than the other officers. We are poorly provided with tents
     &amp; cooking utensils but have guns enough The battle of Sunday last was one of the
     hardest yet -- the enemy had 25000 &amp; we 2500 engaged -- <pb n="2"/> our loss is not
     nearly as great as reported &amp; many of our men are still coming in -- we took 10
     prisoners -- Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> says he accomplished all he expected by his
     move I am in good health <orig reg="though">tho</orig> I have a little cold. Do not look for me
     though I will come if I can -- If our darling Nelly should die have her buried at Union -- but
     God grant she may be spared to us --</p>
    <p> I have but a moment to write &amp; must close -- Good bye. My love to all -- God bless
     the kind friends that aid you </p>
