     <salute>My Dear Sara:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>Your letter of the 12<hi rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">th</hi>
     </hi> came to me yesterday &amp; made my blood boil to be at home for one short hour to
     visit vengeance on the coward Jordan who meanly avails himself of my absence to torment women
     &amp; children -- I earnestly pray that you may all be spared from home &amp; if I can
     ever get home I know you will never be exposed to it again from him -- I could not sleep for
     thinking of it -- I hope you made complaint &amp; had him put under bonds for himself
     &amp; family -- the magistrates are bound to see to it -- tell Dr. Hamilton &amp; ask
     him for me to say to Jordan that I hold him responsible for his own conduct &amp; that of
     his children exactly as I promised him &amp; it will as surely so happen <pb n="2"/>as my
     return unless he behaves &amp; makes all about him do so -- I will not tolerate such doings
     &amp; if there is not a civil law to make him do properly I will let him know that there is
     a <orig reg="soldier's">soldiers</orig> law that <hi rend="underline">will</hi>. Be sure to
     join Mrs Wise in a demand on the Magistrates to have him bound over for the present -- I will
     bind him when I get home.</p>
    <p> We came back here day before yesterday -- the enemy was advancing on too many roads to
     enable us to manage them well while out in the wide Valley, so we came here where the Valley is
     narrow to fight them if they desire, but they do not show much disposition to do so &amp;
     tomorrow we start for Winchester again having rested two days -- Our cavalry drove<pb n="3"
     />the Yanks from Newtown to Kernstown today &amp; captured some stores. The day we fell
     back here one of our Divisions, under Ramseur was sent to Winchester to act as guard, while we
     removed everything -- Vaughan who had command of the Cavalry there reported a small force of
     the enemy in front &amp; induced Gen. Ramseur to go out to capture it -- he did so,
     contrary to his orders, and went out without proper precaution &amp; ran into a large force
     of the enemy, &amp; in attempting to form his line of battle under fire, two N. C.
     regiments broke &amp; ran &amp; the others followed suit, the <orig reg="Yankees"
      >Yankes</orig> capturing four pieces of artillery in the disgraceful stampede -- a few men
     checked the pursuit of the enemy &amp; our loss<pb n="4"/>in all was about 400 -- Gen.
     Lilley was among the wounded &amp; captured &amp; young Ridgely <orig reg="whom"
     >whome</orig> we all thought much of -- a brother of Capt. Calloway was also badly wounded --</p>
    <p> I hope you have had rain before this -- the county here is very dry &amp; we have not
     been rained on to wet us since we left Richmond I do not know how for we may go, but we <hi
      rend="underline">owe</hi> the Yanks a whipping for getting our guns. I wrote you the full
     particulars about the bundle I sent up -- You can send to Maj. Bell's after it -- I fear the
     Calico will not suit you -- it was bought for me by another -- I had no chance to buy --
     &amp; I do not think it very pretty, but you can exchange or something -- any way it is
     good to have it when we think of the prices to which things are going -- I ought to have kept
     some <abbr expan="handkerchiefs">hdkfs.</abbr> -- Anna shall have her shoes if I can find them,
     the dear little one shall not be neglected -- I think much of you all &amp; only wish I
     could do more for you -- All be of good cheer &amp; keep in good heart -- trusting in our
     Merciful God to do good to us &amp; to our country </p>
    <p> Good bye -- write often Love fore Anne &amp; Nelly -- </p>
