                <p>I had the good fortune to spend several weeks at Harisburg one year ago last
                    winter, during that long, tedious but unsuccessful effort to elect a United
                    States Senator. I had also the pleasure of making your acquaintance. And ever
                    since I have been anxious to see you elected. I believe if things are managed
                    right, and the foundation laid now, you could get the votes of all of our
                    members. A young Democratic American of this country named A. N. Rankin <abbr
                        expan="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was introduced to you by <abbr expan="Major"
                        >Maj.</abbr>
                    <unclear>Boser</unclear> who was several years also a member of the lower
                        <unclear>house</unclear>.<pb n="2"/>Mr Rankin is chairman of the Executive
                    Committee of our County. I have talked him into being quite a friend of yours.
                    He is also one of the owners and publishers of our County Anti Buchanan
                    Newspaper. And one of his partners Washington Crooks was put in nomination for
                    the State Senate from this District yesterday. He had also great influence with
                    the 2 candidates for Assembly. Write him a letter about politics generally, it
                    will please him. But you must keep this in <hi rend="underline">confidence</hi>
                    for if he was to find out that you were solicited to write to him, it would
                    spoil all.</p>
