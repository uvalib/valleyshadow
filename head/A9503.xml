                </opener>

                <p>Your kind communication of March 1862 came to hand by due course of mail. I would
                    reply Phonographically but I don't feel that I have the time and patience for it
                    this evening. I am always glad to hear from you but I am particularly glad to
                    learn of your matrimonial prospects progressing to a sweet and happy fruition. I
                    should most heartily second your good wishes and advice to myself upon the same
                    subject but for insuperable difficulties that lie in my way at the present time.</p>

                <p>The one is that I have no lady "courted" like yourself and another difficulty
                    with me just at this time is that the unnatural and detestable war will have to
                    be fought through before I can allow my cranium to be besieged with connubial
                    thoughts. If you are already married please allow your humble and more <pb n="2"
                    />unfortunate cousin and correspondent to wish you many good things which I
                    shall not attempt to specify as well as take considerable pleasure to himself in
                    knowing that he has one more cousin whom he has never seen.</p>

                <p>I am sorry, <abbr expan="Cousin">Cous.</abbr> James, to inform you that we have
                    the enemy so near us at the present time that nearly all our enjoyments are
                    marred. The nearest that they have been was at Mt Crawford on Friday of last
                    week. Some four or five hundred of Yankee cavalry were there that day and all
                    that prevented them from coming farther up the road was the <orig
                        reg="impracticability">inpracticability</orig> of fording the river which
                    has been quite flush for a week or more past, owing to the excessive rains and
                    snow yet remaining in the mountains. The two bridges at Mt Crawford and the one
                    at Bridgewater, by order of General Jackson, were burned on the Tuesday (22nd)
                    preceding.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Jackson at present has his army not far from
                    McGaheysville. <abbr expan="Brother">Bro.</abbr> John belongs to that division
                    of the army. <abbr expan="Brother">Bro.</abbr> Albert belongs to <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Joseph E. <orig reg="Johnston's"
                    >Johnson's</orig> army at Yorktown. <pb n="3"/><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    B. Johnson's army -- the division to which your brother Daniel is attached is at
                    present located at the village of West View in this county about six miles <abbr
                        expan="Southwest">S.W.</abbr> of Staunton.</p>

                <p>So you see the <abbr expan="Confederate">Conf.</abbr> territory of the Valley at
                    present is pretty small. The people are a good deal excited and there is no
                    business enterprise scarcely in the whole county.</p>

                <p>There has been so much rain this Spring that farmers have been scarcely able to
                    plow their ground and as yet I know not of an acre of ground planted in corn in
                    this whole county. Should the season be farmable from this time out I think that
                    there will be nothing like half the usual <abbr expan="amount">amt.</abbr> of
                    corn planted. The wheat is as promising as could be wished and there will be a
                    bountiful harvest from present prospects, particularly if it becomes a little
                    dry during the month of May.</p>

                <p>I leave for the army in a day or two. I have joined an Artillery Company and will
                    meet my Company in Richmond.</p>

                <pb n="4"/>
                <p>We have no regular Mail now nearer than Staunton. The mail at M<hi rend="super"
                    >t</hi> Sidney is exchanged occasionally by persons passing backwards and
                    forwards.</p>

                <p>I tell you we are in a smart hubbub - in a pretty bad "old fix", just now in the
                    Valley. I hope and pray that our arms may be successful at Yorktown. That battle
                    when ever it does come off I think will decide the fate of the Valley indeed of
                    Richmond and of entire <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> and if we are successful
                    I think will be the decisive one of the war.</p>

                <p>A great deal of the live stock of the Valley has been run across the mountains
                    into <abbr expan="Eastern">E</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> in the last two weeks or more.</p>

                <p>I am afraid that we will not be able to recover from the effects of this
                    destructive war for a long time. Religious, moral and educational institutions
                    are at a very low ebb and it will take us a long time to catch up again.</p>

                <p>I am afraid that my <orig reg="prospective">perspected</orig> scheme for life
                    will be spoiled even should I be spared through the war. I pray that God may
                    direct us both and spare us into life eternal for our dear Redeemer's sake.
                    Please let me have an interest in your daily devotions. If you find it
                    practicable and convenient write to me at Richmond in care of <abbr
