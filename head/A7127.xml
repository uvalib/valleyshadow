<p>In an informal report to E. P. Smith, Scott comments on his continuing feud with the black pastor of the local Methodist church, complaining that "the ignorant minister with zeal not according to knowledge still keeps his noisy meetings over the heads of the night school."</p>

<p>I this day read a few little Primary leaves for beginners;  I suppose these are to be used until the <hi rend="underline">immortal Saunders Greenback Primer</hi> has time to reach me  I am obliged for your good intentions but the papers are not worth much, as they are not exhaustive enough in their plan for these children, who can advance only at an easy grade, and not by such abrupt steps as are contemplated by the author of these well meaning sheets  For instance they commense with the Alphabet and by three or four leaves they advance to words of three or four letters; a progress that can only be made in the imagination of the author</p>
	<p>The Saunders Primer is as concise and terse, as a well adapted <del hand="h1">and <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></del> construction will admit  Still more brief works might be made, but the laws of the infant mind will not easily admit of their use within a certain limit  I believe it takes more judgement to make a Primmer than an Algebra.</p>
	<p>I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> therefore that you have not intended to substitute these papers for the regular Primmer.</p>
	<p>My school has gone up already to<pb n="2"/> 100 pupils--"and still they come"</p>
	<p>My colored assistant will come tomorrow but these people need something better.</p>
	<p>The ignorant minister with zeal not according to knowledge still keeps his noisy meetings over the heads of the night school but I think they will soon die away.</p>
	<p>I hope the Lord will over-rule these opposing influences so as to open a way for school purposes and I believe he will</p>
	<p>People are begging me every where for a chance to come to school at night where they will not be annoyed by this religious meeting</p>
	<p>21 spoiled the school last year  I shall bend all my energies to overcome all obstacles  If I supposed you had not filled my order and sent--, I should ask for more Primary Arith--a couple of doz.</p>
	<p>I hope also that you have not failed to send me the <hi rend="underline">clock</hi> presented by Mr. Hine of no 3 Courtland St.</p>
	<p>Bro. Beals always used to say that the Mission House was entitled to the New York 'Tribune' or "Independent"  If that be the case I would like to avail myself of the use of that privelege and obtain the Tribune, at least for myself and to hang in the school-room</p>
