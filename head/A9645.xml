                    >wellcomed</orig> letter last week &amp; was glad to hear from you. My
                    health is very good at present &amp; hope <orig reg="these">theese</orig>
                    <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. We
                    have had <orig reg="another">annother</orig> very hard battle on the ninth of
                    this month. I suppose you have <orig reg="heard">hurd</orig> the <orig
                        reg="particulars">perticulars</orig> before this. Brother John was slightly
                    wounded in the early part of the engagement. Charles was hurt in the hand with
                    his ramrod while loading his gun <orig reg="they">thay</orig>
                    <orig reg="were">ware</orig> both sent to the hospital at <orig
                        reg="Charlottesville">Sharlottesvill</orig> our <pb n="2"/> loss was
                    estimated at six hundred killed &amp; wounded. The <orig reg="enemy's"
                        >enimies</orig> at three thousand. Our Brigade <orig reg="received"
                    >recieved</orig> a <orig reg="great">grate</orig> deal of praise for its <orig

                        >sertainly</orig> did act nobly your Brother was not very well and was
                    excused by the <orig reg="Surgeon">Sergeon</orig> &amp; stayed back with the
                        <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, he did not have the good luck of being in
                    the fight he has got right well again &amp; I hope his health may continue
                    to be good for we all miss him when he is sick or absent. We captured four or
                    five hundred prisoners &amp; two pieces of <orig reg="cannon">canon</orig>.</p>

                <p>I was glad to hear Mr Burkholder health was <orig reg="improving"
                    >improveing</orig> &amp; hope he may soon <orig reg="recover"

                    remember but it has been a long time since I wrote it, &amp; if you <orig

                    Lizzie the Sunday I left it was late when I got to Greenville &amp; I went
                    down to Mr. Burk &amp; then to Mr. Newton's and by that time <del hand="h1"
                    /> was out. Orders just come for us to cook two days rations I suppose we will
                        <orig reg="have to">hafto</orig> march to morrow. General Lee was at
                    gordonsville to day. Yesterday was <orig reg="thanksgiving">thanksgive</orig>
                    day in our Army for the Merciful kindness God showed towards us in the battle of
                        <orig reg="Cedar">Ceder</orig> Creek. I hope the God of battles may <pb
                        n="4"/> still crown us with <orig reg="success">sucksess</orig> in future
                    engagements. I would like very much to be up in Augusta now &amp; go<del
                        hand="h1">s</del> a whirtleberrying. I know I could have a <orig reg="great"
                        >grate</orig> deal of pleasure. I suppose Sam Fitch has been down a half
                    dozen times by this time. Me and Sam are not as intimate as we was once he
                    treated me very kindly when I was at home he has a smooth tongue &amp; seems
                    to be a real ladies man. Dear Kate I have nothing to write that will <orig

                    must not <orig reg="expect">exspect</orig> one from me my friend J.V. sends a
