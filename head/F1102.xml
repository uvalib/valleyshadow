                <p>The handwriting in this letter is not clear, but the images are vivid. McClaws
                    describes marching through enemy territory in Virginia, remarking upon the
                    hiding inhabitants as well as the physical destruction. He recounts his
                    encounters with people, conveying the tension between occupying soldiers and
                    residents. McLaws mentions that many townspeople in Chambersburg fiercely oppose
                    abolition and President Lincoln, even as they hope for peace. McLaws also
                    mentions that the mail is being read by outsiders, because the mail carriers are
                    repeatedly captured.</p>

                    Faulkner had not long since returned from Washington, and on the evening Our

                    <unclear>have</unclear> issued tickets for a large party to be given to the
                    Yankee Officers. The daughters were also constantly visiting the Yankee families
                    and were being visited by them and the Yankee officers generally, and that the
                    greater cordiality existed between them. The farms we saw lying in waste were
                    those of Southern families who were not so devoted to Yankeedom. There was no
                        <unclear>real</unclear> cause given as in Martinsburg, except by very few
                    and those of the ladies who exhibited any cordiality I noticed were clothed in
                    silks and de<del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp; muslins, and all the finery of a thriving
                    Yankee town. Many women &amp; children made faces at us as we marched along,
                    and although we could not hear them, we could see their mouths moving, and from
                    their expressions<pb n="3"/> knew they were giving us their
                    <unclear>Valediction</unclear>. As we <unclear>crowd</unclear> into
                    Williamsport, the people were more friendly, but yet all the Shops were closed
                    and the houses generally deserted or exhibiting no signs of being inhabited. One
                    lady said she was delighted to see us. shook hands very cordially, said she
                    expected to be sent across the river if the enemy should ever return, but did
                    not care. Shortly after I went to the window to get some water and seeing a boy
                    of nine or ten in the room with the blue blouse of a Yankee, I said "you are a
                    Yankee <unclear>and</unclear> the boy said nothing but held down his head's. the

                    loudly and tell him you are no Yankee. "Yes but I am one" answered the boy. and
                    I remarked "Children take their opinions from their older sisters &amp;

                    them as I then had in my mind the contrast between the Southern gentleman and
                    ladies and the very different species I have encountered. as I crossed the line
                    into Pennsylvania. At Green Castle on the road to Chambersburg, Several young
                    ladies were assembled engaged in scoffing at our men as they passed but they
                    were treated with contempt or derision. I heard of nothing witty said by any of
                    them. It was made evident however that they were not ladies in the Southern
                    acceptations of the word. The men I spoke to, acknowledged that the brutalities

                    people, fully justified our retaliating and were surprised at our moderation.
                    The poorer classes told me that our troops behaved better to them than their own
                    did. Arrived, <del hand="h1">but</del> &amp; marched through Chambersburg on

                    begin to believe that they have been vastly deceived by engaging in it. I have
