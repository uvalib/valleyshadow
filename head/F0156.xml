    <p>Friend George I suppose you will be surprised when you find this letter is from your old
     friend Sam Pile, well <orig reg="it's">its</orig> a fact. I am still alive and well, I suppose
     you wonder how in the devil I come to be all the way here in Virginia. I can tell you that best
     another time.</p>

    <p>I hear that you are still at your old business, making <orig reg="ledgers">legars</orig>,
     setting rabbit looops and fishing, take my advice and stick <orig reg="to">too</orig> it, for
     it is a darned sight better than <orig reg="soldiering">soldering</orig>, that is in the wrong
     cause.</p>

    <p>Well George I've been knocking about this Southern Confederacy considerably since I wrote to
     you last.<pb n="2"/> and a devil of a time I've had I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know where
     I will strike to next, the next time you hear from me I will tell you something it would not
     pay to tell it at the present time. George I hear that Al Weiser is dead, poor Natty we have
     had many a gay time together The 87 Rgt P.V. is now at this place. I was somewhat surprised
     when I found it out, I was mighty glad to see many of my old friends, and to hear from old York
     for it has been a long while since I heard from there last</p>

    <p>I want you to write me a long, long, letter, as soon as you get this and tell me what you
     have been doing for the last two years. direct your letter to Miss Maggie Burnett Winchester
     Va. now I know<pb n="3"/> you will wonder what that means, it means I will be more likely to
     get it if addressed to a lady, <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> fail to write. Whisky is a scarce
     article in this part of the world, only eight dollars a quart for stuff that would burn the
     hair off a dog, when you write pour some on the paper then <orig reg="maybe">mabe</orig> I will
     get a smell. If you see any of my folks tell them you heard from me. If you can send me some
     York papers, to the same address. </p>

    <p>Give my respects to all <orig reg="inquiring">enquiring</orig> friends, be a good democrat
     and hate abolitionists and you will stand a good chance in the next world.</p>
