                <p>I have taken the <orig reg="present">presant</orig> opportunity of <del hand="h1"
                        >writing</del> time, to write you a <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> lines for
                    the purpose of answering your last letter which I <orig reg="received"
                    >recieved</orig> a <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> days since. You wrote as if I was
                    trifling with your good nature. I would rather fall in the cause of our country
                    than to blindfold you in any way. You <orig reg="were">ware</orig> mistaken in
                    seeing a letter of mine to Miss Hiss as you stated. I <orig reg="recollect"
                        >recolect</orig> well at the last of my letter to her I had.- <hi
                        rend="underline">from your</hi> devoted friend and if you <orig reg="don't"
                        >do'nt</orig> believe me I only ask you to look at it again none <pb n="2"/>
                    but Sam Fitch <orig reg="knew">new</orig> my motive in writing her that letter
                    it was for his <orig reg="benefit">benifit</orig> she had lost confidence in
                    him, on account of some lies that had been told on him about her. <orig
                        reg="She">Shee</orig> wrote to me stating that I was in <orig reg="Sam's"
                        >Sams</orig>
                    <orig reg="presence">presance</orig> when he talked about her. She said that if
                    the things <orig reg="were">ware</orig> true she was done with Sam for ever. It
                    was all a lie that some of his <orig reg="enemies">enimies</orig> had
                        <unclear>made</unclear> on him, through <orig reg="Sam's">Sams</orig>
                    persuasion I tried to write a forcible letter for I <orig reg="knew">new</orig>
                    that Sam still loved her. &amp; I am <orig reg="certain">sertain</orig> that
                    she once loved him. I suppose if she was my devoted lover I would have written
                    to her since <orig reg="which">wich</orig> I have never done. Very <orig
                        reg="probably">proberably</orig> this will <pb n="3"/> be hard to believe
                        <orig reg="but">put</orig> it is <orig reg="even">eaven</orig> so; your
                    advice is good but in no way. I <orig reg="don't">do'nt</orig> think that I have
                    tried to fool any one &amp; God forbid that I should. I have had <del
                        hand="h1"/> blues ever since I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> letter. I used to think that <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> nature was <orig

                    alas it is far from it.</p>

                <p><orig reg="There">Thare</orig> are no news of importance to write. Our <orig

                    week. I could see the dome of the <orig reg="Capitol">Capital</orig> in
                    Washington City on masons hill I could see vessels going up and down the Potomac
                    at Alexandria. I could see the Yankee fortifications to the right of Alexandria.
                    I <orig reg="couldn't">couldent</orig> get to look through <pb n="4"/> the spy
                    glass. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> said he could see the Yankees working

                    three days it was very rainy weather. We had <orig reg="plenty">blenty</orig> of
