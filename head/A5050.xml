                <p>Charles Baylor writes to his sister Mary about smallpox in the valley, the high
                    cost of food in camp, and an impending battle. He mentions the death of their
                    brother, George, who was killed in the battle of Cedar Creek a few months
                    before. He also mentions writing to his wife, Mary E. Baylor.</p>

                <p>It was with pleasure that I received &amp; perused your kind and Affectionate
                    letter. John &amp; myself have been looking for some time for a letter from
                    some of you all but as often disappointed we had heard that the smallpox was in
                    Zimmermans family but could get no letter from home. I am sorry that it is no
                    worse than it is, though bad enough as it is, I hope they will all an easy time
                    with them. I believe they are right bad in Winchester but as yet there has not
                    been any cases in our brigade as I know of. hope they wont get among us or we
                    will be in a bad fix.</p>

                <p>We are all well at this time but expecting a big fight most any day. We are
                    moving our camp every two or three days up the <orig reg="Valley">Vallie</orig>
                    from six to ten miles up the Mountain on the West side of the Shenandoah river,
                    &amp; they on the other side of the Mountain <orig reg="moving"
                    >moveing</orig> up, so I expect we will come together some of these days before
                    long, it seems like nothing else will do them (Yankees) but fight so I hope if
                    we do have to fight them that we will be able to give them a worse <orig
                        reg="whipping">whiping</orig> than we have ever done yet if that can be
                    possible but we must trust in our God for the issue. Well Mary it is getting a
                    little cold down here in Camp and some of our boys have not got a blanket to
                    sleep in under &amp; not as much as an overcoat how do you like that way of
                    doing, you all at home don't know what we have to go through &amp; yet we
                    are more lively here than you all are at home, we don't draw anything from the
                    commisary now but <orig reg="flour">flower</orig> &amp; Beef we don't get so
                    much as soap anymore we have to <orig reg="buy">buye</orig> all of our soap and
                    pay from 50 <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> to a $1.00 per pound, and can hardly
                    get it at that. In fact we can hardly get anything in the neighborhood. Potatoes
                    are selling in Winchester at $8.00 per bushel, what do you think of that. If Mr.
                    Grove comes down you all must send me some potatoes &amp; apples if you have
                    them, or anything else that you have, for we can't get anything here. Yes we did
                        <orig reg="buy">bye</orig> some pork yesterday at 35 <abbr expan="cents"
                    >cts</abbr> per pound, but that is most to <unclear>diggin</unclear> on a poor
                    Soldiers pocket book these hard times.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>Mary, you Lizzie <unclear>Est</unclear> must write to me some times as we have no
                    dear brother George now, for you to write <orig reg="to">too</orig>. if I don't
                    answer them you must not think hard of it, for it is not every day that I get a
                    chance to write, &amp; then you must remember that I have somebody else that
                    I like to write, though she accuses me for not writing &amp; I write or have
                    written two since I received any from her.</p>

                <p>You all will be in a bad fix for riding horses if you <orig reg="lose">loose</orig>
                    <unclear>Coly</unclear> &amp; <unclear>Pet</unclear> then there will be but
                    one work horse on the place. I don't see how they all will get along with their
                    work this fall, father will have to <orig reg="buy">by</orig> some horses wont
                        <orig reg="he">hee</orig>. Well I must bring my letter to a close for I want
                    to write a few lines to Mary E. Baylor if you know if you know such a lady if
                    you don't I do &amp; would like very much to see her.</p>

                <p>Good Bye May God bless &amp; Protect you all is the humble prayer of</p>
