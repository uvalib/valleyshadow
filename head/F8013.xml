                    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I should have written you sooner, with the <unclear>view</unclear> to
                    congratulate you, upon the cordiality with which your nomination has been
                    responded to throughout the country and the abundant
                    <unclear>assurances</unclear> of final success heard from all quarters, but have
                    waited until, I had seen enough of my friends in different parts of our own
                    state to form a positive opinion of the election here, in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>I can now do so and am glad to say that you will<pb n="2"/>get the state beyond
                    the shadow of a doubt. Your friends need give themselves no trouble about us;
                    and may occupy their time in making Illinois &amp; Indiana safe. We need no
                    help here, <hi rend="underline">of any kind.</hi> The state is for you, and we
                    all have faith in your good intentions to stand by her interests as they are
                    connected with her coal and now beyond which we have no desires.</p>
                <p>My young friend, Mr. <unclear>Lesley</unclear> told me you had shown him your
                    notes of speeches made in 1844, on the subject of protection, and his account of
                    them gratifies all of us, very much.</p>
                <p>We shall elect our <unclear>Gov</unclear> M Curtin, by a handsome majority,<pb
                        n="3"/>but by no means as large a one as you will get in <abbr
                        expan="November">Nov</abbr>.</p>
                <p>I only regret that our opponents are not united. for we would have beaten their
                    great man Douglas with all <orig reg="their">there</orig> forces concentrated,
                    and would <unclear>thus be word</unclear> a context <unclear>hereoften</unclear>
                    when they will unite on him or <unclear>worse</unclear> other single candidate.
                    His friends and those of Breckenridge, are now more bitter against each other
                    than they are against us and I fear that after the elections they will try to
                    ascribe their defeat &amp; our victory solely to their divisions. We will
                    try to keep this <unclear>never</unclear> from them by making your majority a
                    very large one.</p>
                <p>I regret that Pennsylv<pb n="4"/>is a safe.--as much so as Massachusetts or
                    Michigan, and I hope our friends in other states will give all their attention
                    to Illinois &amp; Indiana. Your friends here will be responsible for
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
