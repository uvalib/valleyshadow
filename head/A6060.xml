    <p>You have no doubt come to the conclusion that I have forgotten you as I have not written to
     you sooner <hi rend="underline">but not so my good Cousin</hi>. Your letter was written the
     27th of June came to NewPort &amp; has lain there until yesterday. I was glad to <orig
      reg="receive">recieve</orig> one more letter from my good but absent Cousin. I should like
     very much indeed to hear from you all this evening but was sadly disappointed that I did not
      <orig reg="receive">recieve</orig> a letter from some of you all <orig reg="today"
     >to-day</orig>. S H Runnels &amp; John M<hi rend="super">c</hi>K both owe me letters. <del
      hand="h1">but</del> perhaps they have forgotten I am yet alive. You can tell them I am still
     alive &amp; well. they need not think<pb n="2" entity="Smiley29b" pid="uva-lib:503178"/>
      the Republicans have advanced so far as this already. but we dont
     know how soon we may see them perhaps they will have an army around one of these days
     compelling us to take the oaths of allegiance as one of your company did. but I tell you if I
     ever take the oath it will not be binding as I never will consent only to save my life. We are
     all well &amp; getting along very well only we are very much excited about war. We hear
     very little news about anything else &amp; to tell you the truth we <orig reg="don't "
     >dont</orig> feel much interested on any other subject. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> anyhow
     Cousin Thomas I heard you were ill but dont know whether it is really true. Your Ma &amp;
     Pa have been very uneasy about you as they have not heard from you for some time unless they
     would get a letter <orig reg="today">to-day</orig>. Ma spent the day at your Pa's one day this
     week found them all well. Your relations in this neighborhood were all well yesterday I suppose
     you have been in an engagement with those notorious Republicans<pb n="3" entity="Smiley29c" pid="uva-lib:503179"/>
      that is if you were not sick. We have heard so many results from
     the battle that we scarcely know which one to believe. But if I was a man I would take none of
     the <hi rend="underline">Negro Lovers</hi> prisoners I would do my best to kill the last one of
     them. The Newport Militia have lost their <hi rend="underline">little Union Captain</hi> the
     oath was administered to the company yesterday and he &amp; Mr Spacy refused to take it so
      <orig reg="they">the</orig> threw him out of office &amp; elected <abbr expan="Captain"
      >Capt</abbr> I H Hite in his place. I think it was well done as I never would have mustered
     under a Union man as long as they have done. He said he would remain their <abbr
      expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> if they wished but if he was called to battle he never <hi
      rend="underline">could fire</hi> I think he &amp; the rest of the Hutchen clan had better
     go &amp; be under Lincolns or some other Yankees control awhile</p>
    <p>I suppose friend Beard is looking to tomorrow with feelings of sadness as that is the day
      <orig reg="appointed">apponted</orig> for him to leave home. He spent the day here last<pb
       n="4" entity="Smiley29d"/>
      Friday had a great deal of pleasure with him he is quite an
     entertaining young man. You can tell him I say I have fallen in love with him since he came
     home &amp; am sorry very sorry he has to leave I think he has improved considerable since
     he left home I told him I thought he had grown better. John R Berry seems quite well now at
     least he looks so &amp; has been working ever since harvest began he has not been visiting
     much since he came home I am afraid he will get out of the way of visiting if he <orig
      reg="don't">dont</orig> follow it up more closely Cousin Tom you spoke in your last letter to
     me about friend Baxter you said he was often talking of the pleasant times he had spent with me
     last winter I am glad to know that they were pleasant times I did in fact spend some <del
      hand="h1">as</del> pleasant times with him enjoyed myself as well with him as I ever did with
     any one. You can tell him so. I am as ever one of his friends. I want to know if either you or
     Baxter ever engage in any plays that you have to stoop to let the girls put their arms round
     you. I have often laughed at how you all had to do but I tell you I like to see tall men if
     they do have to stoop occasionally to accomodate the girls. I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig>
     bear to see a little bit of a man you know we have several of them about here Cousin Tom I must
     close as it is now getting dark &amp; I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> see the lines When
     you see my friend Baxter Please present<pb n="1" entity="Smiley29" pid="uva-lib:503177"/>
     my good wishes tell him Miss Harriet is not at home yet I suppose
     he knows more about her than I do as I imagine he writes &amp; <orig reg="receives"
      >recieves</orig> letters from her frequently My best love to <abbr expan="Lieutenant"
