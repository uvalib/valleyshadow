                <p>As you see by the heading I have arrived at the regiment safe and sound. My
                    health is still improving. I wish Bell was improving as well. Write as soon as
                    you get this &amp; let me know how she is getting. I felt more uneasiness
                    about her since leaving home than I did when there &amp; am sorry that I did
                    not do more for her, but still I hope she will get well to welcome me home again
                    if my life is spared to get there. The Infantry here had built very nice
                    quarters &amp; were moved away, so when I got here I found the boys snugly
                    fixed. The Doctor has a good stone fireplace &amp; a slab or puncheon floor
                    in his tent making it very comfortable. He has a bunk built up &amp; covered
                    with hay. I will tell you in the morning how good a bed it is.</p>

                <p>I left the next morning after I got to fathers. Got in Washington City yesterday
                    evening about six <orig reg="o'clock">oclock</orig>. Got on the cars again this
                    morning at nine &amp; got here about two &amp; a half. I gave <abbr
                        expan="William">Wm.</abbr> Potter his boots. He has not called for his
                    bundle yet. I will see George McDavid &amp; him in the morning.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="January">Jan.</abbr> 3<hi rend="super">d</hi> Well I must tell you
                    about the bed &amp; I must tell you I had a good <orig reg="night's">nights
                    </orig>rest, warm &amp; comfortable. Still it is not a feather bed. George
                    McDavid is looking well this morning. His brother Dan was here while I was at
                    home. Will Potter has his boots on &amp; is very much pleased with them.
                    Will Carrol is still stout with the exception of a slight <orig reg="diarrhea"
                        >diarrhoea</orig>. As a general thing the health is good here.</p>

                <p>I got a letter from David that Elisa wrote before I arrived home. She says that
                    David would be helped if he would be caught out in the draft all alone. The
                    regiment is out at this time on a raid, the Doctor &amp; sick &amp;
                    those who have not good horses remaining in camp. I wish you to write soon
                    &amp; let me know how Bell is getting. I would like so much to hear of her
                    getting well.</p>

                <p>Josey has not learned to play Yankee Doodle on his drum. Lucy &amp; Bell will
                    soon learn to read on their cards &amp; they must take good care of them so
                    that Jimmy can have the use of them. I must write to Dave soon. I have nothing
                    more at present but remain </p>
