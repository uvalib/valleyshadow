                <p>I received your affectionate letter a few moment since and I now hasten to answer
                    that long looked for epistle I am happy my dear cousin to say that your letter
                    found me in much better spirits than when you left I feel almost as happy and
                    contented as I ever did &amp; have been convinced that my imagination was
                    all nonsense and I have also been convinced of my sin in allowing myself to
                    indulge in such wicked thoughts but I shall try to be better in future.</p>
                <pb n="2"/>
                <p>I was very sorry that Mr. McCue could not find time to come up to see me but he
                    is very excusable for I expected at the time that he could not leave his
                    business you must give my love to him and tell him that he must write to me. You
                    asked me if I missed you much yes indeed that I do miss you I sometimes think
                    that I cannot get along without you but I trust my sweet cousin that we will
                    soon meet again and be happy once more.</p>
                <p>I went to see Mrs Mcclung and enjoyed myself very much she would make me eat some
                    cake that she had they were very nice she said when Miss Mattie came she
                    intended to send for me to spend the day, I have also been invited twice over<pb
                        n="3"/>at <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Baldwins but I could not go the
                    first time on account of the weather and I was taken with the measles and I have
                    not been out of the house since I only wish you could have seen me my face was
                    as red and bumpy as possible &amp; I was the ugliest <hi rend="underline"
                        >mortal</hi> that you ever beheld the eruption has not left me yet but I
                    hope to be able to go down to school on monday I went down to the table
                    yesterday for the first time for two weeks you cannot imagine how glad I was to
                    get out of my room once more.</p>
                <p>We have had nothing scarcely but rain ever since you left but the trees are all
                    blooming and every thing looks very fresh and pretty I often wish that I could
                    be at Pleasant Grove with<pb n="4"/>you and the children and hear the birds
                    sing. you must give my ablest love to the boy and tell them to write to me you
                    must kiss the little baby X Lisa X <unclear/> a great many times for me and tell
                    <unclear/> that her cousin Aurelia wants to see her very badly too and I hope it
                    will not be long before I will have that pleasure.</p>
                <p>You spoke dear cousin of my flat it did not make the slightest difference for I
                    can with the greatest difficulty get along without it until you return. But my
                    sweet cousin I must close give my best love &amp; a great many kisses to
                    dear Aunt Bet. you must excuse all mistakes for <orig reg="really">realy</orig>
                    I am so sleepy that I scarcely know what I am writing. good night and good bye
                    from your devoted little cousin</p>
