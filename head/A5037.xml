                    and the other one is very weak. Charley I never was as sorry for A dog in my
                    life and he never would have gotten well if I had not attended to him like I
                    would have done with a Child. I gave your Pistol to Dr. Bashaw yesterday and he
                    will give it to John <unclear>Berry</unclear> next Monday in Staunton. I wish
                    you would come out and see me if you cannot stay longer than one night and do
                    something with your dog if you want him. we do not care anything about keeping
                    him as he is so lame. I am well and I hope this will find you enjoying the same
                    Blessing. the Children and all send their love to you. Please write soon and a
                    longer letter than you wrote before and something more satisfactory about your
                    self. Remember me to my friends in <unclear>your</unclear> town.</p>
