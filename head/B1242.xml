                <p>. . .</p>

                <p>Counties of <hi rend="underline">Augusta</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Highland</hi>
                    &amp; <hi rend="underline">Bath</hi>.<lb/> These counties constitute a sub
                    district under charge of <hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>
                        <abbr expan="George">G.</abbr> T. Cook</hi>
                    <abbr expan="Veterans' Reserve Corps">V.R.C.</abbr> as <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr>. The freedmen are
                    generally engaged at labor but do not appear to be in a prosperous or contented
                    position.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Cook</hi> makes grave
                    complaints against the local magistrates for their utter indifference and
                    inattention to the complaints of the freedmen, who come before them, especially
                    where such complaints are made against whites. Reports of outrages are frequent,
                    and almost invariably the freedmen are the sufferers, with but little if any
                    chance of redress. When the attention of the magistrates is <hi rend="underline"
                        >specially</hi> called to a case, and it is at the same time intimated <pb
                        n="1"/>to them by <hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Lieutenant"
                        >Lieut.</abbr> Cook</hi> that any refusal or delay on their part to act
                    promptly in the matter, will necessitate a reference of the matter to the <abbr
                        expan="Assistant">Asst.</abbr> Commissioner, they will act, but generally
                    their action amounts to nothing more than to bind both parties over to keep the
                    peace, the innocent with the guilty, the aggressor with the victim. <hi
                        rend="underline"><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook</hi> does
                    however, report <hi rend="underline">one instance</hi> in which the magistrates
                    protected an outraged freed-girl and bound some white citizens over to answer to
                    the grand-jury for a gross assault upon her. Justice to freedmen is however
                    here, the exception and not the rule.</p>

                <p>Circular No. 7 Bureau <abbr expan="Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">RF
                        &amp; AL</abbr>
                    <add hand="h1" place="inline">Washington</add> DC. <unclear>I</unclear> inquired
                    of <hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Cook</hi> as to what
                    inquiry the Freedmen were making in the matter of Lands in certain states
                    offered to them by the provisions of the Act of Congress approved June 21st 1866
                    and in regard to which information has been <unclear>promulgated</unclear> in
                    Circular No 7 Headquarters Commissioner Bureau <abbr
                        expan="Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">R.F. and A.L.</abbr> and in
                    reply he informed me that he had not received the circular and knew nothing of
                    its provisions.</p>

                <p>Marriage register<lb/> The registry for the county of Augusta had been completed,
                    before the arrival of the blanks distributed for that purpose. I examined it and
                    found it complete with <pb n="12"/>the exception that it did not furnish the
                    names of the former owners of either husband or wife. The <abbr
                        expan="Assistant">Asst</abbr> Superintendent was convinced that it would be
                    impossible even to get the Freedmen together again, for the purpose of
                    completing the record and in consequence, I directed him to copy his present
                    registry numerically upon the blanks, <unclear>trusting</unclear> to time and
                    opportunity to make it gradually more complete. The calling of these people
                    together for the purpose of registry has had an excellent and noticeable effect
                    upon them, especially in imbuing them with a greater respect for the marriage
                    relation that they have heretofore had.</p>

                <p>Support of Destitutes<lb/> The county authorities of Augusta county have made
                    proper arrangements for the support of the poor, and expect and intend to
                    provide for all "freedmen paupers" who are properly thrown upon them. In
                    Highland and Bath counties similar provision has been made.</p>

                <p>So far as Bath County is concerned, it has been but lately added to this sub
                    district: and the officer in charge has as yet had no opportunity of examining
                    into the condition of the freedmen therein. The slave population of the county
                    in 1860, was but small, while in Higland County it was still less.</p>

                <pb n="13"/>

                <p>The official records of this office are in good condition, books are well kept,
                    so far as furnished, and all orders, letters &amp;c properly filed. <hi
                        rend="underline"><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook</hi> appears to
                    be a competent officer and successful in the discharge of his duties.</p>
