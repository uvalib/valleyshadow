                <p>I have your two dear letters of this week one by Hamie &amp; one by the cars
                    this Evening. I wrote to you yesterday in reply to your letter by Hamie
                    &amp; sent it early this morning hours before the train went down to Mr
                    Myers who said this Evening that he gave the letter to the Mail agent on the
                    cars this Morning. he must have forgotten to leave it in Staunton. I was so much
                    disappointed to hear that you did not get it. I think I shall not trust my
                    letters in that <pb n="2"/>way again but send them to Swoopes Depot &amp; be
                    sure of getting them off safely I was so anxious for you to get my letter that I
                    sent down to the Hotel this evening to inquire of Mr Myers if he sent the
                    letter. he said he did then I thought you had it my love early this morning. I
                    am so glad in my very soul that you are coming Saturday I can scarcely wait two
                    days yet. If I did not get to see your dear face every week I do believe I would
                    die. The thought of seeing you soon during the weeks gives me life &amp;
                    hope. I only wish I could see you every day <pb n="3"/>my love then I would be
                    satisfied &amp; happy <orig reg="anywhere">any where</orig>. It seems so
                    long to me since Sunday night when I bid you Goodby. I would love to see you now
                    indeed I am almost too anxious to wait until you can come please do come if you
                    live I want to see you My love Oh so much. I love you more <orig reg="than"
                    >then</orig> all on Earth with a devotion of heart &amp; soul which nothing
                    can change or take from you. My heart &amp; all its affection are yours
                    only, now &amp; always I shall love &amp; think of you as I have never
                    loved any being in this life. Every time I see you I feel that y<del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <pb n="4"/>are the dearest <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> all on Earth to my heart &amp;
                    life, I feel how necessary you are to my happiness when you are gone &amp;
                    that life to me without you &amp; your love would be dark &amp; desolate
                    indeed. I am so glad dear pa is coming home. Ma is not at all pleased with
                    Mountain Palace. I wrote you a loving letter yesterday I hope you will get it
                    yet before Saturday. I am so anxious for you to come I can scarcely wait I would
                    give <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> to be with you now my love. I do love
                    you more <orig reg="than">then</orig> I can ever fully express I wish I could
                    tell you how dear you are to me. I try but I can't say all or half what I feel
                    for you in my heart &amp; soul. You are my all of happiness &amp; love
                    on Earth. I love to have you here then I am happy &amp; contented to stay if
                    I could only keep you my love. Come my pen, lips, &amp; heart say come.</p>

                <p>May God bless &amp; let you come &amp; make me glad &amp; happy as
                    none can do but you. All send love. I love you with my whole heart, soul, mind
                    &amp; all my nature. I think only of you.</p>

                <p>I send a loving Good night kiss to you, &amp; say do come my only love</p>
