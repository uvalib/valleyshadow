                <p>It is with pleasure do I take my pen to answer your elaborate epistle, which I
                    received through the hands of our soldier &amp; hero Mr J. Hayse. It need
                    not be told you that it was received &amp; perused with great pleasure as I
                    consider it a pleasure to read letters from all my friends, who manifest such a
                    deep interest in the welfare &amp; safe return of our soldiers as you do. I
                    am tolerable well at present, but not as well as I have been. I never had better
                    health than I had two or three weeks ago. Have fattened so much you would hardly
                    recognize me, if I were to meet anywhere away from home. I think you might come
                    down &amp; see us all, while we are living in peace &amp; quietude. The
                    indications for a battle are very faint; according to my way of judging. We will
                    soon be strongly fortified here, and I hardly think the Yankees will attack us
                    so strongly fortified, since they are afraid to "show us fight" in an open
                    field. We had a grand display of the <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Volunteers">Vols</abbr> yesterday evening. <abbr expan="Governor"
                        >Gov.</abbr>
                    <orig reg="Letcher">Lecher</orig> was present &amp; presented <pb n="2"/>to
                    each Va Regiment, the Virginia Colors, with a short speech <orig reg="exhorting"
                        >exorting</orig> them to never let her be dishonored, while in their charge.
                    All the Generals with in reach, were present on the memorable occasion.</p>

                <p>The Governor delivered his address, standing upon one of our newly erected forts.</p>

                <p>The <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> is going to have a grand review of the
                    troops this evening, I wish you could attend, it would be something romantic to
                    you especially. I saw some ladies on the field yesterday evening, to see what
                    was to be seen &amp; heard. This part of the country is nearly destitute of
                    ladies &amp; citizens generally, some have united their destiny with that of
                    the Yankees &amp; some with the Southerners.</p>

                <p>I suppose you have heard that the Company to which I belong, has been detailed as
                    a permanent guard at <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Smith's headquarters.</p>

                <p>We were detailed the 2<hi rend="super">nd</hi> day of Oct. The time passes much
                    more pleasantly in that position than it did when we were with the Regiment,
                        <del hand="h1">withs</del> notwithstanding our guard is very heavy.</p>

                <p>I've gotten so used to Camp life, I feel as well contented here, and probably
                    better than I would be if I were at home or College. One of my Classmates came
                        <pb n="3"/>down yesterday to see us all. From the news he gave of College I
                    would not like to be there very much. Only one of my Class returned, Lacy from
                    New Kent County. I hope he will have a big time of it. He graduates this year,
                    if he studies pretty hard. You spoke to me something about <abbr expan="William"
                            >W<hi rend="super">m</hi></abbr> Brand &amp; what I thought of him
                    generally. I have not associated with <add hand="h1" place="inline">him</add> a
                    great deal since he is in a separate <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> from
                    myself, but from what I have seen of him or even heard, raised him in my
                    estimation a great deal. His moral deportment without a reasonable doubt is
                        <orig reg="unimpeachable">impeachable</orig>. I have never seen or heard of
                    his association with the gambler, swearer, or drunkard, or rather I should use
                    participation instead of association, for we are all bound by necessity to
                    associate with men of all ranks &amp; classes. To speak the truth, I have
                    never heard of any action in his life, that would cast a shame &amp;
                    reproach upon his professions. I don't know whether this will be satisfactory to
                    you or not. I have asked no one with regards to him, but speak from my own
                    observations.</p>

                <p>This war I believe is designed to bring out the characters of men, &amp; it
                    certainly <pb n="4"/>has brought out his by this time, &amp; I consider it a
                    good one. I was very sorry to hear of the death of my old schoolmate Miss Sallie
                        M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Cadden, and also others with whom I was acquainted,
                    but speaking from your statement with regard to them, their parents &amp;
                    friends loss was their eternal gain. That disease seems to have been more
                        <unclear>fatal</unclear> this season, than I've ever known it to be. But all
                    these things must needs be &amp; we should submit &amp; that, willingly.
                    The suffering of our army in the west has certainly been very intense. But I
                    still hope &amp; trust it will be all over by next Spring, at the same time
                    I see the tide of war rising more fearful &amp; terr<add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">if</add>ying than ever. I have no news to write to you that
                    would interest you in the least.</p>

                <p>I got some of the cake &amp; cheese you sent to your brother. It was very
                    nice, &amp; accept of my thanks for it. Well I must close, give my love to
                    any you choose, &amp; write to me soon again.</p>
