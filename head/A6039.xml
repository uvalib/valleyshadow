    <p>I seize the present <orig reg="opportunity">oportunity</orig> by writing you a few lines to
     let you know that I am well &amp; hope you may be enjoying the same blessing. Henry Wright
     is not very well he has been complaining for near two weeks but he says he feels a little
     better <orig reg="today">to day</orig>. We are camped on Magruders farm five miles from
     Gordonsville he is a brother of General Magruders. There is nothing of importance to write
     every day we hear reports of the advance of the enemy but they <orig reg="generally"
     >generaly</orig> turn out to be false the enemy are at Orange Court House 10 mile from
     Gordonsville with a very large force it is supposed. we have a considerable force ourselves
     some five or six divisions in all which with Artillery &amp; Cavalry will not fall far
     short of fifty thousand men. We have just had orders to cook two days rations with <pb n="2" entity="Smiley11b" pid="uva-lib:503114"/>
      eight days hard bread and be ready to march at a moments warning.
     it is so warm now that it is very laborious marching. but I hope that the weather will soon get
     cooler and we will get along much better. We have had very good living for a few days we draw
     flour beef sugar salt rice and sometimes molasses apples are plenty and we make a great many
     pies and dumplings which though not quite so good as home manufacture are a <orig reg="very"
      >verry</orig> good substitute We have heard that four thousand of the Fort Delaware Prisoners
     arrived in Richmond yesterday to be exchanged and some of the company expect Sam Beard
     &amp; <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Wright to be in the number if they are still
     alive as that is the place where all the troops that were taken prisoner in the <orig
      reg="valley">vally</orig> were sent. But I must close by Asking you to excuse all mistakes Bad
     writing <orig reg="etc.">&amp;c</orig></p>
