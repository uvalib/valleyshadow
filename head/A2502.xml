    </opener>

    <p>I wrote you a brief note this morning by Mr. Sheets, one of Capt. Sterrett's men who went
     home to stay &amp; enclosed five dollars in it for you. I intended to write you a long,
     long letter today, but in the morning Messengers came into camp at full speed saying that the
     enemy was advancing upon us &amp; so the breast works were manned, extra scouts sent out,
     some placed in ambuscade, &amp;c &amp;c, I took a horse and became aid for the time to
     the Col. to convey orders &amp;c &amp;c, and thus the whole day was spent in the midst
     of excitement, the troops keeping to their arms, but as yet no attack has been made, though
     some look for one tonight.</p>
    <p> There was an engagement last night between some of the scouts of our camp &amp; those of
     the enemy. Three of our men were badly wounded, one shot through &amp; through the lungs,
     another in the head &amp; shoulder &amp; another in the leg I think -- they are all
     doing well &amp; it is thought they may recover. Of the enemy, two were certainly killed
     &amp; likely five or six. They were in the wood &amp; fired on our scouts who returned
     the fire. Our men took the pistols, gun &amp; money of one of the men &amp; two letters
     that were on him -- his name was Johns, from Ohio -- one letter was from a young sister, full
     of love for him, wishing he would come home, not caring whether promoted or <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     the war would only end so that he could <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to them. It was written at Brookville.
      <pb n="2"/> The other letter was from a cousin who seemed to think everything of the young man
     &amp; prayed that he might get back -- but alas the poor fellow was destined never to see
     them again. The scouts said his body was the fairest of any they had ever seen. </p>
    <p> Today our men were going along &amp; thought the enemy was concealed near at hand in the
     woods, so <orig reg="they">the</orig> fired into the woods and then some of the enemy showed
     themselves in the road when our men fired at them &amp; killed one certainly, &amp;
     more they think. Maj. N. Tyler, one of the <abbr expan="Editors">Eds.</abbr> of the Enquirer
     was in command of them -- he is a good fellow &amp; eats part of the time with us at Head
     Quarters, where we sup, breakfast &amp; dine on greasy cakes of dough made into the shape
     of biscuits &amp; hardened on the outside &amp; partway through, with coffee &amp;
     meat, sometimes hard crackers, now &amp; then a taste of butter, sometimes a loaf of bread
     from some where as a present, or a piece of cake procured in the same way. The fare is "pretty
     tough" but borne without grumbling, &amp; the Col. is a no. one good fellow &amp; so
     are his aids, clerks &amp;c -- but Lt. Col. Pegram came here today &amp; assumes the
     command &amp; so I do not know what will be <unclear>done</unclear> or what chance I will
     stand for <unclear>staying</unclear>
     <pb n="3"/>
    </p>
    <p> I will write tomorrow what the prospect is for a permanent situation during the war -- I
     suppose you have heard that Mr. Doyle &amp; his two sons, Tom &amp; __ were wounded the
     other day. It is a sorrowful thing to have so many brave fellows cut up, &amp; some killed,
     like one of the Rockbridge Cavalry the other day, when all we ask of the North is to be left
     alone in the enjoyment of inherited rights. We shall surely conquer but O! how many precious
     lives must be lost, &amp; how many homes made desolate before the end shall come. <abbr
      expan="Adjutant">Adj.</abbr> Hoover &amp; I built ourselves a bark tent &amp;
     stretched a piece of cotton over it &amp; got two boards to fasten up in one corner for a
     table &amp; have two stools made by driving a post into the ground &amp; nailing on a
     board &amp; two beds made by a pole to fence off a space &amp; bark laid down &amp;
     then straw filled in &amp; I have a blanket &amp; my cloak for a bed I got one of the
     jackets, made for the Cavalry -- Yesterday I was out in the woods fixing a line of pickets
     &amp; got wet through &amp; through, the black of the jacket coloring my shirt
     &amp; myself too. I came back after the rain &amp; never washed off as much <del
      hand="h1"/> in my life -- it made me almost <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> through the night -- <pb n="4"/></p>
    <p> Tuesday morning -- I have no time to write this morning -- was up by 3 A.M. &amp; the
     mail soon goes -- I will write again in a day or so. I should like to be at home very much
     &amp; hope I may soon be there. </p>
    <p> Love to all -- kiss the children -- May you be kept safely &amp; God bless you. </p>
