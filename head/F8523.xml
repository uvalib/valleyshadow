                <p>I have read all the proofs of my letters, which were in type before I came down.
                    I expect to revise part of them this afternoon, &amp; the balance in the
                    morning. The pamphlet will be about 50 pages.-- They are anxious to have more at
                    Harrisburg on Thursday; but it is possible they will have to wait until Friday
                    for them. I have not made as many changes, as I would if the <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">letters</add> had not been in type; but I have corrected the
                    errors &amp; made a few improvements in style.-- Mr. Cummings had gone to
                        <abbr expan="Harrisburg">Harr-g</abbr>. He went yesterday <abbr
                        expan="afternoon">aftn.</abbr>, &amp; will <pb n="2"/> be absent most of
                    the week. I <hi rend="underline">may</hi> go up on Thursday with 200 of the
                    pamphlets.-- I understand, however, that the <abbr expan="American">Amer.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Republican">Repub.</abbr> State <abbr expan="Committee"
                    >Comte.</abbr> will meet here on Tuesday next, &amp; I think it likely I
                    will not be home until after that.-- I am disappointed about it, &amp; will
                    not stay over Sunday, unless for some such reason.--</p>

                <p>I saw <abbr expan="Professor">Prof.</abbr>
                    <unclear>Haupt</unclear> this morning, &amp; met Paul Keller on the street.
                    I have not yet been to see <unclear>Wer.</unclear> Kurtz, and I have had little
                    leisure. The heaviest of my work is over, but I must still watch to have all
                    right.= I was at the Opera House a short time on Saturday. It is a beautiful
                    building &amp; was filled with a fashionable <pb n="3"/> audience. I enjoyed
                    looking at them more than listening to the Italian of the <hi rend="underline"
                        >artistes</hi>.--</p>

                <p>If the letters on the Main Line <hi rend="super">1000 copies are to be
                    printed</hi> -- I have made up an Index to the most important tables. I will
                    write Chas. in a day or two. I was at Dr. <unclear>Brandman's</unclear> church
                    on Saturday <abbr expan="afternoon">aftn.</abbr>, &amp; walked home with
                    Miss Rachel Watson, cousin of Mr. Watson. I met her at <del hand="h1"
                    >Martere</del> Caledonia two years ago.-- I called in for a moment at Dr.
                    Siebert's on Sunday <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, but did not go up stairs to see the
                    ladies. I was passing up <unclear>Arch</unclear> street, &amp; <del
                        hand="h1"/> to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for the location of Dr.
                    <unclear>Stark's</unclear> church-- It was too far up town, &amp; I <del
                        hand="h1"/> to the St. Lawrence. I called at <unclear>Kent</unclear>
                    Gilbert's but he was not at home. Harriet is to be married <pb n="4"/> soon. I
                    may call on them before leaving town.-- These hats are but light improvements in
                    the old style. The improvement is the insertion of a soft material, where the
                    hat rests upon the forehead. The <unclear>movement</unclear> is flexible.--
                    Hence the name.-- They are not at all what I expected.-- They are very
                    comfortable, however. I don't know how they would last.-- I have made the
                    personal acquaintance of a Judge <unclear>Laporte</unclear>, Wilmot's intimate
                    friend. He was formerly <unclear>Surgeon</unclear> General, &amp; his face
                    has been familiar to me for years. He will be in town until after next Tuesday.
                    Mr. Wilmot will meet the <abbr expan="committee">comte.</abbr> here.-- Give my
                    love to all.-- I will write again in a day or two.</p>
