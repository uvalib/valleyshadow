    <p>Your excellent letter of a late date came to me in good time and I should have answered it
     before now &amp; must beg pardon for waiting so long &amp; hope you will not "go and do
     likewise". We have been very busy, as the enemy has been making some demonstrations that looked
     like another attempt to cross, so we have renewed activity in fortifying and the Gen. has
     called for a complete map of our position and defences, some 14 miles long, on a large scale,
     so you see there is no lack of hard work, then I have had a wretched cold for some two weeks
     making me so stupid that I have not done much unless under the spur of necessity, and so have
     put off writing to you until I shall do it no longer. I have been alone for several days, I got
     Gen. Stuart to ask Gen. Jackson for him for a few days, and he sent him up to Fauquier to see
     his sweetheart and the "love sick fellow fairly danced with delight, it would have done your
     heart good to have seen how happy he was in anticipation of his visit to "the loved one". But
     the worst of it was that Gen. Jackson wanted him again to construct some works, after the
     Yankee demonstrations, so he sent up after Gen. Stuart's Engineer &amp; of course he had to
     let him come, and Stuart laughed at me yesterday, saying "you caught me once, but you <orig
      reg="won't">wont</orig> again."</p>
    <p>We have been living gloriously ever since I came back, "gorgeously" as Boswell says, and you
     would be surprised how things hold out, you must have endowed some of the "wee" jars &amp;c
     with properties like the "widow's Curse" <pb n="2"/> I ate the last of the catchup today, on a
     snack of bread &amp; butter, when very hungry &amp; weary and o! how good -- the butter
     is not half gone yet, we have some pickles left, but they go tolerably fast -- , we are
     particularly fond of them, especially the cabbage, I never thought it half as good before, then
     the corn, berries, hominy, &amp; dried fruit are almost intact, not a fourth of them gone
     &amp; I may say <orig reg="that">the</orig> some of the corn meal and biscuits, of course
     the apples did not last long. Every one that eats with us praises the good estate of our
     larder, and "my wife" often comes in for the credit due her for the comforts that make this
     barbarous, or at least half civilized way of living at all endurable, I do not know how I could
     stand it but for the nourishing palatable food I get. Last night, after 3 cold days, it began
     to rain and has rained steadily until now, 8 P. M. of the next night and the ground is quite
     wet, the stream coming up, making camp quite unpleasant, while clear, cold &amp; dry a tent
     was very comfortable with a good fire, but in a heavy rain the tent gets wet and a hot fire in
     a stove partially vaporizing the dampness makes a tent like a steam bath and unfits one to
     endure the changes of the temperature we are exposed to. I intend to try for a room in the
     house if we stay here much longer, at least until I get rid of my cold &amp; headache
     caused by it. I think I brought about my cold by washing when I changed my clothes after I came
     back from home. I have never washed all over in camp, in cold weather that it has not so served
     me, and I intend, here after, to profit by my lesson of experience and rub clean &amp; make
     the clothes do the washing for me. I am sorry Nelly has been so <pb n="3"/> poorly and hope she
     is entirely recovered. I fear the warm stove room may help to make the children so liable to
     throat diseaes, but hope not. You have so many wearisome nights with the sick children, I am so
     sorry I may not be there to relieve you, I often think of it on my pallet on the ground and
     wonder if you are enjoying rest or being worn down by the care of our children -- but it will
     not be so always, and we must pray our merciful Heavenly Father that these days may be
     shortened and that neither we nor our offspring may see any more of the like -- we must nobly
     endure and suffer, for the boon we seek is a priceless one, but O how much it costs. I was up
     to Fredericksburg on Monday, went with Col. C. J. Faulkner, who is our "Chief of Staff", he
     wanted to see the "Battlefield of Dec. 13<hi rend="super">
      <hi rend="underline">th</hi>
     </hi> ," and understand it fully, as he is writing out the Report, and so the Gen. sent me up
     with him, and we had quite a pleasant day, as the elements were favorable, I saw two unburied
     Yankees there still, mere boys in appearance slowly washing away thus far from their homes,
     killed in a vain attempt to subjugate us. Heaven help them. I went into Fredericksburg for the
     first time, called on the Mayor, most of the people are still away and the town is deserted
     save by a few men and our soldiers "on duty" there The people are still moving away the wrecks
     of their household property, but as the Mayor remarked, "there is scarce one thing that makes
     life pleasant and comfortable that the Vandals have left behind or have not destroyed. He said
     there was hardly a house that had not a bale or shell hole in it &amp; our men have picked
     up tons of unexploded shells &amp; solid shot. I saw houses completely riddled, roof sides
     &amp; ends and perfectly untenable. I had no idea before how a bombarded <pb n="4"/> sacked
     city would look and I do not wish to see it again, unless it would be right to sack Washington,
     that sink of iniquity, after bombarding it with all "old Abe's" horrid crew in it. The river is
     quite narrow there and the pickets can sit on the opposite banks and converse There is no
     firing of pickets at one another now and our men are throwing up breastworks in easy musket
     range of the enemy -- in fact one of the pickets called to our men, saying, "You needn't be
     throwing up dirt there, we don't intend to come that way again". I hardly think the enemy
     intends to come over here again, though they may. Col. Faulkner says all these elections in the
     North mean peace, he was in prison there until a year ago and some of the men that have since
     been elected to office there or are candidates, were in with him and they told him how they
     intended to proceed until they got the government into their hands when they would make peace,
     though he does not look for it until Abe's time expires, though he thinks hostilities will
     cease after next June. Write to me often my Darling One, for the mails have to be depended on
     now our line of courriers is stopped Put on the letters to Guinea's station P.O. in addition to
     what You usually do. I shall be quite sure to come home before the sale so as to be there and
     we will keep what we want and I will arrange for garden, pigs &amp;c. I have got William
     hired, expect him here now every day, got him very low -- and in the Spring I will hire Allen
     out to some farmer &amp; send William to you and he can make garden &amp; do anything
     you want done -- I will send you some money if I have a chance. Be of good cheer my love and
     may you and our nestlings be in God's holy keeping and be abundantly blessed in all things is
     the constant prayer of your absent husband </p>
