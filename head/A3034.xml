                <p> I have been waiting very patiently to hear from you, &amp; as yet have
                    waited in vain, but I shall not wait any longer. I will now give you a brief
                    history of our fight on monday, in which we suffered more severely than in any
                    previous engagement. I will not say <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> of the
                    fight on <orig reg="Sabbath">Sabath</orig> (as we were not in it) excepting
                    early in the morning, our artillery repelled the enemy that were attempting to
                    cross at Port <unclear>Republic</unclear>, after which the attack was made in
                    our rear upon <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>
                    <unclear>Euel</unclear>, he fought<pb n="2"/> them hard nearly all day occupying
                    the field at night - the loss was heavy on both sides. On monday morning we
                    crossed the river &amp; proceeded down in the direction of Swift-Run Gap,
                    our Train Crossing &amp; taking the Browns Gap road, we had not proceded far
                        <orig reg="until">untill</orig> our batteries commenced shelling a piece of
                    wood in which the enemy were encamped. Our batteries were soon responded to by
                    the <orig reg="enemy's">enemys</orig>, it was not long untill a <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <unclear>my</unclear>
                    <unclear>regiment</unclear> on <unclear>across</unclear>. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to support a <unclear>battery</unclear> which position we held
                    for some time. We were then ordered forward (to meet<pb n="3"/> the enemy who
                    were advancing on our left) the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi> Louisiana being on our
                    right, we had not proceeded far <orig reg="until">untill</orig> the firing
                    commenced which was kept up for some time, our men fighting most nobly. <abbr
                        expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> after <abbr expan="regiment">Reg.</abbr> of the
                    yankees came up <orig reg="until">untill</orig> our men had obliged to give way,
                    not however <orig reg="until">untill</orig> their ammunition was nearly
                    exhausted. It was just about the time that our men commenced falling back that
                    your Cousin James fell, he fought with as much bravery as ever did any man - he
                    was in the act of loading at the time. John <unclear>Bonbeck</unclear> fell
                    about the same time. Our reinforcements came up pretty soon &amp; it was not
                    long <orig reg="until">untill</orig> we had them to use a vulgar<pb n="4"/>
                    expression, "schedadling". we pursued them some 6 or 8 miles taking some 300
                    prisoners. We also took <unclear>6</unclear> officers of their best Artillery -
                        <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> McKeny &amp; myself took your
                    Cousin James' &amp; <orig reg="Bruckick's">
                        <unclear>Brukicks</unclear>
                    </orig>
                    <orig reg="bodies">bodys</orig> &amp; carried them some distance up the
                    river thinking that we <add hand="h1" place="inline">might</add> get an
                    opportunity of sending them home - but the yankees came up on the opposite side,
                    &amp; we were obliged to take them down the river further, we then concluded
                    to bury them which we did as best we could. Our <abbr expan="Regiment"
                    >Reg.</abbr> lost 4 men killed &amp; 78 wounded. Our company 2 killed
                    &amp; 12 wounded. Thus ended one of the bloodiest battles that we have
                    witnessed. We then fell back to this place where we are perfectly safe. The
                    Yankees are falling back it is said [next section written upside down at top of
                    page] I think there is no doubt but we will be in the valley in a few days
                    again, &amp; may yet be able to drive the invaders from off our soil. I
                    shall expect to hear from you soon.</p>
