                <p>Since my last letter, companies A and B, Captains Harry A. Miles detached from
                    the regiment. These companies were sent from Camp Couch, under sealed orders, to
                    perform some special duty, and left here, with six days cooked rations, on
                    Friday afternoon last, and took up the pike towards M'Connellsburg. We are sorry
                    to part company with them so soon, and hope they may speedily return to camp, to
                    increase our "Happy Family" to its full extent once more.</p>

                <p>As additional regimental officers not before reported, I would mention the names
                    of Dr. Wagonseller, of Snyder County, as Chief Surgeon, and Dr. James Henderson,
                    (a well known and talented young physician, of Hummelstown, Dauphin county,) and
                    Dr. Brant, Assistant Surgeons.</p>

                <p>Washington P. Ogelsby, of Harrisburg, as Hospital Steward.</p>

                <p>The health of the regiment is good, not more than fifteen or twenty men being on
                    the sick list.</p>

                <p>Intermittent fever and a few cases of <orig reg="diarrhea">diarrhoea</orig> are
                    the prevailing complaints.</p>

                <p>Assistant Surgeon Henderson joined the regiment on Friday last, and has been very
                    attentive to the patients under his charge since his arrival. Dr.H. commanded a
                    company in the 127th regiment. He is a <orig reg="praticing">practising</orig>
                    physician of much experience.</p>

                <p>We had a refreshing rain here, commencing on Saturday evening and lasting (at
                    intervals) all day Sunday. Many of us were sorry for this, as we had an
                    invitation to attend Divine worship, under the direction of our esteemed and
                    worthy Chaplain, Rev. Rakestraw, which was to have been held in a grove
                    contigious to camp.</p>

                <p>"Dress Parade" was also dispensed with for the same reason, which was another
                    source of annoyance to most of the men, for a true soldier delights to see the
                    regiment drawn up for inspection, to witness the fine appearance the respective
                    companies present on the occasion.</p>

                <p>The Harrisburgers belonging to the 201st have evidently been accustomed to good
                    living. After duty, parties go out to "forage," as they term it, and return to
                    camp laden with poultry; corn; sweet potatoes; fruit; milk; &amp;c., all of
                    which they pay for. Our young Colonel issued an order that no private property
                    was to be molested, and the order is strictly adhered to. The rations we get
                    daily are fresh, ample and of the best quality. But "force of habit" is strong
                    with many people, and they must have delicacies if money can procure them.</p>

                <p>It is amusing to witness the railroad engineer, the blacksmith, tailor,
                    carpenter, clerk, butcher and man of letters, sitting around a fire of logs,
                    toasting hard tack, frying chicken, stewing lamb and sweet potatoes, or anything
                    else that their appetite craves. Many of them will be capital cooks when they
                    return to their homes, and <orig reg="adept">adepts</orig> in the art and
                    mastery of gastronomy.</p>

                <p>There are many Harrisburgers <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to company I. The following is the
