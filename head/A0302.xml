                    <salute>Dear Cousin,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Please excuse my paper, it is the best I have. I commenced writing to you
                    yesterday on half a sheet. I got this yesterday, and I concluded that I would
                    throw it away and commence anew.</p>

                <p>I got a letter today the first for I dont know how long, don't think I have got
                    any since yours <orig reg="arrived">arived</orig>, got one from Cousin A
                    Buchanan, she has had Diptheria, but I believe she is not a friend of your so I
                        <orig reg="need">nead</orig> not write about her. Well I will tell you what
                    I have been doing this evening, have been helping to make an eggnog. George
                    Baylor and myself went out this morning and got some milk and eggs, we are going
                    to have some company tonight and have a sing, we have invited some of the Marien
                    Riflemen, from Winchester. They are the best singers I ever heard. We expect to
                    have some <pb n="2"/> instrumental music too, but you must not think that we
                    expect to get tipsy we don't do such things in our mess. We had a big eggnog the
                    evening after we moved into our cabin and had a heap of fun.</p>

                <p>You said in your letter that you were disappointed that you did not get to
                    Fairfield, who is it that you go to see there, It must be Charley <unclear/> we
                    are living finely here now, get plenty to eat and of a good quality. can fix it
                    up a great deal better in our cabin than when we were in our tents we have yeast
                    and bake raised bread, have warm rolls for breakfast every morning, we have our
                    mess laid off in twos and have regular cooking days, there is 14 of us so cook
                    day does not come but once a week, get plenty of coffee and <orig reg="sugar"
                        >shugar</orig>, can get some molasses, have to buy them, they are furnished
                    for the officers at 20 cents per <unclear>goll</unclear>, we are having a grand
                    time here, if never had no harder times than we have here we would get along
                    very well, but this is not always <pb n="3"/>the case, I expect we will have
                    some hard fighting to do the next term, and I expect we will all be into it. I
                    have not reenlisted yet and don't know when I will. 9 of our company have
                    reenlisted. we have to the 10th of March to <orig reg="decide">deside</orig>. I
                    rather expect most of us will reenlist by that time some will stand the draft. I
                    sometimes think that I will just float along let come what will. I would not
                    hesitate a moment to reenlist if I thought my going would not stop some <orig
                        reg="militiaman">malitiamen</orig> from coming. What are they all thinking
                    about it I guess some of them would like if we would reenlist, if I were in
                        <orig reg="their">there</orig>
                    <orig reg="places">plases</orig> I would too. Cousin K. I am much obliged to you
                    for the invitation to dinner am very sorry that I could not be there. well it is
                    getting too dark to so will stop for the present, step in and have some eggnog
                    with us. 21<hi rend="super">st</hi> I did not have time to finish my letter in
                    time for the mail today but will <orig reg="endeavor">endever</orig> to start it
                    in, in the morning. We had a nice time last night <pb n="4"/> some came that
                    were not invited consequently were <orig reg="too">two</orig> much crowded, some
                    one I did not say who got one of the performers out and gave him a little <orig
                        reg="too">two</orig> much to drink which spoiled it some. You spoke of
                    thinking about the Sunday that we went to Middlebrook, I expect you often think
                    of that day and of <unclear>So Dall</unclear> too. I would like very much to
                    know what you could tell me about that day, but I <orig reg="reckon"
                    >recon</orig> it is a secret. You asked me if I was fond of
                    <unclear>prels</unclear>. I am not particularly fond of them when I am at home
                    but they are very good here. You said that you expected I would not wear a
                        <unclear>viser</unclear> that you knit, you are very much mistaken. I will
                        <orig reg="surely">shurely</orig>
                    <orig reg="prize">prise</orig> it very much indeed. As for the button I have
                    none that is fit. but will get one the next time I go to Winchester. Write soon
                    and tell me about your trip the Ridge. You wished that I was there to go with
                    you some time, you don't wish it more than I do.</p>
