    <p>As John Beard starts back this morning to join your company I will endeavor to write a few
     lines to you. We are all in our usual health We have had a great deal of anxiety about you for
     the last eight or ten days past It is about three weeks since the last letter we got was
     written June 23 I thought you were certainly Sick. We tried to find out but you were not named
     in any of the letters that came into this <orig reg="neighborhood">neighbourhood</orig> And it
     was not <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> day <orig reg="before">befour</orig> yesterday that we
     heard you had the measles, and then through letters written to persons four or five miles
     distant. I want to send you a piece of Cheese and a few cakes if John can take them. We will
     also send you three dollars Gold and silver And now I will say in conclusion if you wish to
     come home and your friends think you ought to come M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Steele has gone
     down<pb n="2" entity="Smiley71b" pid="uva-lib:503279"/>
      and I think will take charge of bringing you home if you want to
     come. If you do not come I want you to send a particular <orig reg="account">acount</orig> of
     your case and situation. And now I will close hoping and praying that your health and strength
     may be restored and that you may use it in Gods service </p>

     <seg type="postscript">Sabbath evening July 14<lb/> Dear Son<lb/> As John did not start
      yesterday as was expected I will <orig reg="endeavor">endeavour</orig> to write you a few
      lines this evening I heard today that M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Bowman got a letter from Will
      Arehart yesterday stating that you Wade and himself were still in the Hospital but thought you
      would soon be able to join the Army We had the <abbr expan="Reverand">Rev</abbr>
      <unclear>M<hi rend="super">r</hi></unclear> Penie of North Carolina with us today he preached
      a very excellent sermon and was very fervent in prayer for the soldiers he also has sons in
      army There appears a little wakening up in the Church on our last Communion there was some 12
      or 13 persons joined the church some on certificate and this day there was two persons
      received into the church who did not wait for a communion season John W Beard and James B
      Berry &amp; now my dear son I hope ere this you have accepted of Jesus Christ in all his
      offices as your prophet priest and King and that you also will connect <orig reg="yourself"
       >your self</orig> with the Church<lb/> Your Mother</seg>
