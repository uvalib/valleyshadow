                <p>McCutchan write to his cousin Rachel of the crowded and unhealthy conditions in
                    his camp, now that thousands of troops are gathering near Harper's Ferry.</p>

                <p>Well Rate I suppose if you <hi rend="underline">do</hi> complain of my letter not
                    being <hi rend="underline">interesting</hi>, you can't complain of it not being
                    long enough.</p>

                <p>There are about twenty thousand troops here now, &amp; more coming nearly
                    every day, sometimes as many as a thousand at a time. The place is nearly full
                    up, nearly all the citizens have moved away out in the country. Rate it would do
                    you good to see this town from the top of the mountain. Those who have no <hi
                        rend="underline">tents</hi> are quartered in houses, those who have tents
                    have them pitched immediately to the North of the town. there is a hill close
                    here, <orig reg="literally">litterly</orig> covered with tents, not less a
                    thousand I suppose, all laid out in rows like a little town. </p>

                <p>There are twenty two hundred Mississipians here, fifteen hundred Alabamians,
                    &amp; one thousand Kentuckians. There are a good many accidents happening
                    here among careless persons, several men have accidentally shot &amp; one or
                    two Kentuckians on purpose. The Rockbridge Rifles are gone up to Martinsburg
                    about 13 miles from here to the North I don't know how long we will stay here.
                    We may be called away any day. I wish they would send us to Shepherdstown it is
                    a beautiful town 8 miles from here right up the <orig reg="Potomac"
                    >Patomic</orig>. I would like to go somewhere else now where it would be more
                        <unclear>quiet</unclear>. There are too many here now. One poor soldier died
                    yesterday evening. I saw him but an hour or two before he died; he suffered
                    dreadfully, he was not sick more than 24 hours I believe. When I saw him he was
                    almost black. Physicians say he was poisened by something he ate or drank. He
                    was taken away this morning with the honors of war. <pb n="2"/> I must stop
                    writing to you &amp; write some to M.J. I got a letter from home to day. I
                    want your to write to me now as soon as you can if the plow has to stop in
                    consequence of it. I will write to you as soon as I get an answer to this one.
                    Buck send his best love to you. Kiss all the children &amp; </p>
