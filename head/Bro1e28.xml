<salute>Dear Father,</salute>
</opener>
<p>When I wrote home <lb/>
last week I believed that our company <lb/>
would <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">not</add> be ordered out, but
now we <lb/> think we will be. </p>
<p>Two or three weeks <lb/>
ago, we determined to write to the <lb/>
<name type="person">Governor</name> (before we would get <lb/>
coats) to know whether he would order <lb/>
us out or not.  After waiting two <lb/>
weeks, Mr. <name type="person">
<abbr expan="James">Jas</abbr> Davidson</name> of this place <lb/>
came home from <name type="place">Richmond</name>, bringing <lb/>
us word that the <name type="person">Governor</name> would not <lb/>
call us out under any circumstances.<ref n="1" target="n1">[1]</ref> <lb/>
Saturday night <name type="person">
<abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Nelson</name> received <lb/>
an official answer from
<name type="person">S. Rafael French</name>, <lb/>
Aid de Camp to the Governor requiring him <lb/>
to ascertain the consent of the parents <lb/>
of the boys and to report to the <name type="person">Governor</name>, <lb/>

<pb n="2" entity="Bro1e284" pid="uva-lib:502875"/>

and he would then "decide the matter." <lb/>

By the same mail <name type="person"><abbr expan="Professor">
Prof.</abbr> White</name> received <lb/>
a letter from <name type="person">Greenlee Davidson</name> (son of the <lb/>
above and clerk in the
Executive department) <lb/>
telling him to ascertain the consent of the <lb/>
parents of the boys, and that the
<name type="person">Governor</name> "would <lb/>
order us to <name type="place">Harpers Ferry</name>
or the <name type="place">Manasas <lb/>
Junction"</name><ref n="2" target="n2">[2]</ref>.
A good many of the boys <lb/>
had gone home.  They have been written <lb/>
to, to return.  The parents of a few of the <lb/>
boys will keep them at home, but we <lb/>
have been getting some recruits to fill <lb/>
their places.  There is no doubt but that <lb/>
the company will be filled out, in a day <lb/>
or two.  We are drilling four times a <lb/>
day.  Recitations suspended. </p>
<p>The captain ordered us to get flannel <lb/>
shirts or jackets.  We have no coat.</p>

<p> We are out of money and would <lb/>
like to have some this week if you can <lb/>
send it.  The County Court appropriated <lb/>
$25,000 to equip volunteers, allowing $25 <lb/>
per man.  An effort will be made to <lb/>

<pb n="3" entity="Bro1e285" pid="uva-lib:502876"/>

have <del hand="h1">ou</del> the remainder
of our uniform<lb/>
knapsacks paid &amp;c -paid for out of this <lb/>
fund.  Some of the court object to it, <lb/>
because we do not all belong to the <lb/>
county.  We have heard a great many <lb/>
reports about the fighting at
<name type="place">Hampton</name><lb/>
<name type="place">Harpers Ferry</name>
 <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>, but they are too <lb/>
favorable to our side to be believed.  <lb/>
I heard this evening that 7 houses in the <lb/>
upper end of <name type="place">Waynesborough</name> were burning <lb/>
yesterday as the cars came by, couldn't <lb/>
hear whether it was by accident or had been <lb/>
set on fire<ref n="3" target="n3">[3]</ref>.
In consequence of so many boys <lb/>
leaving, the Faculty has called a meeting <lb/>
of the Trustees, next Saturday, to graduate <lb/>
the Senior Class and suspend College. <lb/>
Whether the company goes or not it is <lb/>
not probable we will have any more <lb/>
 College duties this session.<ref n="4" target="n4">[4]</ref>
</p>
<p>We will write again as <lb/>
soon as we hear from the Governor.  </p>
<p>I would like to have two new pair <lb/>
of woolen stockings.  <lb/>


<pb n="4" entity="Bro1e286" pid="uva-lib:502877"/>

William &amp; I both want a new <lb/>
strong cotton shirt.  We have one <lb/>
apiece, our sleeping shirts which <lb/>
have never been used.  You need <lb/>
not send them here, as we will <lb/>
go to <name type="place">Staunton</name> and most likely <lb/>
by <name type="place">Waynesboro</name> of which we will <lb/>
give you notice. Has Ma gotten<lb/>
home? and has she improved?<lb/>
Write to us soon. </p>

<head>Notes</head>

<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> As Andrew observes, throughout May the company requested
to be brought into service.
Virginia's Governor John Letcher
finally called the Liberty Hall Volunteers to action on June 2, 1861 and
ordered them to
proceed to Harper's Ferry, where the Valley forces were mobilizing.
</p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p>
When the Liberty Hall Volunteers company was formed in April of 1861,
Professor Alexander Nelson assumed the role of captain, but he was forced
to resign in June because he contracted erysipelas (Bean 7, 9, 11).
James White, a professor of Greek at Washington College, was
commissioned as a
Captain when Company I was organized on June 2, 1861.  Because he was
thirty-two at the time that he became a captain, White was nicknamed
"Old Zeus." He resigned on September
6, 1861 due to illness (see Turner).
</p></note>

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> Andrew Brooks may be referring to the fighting
that broke out near Hampton Roads, Virginia on May 18, 1861 (Denney, 44).
Harper's Ferry was a crucial site during the Civil War, not only because
it was formerly a Federal arsenel, but because it was "the northern gateway to the
Valley of Virginia" (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 4).
On April 18, 1861, even before Virginia seceded from the union,
Virginia militia members took control of Harper's Ferry in order to win possession
of the arsenel. Andrew's speculations demonstrate how rumors
were swirling in the early days
of the war.
</p></note>

<note n="4" id="n4" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[4]</seg><p> Classes at Washington College were suspended on June 1
(Turner, 39).
