                <p>Well I sit by my fire in chamber now, 11 <abbr expan="o'clock">Ohc</abbr> PM
                    whilst little F sleeps sweetly by my side &amp; all is quiet through the
                    house. I think fondly of the &amp; our little ones with you hope you are all
                    well. I heard with joy the other day that you were all well &amp; that you
                    had a young lady with you who I think you can well rely upon &amp; who will
                    doubtless remain with you. her friend<hi rend="super">s</hi> are glad to hear of
                    her good home</p>

                <p>We are quite well here &amp; doing as well as can be expected under the
                    circumstances. F studies hard &amp; learns fast I think you may well be
                    proud of such a lad</p>

                <p>I wrote you at length a few days<pb n="2"/> ago, &amp; enclosed several
                    drafts for you to collect &amp; I was not here when the letter was started
                    &amp; I omitted to endorse my name on the back of each one which is
                    necessary <add hand="h1" place="inline">to</add>
                    <del hand="h1">for</del> their collection. You have some one to endorse them

                    in that letter. try &amp; let me know soon if they come to hand &amp;c
                    &amp;c-</p>

                <p>I have no directions to give about our matters. You have been managing so long
                    &amp; so well that it is not necessary for me to direct at least whilst
                    absent do the best you can &amp; as you may desire, I hope it will not be
                    long until we will be together. I am <orig reg="sorely">soarly</orig>
