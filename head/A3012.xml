    <p> Your very kind and interesting letter was received several days ago, the perusal of which
     gave me much pleasure I assure you. I had began to think you had forgotten me, or perhaps
     something else had turned up to cause the delay. Well I have no news of importance to write you
     this morning. Every thing is going on quietly, &amp; in the same old way. The weather has
     been very cold for several weeks. Snowing, freezing &amp; raining, about every other day;
     the weather &amp; roads together has been the cause of our remaining so quietly for the
     past month the roads are in such a <pb n="2"/>condition at present that it would be impossible
     for an army to move. Hope they may continue so for some time to come, so that some of our boys
     may get home on furlough. They are granting to two in each company at present. <abbr
      expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Williams &amp; Major Newton starts for home this morning on a
     twenty days furlough. Hope they may have a <hi rend="underline">good</hi>
     <hi rend="underline">time</hi>. I dont expect to be able to get home any more 'till the war
     closes if then. There is no officer with the <abbr expan="Company">Comp.</abbr> except myself
     &amp; of course they wont let me leave. I am getting mighty tired of my position, I assure
     you. <orig reg="There">Their</orig> have been no promotions as yet, since the resignation of
      <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> M Kenny.</p>
    <p><pb n="3"/>You wished to know how <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Strickler was getting
     along. Well, I presume; as I have not heard anything to the contrary. You can tell his <unclear>
      <hi rend="underline">Buck</hi>
     </unclear> that he was well the last time I saw him &amp; is getting as fat as a <hi
      rend="underline">
      <unclear>Squire</unclear>
     </hi>.</p>
    <p>I hear Miss Jennie is having lots of <unclear>beaux</unclear> since she went to Newport. Am
      <orig reg="afraid">affraid</orig> Cousin Jimmi will be like the handwriting on <del hand="h1"
      >the</del> wall. "weighed in the balance &amp; found wanting."</p>
    <p>Suppose you had a nice time while you were in the <unclear>Berry</unclear> neighborhood, wish
     I could have been with you, know I would have had lots of fun &amp; plenty good things to
     eat. I heard <hi rend="underline">Sugar</hi> had been to see you. Said he intended to <pb n="4"
     />make one more desperate effort to obtain the "heavenly prize", &amp; if he failed, he
     intended to give up the chase. Please tell us the result in your next.</p>
    <p>I <orig reg="read">red</orig> a letter from <hi rend="underline">Tom</hi> a day or two ago,
     says he has fine times up there except he is most of the time at the <hi rend="underline">Old</hi>
     <hi rend="underline">Store</hi>. Cant find out which one he is after. Well I hope he may be
     more successful than in times past.</p>
    <p>You said you intended to send me a New Years Gift - if it was nothing but a "black eyed pea".
     I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> want <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> of that kind, got
     plenty of them, must send one something better than that. I wont send you any more kisses as
     you made so much fun of the <unclear>ones</unclear> I did send. Hope you will excuse my
     uninteresting letter. You did not request me to answer in your last but I presumed you forgot
     it.</p>
