                <p>I have been here for several Weeks and have been watching the general course of
                    events, by reading the <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Philada</abbr> Enquirer,
                    Press, &amp; New York Tribune &amp; occasionally the Herald, &amp; I
                    can assure you <orig reg="Crittenden's">Crittendon's</orig> course is the most
                    proper and popular at this time, and if you <orig reg="can't">cant</orig>
                    compromise, so as to retain Virginia, Maryland Tennessee Kentucky and Missouri-
                    in the Union, Then let the Southern Fire eaters and rabid abolitionists and
                    uncompromising <hi rend="underline">shall I say</hi>, Black Republicans go their
                    own way to <orig reg="destruction">distruction</orig> for that will be their
                        <orig reg="destruction">distruction</orig> &amp; I fear of the whole
                    country, but before this let the Middle Portion of the Republic go for a
                    separate, Independant, &amp; free country or Join Canida &amp; come
                    under Queen Victoria and secure us life liberty equality &amp; protection,
                    Our Country must have a larger <orig reg="Military">Millitary</orig> force and
                    Scott &amp; Anderson, to wield the helm of State, no more temporizing with
                    Trators &amp; disunionist. King of your house, used the right language, to

                    accepting pay and compensation to dismember the union it is disgraceful and I
                    might say horrible when the consequences are taken into account, I hope still
                    for peace &amp; my voices for<pb n="2"/>this still, but the over ruling
                    power of the conservatives--I have as you know always been a Whig &amp; a
                    Jackson Man, but now I feel, looking at Hickman Stephens &amp; other
                    Republicans, like joining the Democrats, the <unclear>Bigler</unclear>
                    Stripe--Douglas is rather too versatile to be trusted - I have now to turn to
                    another matter relating to yourself, I seen the letter from Mr Gehr to you, it
                    was full and frank, and in unison, entirely with my feelings, and he has <orig
                        reg="today">to day</orig> written, a letter, more conservative than the
                    other, to <abbr expan="Abraham">A.</abbr> Lincoln, it will not be libellous but
                    equally as strong, showing up McClure and the opinion of him here, and that no
                    other man than yourself was ever spoken or thought of for Mr Lincoln's Cabinet
                    and <orig reg="McClure's">McClures</orig> antipathy arises against your,
                    appointment from personal, <orig reg="considerations">considirations</orig>
                    alone, others here may also quietly advise Mr Lincoln, excuse my freedom and
                    liberty as all I have said and done towards this matter has arisen from old and
                    long established friendship, which I shall carry with me to the grave. I am now
                    in my 76 year.--I will keep for you a copy of <orig reg="Gehr's">Gehrs</orig>
                    letter to Lincoln,--with sentiment of high regard I am your friend &amp;c</p>
