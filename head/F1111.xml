                <p>Rosenbery responds to some news from home. He then takes time to disparage those
                    whom he considers traitors: men avoiding military service for the nation.
                    Rosenbery also mentions sending money home. He discusses the weather and planned
                    troop movements. As in earlier letters, Rosenbery expresses his confidence that
                    he does the "will of God."</p>

                    <salute>Dear Father:-</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>This morning I seat myself with pen in hand to inform you that I am well, hoping
                    that these few lines may find you all enjoying the same Blessings of Health that
                    I enjoy.</p>
                <p>I received your kind letter of the 8th of November. It affords me much joy to
                    hear from you.</p>
                <p>I began to think that you did not get my letters. I am glad that you got some of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, I sent you ten dollars in a letter and I sent Rachel ten dollars in a
                    letter. I hope that you and Rachel has received them letters.</p>
                <p>I told Rachel to give you five dollars and keep the other five, if she need it.
                    And if she does not need it she can give the ten dollars to you and you will see
                    that it is kept account of as it is hard for me to keep account of it.</p>
                <p>The old soldiers here tell me that we get our pay regular every 2 month.</p>
                <p>Now, about them shoes, you may use them if you can make any use of them in the
                    family.</p>
                <p>I am glad that Mr Cree has taken <orig reg="an">and</orig> interest in having
                    them <orig reg="thieving">theiving</orig> Thomases catched. I think that young
                    William Thomas ought to get preaching <orig reg="license">lisence</orig> he
                    could preach to his comrades in the Huntingdon <orig reg="Jail">Jaile</orig>.</p>
                <p><orig reg="Further">Futhrer</orig>, I would say that Solomon should be <orig
                        reg="well">wll</orig> rewarded for helping to catch the government property.
                    They should all be <orig reg="caught">catched</orig> for if a man does not go
                    when he is drafted or does not pay his fine, he is worse than a Reb. Yes, he is
                    worse than a traitor to his country and should not be permitted to live among
                    loyal men.</p>
                <p>I have not got any letter from Rachel yet. I have written several letters to her.
                    Tell <orig reg="her">he</orig>, I said she should stay about home as much as she
                    could. Although I do not ask her to stay all the time. She can go and attend
                    meetings and <orig reg="visit">viist</orig> her neighbors but not to make a
                    practice of it.</p>
                <p>I believe I have answered this letter so far as you have desired of me in this
                    letter.</p>
                <p>I send you five dollars more. Hope you will receive it safe. This will make
                    twenty-five dollars that I sent to you and Rachel.</p>
                <p>I will keep 3 dollars with me. I think that it will do.</p>
                <p>I wish you to send me some postage stamps. I have forgot <orig reg="whether"
                        >wether</orig> I wrote for stamps yesterday or not.</p>
                <p>I have not written to Abraham or Ashway yet.</p>
                <p>You will please give them my past address. If they write to me I will answer
                    their letter.</p>
                <p>Yesterday was a warm day. Toward evening it began to cloud over and at dusk it
                    began to thunder and lighten and the wind arose and the rain came in <orig
                        reg="torrents">torrests</orig> down.</p>
                <p>I have a <orig reg="middling">midling</orig> comfortable place. It is thundering
                    now. It will soon rain again.</p>
                <p>We got orders to make ready to pack up. We are laying between the <orig
                        reg="Rappahonnock ">Rapahanock</orig> River and the Rapidan. It is so as
                    soon as it stops we cannot tell what minute we must leave.</p>
                <p>I still feel satisfied that I am doing the will of God. I can't sit down to write
                    and <orig reg="interesting">intersting</orig> letter as long as the Army is on
                    the move.</p>
                <p>I must close for the present. Give my love and respect to my family and <orig
                        reg="all">al</orig> inquiring friends.</p>
                <p>You may look for letters as I will write as often as I can possibly. I would like
                    to write to the neighbors around but I can't have time yet. Write as soon as you
                    can.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Your son till death, Farewell for this time.</salute>
