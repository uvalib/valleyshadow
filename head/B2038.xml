                    Office, 53 John Street, New York) has been working twenty years for the African
                    race. Since the beginning of the Rebellion it has turned special attention to
                    the Freedmen. Whatever a wise Christian benevolence prompts in their behalf, by
                    way of Common Schools, Normal Schools, Orphan Homes, Relief of the suffering,
                    and direct religious effort, the Association undertakes, to the full extent of
                    the means furnished by the friends of the colored people. The Teachers and
                    Missionaries last year numbered over 500.

                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I have already stated the trouble that I have had in regard to the colored people
                    about a school house. I never before was turned out-doors by any-body until the
                    school with their teacher was driven out of the church by the colored minister.</p>

                <p>And the school will never be very successful until there is a school house here.
                    We want a building large enough to accomodate 800 scholars. Now how can we
                    obtain it. The colored people ar already in debt - having just purchased a
                    cemetery for $1200 and the baptist denomination are now <pb n="2"/>trying to
                    build a church.</p>

                <p>I have made application to the <abbr expan="Government">Gov't</abbr> for aid and
                    find the appropriation exhausted.</p>

                <p>The colored people have land here, now, can any money for the building of <hi
                        rend="underline">school</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">houses</hi> be obtained from the Peabody fund on any
                    condition, and if so, on what condition.</p>

                <p>Have you any circulars or printed information.</p>

                <p>There is I suppose an <abbr expan="Agent">Agt.</abbr> in this city, but I am
                    entirely unacquainted with the business methods of applying for this fund or
                    with the specific object of it further than the newspaper <abbr expan="account"
                        >acct</abbr> of such a fund having been left for the benefit of schools in
                    the country.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>If it can be properly used for such a purpose I would like to obtain something
                    for a school building.</p>
