              <p>The numerical date [1862 Apr 20] was added by a later archivist or family member, but
        Smiley's discussion of the Grant vs. Lee campaign suggests that the letter was instead

    <p>I will endeavor to write you a few lines once more to let you know how I am getting along. I
     am well at present and hope that this may find you in the enjoyment of good health. We are
     still in our winter <unclear>quarters with no immediate prospect</unclear> of a move, except on
     picket which will be next week. Our time at present is pretty well taken up with drills and
     police duty. We have two drills each day and dress parade in the evening<pb n="2" entity="Smiley5b" pid="uva-lib:503094"/>
      There is preaching nearly every day or night as it suits. The
     preaching is pretty well attended and pretty good attendance is had during the services. The
     weather for the past week has been very fine but it has gotten colder the last day or two and
      <orig reg="today">to day</orig> looks as if we <del hand="h1">we</del> would have snow I do
     not think there will be much fruit this year <orig reg="especially">especialy</orig> in the
     part of the country as it has been so cool that I think it would all be killed. Our sharp
     Shooters are now out <orig reg="practicing">practising</orig> firing at a target which reminds
     us very much of the commencement of a battle but it is to<pb n="3" entity="Smiley5c" pid="uva-lib:503095"/>
     be hoped that we are not to have many more battles to fight as from
     late northern news they are more unsettled now than they have been for some time past. General
     Grant seems to be making great preparation for an active campaign but some persons think it is
     only done for a show; while the real plan is to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the first <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> here, and I suppose it true that a good many troops
     are being sent here to <unclear>strengthen</unclear> Lee's army. if it is true I think it is
     the policy of our leaders to assume an offensive <orig reg="attitude">atitude</orig>.<pb n="4" entity="Smiley5d" pid="uva-lib:503096"/>
      But as we are to have a brigade drill this evening, and the hour is
     about come. I will close by asking you to excuse all mistakes, bad writing, <orig reg="etc."
      >&amp;c.</orig></p>
    <p>Give my love to aunt Ann, Uncle Jame's family and any one else who may think worthwhile to
     ask for me, </p>

    <closer>
     <salute>&amp; also receive a due share yourself from your affectionate nephew</salute>
