                <p>Nelson Irwin writes a very poignant and wrenching letter to General Schofield,
                    the head of the Potomac Military District, pleading for justice and protection
                    for blacks. He refers to an upcoming trial in Staunton and claims that blacks
                    live under a "reign of terror". Irwin asks Schofield to use military power to
                    intervene on the side of the law, writing, "We gave to the rich white man our
                    best years, our strength, our youth, our sweat, and now that we are free, we get
                    in return meanness, tyranny and injustice." Judging from the papertrail, this
                    letter was passed all the way to Orlando Brown.</p>

                <p>Living within your military department, I am forced to appeal to you in my own
                    behalf. My case and cause are those of thousands and just as I am <orig
                        reg="affected">effected</orig> they will be <orig reg="affected"
                    >effected</orig> also. There is a deep laid organization here that governs and
                    controls every thing by might in defiance of truth and justice. On any, even the
                    least pretense a black man is taken up and imprisoned. His color is his
                    condemnation, and every lawless act committed he is accused of. At present my
                        <orig reg="brethren">brethern</orig> are living in a reign of terror and
                    many of them are locked up in Stauton <orig reg="Jail">Gaol</orig>.</p>

                <p>An act of theft has been committed here by one or two black men and lo! four are
                    taken up and all of us are accused. Some of us had to fly, who were and are as
                    innocent of the crime as you are. The Freedmen's bureau is ineffective, laughed
                    at and despised. On the first Monday of November these men are to be tried, and
                    in view of their case we cannot expect justice unless the strong arm of military
                    protection is reached out to us. We gave to the rich white man our best years,
                    our strength, our youth, our sweat, and now that we are free, we get in return
                        <orig reg="meanness">meaness</orig>, tyranny and injustice.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>And now General, instruct the officers of Bureau and let them insist on justice.
                    Some of our men are in a state of perpetual terror. If you turn your back on us,
                    who can we appeal to. If we have commited a violation of law let us be judged
                    impartially by the laws, but let us not be condemned with out a cause. From this
                    depth of degredation we look to you, and in the name of suffering humanity, I
                    trust I do not write in vain.</p>

                <p>The name of those imprisoned are Reuben Hill, James Burgy, Joe Wilson is out as
                    State evidence, and mind you a black man's oath before the war would not be
                    believed and now they would degrade him to be a liar. General we only ask for
                    justice. See that we will have it and all will be yet well. There is no
                    accusation against me and there never was. I am black but in my heart there is
                    not stain of infamy.</p>
