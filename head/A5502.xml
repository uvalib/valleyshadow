                </opener>

                <p>I am much indebted to you for your letter -- It relieved my mind in regard to the
                    children, who, I hope are by this time quite well.</p>

                <p>I received no Staunton paper last night &amp; therefore am quite in the dark
                    as to what our people are doing in Augusta-</p>

                <p>When I first arrived in Richmond I found the most alarming excitement prevailing,
                    which threatened the most disastrous results -- All direct opposition was
                    fruitless. We had for the time, to give way -- <unclear>Gradually</unclear>
                    however we gained strength, &amp; now I think the conservative party is in
                    the majority &amp; will be able to prevent any further mischief -- It will
                    now be for the people to decide what shall be the character of the convention to
                    be elected on 4<hi rend="super">th</hi>
                    <abbr expan="February">Feby</abbr>. I sincerely hope the union party will
                    succeed in electing a majority against secession-</p>

                <p>The weather here has been dreadful -- yesterday morning it cleared off
                    beautifully, &amp; it was a charming day -- Today is also mild, bright
                    &amp; beautiful -- I hope you will induce your mother to ride on<pb n="2"
                    />the McAdamised road -- She is so negligent of her health, that it is necessary
                    for you &amp; your sisters to stimulate her to "make an effort-</p>

                <p><unclear>Howe</unclear> Peyton is here, &amp; I presume will return to
                    Staunton -- The unsettled condition of the country is the reason he assigns for
                    failing to go to Texas -- He is a decided secessionist -- He says he spent <abbr
                        expan="Christmas">Xmas</abbr> at Mr Towles's &amp; that Mr Towles has
                    been elected a secession delegate to the Louisiana Convention --</p>

                <p>I still hope there will be an accommodation of existing difficulties on the lines
                    of Mr Crittenden's propositions -- The joint committees, of which I am a member,
                    agreed, last night, to report that in the opinion of Virginia Mr Crittenden's
                    plan would be satisfactory --</p>

                <p>The Misses Peyton &amp; your aunt Susan came up to the Capitol this morning
                    -- The girls are looking very blooming &amp; pretty -- I have not seen much
                    of them, as I have been very much engaged -- Mrs Thompson &amp; party will
                    leave tomorrow for Halifax -- She seems in high spirits, &amp; improves very
                    much on acquaintance<pb n="3"/>I hope you &amp; your sisters will write to
                    me as often as you can -- It is a great satisfaction to receive even half a
                    dozen lines every day to assure me that all are well.</p>

                <p>I hope we shall have a recess of the Legislature in a week or ten days, though I
                    am not by any means certain of this fact -- It would be very gratifying to me to
                    return home for a week or ten days --</p>

                <p>I have heard nothing from home in regard to the Convention -- I do not know who
                    will be candidates except your uncle John, &amp; Harman, &amp; Imboden
                    -- As for myself I have no desire to be a member, &amp; shall not seek the
                    position -- If the people desire it, of course I cannot refuse -- I suppose I
                    will get some letters this evening which will give some idea of the state of
                    feeling at home.</p>

                <p>Give my love to all the children &amp; tell them all to write to me. </p>
