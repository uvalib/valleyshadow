                </opener>

                <p>In reply to your favor of yesterday, I have to say that <unclear>Graham</unclear>
                    R. Bailey who is a white man was examined by a justice upon a Peace Warrant, and
                    committed for want of Bail, upon an appeal to the Court, his Counsel stated that
                    Bailey was manifestly a Lunatic and there upon a commissioner (under the Chapter
                    85 Code of <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> 1860) was appointed, who having
                    complied with the law, reported him insane. The Court directed him to be
                    discharged upon the Peace Warrant, but retained in Jail to await the order of
                    the <abbr expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr> of the Lunatic Asylum. The sheriff
                    had the papers he sent them to Dr. Stribling of Staunton who reports that there
                    is room for him and the sheriff has made <pb n="2"/>arrangements to take him to
                    Staunton in a few days.</p>

                <p>He is a poor unfortunate man, is violent, and is firmly impressed with the idea
                    that two men are attemting to take his life - one is said to be dead and the
                    other not in the Commonwealth.</p>

                <p>It is not rare for insane men to complain of ill treatment. W. P.
                    <unclear>Kidd</unclear> is the jailor, Schuler G. Harris and Robt. Johnson are
                    gentlemen in the neighborhood of Fabers Mills where he lived. I do not presume
                    that these gentlemen were aware that he had written to Governor Wells.
                        <unclear>Dissapation</unclear> is said to be the cause of his insanity, and
                    if so, it is to be hoped that Dr. Stribling will soon be able to restore him to
                    his right mind.</p>

                <p>The commission was composed of three intelligent justices, one if not two of them
                    were physicians. You may rely upon it there is no purpose to ill treat but to
                    benefit this unfortunate man.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>He has no estate and is a mechanic and sympathy not unkindness was manifested to
                    him.</p>

                <p>As is generally the case he is unwilling to be taken to the Asylum.</p>
