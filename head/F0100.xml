                <p>Well Jennie I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> quit yet it is not quite bed time and
                    I am alone I have concluded that it is <orig reg="as">a</orig> well to be
                    writing to you as to be thinking of you till "<hi rend="underline">sleepy</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">time</hi>." The rest of the boys are out in the bake shop
                    at work but my turn comes to work in daytime so I have a good chance to write to
                    my friend. But here comes one of the boys with two letters for me one from
                    Mother and one from my sister Alice - Mother tells me that you are really <orig
                        reg="very">verry</orig> ill this is bad news to come so unexpected you did
                    not tell me all this - and I supposed you were able to go visiting at pleasure -
                    Mother tells me you were bolstered up in that big chair and <orig reg="very"
                        >verry</orig> delicate and in other respects it was just as I expected she
                    was well pleased with "Your Jennie" as she calls you. She is <orig reg="very"
                        >verry</orig> anxious to have you come and live with her a while - she will
                    soon pay you <orig reg="another">an other</orig> visit and I shall hope to hear
                    of your rapid recovery - rest assured dear girl<pb n="2"/> that the love you
                    have so lavishly bestowed upon me is warmly appreciated and with your <orig
                        reg="consent">concent</orig> and that of your parents I should be the
                    happiest man on earth if I could be the <orig reg="husband">housband</orig> of
                    so true hearted a lady as yourself.</p>

                <p>Now Jennie you have heard what I long have wished to say I love you as truly as
                    man can love and I have flattered myself that no one has ever loved me so truly
                    and if you will <orig reg="consent">concent</orig> to become the wife of this
                        "<hi rend="underline">ugly</hi>, <hi rend="underline">mean</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">rascal</hi>" you will make me the happiest man in the
                    Yankee Army.</p>

                <p>Well now it is time for me to retire for if I sleep tomorrow in the bakery the
                    boys will torment the life nearly out of me. Give my regards to all your <orig
                        reg="family">famile</orig> and write soon to</p>
