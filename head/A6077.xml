    <p>I will endeavor this evening to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well
     &amp; hope when this comes to hand it may find you well. I have not heard from you all for
     nearly a month. the last letter I received was dated August 17<hi rend="super">th</hi> There is
     hardly anybody in camp <orig reg="today">to day</orig> as there is a <orig reg="General"
      >Genereal</orig> review of troops and they have all gone. From every appearance I think that
     the army will not remain stationary much longer it is rumored that some of the first Corps has
     already commenced moving but in what direction I cannot say.</p>
    <p>There was a military execution took place in our division last Saturday (10) ten men of the
     third North Carolina regiment were shot for the crime of desertion. They marched around the
     division to the stakes with as much apparent firmness as they would into a battle they knelt
     down, their hands were tied eyes bandaged and then the command was given to the firing party,
     ready; aim, fire,<pb n="2" entity="Smiley51b" pid="uva-lib:503243"/>
      when a hundred and twenty muskets belched forth their leaden storm
     and the poor fellows are dead. They had the privilege of any <orig reg="Chaplain"
     >Chaplan</orig> they wished and they chose a Catholic priest</p>
    <p>The division was then marched past their bodies which lay just as they had fallen.</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>But as I have nothing of interest to write I will close by asking you to write soon to
      your affectionate son</salute>
