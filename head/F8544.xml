                <p>Since I received your letter I suppose you have been to Washington, returned,
                    home &amp; probably gone again, &amp; I have not gone beyond good
                    intentions, in my desire to write to you. Sometime a weariness of body &amp;
                    mind comes over me &amp; then an effort of either is a burden, however the
                    will may be affected in the matter. We fear, you did not go to see Lizzie as in
                    the only letter she had written since, she said nothing about it. But she wrote
                    in a great hurry as usual &amp; she genuinely leaves out much she intends to
                    say. <unclear>We</unclear> think <orig reg="anyone">any one</orig> with a
                    husband, a baby &amp; a house ought to be excused from writing much
                    &amp; often. I <pb n="2"/>wish you could have paid her a visit as (<del
                        hand="h1"/> and incredible as it may seem) she has the name of being quite a
                    housekeeper. She takes great delight in it &amp; she seems as happy as
                    possible. They are very hospitable &amp; their young friends are a great
                    deal there -- &amp; as for the little boy, he is considered by all as sweet,
                    sweeter, sweetest, &amp; is the pet of the Town so you perceive what you
                    missed. No doubt, you were in Washington in the midst of the excitement caused
                    by that tragic affair in High life. I can scarcely think of it as a reality
                    &amp; when I permit my mind to dwell upon it, I am overwhelmed with pity,
                    grief &amp; shame. One of the parties has gone to his last account, with the
                    weight of all his crimes, the others, still within the reach of misery, as
                    regards another world; but as to this, separated by a cause worse than death.
                    Instead of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> recrimination, I feel as though all less guilty
                    ought to return thanks continually for that sustaining &amp; preventing
                    grace which upholds them, in the midst of sin &amp; folly. I do trust it
                    will prove a salutary lesson to society in Washington. <pb n="3"/>Your cousin
                    can go <orig reg="downstairs">down stairs</orig> again, but not yet able to go
                    out. The weather is too uncertain for delicate folks. I had a letter from Lizzie
                    Law last week. She seems to be as settled in her new house as though she had
                    been married for years. I hope the <abbr expan="Captain">Cap.</abbr> will not
                    keep her all to himself. Mr. Tyler has not been very well.-- He thinks of going
                    to the District next week to make arrangements for opening an office in
                    Washington. We have heard several times from Mittie. She is quite pleased with
                    Chicago. She told us in her last, of the failure of Mr. Kennedy who married
                    Libby McPherson, which I was very sorry to hear. Fanny <abbr expan="McPherson"
                        >McP.</abbr> has been in Georgetown &amp; Baltimore, for some time-- I
                    suppose she will soon be at home. The rest are well. Poor cousin Susan Boggs is
                    having anxious days &amp; nights now on account of Jane, who the Dr. thinks
                    is declining-- She has been growing weaker since <abbr expan="January"
                    >Jany</abbr> &amp; had no appetite to sustain her. But, her Ma says, she is
                    ripening for Heaven, &amp; that is a comfort not granted to all. I have been
                    wanting to write to Kate for some time, but could not feel in the spirit for it.
                    I <pb n="4"/>hope she &amp; all are well. Do not let it be long before you
                    pay us the promised visit. It will not be good for you to stay at home &amp;
                    feed your sorrow--. It is too dreary &amp; desolate for you, while the
                    wounds are still fresh, when you are surrounded by <orig reg="everything">every
                        thing</orig>, to remind you constantly of loved ones, now removed from your
                    hearth stone. Not that I wish you to forget either them, or the lessons designed
                    by Him <add hand="h1" place="inline">who called them</add> for your highest good
                    -- far from it -- I think you understand me. There is some talk of an extra
                    session -- if so I suppose you will have to take your seat. Mr. Tyler has been
                    reading recently &amp; continuously with great pleasure "Noctes
                        <unclear>Ambrosian</unclear>" He sometimes bursts out in a loud laugh. Is
                    your Aunt still with you? Remember me to her, Mrs. McC, Maria Wilson &amp;
                    others. Tell Mrs. <unclear>Gilliland</unclear> Nelly Ramsey's family are well
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. Your cousin C- &amp; Mr. T <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> John
                    &amp; myself in love to yours. I am so sorry Mr. Van Wycke does not leave.
                    Let us hear from &amp; see you soon--</p>
