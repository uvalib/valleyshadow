                <p>Yours of the 27th of Last month <unclear>Inst.</unclear> came safely to hand
                    Yesterday, and I Will reply at once. you can only imagine how <orig
                        reg="greedily">greedly</orig> I devoured its contents. And indeed it was a
                    rich Treat to me. It gave me a great <orig reg="deal">deel</orig> of pleasure to
                    peruse it line by line; Every Word was Interesting and cheering to me, For I
                    must confess, it <unclear>arrived</unclear> in a very good time, for I was very
                    much down in the mouth about The fall of Atlanta. Just before, I had been raised
                    to the very highest <orig reg="pinnacle">pinnacule</orig> that imagination could
                    place a man, on the peace question. With the hopes that, Atlanta could hold out
                    This <orig reg="campaign">camppaign</orig>, but alas! all my bright visions of
                    peace was blasted. My hopes of the <orig reg="pleasure">pleasur</orig> of
                    meeting my old <orig reg="friends">Freinds</orig> as a Freeman and enjoying my
                    self as of years <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> by, in <orig reg="their"

                    your <orig reg="cheerful">cheerfull</orig> letter cure me<pb n="2"/>to brighten
                    up <orig reg="again">againe</orig>, and bring back the old cheerful smile on my
                    pug. I Soon banished all despondency, and now, I am Just as hopeful as Ever, and
                    about the Same old <unclear>Sort</unclear>. I heard Good news from Georgia <del

                <p><unclear>Well</unclear> miss Mollie our Division had a Smart little fight on the

                        >untill</orig> We left the 3rd day. the Yanks would not fight. So we Would
                    not Stay any longer, our loss was very small considering the great advantages
                    the Yanks had over us. We had to charge through a open field of half mile under
                    a heavy fire but our whole loss was only 175. our Div was all the troop there.
                    the Yankee paper admit a loss of 300. We Just cleaned them up. I was a spectator
                    of the whole It is an <hi rend="underline">awful</hi>

                    see the boys. I found them all well &amp; in fine Spirits. all hopeful of
                    speedy peace. the old Brigade is <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> up the Spout. very

                    and I find it is misplaced why I must just do the best I can, &amp; not
                    curse the whole human race for what that woman done, no I will not do that for I
                    Love the Ladies; I could not think what young Lady you <unclear>spoke</unclear>
