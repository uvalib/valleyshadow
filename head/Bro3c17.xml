<p>
Your letter by <name type="person">Jimmy<lb/>
Burns</name><ref n="2" target="n2">[2]</ref> was received this evening.<lb/>
Charles' letter came yesterday, after<lb/>
looking for a letter for a week. I had<lb/>
begun to think you had forgotten me, it<lb/>
was so long coming. He mentioned<lb/>
that <name type="person">Johny</name> had gone <del hand="h1">to</del>
somewhere (but<lb/>
didn't say where) except that I would no<lb/>
doubt see him before I got his letter.<lb/>
He didn't tell me what he had gone for,<lb/>
or anything about it, nor did you except<lb/>
that he sent to <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr>
Lee</name> a recom<add place="inline" hand="h1">m</add>endation<lb/>
for my detail.  What<del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> sort of a thing is<lb/>
it and who recommended me. I suppose<lb/>
he was in <name type="place">Richmond</name> and took the contract to<lb/>
the war office.  I <orig reg="haven't">havn't</orig> gotten the letter
you<lb/>
say he wrote me and have never gotten<lb/>
but one letter from him since I left. I have<lb/>
been very anxious to hear from him, and<lb/>
know what is doing at the Furnace. It will<lb/>
now soon be time it was put in blast.

<pb n="2" entity="Bro3c172" pid="uva-lib:502923"/>

When I commenced writing I had just<lb/>
returned from preaching, which we have<lb/>
every night. <name type="person"><abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr>

unable to stand infantry service. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig><lb/>
know who will get his place, if his resignation<lb/>
is accepted. We heard considerable firing<lb/>
across the river yesterday, but <orig reg="haven't">havent</orig> heard the<lb/>
cause. Wednesday morning, I will get<lb/>
the box today -am very much<lb/>
obliged to you all for it -I am not<lb/>
much afraid of it being much like<lb/>
what <del hand="h1">y</del> I get here, there is but one place<lb/>
I ever saw that I got such rations.<lb/>
I am sorry <name type="person">Miss Sue Harden</name> is about to<lb/>

<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> The Stonewall Brigade constructed Camp Winder for
their winter quarters in December of 1862. Located in the forests of
Moss Neck, Camp Winder was easily accessible to the Richmond,
Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad and offered good drainage, wood and
water supplies (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 175).</p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p> James Burns (1841-1864)of Augusta County enlisted in
the 52nd VA Infantry, Company B, in July of 1861 as Third Sergeant. He
was elected Second Lieutenant in May of 1862 and promoted to First
Lieutenant in June of that same year. Burns was wounded in action at
Sharpsburg on September 17, 1862. He is listed as absent on leave in
February of 1863, during which time he could have received a letter from
Eleanor Brooks to deliver to Andrew. During the Spring of 1863, he was
involved in arresting deserters. Burns commanded Company B in the Fall
of 1863 and again in August of 1864. On September 19, 1864, he was
fatally wounded in the stomach at the battle of Winchester (Driver, 97).
</p></note>

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> Dr. Hoge refers to Moses D. Hoge, of the Second
Presbyterian Church in Richmond. James White mentions Dr. Hoge in a
letter to his father-in-law Colonel Reid, on February 17, 1862 (Turner,
93). Dr. Hoge was also featured in an article in
the Republican Vindicator, October 20, 1863, telling of his safe return from
England through the blockading ships. See the "Valley of the Shadow"
newspaper index
(http:&sol;&sol;cti.itc.Virginia.EDU&sol;~ela&sol;newsnews.html).</p></note>

<note n="4" id="n4" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[4]</seg><p> The Staunton Spectator ran an article on the
Reverend Mr. Lacy on November 17, 1863. Reverend Lacy had spoken about
the religious revival among the Confederate soldiers, attributing it to
General Stonewall Jackson's influence. See the "Valley of the Shadow"
newspaper index
(http:&sol;&sol;cti.itc.Virginia.EDU&sol;~ela&sol;newsnews.html).
Bean mentions that a religious revival swept through the Army of
Northern Virginia during the Spring of 1863 (135).</p></note>

<note n="5" id="n5" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[5]</seg><p> James B. Culton was elected Third
Lieutenant upon his enlistement in the 4th VA, Co. I in April of 1862.
He was promoted to Second Lieutenant on August 30, 1862; however, as
Andrew indicates, he resigned on March 16, 1863 (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth
Virginia Infantry</hi>, 47).</p></note>

<note n="6" id="n6" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[6]</seg><p> Mary Susan Brooks (1841-1915) was the Brooks brother's
sister. See Andrew's letter, January 23, 1861 and William's letter, July
8, 1861.</p></note>

<note n="7" id="n7" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[7]</seg><p> Captain James A. Dold (1838-1864) enlisted in the 52
VA, Co. H in 1861 as a Second Sergeant. Advancing rapidly through the
ranks, Dold was eventually elected captain on December 19, 1863. He was
killed in action at Bethesda on May 30, 1864. In the present letter,
Andrew may refer to Dold's leave of February, 1863 (Driver, 108).
James's father was Addison Dold, who is listed in the 1860 census as a
farmer. He may or not be the "Dr. Dold" whom Andrew mentions.</p></note>
