     <salute>My Dear Wife:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p> I promised to write to you from Mr. Rude's, but I did not get here until quite late last
     evening &amp; the wind was very high &amp; the turnpike dust, the very worst I ever saw
     -- fine sand -- filled the air at times, &amp; then I heard that Mr. Rude had gone to
     Synod, so I turned in to every body's home, (emphatically everybody's in these times,) where I
     happened to know the landlord, Mr. <unclear>Crabide</unclear>, so I got a good room &amp;
     clean bed, and as I found a storm, cold &amp; bad, brewing this morning I have kept by a
     good fire in my room, truly thankful that I am so well off, when I see so many hundreds
     tramping along through the mud &amp; rain or travelling in the overloaded stages &amp;
     ambulances -- I went to church, the Old School Lutheran &amp; heard most of a sermon on
     "the good old way", delivered in cadences, seemingly attuned to the organ that accompanied the
     music -- though the organ had <hi rend="underline">stops</hi> that the player used but the
     preacher had none in reading or speaking -- though he got through at the good old hour of 12 m.
     -- It has rained quite steadily all day &amp; the clouds still hang low &amp; <orig
      reg="heavy">heay</orig> on the Massanutten Range that is visible from my window --</p>
    <p> There is no news from the army, all quiet it is said -- <pb n="2"/> Miss "Madam" Belle D --
     and her <unclear>Potter</unclear>, made their appearance at the dinner table, occupying
     "reserved seats" near the head of the board, and having a "private" cup of tea for the use of
     their weak stomachs -- She was quite elegantly dressed &amp; he equally stylish -- I think
     she knew me far down the table, for she never looked up &amp; "very modestly" conversed
     with her paramour -- I have asked no questions about them -- Belle is looking very fresh
     &amp; gay but he is rather thin --</p>
    <p> I spent the night, after leaving home, at Mr. Roler's at Mt. Sidney -- they had buried old
     Mr. Hyde that day -- he got thrown from a wagon &amp; hurt. Dr. Moorman was buried the day
     before &amp; a Mr. Ross was brought home that day -- Charley was at home, he has been
     exempted on account of health, but is uneasy and longs for the excitement of camp life -- wants
     to go on some light duty -- he is now in very good health &amp; is fat. Miss Charlotte is
     about as usual -- very kind &amp; got me a nice supper &amp; breakfast -- Sheffey is
     tall and thin &amp; looks badly -- They have servants &amp; every thing seems to move
     nicely - - Mr. R -- <pb n="3"/> lives in Staunton &amp; does not often get home except for
     a few hours -- he is in the Stable business at the Va. Hotel -- I came Friday to Peale's at the
     cross roads from Harrisonburg to McGaheysville -- had a very pleasant evening there -- where we
     put up when we left <abbr expan="Harrisonburg">H-g</abbr> and went to Conrad's Store The people
     have many surmises as to the object of my passing along taking notes -- &amp; I heard many
     strange reports -- One that I had selected a hill near Dayton for our winter quarters -- that
     report had spread widely. I could hardly make them believe that I only wanted to make a map of
     the country -- they suffered so much from the Yankee invasion of the Valley that they live in
     constant dread of a repetition of it and interpret everything that looks like a backward
     movement as ominous of danger -- they say Jackson is now where he was last year at this time --
     therefore he will run the same round for next year; that is their logic -- <pb n="4"/>
    </p>
    <p> I found it quite hard to take the weather again, after two days rest &amp; housed by a
     warm fire &amp; was quite chilly the first day, but got more used to it the second -- had a
     slight attack of <orig reg="diarrhea">diarhaea</orig>, but "the remedy" in the bottle checked
     it, and I am feeling very well now -- as well as such a raw and <orig reg="disagreeable"
      >disagreable</orig> day will allow one to feel --</p>
    <p> I hope you did not get the blues badly after I left -- you must not get into such bad habits
     -- for I may be able to make short trips home every now and then, but if they depress as much
     as they enliven, or perhaps more, it <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> do -- So cheer up and keep
     in good spirits -- the war must &amp; will end before long, one or two years more at the
     most, and if a Kind Providence spares our lives we may hope to again enjoy the blessing of
     peace, and with a keener relish from having experienced the evils and privations of a horrid
     war --.</p>
    <p> Write to me soon, I expect to get to Camp in one week -- not much before, as I have quite a
     round to make -- God bless and keep you all Kiss Anna &amp; Nelly for Pa --</p>
    <p> Good bye </p>
