    <p> I seat <orig reg="myself">my self</orig> to <orig reg="inform">in form</orig> am still <orig
      reg="enjoying">injoying</orig> good health and wishing when this may reach you it will find
     you <orig reg="enjoying">injoying</orig> the same blessing that our god has bestowed upon me. I
     received your letter yesterday <orig reg="evening">eavening</orig> which was dated the 2nd. I
     was glad to <orig reg="hear">heare </orig> that you all was well and hearty but i was sorry to
      <orig reg="hear">heare</orig> that you was disappointed in my [not] coming home but I thought
     it best to tell you the <orig reg="truth">truthe</orig>. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> see
     any chance of a well man to get away from <orig reg="here">heare</orig>
     <orig reg="without">with out</orig>
     <orig reg="running">runing</orig> off and I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> like to do that
     without a good cause but if sickness get in our family I will strain all the nerves I have I
     will raise the blockades and come home let the consequences be what it may or will try but if
     it is so that I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> get home you must trust in providence. I think
     you will have some <orig reg="neighbors">neighbours</orig> that will give you and you <orig
      reg="need">nead</orig> not be <orig reg="uneasy">oneasy</orig> about me volunteering before i
     see you and the children thats one thing <orig reg="certain">sertain</orig>. <orig
      reg="concerning">conserning</orig> the barger business I have <orig reg="written">riten</orig>
     to you the first of October so I thought you <orig reg="knew">new</orig> that we <orig
      reg="owed">oad</orig> [owed] him. <orig reg="there">their</orig> has <orig reg="been">bin</orig>
     <orig reg="several">severle</orig> letters I sent that I received no answers. I sent some money
     to you with J. Skeles [Skyles] when he was <orig reg="here">heare</orig> last $21 it was. I
     sent 2 other letters one by mail one by F.J. Sheats. <orig reg="write">rite</orig> whether you
     received them or not. we have had some <orig reg="two">too</orig> or three very <orig
      reg="cold">coald</orig>
     <orig reg="weather">wether</orig> snowing and sleating raining as usual. Smith Jones wants some
     20 bushels of corn. he said they would pay the money down when they take it away but i think it
     best for to get the money first as you <orig reg="know">no</orig> him as well as I do. if you
     have the corn to <orig reg="spare">spair</orig>
     <orig reg="write">rite</orig> me and if he pays me i will <orig reg="write">rite</orig> to you
     for he said he would pay when we draw <orig reg="again">a gain</orig>. it is <orig reg="due"
      >dew</orig> us now but its uncertain when we get it.</p>
