     <salute>My darling wife:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I have been thus particular about our present location for two reasons, first to enable Pa to
     tell you precisely where I am, at the forks of the road running off to the Bridge 14 miles from
     Lexington &amp; 10 from <orig reg="Buchanan">Buckannon</orig>, &amp; secondly to test
     my own identity &amp; self possession and equilibrium, which I have very nearly lost, so
     rapidly have events chased each other &amp; so wearying has been the last ten or fifteen
     days. In all my experience of war I have never been so <hi rend="underline">chased</hi>, <hi
      rend="underline">pursed</hi>, <hi rend="underline">dogged</hi>.</p>

    <p>I have given you some little information up to Brattons, near Panther Gap on the <abbr
      expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> Central <abbr expan="Railroad">RR</abbr>. Well, from there they
     chased us through Buffalo Gap where we barely made good our escape from Hunter who had beaten
     Jones the day before, notwithstanding we had prevented the junction of Crooks and Averill, with
     him. From the Gap we had a dead race to get to Middlebrook<pb n="2"/> (but here I remember that
     I wrote you from Middlebrook) before Crooks who turned across the Mountains near Goshen Depot
     to strike the Valley at Middlebrook, &amp; catch us between himself &amp; Hunter, but
     in this he failed &amp; passed on to Staunton, leaving us at Brownsburg (did I write you
     from this place?). Nothing daunted we turned our backward march into a forward one, shewed our
     Ragamuffins on the Hills in one mile of Staunton, driving in the pickets of the enemy, then
     falling back about six miles for the night. This so enraged them that early next morning Crooks
     and Averill 12,000 strong marched out against us, swearing that they would drive McCausland to
     Hell, &amp; really from the way he has put us through from there to this place seems like
     he would be able to keep his word. On the morning of the 10th, at about 9 o'clock, he attacked
     us 6 miles from Staunton, &amp; for three hours the 22nd and 14th held him in front, the
     16th and 17th guarding the flanks, but what availed courage against such odds, 1400 against 12
     to 1300.</p>

    <p>We commenced falling back, calling into the main road all our little army, they pressing us
     heavily in the rear and flanking us by two parallel lines, running each side of the road<pb
      n="3"/> we were on. We were in what may be called <hi rend="underline">a very tight
     place</hi>. If we turned our backs 'twas a ruinous rout; if we moved back fighting, <hi
      rend="underline">slowly</hi>, the flanking columns, one, two thousand, &amp; their other
     fifteen hundred strong (cavalry) would pass &amp; engulf us. Here was a <hi
      rend="underline">dilemma</hi>. Of the two horns, we chose to seek the latter, keeping one
     little squadron well mounted, sternly &amp; slowly getting in the road, &amp; from one
     company to a regiment, as the pressure required, on foot, each side of the road, thus
     retreating &amp; fighting the entire day, for thirty miles. Nearly all the balance of the
     command except horse leaders were engaged in scouting and skirmishing on the flanks. During the
     day we repelled 5 charges &amp; made two, to keep them from closing upon our rear. Night
     brought us to Lexington one mile beyond which we halted, still keeping between that place
     &amp; the foe, where foot sore, hungry &amp; exhausted were determined to rest. After
     seeing that the men had rations for the night, at about 11 o'clock P. M. I threw myself upon
     the ground, exhausted, gloomy &amp; sad. This had been the hardest day of my experience. I
     had been acting as aid throughout the day beside discharging my own duties, in getting off
     stores from Brownsburg which I had accumulated there, &amp; just as I had commenced one
     sweet dream of thee &amp; of home, the <abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr><pb n="4"/> called
     for me to go with him to Lexington to the Institute, to consult with <abbr expan="General"
      >Genl.</abbr> Ship, <abbr expan="commanding">comdg.</abbr> the cadet corps (250), and <abbr
      expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Smith, who had just reached the place from Richmond &amp;
     tendered the services of these brave Boys. Here a long consultation ensued, through which I was
     only enabled to sit by frequent potations of strong (<hi rend="underline">don't look
     cross</hi>) <hi rend="underline">Coffee</hi>, handed round by <abbr expan="General"
     >Genl.</abbr> Smith's fair Daughter (&amp; oh such a pretty foot, too!). Back we went to
     camp and after a brief repose was roused to life by the thunder of Crooks guns close upon us.
     We retired across the river &amp; made the best disposition for checking (we knew we could
     not whip) them we could. About 10 A.M. the battle commenced. We had three pieces, small ones,
     &amp; for 4 hours we had quite a brisk time. Finding our little forces flanked beyond our
     reach, we fell back to this place yesterday evening, and on this Sabbath day we rested; that is
     the troops did. I have been engaged in hunting up and impressing supplies. <abbr expan="Major"
      >Maj.</abbr> Smith CS has joined with wagon trains but this morning the <abbr expan="General"
      >Genl.</abbr> asked me to hold on as <abbr expan="Brigade">Bridg.</abbr> CS for a few days,
     &amp; like a goose I done so, for the sake of seeing the men fed, though nothing else could
     induce me. I should like to write you a long letter but have no paper but will hunt up some
      scraps<pb n="5"/> &amp; give you some few incidents of the various fights, more
     particularly that of Lexington, in which you came very near being reduced several times to the
     necessity of hunting up another husband. Pa knows the river cliffs beyond the Institue, between
     which &amp; the Institute Hill runs a deep ravine. On these cliffs were posted our sharp
     shooters &amp; one piece. Here I must close for the present, the <abbr expan="General"
      >Genl.</abbr> calls me.</p>
    <p>Just in the rear is Institute and other hills rising higher than the Bluffs. About 11 o'clock
     the enemy commenced a severe fire from some six or eight pieces, the shells screaming,
     shrieking, bursting &amp; whizzing all over the crest of the hills above mentioned. (Pa can
     tell you that on the opposite side of the river the country is even higher than our position
     &amp; gave them the advantage). On Institue Hill was generally found the <abbr
      expan="General">Genl.</abbr> &amp; staff. &amp; it was here that you had like to have
     been a widow.<pb n="6"/> The corps of cadets were thrown up here, &amp; here were seen (?)
     the officers, &amp; here fell the shot the thickest. Sitting on my horse in a little wheat
     field, sorta (?) on the southern slopes of the hill, <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Harvie,
     Mr. Marshall &amp; two others by <orig reg="my side">myside</orig>, a <orig reg="rifle"
      >riffle</orig> shell passed so near as to nearly take my hat off. I had only time to observe
     to <abbr expan="Captain Harvie">Capt. H.</abbr> that we should have to move, as they had gotten
     the range, when another came shrieking through the air, passing just before Jeff's head, and
     plunged into the ground, some fifteen feet past me, seemingly, burying itself two or three feet
     ere it exploded; when it did so<pb n="7"/> throwing a large quantity of earth upon everything,
     making a grave nearly large enough to bury horse &amp; man. Poor Jeff, he was completely
      <hi rend="underline">
      <orig reg="paralyzed">paralized</orig>
     </hi> with fright. He had been very restive all day but this was too much &amp; he only
     trembled &amp; perspired in a foam. He shook so terribly that I could hardly keep my seat,
     and for three hours after he was in a perfect <hi rend="underline">quiver</hi>. I have never
     seen anything so frightened. I fear he is a coward, but he, poor fellow, need not be ashamed
     for his betters, or rather his masters, considered it prudent to canter to another part of the
     Hill, only to await a repetition of the same, sitting upon the platform in front of the
     Lexington Hotel, where some of us had dismounted to breathe our weary steeds. The rascals on
     the other side of the River (Pa may remember looking east,<pb n="8"/> or north of east, the
     hills beyond can be seen) got the range of the street completely, &amp; seeing a group of
     horses &amp; men, let fly a shell among us &amp; so fine was the practice (?) that it
     passed over our heads about 5 feet, passing up the street about 100 yards beyond us, striking
     the <orig reg="banister">bannister</orig> of a porch, rolled harmlessly into the street,
     striking the porch of course. Thus was your husband twice saved from destruction, once by the
     depth the shell had buried itself in the earth, and again by a bad fuse, the latter shell not
     bursting.</p>
    <p>Well, here we are, &amp; Crooks &amp; Averill in and around Lexington with between 20
     and 25,000 men. Hunter is or was at Midway, and by sunrise tomorrow we must again confront
     them, but to fall back: but we<pb n="9"/>will fall back like Spartans of old, &amp; fight
     them back into the City of Richmond. Here I shall have to stop again. I am three miles from
     Camp: have just eat supper. 'Tis ten o'clock. I must go to camp. Can't say when I shall finish
     this.</p>
    <p>It occurs to me to finish now, or rather close, for tomorrow brings sterner things. I
     remember you are a Soldier's Wife, hence I shall talk plain. It has always been my habit to
     talk plainly to those I love. Therefore do not let what I am going to say disturb or make you
     sad. I always try to keep my lamp trimmed as well as possible, temporarily at least.</p>

    <p>Here, the Pay <abbr expan="Department">Dept.</abbr> owes me from first of August 63; the
      <abbr expan="Quartermaster">QM</abbr>
     <abbr expan="Department">Dept.</abbr> forage for two<pb n="10"/> horses, about 5 months, at
