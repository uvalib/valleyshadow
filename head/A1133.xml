                <p>So far from adding anything to my despondency, your letter was a source of
                    gratification &amp; satisfaction - Your sentiments harmonize more nearly
                    with mine, than those of <orig reg="anyone">any one</orig> else, &amp; I
                    read your statement of occurrences &amp; remarks upon them, with a
                    consciousness that I am reading truths, &amp; not monstrous exaggerations-
                    The utter disregard for truth, which permits both sides in every contest great
                    or small, to claim a magnificent victory; &amp; for justice, which
                    aggravates every slight <orig reg="irregularity">iregularity</orig> on either
                    side, into a monstrous outrage &amp; crime, illustrates forcibly the
                    degrading tendency of the war - an approach to truth may be attained from the
                    public prints <add hand="h1" place="inline">only</add> by a careful study of
                    details in the accounts of both sides, &amp; deducing conclusions - upon
                    general statements nothing can be founded</p>
                <p>Upon general principles I am led to believe Richmond must fall. Time is all a
                    besieging force of appropriate numbers needs, &amp; that time has been<pb
                        n="2"/> given in a great measure. M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Clellan's
                    reconnaisances have been sufficiently complete for more than a week or ten days,
                    to admit of definite plans &amp; arguments, doubtless now in course of
                    prosecution. Except the battle of Seven Pines, we have read of no engagement
                    near Richmond, &amp; I am satisfied the Yankees have not been idle. I am
                    forced to conclude also that the "Seven Pines" is wholly without other than
                    moral effect. The Yankees were doubtless somewhat worsted, but its <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">effect</add> bears such a proportion to the fate of
                    Richmond, as a skirmish among <unclear>
                        <orig reg="pickets">picquets</orig>
                    </unclear> to an impending battle between <del hand="h1">opposing</del>
                    contiguous armies. I am also so perfectly satisfied that the Confederate <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">generals</add> have already done, &amp; are
                    still doing everything that can be done in the premises, as to make that fact an
                    important consideration in my conclusions. If they could have done so, they
                    would certainly have before this joined battle in full force, &amp; thus
                        <add hand="h1" place="inline">have</add> adopted perhaps the only means of
                    saving the city. Whilst I am writng this may have already been done, but we
                    heard nothing of it.</p>
                <p>I know you have mourned with me over the<pb n="3"/> losses of our regiment at
                    Lewisburg. My first information was that poor Thompson <del hand="h1">was
                    killed</del> and <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Patton's brother were killed,
                    and that Rand was left lying in the field with a broken arm. These things
                    shocked me greatly, &amp; I have been greatly relieved to learn that my
                    information was not correct. We have though to mourn some <add hand="h1"

                    made it necessary for them to retreat but they were so far in advance, as to
                    make their escape<pb n="4"/> with great difficulty, &amp; not without severe
                    loss as the Yankees had nearly closed in behind them. I get this information

                    >have</del>may have heard it long since - I have a warm affection for <del

                    deeply mourn their losses</p>
                <p>I can tell you little or nothing <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of news here, On Sunday <del
                        hand="h1"/> cannonading was heard here. On yesterday morning (Monday) I
                    heard with great distinctness heavy cannonading, very frequent &amp;
                    somewhat continued - We learn the fight on Sunday was Ewell's force with part of
                    Jackson's old command, engaged with Fremont &amp; Rosecrans' forces between
                    Port Republic &amp; Harrisonburg. On yesterday Jackson fought <orig
                        reg="Shields'">Shield's</orig> near Port Republic - Shields came up the
                    Valley from Front Royal on the East side of the South Fork of Shenandoah,
                    &amp; the battle took place on that side - Jackson attacking. To tell the
                    results of these two engagements is a different matter. I hear that the
                    Confederates were victorious in both, - the following are some of the accounts.
                    The <orig reg="rumor">rumour</orig> before the fight on Sunday morning was that
                    Jackson &amp; staff had been captured at their headquarters (this was false
                    of course) - Sunday evening "Enemy <hi rend="underline">badly whipped</hi> took
                    18 cannon" "Enemy <unclear>do</unclear> took three cannon"-<del hand="h1">Monday

                        <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> Shields had" (Shields army at that
                    time not engaged) - Monday morning "Ewell <del hand="h1">whipped</del> &amp;
                    whipped &amp; routed Fremont"- <orig reg="etc., etc., etc.">&amp;c
                        &amp;c &amp;c</orig> Monday evening "Jackson routed Shields, Shields
                    retreating &amp; blocking the road behind him" - Last evening late it was
                    reported Fremont was crossing the North river at a ford between Port Republic
                    "The Valley Turnpike, &amp; it is certain that the bridge across the river
                    at Port Republic was burned by <del hand="h1">--- Jackson ---</del> the
                    Confederates - A victory followed by the <del hand="h1">retreat</del> falling
                    back of the victorious army, &amp; the destruction of the only bridge left
                    in the Valley, is certainly not a remarkable success. The bridge you will see by
                    reference to a recent <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, across Middle river just before its
                    junction with<pb n="5"/> the South fork of Shenandoah river. Ewell fought
                    somewhere along the road from Port Republic to Harrisonburg, &amp; must have
                    fallen back for he would scarcely have burned the bridge behind him. An
                    additional fact is <add hand="h1" place="inline">that</add> sick &amp;
                    wounded <orig reg="etc.">&amp;c</orig> are being removed from Staunton by
                    order of Jackson - it is also said that Jackson received a regiment or two
                    reinforements on yesterday, &amp; more are expected <orig reg="today"
                    >to-day</orig>. These are reports which have reached me distilled through many
                    brains &amp; lips. You can study them for yourself I can draw no conclusions</p>
                <p>I have abandoned all hope of receiving any letters from my wife &amp; sister.
                    My efforts to get them aided as I have been by kind friends have been
                        <unclear>unavailing</unclear>. My family have not heard from me either. The
                    Federal officer at Charleston burned my last letter which reached them <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">in February</add>
                    <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Patton thought the last which I wrote improper
                    &amp; did not feel authorized to send it - on neither side therefore have we
                    received letters for many months. The short letter I have received from my
                    mother who seemed too much affected to write news.</p>
                <p>My kindest regards to all of your family &amp; believe me very truly</p>
