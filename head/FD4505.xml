<p>Orders more sensible today, to march at <abbr expan="6:30 o'clock">6 1/2 o'clk.</abbr> Passed through Greencastle in Franklin <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> where the people all looked very serious, most of the houses closed, but the inhabitants were visible. Fine country well cultivated. An old farmer said he could not blame our army for taking horses <abbr expan="etcetera">&amp;c</abbr> for he had heard the Yankees boast of what they had taken from the Southern people.</p>

<p>A fine day for marching, but only made about 15 miles passed through Marion a village 4 miles from Greencastle &amp; through Chambersburg, a thriving town of perhaps 7 or 8,000 inhabitants, camping 3 miles beyond the latter place. Stores closed but streets and windows filled in with men &amp; women, the latter very common looking, not to compare with our Southern females. <abbr expan="Quarter Master">Q. M.</abbr> &amp; Commissary supplies pressed in C. The men caught some fowles on the road, but were made to offer to pay for them. I am glad to see the men are allowed to walk through wheat fields <abbr expan="etcetera">&amp;c</abbr>, instead of confining them to the muddy roads. Some of the women were very impudent. A few of our men exchanged hats with citizens in a very quiet manner. <abbr expan="It is">'Tis</abbr> said one murder was committed by a southern soldier, but as the parties were drunk I did not here what was done with the men. <abbr expan="It is">'Tis</abbr> also said that some of our men have been bush-whacked, this should not be allowed. Met several droves of horses going South.</p>

<p>I did not mention that a deserter was shot in Garnett's <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr> on the 25th upon halting from the night. The offence was committed some time ago.</p>
