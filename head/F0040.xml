                <p>I received your letter in post time and was glad to hear from you I am well at
                    present and hope these few lines may find you enjoying good health. There is
                    great excitement in camp <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig>. we hear that our
                    troops are in <orig reg="possession">possesion</orig> of Yorktown. they
                    Evacuated their fortifications and retreated about <unclear>18</unclear> miles
                    towards Richmond. they are <pb n="2"/> now stationed on Chickahom<add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">m</add>ny creek. the 3 <abbr
                        expan="Pennsylvania Volunteer Companies" cert="no">P.V.C.</abbr>
                    <del hand="h1">and the</del> are following them up and capturing their men as
                    fast as they can. and Banks and M<hi rend="super">c</hi> Duvall are coming up in
                    the rear. I think against they get Richmond and Yorktown (our troops I mean) it
                    will be the ending of the war. I hope so anyhow. we have orders <orig
                        reg="tonight">to night</orig> to go to the fort tomorrow morning on some
                    business or other I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know what. there is no use of
                    guessing for we <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> know till we get there. some of
                    the <orig reg="rebels'">rebbels</orig> gunboats <orig reg="were">was</orig> seen
                    off Crany Island <orig reg="today">to day</orig> but they showed no sign of
                    fight. There is a report that they are Evacuated <unclear>Senals</unclear> Point
                    but there is no telling how true it is. for as I often say you <orig reg="can't"
                        >cant</orig> believe anything you hear, <orig reg="until">untill</orig> it
                    is proved. we were mustered for two months more pay on the 30 of last month. we
                    will be payed in less than 15 days. now<pb n="3"/> there is pretty good pasture
                    down here in some places. now we were out <del hand="h1">theday</del> today
                    letting our horses have a little. it is pretty warm here. we are beginning to
                    try our luck fishing now some of the Regiment is out all the time. we catch
                    eels, cat fish, and spots, and <orig reg="sometimes">some times</orig>

                    than him and me had at the old warehouse. Give my love to Jane. to Ben, also, my
                    love to Fred. tell old XJ I send my love to him. and I am looking for that woman
                    he said he was going to send me. tell him to hurry up, for I am waiting <orig
                        reg="very">verry</orig> patiently. tell old Jimmy I send my love to him.
                    tell old Jimmy that the one he had his eye on says he is no man <orig
