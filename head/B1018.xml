                <p>Jackson's report notes a general decline in relations between whites and blacks
                    in Augusta and Highland Counties. He reports that conservative whites have
                    turned the "energy of Rebellion" against blacks and any union loyalists, and
                    that the freed population is becoming increasingly frustrated.</p>

                    <orig reg="comprising">comprizing</orig> the counties of Augusta &amp;
                    Highland. The usual yearly settlement of accounts with Freedmen is now
                    commencing and I find the same sharp practice prevails here as in other portions
                    of the State and without apparent dishonesty the Freedman finds himself with
                    little to receive and that little almost impossible to collect in cash. This is
                    one cause why many Freedmen decline making contracts by the year, as day
                    laborers can obtain cash payments, but this irregular mode of employment is a
                    disadvantage to both employer and employed and its general adoption to be
                    regretted.</p>

                <p>Several applications for relief have been made during the month and by me
                    referred to proper county officers <pb n="2"/>who seem impartial in the
                    treatment of White and colored.</p>

                <p>In regard to temperance, freedmen now drink but little whether this is from
                    disposition to refrain or lack of means I cannot say; but can only report my
                    inability to organize a branch of the Lincoln National <abbr expan="Temperance"

                    <abbr expan="Association">Ass<hi rend="super">n</hi>.</abbr> The overshadowing
                    topic is the political aspect of affairs. The whole energy of Rebellion is
                        <unclear>thrown</unclear> with the attempt to array White against Black and
                    every lie which will serve the purpose of agitation is eagerly copied by the
                    press and circulated among the people. Union men and Freedmen are denounced in
                    the papers and at a Conservative meeting held here on the 25th Inst. leading
                    disfranchised persons of the County spoke in the bitterest terms of any white
                    man who would vote with the negroes and committees were organized for each
                    magisterial district ostensibly to canvass on behalf of the conservative
                    interests and bring out every voter against the Constitution, but from the talk
                    in the County, really to terrorize over loyal men <pb n="3"/>white and black.
                    Only yesterday I was <unclear>seriously</unclear> asked by a union man in the
                    county if General Grant could be depended upon as he had been informed that the
                    President had called for 30.000 troops.</p>

                <p>Four <del hand="h1">attempts</del> attacks with pistols have been made during
                    this month by white men upon Freedpeople and if the present systematic agitation
                    continues there must be general disorder or freedmen will not vote at the coming
                    election with regret I must report that the feeling of the colored towards the
                    whites is becoming daily more unfriendly.</p>
