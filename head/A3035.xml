                    <p> Yours of the 12<hi rend="super">th</hi> has come to hand. And believe me it
                         was read with delight - as it was the first, &amp; the only one, that I
                         have received from any source, since Brother was down, so you may well
                         imagine how eager I was to get some news, especially from one who I believe
                         to be a friend if nothing more. I have little <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> news of
                         importance to write you at present. I believe I gave you all the
                         particulars of<pb n="2"/> our late fights in my last letter. We are
                         encamped within a few hundred yards of the Cave at present, have been here
                         for several days. I often think of the time we were at this place,
                         &amp; of the appearance that some of our crowd presented on their way
                         from the <orig reg="hotel">Hotell</orig>. <orig reg="Alas">Alass</orig>;
                         one of our crowd is no more, he has gone the way of all the living. But we
                         trust our loss has been his gain. <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Thompson
                         &amp; Lady were with us yesterday &amp; today, preached for us at
                         the Artiller Camp on yesterday, had a good<pb n="3"/> Sermon. <orig

                         Joining with him in prayer he left for home this evening &amp; can
                         doubtless give you a full history of camp life.</p>
                    <p>I walked out this evening to see some of my friends &amp; accidentally
                         happened on Mrs Brownlee &amp; Cousin Pitt they were at the 25 <abbr

                         know you are tired of such <orig reg="stuff">stuf</orig>. If you all care
