                <p>Once again, Alexander McClure updates Thaddeus Stevens as to the status of
                    President Lincoln's appointments. Wilmot, Stevens, and Cameron are all
                    discussed.</p>

                </opener>

                <p>Yours of the 10<hi rend="super">th</hi> came this morning. I will see to the
                    matter at once, without being too conspicuous to do you <hi rend="underline"
                        >harm</hi>.</p>

                <p>Will Cameron join? or will he not resist? What is his temper? His friends here
                    seem ferocious, and without a policy marked out for them. If he is utterly
                    thrown by Lincoln, a Pennsylvanian will be appointed to mark his contempt for
                        <orig reg="Cameron's">Camerons</orig> trick upon him; if he means to
                    conciliate Cameron, he will appoint none in the State, or what would be worse,
                    will take <orig reg="Cameron's">Camerons</orig> choice, which would be Pollack
                    or Reeder. Until better advised all around, I cant see exactly <pb n="2"/> where
                    we are to come out. I think that if Lincoln were left to himself entirely, he
                    would take Wilmot; but when I left him his mind seemed not to look beyond Wilmot
                    &amp; yourself. I take it that if the Delegation in Congress make anything
                    like a united move it would settle the matter, unless the causes mentioned on
                    the first page should control the decision <unclear>otherwise</unclear>. Until
                    we at once see how the land lies, so that I can act advisedly. As things now
                    are, if I were to take an open stand for any one who could be possibly suspected
                    by <orig reg="Cameron's">Camerons</orig> friends, they would strike at him.</p>

                <p>I am hoping to hear from Lincoln every day. In his letter <pb n="3"/> received on
                    Wednesday, he said he would write me again on the subject very soon. When I hear
                    from him, I will write a telegraph you, as may be best.</p>

                <p>Curtin will be here <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig>. He was involved in <orig
                        reg="Wilmot's">Wilmots</orig> selection to the Senate, &amp; failed.
                    There is some danger of him wanting to strike for Wilmot for the cabinet. But I
                    can hold him at least to neutrality, if Congress has moved with any unanimity.
                    There must not be a contest between Wilmot &amp; yourself.</p>

                <p>We are without a head here and all at loose ends. The state administration
                    seeming to be but sight of in all <orig reg="their">there</orig>
                    <orig reg="differences">differentces</orig>, and every man is in his own book.
                    Will write as soon as I can communicate anything of interest.</p>
