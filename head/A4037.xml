    </opener>

    <p>I got back today from my survey of the battle field in which I have been engaged for more
     than a week past, &amp; employ this evening in bringing up my correspondence, limited as it
     is, I have only written one briefe note, and that to you, since the battles -- for it was
     necessary to use all the diligence in my power to get what I had to do, done &amp; out of
     the way before, any thing else should happen -- It has been very warm &amp; very cool too,
     quite changeable, but still healthy. You have before this, long before, heard of Gen. Jackson's
     death, funeral processions &amp; burial -- he is gone and sleeps in the Valley he loved so
     much -- We miss him all the time &amp; a void is made here which time can hardly fill -- it
     seems not like our "old <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> to any of us &amp; less
     to me than to any one else, for my tent mate is gone as well as my General -- I do not know
     whether I shall stay here or not, I shall for the present. Gen. A.P. Hill is in command of our
     Corps, he is an able General &amp; will fill well the place of Gen <abbr expan="Jackson"
     >J.</abbr> in a purely military point of view, but he is not a "man of God" like &amp;
     wears not "the sword of the Lord and of Gideon", but still we have Gen. Lee, a <hi
      rend="underline">good</hi> man &amp; true, faithful in all things &amp; we trust Gen.
     Jackson "still lives" to plead our cause. Our success was a decided one, the Yankess had
     exhausted every appliance to make Hooker's Army complete &amp; it had the power of numbers,
     he could not have managed more men &amp; yet we routed &amp; defeated them at every
     point and compelled them to seek safety in flight, and though we had a large number of men
     wounded, yet many of them were slight &amp; a large number have already returned to
     duty-our loss in killed was disproportionately small, less than usual for the numbers engaged,
     though the loss of officers was remarkably large. Some that we thought killed were only
     captured &amp; will soon be back. Gen. Jackson was riding ahead of his men after we had
     routed the enemy &amp; pursued them some 2 miles when, it having become twilight he
     suddenly came on the enemy's skirmishers &amp; being appraised of it by some one he turned
     back, when a line<pb n="2"/>of our men on the side of the road mistook him &amp; his staff
     for the Yankess coming back &amp; fired on them, he then went towards the other side of the
     road &amp; was fired on again -- by our own men -- Boswell had just gone to report to Gen.
     A. P. Hill who was putting his men in front at the time -- taking the place of Rodes' men who
     had been in the front during the day &amp; he was a little behind Gen. <abbr
      expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> when it is supposed his horse rushed forward &amp; thus brought
     him under the fire of the volley of musketry the enemy opened very soon after our men fired --
     Maj. Pendleton &amp; myself came riding up a little distance behind, a few rods &amp;
     came up to Gen. Jackson a moment before the Yankee Volley opened &amp; I had started back
     after Dr. McGuire as the enemy opened several pieces of artillery on us in the road, a short
     distance off, with grape &amp; canister, one of the most terrific storms of such missles I
     ever saw -- and I was only surprised that every one exposed to it was not destroyed for it
     raked the road which was full of soldiers, artillery, officers on horseback &amp;c -- I
     hope to never be in such a place again. I went to the hospital where Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson"
      >J.</abbr> was taken &amp; then to where Gen. Lee was, that night, aftermidnight, having
     to go a long ways &amp; I did not get back to look for Boswell until noon the next day, in
     fact the enemy had possesion of the place where he was killed until about the time -- I found
     him looking perfectly natural, a smile on his face -- I have no doubt he was instantly killed,
     for two bullets went through his memorandum book in his side pocket &amp; then through his
     heart. I got an ambulance and took his body to a nice family grave-yard, Mr. Lacy's brother's
     and there had a grave dug &amp; wrapped his over coat closely around him, putting the cape
     over his head &amp; buried him thus, in all the martial dress, lowering him to his resting
     place in a shelter tent I picked up on the field of battle, and then spreading it over him --
     Mr. Lacy made a noble prayer &amp; we finished our sad duty just as the moon rose over the
     distant hill of his own loved native county, Mr. Lacy, Mr. Brown &amp; myself &amp; the
     two men that dug the grave were all that were there &amp; we freely wept a we left his
     manly form to await the last trump -- he was a Christian &amp; has gained by the exchange
     of worlds, I doubt not -- and so too has our "Great Leader" for this life was to him one of
     constant toil and anxious care for the welfare of those entrusted to him -- and for the good of
     our beloved country -- they were both true to their country &amp; their God --<pb n="3"/>I
     am sorry the people despond. I see no reason to do so, but, on the contrary, much to cheer and
     gladden -- true lives have been sacrificed, but such is the price of liberty and without it
     there can be no redemption -- <hi rend="underline">all</hi> will mourn, I doubt not, but the
     days must come when sorrow shall be turned into joy. I have not the most distant idea that
     Virginia will be given up, I see nothing to indicate it, but much, very much, that proves
     conclusively, to my mind, that we shall successfully hold it &amp; perhaps make it too warm
     to hold the enemy at the same time -- trust still in God's protecting care -- the enemy has
     gained but little ground here, in Va. I mean &amp; holds that at our discretion, as proven
     by the successful movement of Imboden &amp; Jones, and I do not think the Yankees will ever
     be able to make another successful raid towards Richmond, Stuart will be after them -- he is
     now in the saddle &amp; may be heard from ere long -- he commanded our Corps after Gen.
     Jackson's wound was <orig reg="received">rec'd</orig> for Gen. A. P. Hill was struck by a spent
     ball &amp; bruised so he had to go off the field &amp; nobly did Stuart lead it too.
     The conduct of the enemy is horrible in the Valley, but I hope our day of retribution will come
     soon -- I saw a poor woman yesterday whom the Yankees had robbed of every thing the third time,
     she had been in good circumstances, she was mending an old &amp; tattered dress, the only
     one they had left her she said save the poor one she had on -- they had taken every thing she
     had laid up to eat -- she said she prayed &amp; she hoped it was not a wicked prayer "That
     there migh never be another Yankee child born &amp; that not one of the race might be left
     on the face of the earth by the first day of next June" -- &amp; as she spoke the tears ran
     down her cheeks -- . I wrote to you about the Lindsey place -- I do not want it now &amp; I
     will think about the other -- I send you forty dollars in this letter -- have you used your
     check -- If you put me up a jar of butter make it <orig reg="saltier">salter</orig> &amp;
     hack it harder if you can -- It is late &amp; I am tired -- so my love to you may our
     Heavenly Father bless you. Write soon </p>
