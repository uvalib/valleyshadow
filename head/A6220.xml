                </opener>

                <p>I could scarcely wait until Mr. Jones came Tuesday Evening I was so anxious to
                    get your dear, &amp; welcome letter &amp; see if you were really coming
                    Saturday if you lived. I was so fearful that I should open the letter &amp;
                    read that you could not come this week. I don't know what I should have done
                    with myself if I had been disappointed again. But you are coming. Oh! I am so
                    glad that I can hardly wait for Saturday, I hope &amp; pray God will let you
                    come for I do want you to come with all my heart. I feel like I have not seen
                    you for a year just that long the time seems to me since you were here I am
                    sorry on your account that your brother was not permitted to remain longer with
                    you. but as his stay kept you so long from me I was almost selfish enough to
                    want him gone. I would have wished it if I had not known that he &amp;
                    yourself were transacting business together, &amp; that he is your favorite
                    brother. I love him because he is dear to you, &amp; that brother of yours
                    does <pb n="2"/>not know how dear his brother David is to my heart or he would
                    never think me selfish for wanting you to come while he was with you. but I
                    confess that it would have been very selfish of me to want you to leave him
                    &amp; your business last week after you wrote that he was still there. I was
                    anxious to see you my love very anxious I know well that you were lonely after
                    his departure &amp; for that reason I was sorry to hear that he left, but
                    glad when I knew you could come this week. I hope you &amp; your dear
                    brother may often see eachother in coming years &amp; that your love one for
                    the other may only increase as the years go by. I should like to see, &amp;
                    know him for your dear sake, &amp; hope that pleasure will be mine very
                    soon. I love all who are near, &amp; dear to you. How much I would give to
                    see you <orig reg="today">to day</orig>. You said you would tell me when you
                    come why you have been so long detained you must not forget. Did my letter of
                    last Friday read as if I had no wish or interest in your future <orig
                        reg="welfare">wellfare</orig>? it did not read so, &amp; I did not write
                    so. All &amp; <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> that will promote
                    your interest &amp; success in business, does, &amp; ever will promote
                    my happiness. <orig reg="Anything">Any thing</orig> with which you <pb n="3"
                    />are connected is of interest to me &amp; I only love &amp; admire you
                    the more for your energetic efforts to do something for yourself. &amp; I
                    love to encourage, &amp; sustain you in striving so nobly, for God will also
                    aid your efforts, &amp; bless them with all your heart wishes if you do not
                    make money the one Idol of your life. that is what I so often hope you will
                    never do, &amp; what I alluded to in my letter of Friday, but the ideas you
                    made so clear to me in your letter on the subject have put away such fears from
                    my mind. You will not agree that much wealth often hardens the heart. in that I
                    give way to your better, &amp; stronger judgement in such affairs &amp;
                    will never mention a wrong thought on that subject, but I do agree with you that
                    wealth nor <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> on Earth cannot step between
                    husband, &amp; wife if they truly love <orig reg="each other"
                    >eachother</orig>. Many marry for money, &amp; the gratification wealth
                    gives to selfish purposes, &amp; with all they are not contented or happy
                    how can they be without love? Give me tender &amp; devoted love in my
                    married life tho' it may be humble in situation I would thank, &amp; bless
                    God for it as the greatest gift of all. If my pa should make millions with his
                    Steel process my only wish &amp; hope then would be your love &amp; that
                        <pb n="4"/>of my pa &amp; his family &amp; above all I would only
                    ask for your love &amp; that I might make bright &amp; happy your heart,
                    &amp; home always. These are not mere romantic ideas, but true &amp;
                    sincere feelings of my heart. I have so much to tell you when you come. We have
                    heard from pa since he left. say to Magnus to tell pa I read a long article in
                    the Register <orig reg="today">to day</orig> written by Editor Wartman of
                    Harrisonburg of his visit to Elizabeth Furnace a few days ago. Ma says she wants
                    to see you so much &amp; that you must not stay away so long again. If it is
                    your wish for Mr. Robert Heope to come with you bring him <orig reg="anyone">any
                        one</orig> who comes with you to my home is welcome for your sake. I am
                    sorry you will be so late getting here. Friday &amp; Saturday will be long
                    days to me waiting for you. I wish it was this evening for I am so anxious to
                    see your dear face &amp; I do earnestly hope nothing will ever keep you away
                    from me so long again while I live. It seems that I can't be satisfied in any
                    way when you are not with me my love. Oh how glad, happy &amp; thankful I
                    shall be when you come Saturday so I can see &amp; be with you once more. I
                    will feel like a new creature for I do love you with all my heart, &amp;
                    Soul &amp; it is such a sweet pleasure to be with you who I love so
                    entirely, &amp; devotedly &amp; it is so hard to have you stay only a
                    day &amp; then leave me for two dreary weeks. You must <orig reg="be sure"
                        >besure</orig> &amp; come Saturday May God let you come &amp; guide
                    your way safely, &amp; I will make your visit happy &amp; pleasant to
                    you my love, I desire so much to make you happy. All send love I send a loving
                    kiss to you, with the hope, &amp; prayer that you will soon be here,
                    &amp; make my heart happy as you only can do. I love you with all my Soul.
                    God bless you Ever my love. Come my heart aches to see you again. I think only
                    of you, &amp; shall ever love you while I live</p>
