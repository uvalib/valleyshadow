     <salute>Dear Brother</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I take my seat this morning to write you a few lines. We are all well at present. Ma had the
     headache sunday and could not go to church I hope you have got better, if you have not got out
     of the hospital yet you have had a long heat of it. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Curry is
     expected home in a day or two The northerners made him take the oath and let him go. They took
     several others of the company prisoners. Jim Gordon &amp; a Sweet got more honor in one day
     there than in <orig reg="their">there</orig> whole life at home. It is said they killed thirty.
     There was some ammunition give to Sweet to divide among the company but he got behind a tree
     and used it all himself. when it was done he called for more and when none was to be had he got
     out from behind the tree shook his fist at them and started to run. The ladies of Brownsburg
     are sewing for that company. yesterday and <orig reg="today">to day</orig>, The northerners
     treat the virginia prisoners very well but when they get a <orig reg="hold">holt</orig> of the
     South Carolinians or Georgians they use them up. Since the militia has been called out there is
     no one but old men and little boys about except a few who has been let off. John Lucas went in
     his fathers <unclear>place</unclear> Harvey Fulton says he will go in<pb n="2"  entity="Smiley37b" pid="uva-lib:503203"/>
      Bills place, but Bill <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> let him. I reckon he is afraid to
     stay at home. Pa &amp; Jackie Beard are out mowing today. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig>
     see how farming is to be carried on if <orig reg="there">the</orig>
     <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> more get back than has for the grain has to be got out or the
     people will starve. Pa has got nearly all of his grain in. Oats will soon be ready to cut.
     There is to be preaching at Newport Sunday evening, Mr Junkin has not preached there for more
     than a month The baptists have been turned out of the church up on the hill. He preached Sunday
     but I have not heard where I heard he was going to stand in at <unclear>Mens</unclear>
     <unclear>don</unclear> and preach, so he has a mind to get as close as he can. Baily Reid hung
     himself the night before the militia started so he has been the second of that family who has
     hung himself. The printer of the Staunton Spectator has gone so we are entirely out of a paper.
     Jim Strain is home on a furlough of 20 days to get his harvest in and not the first load was in
     Sunday as I <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> He has been acting the coward run off got to Staunton they sent
     him back again and is at home now. I believe the company <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> want
     him. He is ashamed to show himself at church. But I must close now as it is nearly time for the
     mail to go up. Excuse all bad writing and spelling. Write Soon</p>
