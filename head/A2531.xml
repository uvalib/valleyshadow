    </opener>

    <p>I avail myself of a lull of business, caused by the horrible weather of today, snowing like
     all the world all day, great big flakes, to write to you while I can, for I do not know how
     long I shall have that privilege, or how long before communication will be wholly cut off -- We
     have just <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> a messenger from Winchester, he says they have an
     iron rule there, visiting houses searching everything, marauding over the country &amp;
     insulting people -- Most of those there are Dutch, and they are more brutal than any others --
     but our women there are not afraid of them and tell them freely what they think of them. We
     learn that they have about 21000 men under the command of Rosencranz -- Banks &amp; Shields
     have gone away. We take a number of prisoners every day -- we had today one from Maine, one
     from <abbr expan="Connecticut">Conn</abbr>, one from <abbr expan="Vermont">Vt</abbr>, one from
      <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> and one Dutchman. The <abbr expan="Connecticut"
     >Ct.</abbr> man says the people in <abbr expan="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr> think they will
     conquer us by July but he does not think so now -- he said he would take the oath to the
     Southern Confederacy if we would let him go. I saw <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> Chrisman
     yesterday -- Ralston was elected Capt. in his place and he has gone to Richmond -- All the old
     officers that were not reelected are suffered to go home by Gen. Jackson, and we have had quite
     a stampede of officials -- Baylor was elected Col. of the 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> &amp;
     Harman went home -- all sorts of promotions and <unclear>depressions</unclear> in one <abbr
      expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> -- the Adjutant was made Col. Rev. Dr. R. L. Dabney came here
     today and was made Adjutant Gen. of this Division -- he is a fine man, says the <pb n="2"/> the
     war has taken away all his students at the Seminary and he now comes to the war too -- We are
     getting our army reorganized and will soon have order out of chaos I suppose - The enemy has
     been down this side of McGaheysville, a few of them, but our Cavalry put them to flight -- They
     came into Harrisonburg and have taken some prisoners, men from the country. They will need more
     and more men to keep the county the farther they advance &amp; will find the task of
     subjugation no easy one. One of our Cavalry companies went last Monday to within 6 miles of
     Winchester and there took some prisoners and returned. One of the enemy's sentinels was also
     shot at Harper's Ferry and they will find as they advance a foe in the rear that will annoy
     them as much as the one in front and so the work of subjugation will have to be daily done
     over. It is reported in the Richmond papers that we are again in possession of Nashville, how
     true it is I know not. McClellan is still idle upon the Penninsula, bound down hand and foot by
     the mud of that region, said to be bottomless by those that know -- his large army is being
     increased daily but still he fears to offer battle, knowing as he does that his whole
     reputation hangs on the result -- Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> remarked today that he
     was in the same class with McClellan at West Point and thinks he lacks nerve. The army of Gen
     Ewell is in supporting distance of us, and which one of the armies will join the other to
     strike a blow is uncertain -- One of our present problems of chances for discussion -- for no
     one know what Jackson intends to do. </p>
    <pb n="3"/>
    <p> I shall come home to see you all as soon as some important moves have been made &amp; I
     hope they are not far off and hope also that they will relieve the Valley of the presence of
     the enemy. We heard that Johnson is at West View; too near home to be agreeable -- we now feel
     what it is to have an army in our houses and an enemy thundering at our doors, but then that is
     the best way to have our forces where they cannot be cut off in detail but can assist each
     other -- the day of hope may be followed by a night of despair, but that night is sure to be
     followed by a morning of sunshine -- so trust in God's all-abounding goodness and mercy my
     loved ones and in faith pray for the day of deliverance to speedily come -- If the foe should
     come to your door, outwardly submit, but coldly abhor to the last those that seek our firesides
      <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> slaughter and devastation. Train our children, as you have done, in the ways
     of knowledge, virtue and holiness and so fill up the weary hours of our separation, and may the
     Lord in mercy shorten these days of tribulation. I hope you have no need of anything and that
     you are all being restored to a measure of health. I am extremely anxious to hear from you, and
     I wrote to you to send a letter to Maj<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Harman, Staunton, asking him to
     send it to me by Gen. Jackson's courier. The rain is now beating against our windows and it is
     dark without -- I pity our poor shelterless men. I am enjoying excellent health, am not exposed
      <pb n="4"/> any at night, and do not intend to go into a tent until the weather is better --
     though it costs something more to live so -- paying for our board -- but the constitution is
     saved and that is of more value than a few dollars -- I hope the foe may not visit you -- but
     if <orig reg="they">the</orig> do try and keep them from destroying by claiming protection as a
     lady from the officers and they may give some heed to it -- I do not think it worth while to
     move anything, though you might secrete your provisions if you can -- My love to all -- live in
     the bonds of love and peace and may God's choicest blessings be upon you all I sent Nelly an
     illustrated paper yesterday -- I hope she may get it -- kiss my children for Pa --</p>
