                <p>How's monthly report refers to a case in Augusta County of E. P. Walton,

                    resulting from the lack of a sufficient military presence in the region and
                    requests a military detachment to be stationed in Staunton. Such a detachment
                    would then be capable of deploying to surrounding counties when necessary.</p>

                <p>I have the honor to forward herewith monthly reports of Bureau Affairs as made by
                    the several Assistant Superintendents, and I would respectfully ask your
                    attention to the sufficiently explicit suggestion of Mr. F.S. Tukey, <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asstist Supt</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Sub District">Sub Dist</abbr> "B" in the case of E. P. Walton, and
                    I endorse the proposed action since there is no force <unclear>easily</unclear>
                    available for his arrest, and no Military prison in that Sub District in which
                    he could be confined for his contempt of authority and until he should comply
                    with the decision of the Board of Agents.</p>

                <p>It would seem that no serious disturbances have taken place during the absence of
                    Military Power, and it must also be evident that no effective jurisdiction can
                    be exercised by the officers and agents of this Bureau when unsupported by the
                    presence and use of United States <unclear>forces</unclear>
                    <pb n="2"/>I have therefore again to request that a detachment of troops, number
                    thirty (30) or more, may be sent to Staunton with a commissioned officer who may
                    be empowered to station ten (10) of them at Lexington and to send small squads,
                    when requested, anywhere through Augusta, Highland, Bath, Alleghany and
                    Rockbridge counties.</p>

                <p>The other portions of the District will soon contain a force, including Cavalry,
                    which will suffice for the maintenance of Bureau Power at the most important
                    points, and with the officers on duty and the Agents at their posts will enable
                    me to carry out instructions and protect the Freedmen in all their conceded
                    rights.</p>
