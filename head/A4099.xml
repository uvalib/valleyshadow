    <p>We are off again tomorrow &amp; I shall not be able to write to you for a day or two so I
     will write before I retire I wrote you a few days ago - yours of the 4<hi rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">th</hi>
     </hi>
     <abbr expan="Instant">Ist.</abbr> came a day after Mr. Robinson's 2<hi rend="super">
      <hi rend="underline">nd</hi>
     </hi> "Sunday surprise" -- I wanted to surprise you the 3<hi rend="super">rd</hi> Sunday but
     "Old Jubal" said "no" so I had to moodily submit &amp; forgo a sweet day at home &amp;
     spend a cheerless one in camp but I trust such days will not last always &amp; that a kind
     Providence will permit us to spend many quiet &amp; happy years at home -- all the more <hi
      rend="underline">happy</hi> because we have been compelled to spend so many away from each
     other &amp; have been taught to appreciate the more fully each the <orig reg="other's"
      >others</orig> worth &amp; mutual benefit. I have just written to Allie &amp; hope to
     be able to send it in a few days -- I have told her plainly not to bring her sister with her,
     for she would not meet with a pleasant reception &amp;c &amp;c -- as I told you I would
     -- &amp; have advised her to come on by Winchester -- I wonder if Frank has had to go out
     under the last order calling out all "detailed men." -- Write me. It seems hard my Dear to call
     out the detailed men, but the next 6 weeks determine our fate &amp; every man <hi
      rend="underline">must</hi> come out for that time &amp; do his duty -- if they do all will
     be well &amp; they can then go home in peace &amp; stay there with safety -- see what
     the reserves did at Saltville &amp; so they can do everywhere until this emergency is past
     -- <hi rend="underline">All</hi> must put a shoulder to the wheel &amp; roll on to the end
     of <hi rend="underline">this</hi> campaign &amp; I feel that the <hi rend="underline"
     >end</hi> will then come -- Our <hi rend="underline">men</hi> in the field have lost none of
     their <hi rend="underline">accustomed courage</hi>, their <hi rend="underline">leaders</hi>
     none of their accustomed <hi rend="underline">skill</hi>, but our ranks are depleted by the
     many bloody battles of this mighty campaign &amp; we must have our lines lengthened to
     oppose those of the insolent foe that has added thousands upon thousands to his from every
     household in the North -- The enemy is determined to do all that <hi rend="underline"
     >numbers</hi> can do this year &amp; we <hi rend="underline">must</hi>, <hi
      rend="underline">
      <hi rend="underline">shall</hi>
     </hi>, &amp; <hi rend="underline">will</hi> meet him with even numbers -- <orig reg="not"
      >no</orig> even as figures tell it, but every as moral courage &amp; unconquerable will
     tell it -- So say for me, to all that they <hi rend="underline">must</hi> cheerfully come <hi
      rend="underline">now</hi>, and in two months <hi rend="underline">all</hi> will be well -</p>
    <p> I have written to Maj. bell to attend to Jordan's case &amp; think it will be properly
     cared for -- there will be no getting off now I think -- hope so any how -- <pb n="2"/>I have
     got Charlie here -- had my black horse stolen -- he is doing well -- I may sell him yet -- hope
     to get some more supplies for you and some things to trade on. I spoke to Reed to see about 20
     gallons of molasses when at the lowest -- you can see him -- I shall send William home to cut
     wood &amp; prepare for winter &amp; hope to be able to come &amp; attend to it
     myself -- </p>
    <p> Everything here wears a cheerful aspect, notwithstanding the reverse of last Sunday --
     Rosser drove the Yankees down to Fisher's Hill, killed &amp; captured a large number, got
     hundred of cattle &amp; sheep; wagons &amp; ambulances -- but there the Yankees massed
     all their cavalry -- on him -- 3 Divisions on two small ones &amp; charged him &amp;
     compelled him to retire rapidly &amp; his artillery horses were so <unclear>jaded</unclear>
     they could not pull his guns out on the rough road he was on &amp; the enemy captured them,
     but they got but few <hi rend="underline">men</hi> &amp; he reformed &amp; drove them
     back again -- after they had forced Rosser back they massed on Lomax &amp; served him the
     same way and with the same result -- Our cavalry all of it that was there -- did its duty
     &amp; if the thousands that are improperly away had been their it would not have happened
     -- I trust we shall get an opportunity to retaliate -- Gen. Lee achieved a great success at
     Richmond on Friday &amp; Mosby played havoc with two trains the Yanks sent up the Manassas
     Gap <abbr expan="Railroad">R.R.</abbr> They say Capt. Sam Chapman prayed over 50 of the Yanks
     that he sent to their long home in retaliation for some killing they did at Front Royal -- Sam
     is the 2<hi rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">nd</hi>
     </hi> in command with Mosby -- I am glad Nelly has resumed her studies &amp; I hope Anne
     has too -- they must be very diligent -- Mrs. Strager here gave me a good warm pair of gloves
     -- I suffered terribly from cold hands last Sunday -- It is very pleasant now -- Get all your
     flour &amp; eatables home as soon as you can -- get Mr. Reed to get a Bbl. of flour from
     Mr. Smith -- for you -- Pleasant dreams to you -- &amp; may Heavenly blessings descend upon
     the heads of all the "loved ones at home" -- Write soon -- </p>
