 <p>At least one page is missing, beginning after page three. The page opposite  
 the first page is engraved with the American flag and the song titled "Red,  
 White and Blue." The printing was done by Mumford &amp; Co., Cincinnati. The  
 words of the song are:  
 <lb/> 
 <hi rend="bold">Red, White and Blue.</hi> 
 <lb/> 
 </p> 
 <lg><l>Oh, Columbia! the gem of the Ocean, 
 <lb/> The home of the brave and the free, 
 <lb/> The shrine of each patriot's devotion, 
 <lb/> A world offers homage to thee, 
 <lb/> Thy mandates make heroes assemble 
 <lb/> When liberty's form stands in view, 
 <lb/> Thy banner make tyrants tremble 
 <lb/> When borne by the red, white and blue. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> CHORUS &mdash; When borne by the red, white and blue, 
 <lb/> When borne by the red, white and blue, 
 <lb/> Thy banners make tyrants tremble 
 <lb/> When borne by the red, white and blue. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> When war waged its wide desolation, 
 <lb/> And threatened our land to deform, 
 <lb/> The ark then of Freedom's foundation, 
 <lb/> Columbia rode safe through the storm. 
 <lb/> With her garland of victory o'er her, 
 <lb/> When so proudly she bore her bold crew, 
 <lb/> With her flag proudly floating before her, 
 <lb/> The boast of the red, white and blue. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> The boast of, &amp;c. 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> The wine cup, the wine cup bring hither, 
 <lb/> And fill you it to the brim; 
 <lb/> May the wreath they have won never wither, 
 <lb/> Nor the star of their glory grow dim; 
 <lb/> May the service united not sever, 
 <lb/> And hold to their colors so true! 
 <lb/> The Army and the Navy for ever, 
 <lb/> Three cheers for the red, white and blue, 
 <lb/> 
 <lb/> Three cheers, &amp;c.
