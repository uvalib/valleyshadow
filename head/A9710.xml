                <p>Henry A. Wise, former Governor of Virginia (1856-1860) and Confederate brigadier
                    general, writes to Alexander H. H. Stuart, requesting that Stuart confirm the
                    report of a speech recently given by Stuart in Staunton (see the Valley
                    Virginian, January 28, 1869). Stuart supported the "New Movement" seeking to
                    accept black suffrage in order to restore peace in Virginia. His comments
                    appeared to be critical of Governor Wise. For more information, see Stuart's
                    response (February 5, 1869) and Wise's reply (February 8, 1869).</p>

                <p>The Richmond Enquirer of yesterday called my attention to a report, in the Valley
                    Virginian, of the 28th ult., of your address, on Monday the 25th ult., to the
                    Citizens of Augusta County, at Staunton, "on the New Movement."</p>

                <p>The Editor expressly states he had obtained no notes from you, "to aid him in
                    making a fair report of the <hi rend="underline">substance</hi> of your speech,
                    and that he had ascertained that you had spoken entirely "extemporaneously." He,
                    therefore, was "compelled to rely on memory and very imperfect memoranda, in
                    reproducing the <hi rend="underline">substance</hi> of your remarks."</p>

                <p>Thus, not pretending to give your <hi rend="underline">words</hi> or <hi
                        rend="underline">phrases</hi>, he publishes as a part of the substance of
                    your remarks, on the occasion named, the following passage: - </p>

                <p>"Mr Stuart referred to the opposition which had been made to the mission and
                    action of the "Nine," and to the unjust reflections which had been made on their
                    proceedings. He adverted to the opposite sources from which criticism came.
                    Governors <pb n="2"/><hi rend="underline">Wells</hi> and <hi rend="underline"
                        >Wise</hi> were <hi rend="underline">pulling together in the same team</hi>,
                    and the Richmond Enquirer and the Radical Journal were in full accord in
                    opposing the "Movement," and George Pye, Yankee Allen and D<hi rend="super"
                    >r</hi>. Bayne found coadjutors in Augusta! <hi rend="underline">It was an
                        alliance of the Carpet-baggers and the fire-eaters from which no good could
                        come</hi>! <hi rend="underline">Gov. Wise had written five letters he
                        understood in opposition, but he thought the history of the last eight
                    years</hi> proved that Gov. Wise was not a safe counselor."</p>

                <p>The allusions, personal to me, contained in this report, published in a paper
                    friendly to you in the town of your residence, authorize me to ask you whether
                    it is in <hi rend="underline">substance</hi> correct? or, whether it is approved
                    and sanctioned by you?</p>
