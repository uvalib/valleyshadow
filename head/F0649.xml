                <p>I take the present opportunity to drop a few lines to you in answer to your much
                    esteemed letter of the 21<hi rend="super">st</hi> inst. which came to hand a few
                    days ago, - The very day of the date of my last to Mary Ann. Your letter was a

                        >began</del> begun, timely, and well finished, and better written than this
                    by a long shot! You complain of bad pen, but if you can find a worse one than
                    this I'll then give up.</p>

                <p>I am much pleased to hear that your ring pleases you so well and suits the right
                    finger, - I hope mother's will please her the same, and till this letter reach
                    you, she maybe at home and enjoying it.</p>
                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I am glad to know that you are getting <orig reg="tombstones">toombstones</orig>
                    for Samuel <unclear>to mark</unclear> the hero's resting place and think it
                    sacred. Plant roses and <orig reg="sweet">sween</orig> scenting flowers on his

                <p>You wondered how I'll <del hand="h1">got</del> get my socks. I don't know. Better
                    keep them till you get a good chance to send them. I don't <del hand="h1"

                    </unclear> I have my old ones yet.</p>

                <p>You wonder why I don't write to M. E. Allison. <unclear>
                        <orig reg="Don't">Do'nt</orig>
                    </unclear> write to girls anymore. </p>

                <p>I don't expect to get <add hand="h1" place="inline">home</add> till I am mustered
                    out of service and you know that is a very long time. Then, if God spares my
                    life and health I will come home and stay awhile with you. If the war is not
                    over, <del hand="h1">then</del> till that time I will go again. I will then go
                    in the vet<pb n="3"/>eran corps. <orig reg="In fact">Infact</orig> I would have
                    enlisted long- ago in the veteran corps but I knew if I would mother would
                        <unclear>scold</unclear>. Well as long as the war lasts I think that I
                    cannot get better employment than to fight the minions wickedness under the
                    command of Jeff Davis.</p>

                <p>I have not been very well these last few days. I have a <orig reg="diarrhea"
                        >diarhea</orig> with slight headache but nevertheless I have done my share
                    of picketing. hope to better tomorrow.</p>

                <p>I must now thank Thomas for his little <hi rend="underline">memento</hi> and then
                    close for this time and get supper.</p>

                <p>I forgot to tell you that I only got one letter from any girl since <del
                        hand="h1"/>
                    <unclear>west</unclear> (Clara) and Mary E. Allison did not answer my last.</p>

                <p>Hope this letter may find you all well. Remember me to father, mother, brothers
                    and sisters.</p>
