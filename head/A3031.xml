                <p> I will take this opportunity of answering your welcome note sent in <hi
                        rend="underline">Buck's</hi> note, which I received several days since. I
                    would have answered it sooner, but we were expecting to move our camp every day
                    &amp; I thought perhaps that it would be some satisfaction to you to know
                    where we would be <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> in the future, so I put it off <orig
                        reg="until">untill</orig> the present. Well I suppose I can tell you where
                    our winter quarters will be now. We are encamped about 3 Miles from Winchester,
                    on what is called the "<unclear>Pear</unclear>town" road. We have been engaged
                    for two or three days putting up huts. not withstanding this is the <orig
                        reg="Sabbath">Sabath</orig>, a great many of our men worked all day at them.
                    some building, some chopping &amp; others dragging <orig reg="logs"
                        >loggs</orig>.<pb n="2"/> All seem to be anxious to get in to their new
                    homes. I have nothing much, worth relating about our trip to Bath &amp;
                    Romney except to say that we had a hard time of it. It rained &amp; snowed
                    nearly every day during our entire march - <orig reg="which">wich</orig> was
                    about 26 days. But I suppose Buck has given you all the news worth relating.
                    from the time he joined us in Romney up to the present; so I'll not trouble you
                    with it again. I was greatly in <unclear>hopes</unclear> that I would get home
                    soon to see <hi rend="underline">you</hi> &amp; all the rest of my friends
                    but it is a settled fact now, that this privilege will be denied - unless I
                    reenlist. Well I think I can stand <unclear>through</unclear> my time out.
                    &amp; then I will make a strenuous effort to get there. With this, I will
                    close for the present hoping that I may <hi rend="underline">still</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">hear</hi>
