                <p>I arrived today about 3 o'clock, &amp; found E. extremely ill.-- At one time
                    this afternoon, before my arrival, it was thought she was dying; but she rallied
                    a little.- She thinks, &amp; so said, that she would not die until probably
                    tomorrow. She has a marvelous knowledge of her symptoms &amp; the extent of
                    her strength. She &amp; the rest -- the children especially -- were very
                    glad to see me, &amp; appear comforted by my presence. Mr. Briggs, Mr. Orth
                    &amp; many others are assiduous in their attentions. All their wants are
                    supplied so far as they can be. The <abbr expan="Doctor">D.</abbr> said this
                    evening about tea time that she might go off suddenly or might linger a day or
                    two. She is entirely resigned &amp; composed. The change within the past two
                    weeks is very great, &amp; startled me when I saw it. The seal of Death is
                    upon her now.-- She has lost her voice almost, but her mind is as clear
                    &amp; active as ever. I am going <unclear>around</unclear> there to stay, as
                    she requests.-- Mr. Wallace is pretty well, as the rest are.--</p>

                <p>It began to rain on us about Petersburg, but <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
                    Irwin bought an umbrella, &amp; I did not get <pb n="2"/>wet. The ride is
                    not agreeable, as the roads are in bad condition. I expect to return the other
                    route, taking the morning train &amp; reaching home by tea time.-- I cannot
                    say when I will start.-- We had several passengers, &amp; several others
                    came on in a chartered machine.-- All could not be carried on our sleigh.-- I
                    forgot to bring your cloak, which is at George's hanging up.-- I did not need
                    it, but would have brought it if it had not escaped my memory.</p>

                <p>The <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> &amp; Mr. Curtin are absent, but are
                    expected tomorrow <del hand="h1">afternoon</del> evening.-- My friends are in
                    good spirits, but I had heard little. I meet some of them in a few moments.-- 17
                    Senators <add hand="h1" place="inline">I learn</add> have signed a remonstrance
                    against the reappointment of Mr. Dewitt; and the <abbr expan="Governor"
                    >Gov.</abbr> is said to have mentioned that if he does not renominate him, he
                    will not nominate any citizen of Harrisburg; which, if true, will rule out <abbr
                        expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Colder. But in a few days the <del
                        hand="h1"/> will be resolved. Fortunately, I am prepared for either result
                    -- Give my love to Mother &amp; Charles &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"/></p>
