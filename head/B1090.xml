                <p>Having heard with surprise that complaints have been made against Mr F S. Tukey
                        <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Ast Supt</abbr> of Freedmen's Bureau
                    of this place therefore this is to certify that I am a Union man and was a
                    refugee from here during the war and went to Washington D.C. and was in the
                    service of the U.S. Government <abbr expan="Quarter Master Department">Q. M.
                        Dept</abbr> during nearly the whole of the war. I came back here soon after
                    the surrender and opened a Livery Stable which I kept for awhile and then
                    changed my location and bought out a colored man who had been in the same
                    business here for many years and then hired him to remain with me his extensive
                    acquaintance among the colored people naturally brought many <pb n="2"/>of them
                    around the Stable and gave me a free opportunity to mingle with them in
                    conversation. I often heard many of them speak in the highest terms of Mr Tukey
                    and so far as I recollect never heard one of them say anything against him and I
                    know that his course here during his former period of service was entirely
                    satisfactory to the Union men and Freedmen and also forced the Rebels to respect
                    him. During a portion of the time <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Cook was here he boarded a Government
                    horse in my Stable, which Horse he traded off with another man after he was
                    relieved he came to me in a state of excitement and said some hard things
                    against Mr Tukey among others he said that Mr Tukey had undermined him and lied
                    about him and had reported him to <abbr expan="Head">Hd</abbr> Quarters and
                    swore he would have satisfaction and said he meant to come back here <pb n="3"
                    />again and from all that I have heard since I am satisfied that the comaplaints
                    against Mr Tukey have been made in a spirit of malice and revenge.</p>
