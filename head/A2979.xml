                <p>Truly time has seen many days pass &amp; your letter remained unanswered, I
                    have procrastinated <orig reg="until">untill</orig> I am <orig reg="ashamed"
                        >aschamed</orig> to seat my self to write <orig reg="even">eaven</orig> to
                    the kindest of friends. One request I will ask of you that is to forgive
                    &amp; forget, I intended writing before I left camp. But after I had a
                    chance for a furlough I thought I would wait <orig reg="Until">untill</orig> I
                    got home &amp; then I might come down, But alas it seems that I can never
                    get away from home, I have had very bad health ever since I came home. Some days
                    I suffer with chills &amp; fevers with violent <orig reg="headache"
                        >headeache</orig> &amp; pains in my limbs. Father is very ill with the
                    mumps, though I think he is getting better, It will be my time to have them
                    next, as I never had them, I have had chances to have taken them before, <orig
                        reg="probably">Proberably</orig> I may miss them this time, I <orig
                        reg="won't">wount</orig> care if I <orig reg="were">ware</orig> so
                    fortunate. <pb n="2"/>Well I reckon you think, "What have I been doing towards
                    enjoying myself" since I came home, The blues have been my most constant
                    companion I <orig reg="declare">declair</orig> I never was as lonesome in my
                    life Time seems to stand still on her wheels, Tom is busy <orig reg="plowing"
                        >blowing</orig> so if I wanted to go <orig reg="anywhere">anywhare</orig> I
                    have no horse to <orig reg="ride">wride</orig>. I formed a slight acquaintance
                    with your friend Fannie Seems to be a very nice girl, Kind I think would make a
                    noble <orig reg="coquette">coquet</orig>, But you must not tell her that I ever
                    thought such a thing, well you know that it is natural for self willed man to
                    form an opinion of the fairer <orig reg="sex">sext</orig> on first sight. Well I
                    do not know what to write to <orig reg="interest">interrest</orig> you I <orig
                        reg="promised">promist</orig> to answer the questions that I asked in my
                    last letter in reference to your Cousin Lizzie, But I will wait hoping that I
                    may see you before long. Then I can answer you <orig reg="verbally"
                    >verbaly</orig>, I know that I can <orig reg="satisfy">sadisfy</orig> you in
                    that way better than by writing I suppose you have already form some idea of my
                    reason for asking you. <pb n="3"/>I hope that I may soon get my health &amp;
                    be able to help work some on the farm as we will be late with the spring crop I
                    suppose you <orig reg="were">ware</orig> surprised to hear of me coming home as
                    you wrote that I <orig reg="won't">wount</orig> come home for six months, <del
                        hand="h1">Thare</del> if I could get a furlough. <orig reg="Therefore"
                        >Tharefore</orig>
                    <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> suppose you are very <orig reg="anxious"
                    >ancious</orig> to see me, But for my part I never was as <orig reg="anxious"
                        >ancious</orig> to see you in my life Though you may think my actions do not
                    prove it, Well you must <orig reg="recollect">recolect</orig> my health
                    &amp; more I have no way of getting about, <orig reg="Despair"
                    >Dispair</orig> not I will be down <orig reg="ere">ear</orig> long, And then my
                    long absence will make it a <orig reg="happier">hapier</orig> meeting, Often you
                    are by my side in my nightly dreams them it <orig reg="seems">seemes</orig> that
                    I am happy, But I wake up &amp; find it all delusion I must bring this <orig
                        reg="uninteresting">uninterresing</orig> letter to a close I hope this may
                    find you enjoying your usual good health if I have written anything in this
                    letter to mar your feeling your <orig reg="pardon">parden</orig> I crave</p>
