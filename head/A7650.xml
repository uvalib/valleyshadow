                <p>I suppose George Kilmer has been plowing. if not he should be let the ground at

                <p>I have the painters &amp; paperess full at work here, but it is a large job
                    &amp; it goes slow. it will take full 2 months to get through with it. I am
                    trying to make some change here in the property whilst I am here. <orig
                        reg="don't">dont</orig> know yet what I can do. I went to see the farm
                    &amp; mill which was offered me 6 miles from here. it is good &amp;
                    desirable property for this country but price is too high $45,000<hi

                    &amp; strife on political matters every body is getting along well. all meet
                    me cordially &amp; want me to move up here &amp; live. have been so
                    afflicted that I have not been able to attend much to my business matters Indeed
                    if it was not necessary for me to be at home soon in putting george to farming
                    &amp; fitting up garden fencing &amp; the fences &amp;c at mill I
                    would go to Some of the Springs now As the doctors advise me that Alum water
                    would be of much benefit to me I fear that unless I take great care of my eye I
                    will loose it Such frequent attacks make it quite dangerous</p>

                <p>Tell the children to take care of things right.</p>

                <p>If my lawyers think best for me to remain away to give good reason for continuing
                    my cases I will stay here a few days longer if not I will start for home on
                    monday next if I am able to travel &amp; reach home tuesday</p>

                <p>Do try &amp; write me &amp; let me know how things are going on
                    &amp;c &amp;c-</p>

                <p>If you want to make garden get H Myers to finish the fence I commenced. it runs
