                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report, giving in detail the status in
                    which I found affairs of the Bureau, in the various sub districts which I
                    visited in pursuance of orders subsequently mentioned:</p>

                <p>In obedience to Special Order no. 61 <abbr expan="paragraph">Par.</abbr> 1 Series
                    1866 Head Quarters <abbr expan="Assistant">Asst</abbr> Commissioner State of
                        <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> I proceeded first to Harpers Ferry the
                    Headquarters of Captain G.W. Wells A.Q.M. and Asst Superintendent of Sub
                    District E, 6th District - consisting of Jefferson and Berklee Counties. . . .</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>. . . Head Quarters 6th District Winchester</p>

                <p>Having completed my inspection of the above mentioned locality I proceeded to
                    Winchester <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> the headquarters of Brevet <abbr
                        expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> W. S. How, <abbr expan="Superintendent"
                    >Supt.</abbr> 6th <abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr>. Upon arrival I found <abbr
                        expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> How absent at Staunton, he having established his
                    headquarters there temporarily as more convenient of access for the citizens and
                    freedmen of the more southern portions of his district. Learning that he had
                    taken the more necessary books and papers with him, I proceeded directly to
                    Staunton as the better <unclear>point</unclear> for the time being, from which
                        <pb n="4"/>to learn the actual condition of affairs in the District. Upon
                    arrival at the latter place, I learned that both <abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr>
                    How, and the <abbr expan="Assistant">Asst.</abbr> Superintendent, Mr. Tukey,
                    were absent attending to business in some of the adjacent counties. The former,
                    however, returned to Staunton the evening of my arrival.</p>

                <p>Condition of Freedmen &amp;c<lb/> I made it my business both at Winchester
                    and Staunton and also at various points in my journey down the Valley, to
                    converse with the more respectable and intelligent looking citizens whom I met
                    concerning the condition of the Freedmen, the status of the Bureau, the question
                    of labor as to demand and supply, the condition of the county, &amp;c.
                    Through the rural portions of Frederick, Shenandoah, Rockingham and Augusta
                    counties, I without exception heard that the Freedmen were nearly all employed,
                    indeed all the thrifty and better class, and that it was only the idle and lazy
                    who did not seek employment either regular or irregular who were without it.
                    Even with the impoverished condition of the land, owners and farmers in the
                    Valley, there is a demand for labor and all the Freedmen could be regularly and
                    permanently employed at fair wages - did all desire it.</p>

                <pb n="5"/>

                <p>Expense of the 6th District.<lb/> During the month of April the aggregate
                    expenses of the Bureau in this district have been somewhat reduced. One civilian
                        <abbr expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr> and two clerks Mr. Hall and Mr.
                    Adams have ben discharged. Mr. <unclear>Carse</unclear> has been appointed <abbr
                        expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr> (<abbr expan="Assistant">Asst</abbr>) of
                    Clarke <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> and two messengers have been employed at
                    Woodstock and Harrisonburg at $15 each per month. Net decrease during the month
                    about $120. No further decrease in expenses can be made in this district I
                    believe at present at least, without hindering the operations of the Bureau,
                    except by the substitution of Officers for civilian agents, of which class there
                    are three - at Front Royal, Staunton and Clarke <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr>
                    respectively.</p>

                <p>I would however, respectfully recommend that <abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> How
                    be directed not to employ in future, either clerks or messengers without the
                    approval, before <abbr expan="appointment">appt.</abbr>, of the <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Commissioner">Asst Commissr</abbr>. In this way only can
                    the expenses be kept within the limit rendered necessary by the
                        <unclear>straitened</unclear> condition of Bureau finances.</p>

                <p>Bureau and Quartermaster Property<lb/> The District Superintendent has no stores
                    either Quartermaster or Bureau which can be turned over or disposed of. All the
                    property in his <pb n="6"/>possession, and the amount is but small is necessary
                    for use distribution &amp;c</p>

                <p>Mr. Tukey the <abbr expan="Assistant">Asst.</abbr> Superintendent of Sub-District
                    B did not return to Staunton during my visit - and I had therefore no
                    opportunity of judging of his papers or capacity for his position. He is spoken
                    of favorably by <abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> How his immediate superior.</p>
