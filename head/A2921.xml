                <p>I seat myself this evevning to drop you a few lines to let you know that I am
                    well. I intended to write to you last Saturday but did not get our <del
                        hand="h1"/> until late in the evening so I put it off until this evening. I
                    sent Robert over with the horse this morning and expected to get a letter but
                    was disappoint<add hand="h1" place="inline">ed</add> he said they were all well.
                    Mag received your letter last Thursday and one from N K Trout requesting Mr
                    Cooper &amp; Mr Black to go down to Staunton to attend to your papers. I
                    suppose they would go yesterday or today. I hope that your other papers will be
                    found <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> then go on and you will get home soon. Henry is still at
                    home as busy as ever his detail was out last Thursday he had written
                    <unclear>on</unclear> to have it extended but had not received an answer when I
                    left Frank M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Nutt started back last Friday or Saturday he
                    hardly waited until the wedding was over. Elick went to Staunton last Monday
                    with a load of apples for his Uncle Henry and got the cloth you sent up and went
                    round by Aunt Sallies and got some potatoes and Harriet came in the wagon with
                    Henry <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> by Mr Shueys and brought Miss Eliza &amp; Miss Kittie
                    Anderson, so you see he had a pretty good back load. they <orig reg="stayed"
                        >staid</orig> with us Wednesday night and Thursday and went over to Mr
                    Coopers that night they all went but Charlotte and I they walked and the snow
                    was so slick they could scarcely get along several of them fell down. Miss Eliza
                    said to tell you she missed you very much for she never had been there before
                    when you were away from home she said to you her best respects to you <pb n="2"
                    />I forgot to tell you in my last letter that Lieut Hull had called at the gate
                    he did get off his horse <orig reg="at all">atal</orig> and I did not see him he
                    said he expected <unclear>to see you at</unclear> home. I have not heard from Mr
                    Newton yet but I will try and get some one to go to see him soon and try to
                    hurry him up. Becca &amp; Phebe would like for you to send them $10 worth of
                    stamps and they will send you the money in the letter, Becca says to send half
                    of them in the first letter you write and send the rest some time again. I have
                    just been eating some wedding cake, Sister was at two marriages this evening
                    both at Mrs Hitts they were darkies there are a many weddings among the darkies
                    this week, but what surprises me more than all, Senie Harper &amp; old
                    Walker Helso are to be married this week, he is about 60 years old and she is
                    almost 19 I think she must think the young men will all be killed or perhaps she
                    thought she would marry a man that was not subject to military duty. Pa said to
                    tell you he would have sent you some apples before this time but he heard that
                    you expected to get home if you have to stay they will send you some as soon as
                    he can. Becca says she will write to you in a few days, Phebe wanted to write
                    and send with mine but I told her I would rather she would wait a few days and
                    by then you could hear oftener. I think you certainly have missed getting some
                    of our letters for I have written twice a week nearly every week since you have
                    been gone and Mag once nearly every week. I believe I have given you all the
                    news I expect to be here for some time. If you find any mistakes in this letter
                        <add hand="h1" place="inline">you</add> need not be surprised for Pa
                    &amp; Robert are both playing all send their love. Nothing more at present
                    but remain your affectionate Wife until death</p>
