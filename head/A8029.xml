                <p>Imboden asserts that civil war is eminent, but argues that the South cannot
                    secede solely on the grounds of Lincoln's election. He gives his opinion on how
                    the South should procede in the crisis, and discusses his financial plans for a

                    <salute>Dear John,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>My apology for delaying an answer so long to your letter in the old place of
                    business. I have never been more engaged in my life than Since my return from
                        <abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky</abbr>.</p>
                <p>I read your letter with interest. We are not really so far apart as you suppose.
                    I understand that you are a "Union man"--So am I--You would resist
                    Republicanism--so would I--We neither think <abbr expan="Virginia">V<hi
                            rend="underline">a</hi></abbr> ought to secede--or rather revolt <hi
                        rend="underline">just</hi> now. You think <abbr expan="South">S.</abbr>
                    Carolina ought to go out now, I think not--and here is the only point of
                    difference between us, so far as I can see. That the entire South will speedily
                    have to leave the Confederacy under the present Constitution I entertain no
                    doubt whatever, but I dont think <abbr expan="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr> has
                    put the issue upon a defensible ground--the mere election of a President under
                    the Forms of law &amp;c Hence you have a <hi rend="underline">divided</hi>
                    South. My idea is this--regard Lincoln's election as another step towards that
                    sectional domination to which we never will submit if it be attained, and so
                    regarding it, let us go to work to <hi rend="underline">prepare</hi> for
                    resistance when <hi rend="underline">actual cause</hi> arises. Then you would be
                    prepared for any contingency. Then you would have a <hi rend="underline"
                    >united</hi> South. But<pb n="2"/>to break up the Government for the mere loss
                    of an election is not regarded by thousands as justifiable. It is regarded as a
                    mere pretext on the part of disunionists <hi rend="underline">per se</hi> to
                    precipitate a revolution. You can't make the great mass of the people--
                    especially the non slaveholder's understand the political philosophy of our
                    government, and the nice principles on which the Secessionists are now
                    attempting to act. And there is great danger of creating a party with sympathies
                    for the incoming administration, here in our midst. The non slaveholder will
                    fight for his section as long as the slaveholder if you can convince him that
                        <hi rend="underline">his</hi> political rights are really threatened, as <hi
                        rend="underline">a citizen</hi>. But he is not willing to leave his family
                    &amp; offer his life in a struggle which he believes is a mere contest
                    between politicians for the spoils of office--and while he believes that the
                    successful party ought to have the opportunity to develop its policy. Therefore
                    I am opposed to immediate action. I am for preparation now--defence when the
                    equality of my State is actually denied.</p>
                <p>If I had my way now, I would fight the Republicans thus--I would say to Lincoln
                    "You have been elected by the vote of only about<pb n="3"/>onethird of the
                    people of the <abbr expan="United">U.</abbr> States. Your party is revolutionary
                    in its organization, tendencies &amp; aims. No man of your party ought to
                    fill any national office if it can be prevented. We--the conservative 2/3rds of
                    the American people still control the Senate &amp; <abbr
                        expan="House of Representatives">H. of Reps.</abbr> of the <abbr
                        expan="United">U.</abbr> States. We will use our power in those bodies to
                    protect ourselves. We understand your party aims at the subjugation of 15 States
                    &amp; you as their head are expected to further their objects. We therefore
                    declare war upon you &amp; your party as you have declared war upon us. You
                    shall have no tools of yours in office to aid you in your unholy work. The
                    Senate must confirm all your appointments to office before they are valid. Now
                    Sir! no man of your party is fit for <hi rend="underline">any</hi> office,
                    because his political opinions are destructive of American liberty. The Senate
                    therefore will refuse--as they ought to do, being the <abbr
                        expan="representatives">reps.</abbr> of the Sovereignty of the States which
                    you seek to assail--to confirm to office any man who votes for you. We offer you
                    the range of all other parties from which to select your Cabinet, your
                    ministers, Post Masters, Collectors, Attorneys, Judges &amp;c and we will
                    confirm no others." If this ground was firmly taken &amp; maintained,
                    Lincoln would be<pb n="4"/>utterly powerless. It would soon be understood that
                    not <hi rend="underline">he</hi>, but the <hi rend="underline">Senate</hi> was
                    the real appointive power, and then no man need hesitate about taking office
                    under his administration for he would hold it, not from Lincoln but from the
                    Senate. The President would have a Cabinet to watch him &amp; control him.
                    It may be said such a course would be revolutionary--perhaps it would--but it
                    would be under &amp; within the Constitution. And I would go further if he
                    refused to submit to this control. I would defeat all appropriations of money
                    for <hi rend="underline">all</hi> purposes whatever &amp; thus dissolve the
                    government into its original elements. This would disband the army, destroy the
                    navy, break up the <abbr expan="Post">P.</abbr> Office &amp; Judiciary, and
                    leave each State as it was before the Constitution was adopted, Sovereign
                    &amp; free. All this I would do &amp; do speedily, rather than leave
                    this government in existence &amp; organized to do us all the harm in their
                    power in the event of our revolt now. Hence I think <abbr expan="South Carolina"
                        >S.C.</abbr> &amp;c <unclear>mony</unclear> to go off now till these
                    various modes of resistance have been tried. These are mere hints on the various
                    points mentioned. I have not time to amplify them. But I fear revolution is upon
                    us. I expect Civil War before the 1st of June.<pb n="5"/>I am ready for it, if
                    it comes but it will be awful in its consequences to the whole country. I shall
                    be ruined by it. Instead of leaving my children as I had hoped well provided for
                    they will be left, as I began life, poor, with the wide world before them. But
                    while I cant help looking at such consequences, I would face them all, loose
                    all, even life before I would submit to be less than the political equal of any
                    man who treads American soil. I am afraid the die is cast, and that no power on
                    earth can avert the impending ruin of anarchy &amp; bloodshed. But I forbear
                    dwelling longer on this theme. If I can get the time, I will one of these nights
                    write you my views in full.</p>
                <p>I have been to <abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> and am now engaged in operations
                    there that would make me a fortune in three or four years, but for the political
                    dangers ahead. Mr. McPhail has given me 750 acres of as fine land as the Sun of
                    Heaven even shone upon, lying about 40 miles above the mouth of the Cumberland,
                    with a river front of over a mile. It is the finest timbered land I ever saw.
                    There is $100,000 worth of lumber on it, for staves, ship &amp; Steamboat
                    building &amp;c I ascertained while there, that nearly all the fine<pb n="6"
                    />timber on the Mississippi and all its tributaries has been cut. There is
                    therefore an immense demand for it. The business of getting out staves for
                    France, for wine pipes &amp; butts, is enormous. There are two houses in
                        <abbr expan="New ">N.</abbr>Orleans engaged in the purchase of these staves,
                    employing a capital of half a million a year. They pay for white oak staves 60
                    inches long 4 inches wide &amp; 1 thick, simply split out &amp; not
                    shaved or dressed $75 per 1000. in <abbr expan="New">N.</abbr> Orleans or 70$ at
                    any steamboat landing above within six or eight hundred miles. I have thousands
                    of trees on my land that will make from 800 to 1100 staves to the tree. I have
                    therefore gone largely into that business. Mr. Arnall is my agent &amp;
                    manager. He is now in <abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> at work with from 20 to
                    25 hands. I pay him $75 a month &amp; expenses. I pay for labour $15. a
                    month <hi rend="underline">dry</hi> time &amp; furnish provisions. The hands
                    do their own cooking. Each man is bound to get out 200 staves a day--that is my
                    contract with each. So that I am now getting out from 4000 to 5000. a day. I
                    have an ox team, which I bought, hauling them to the river bank, my own
                    steamboat landing, where steamers pass almost hourly as fast as they are got
                    out. By the 1st of April if the winter is not too hard I will have 320,000 ready
                    for market. In the mean time Arnall, will have me six flat bottomed barges

                    Orleans in April.<pb n="7"/>Unless Civil War breaks out the Cargo will bring me
                    from $22,000 to $24,000 in gold. Out of this I shall have to pay expenses--say
                    $2500. for wages, $500. for provisions &amp; $1000. for boats &amp;
                    hands to <abbr expan="New">N.</abbr> Orleans--leaving me $18,000 or $20,000
                    profit. Wages &amp; other expenses I have to advance this winter &amp;
                    it will run me to the eyelashes to raise the money. If Mr. McPhail had his
                    tobacco in market he would advance me $3000. in money, which sum he told me in
                        <abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> he would still advance me to make up the
                        <abbr expan="amount">amt</abbr> he designs for May at present. But till he
                    markets his tobacco, he will have no funds. It will take 20 hands 5 years to get
                    off all the lumber from the land. In the Spring I will erect a first clap steam
                    saw mill on the land to cut up the logs not fit for staves. I found in
                    Louisville that I could get such a mill for $2050. It will cost about $1500 more
                    to take it down the river &amp; put it to work. It is then my desire to get
                    out ship &amp; steamboat lumber. There is a ship yard now at Paducah 58
                    miles below me where I can sell it all. But when I go out there in April, I may
                    be able to induce the owners of this yard to put up a similar establishment on
                    my own land. If so it will add immensely to its value. If I live I hope in 5
                    years to get 500 acres of river bottom cleared &amp; set in grass. These<pb
                        n="8"/>bottoms bring 2 tons to the acre one year with another--and hay is a
                    cash article on the bank of the river at $20 per ton. It is taken down to the
                    large cotton &amp; Sugar plantations in <abbr expan="Mississippi"
                    >Miss.</abbr> &amp; Louisiana &amp; sold also at Memphis Paducah <abbr
                        expan="New">N.</abbr> Orleans &amp;c. With my land cleared and in grass,
                    I want no better fortune. And I think I can put it in that condition, all under
                    plank fence, with good buildings &amp;c in five years, and pocket in the
                    meantime $10,000 a year from the lumber. Thanks to old <abbr expan="Colonel"
                    >Col</abbr> Carrington who would never let a stick of timber be cut upon this
                    land, &amp; kept on a gent on it to protect it, it is now a fortune. Mr.
                    McPhail has 1590 acres in an other tract 7 miles above mine, that he intends for
                    Nannie &amp; Jennie, unless, as he says my success this year tempts him to
                    follow me in the lumber business--before the girls marry. Arnall will move his
                    family out there next year, if he likes the business.</p>
