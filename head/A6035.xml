    <p>I will endeavor this morning to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well. Hope
     when these come to hand they may find you all in the enjoyment of good health Mr. Lucas arrived
     in camp last night he told me that you were looking for me home this week but I will not be
     there until the fifth or sixth of March if nothing unusual happens. I hope to get there about
     that time. My time would have come next week. but on Sunday, and I thought that I would rather
     wait two or three days and go on a week day. Our brigade will go on picket next wednesday I
     expect, but I do not know whether I will go or not as my shoes are nearly worn out. I had hoped
     to get them fixed but have had no chance</p>

    <p><pb n="2" entity="Smiley7b" pid="uva-lib:503101"/>
      If there is any leather I wish you would have me a pair of shoes
     made. Mr Lucas says you are considerably annoyed by General Imbodens command but it does not
      <orig reg="surprise">surprize</orig> me much as his troops are a pretty rough set a great many
     of them being <orig reg="deserted">deserte</orig> from other armies, and prisoners from Castle
     Thunder. I cannot understand why Charlie Berry prefer going among such a set when he could get
     to a better place and among better companions as for the danger one is not more so than
     another. As it is nearly night I will close by asking you to write soon </p>

    <closer>
     <salute>Nothing more but remain your affectionate brother</salute>
