                <p>Yesterday's papers brought us news of <orig reg="Rosecrans">Roscrans</orig>
                    defeat. I was beginning to hope that our Army in the South west would be
                    successful, but now the worst is known, and we must make up our minds to make
                    the best of what I take to be a pretty severe flogging. Still I do not despair
                    of something turning up that may <unclear>

                <p>I think it was <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Walkenshan, formerly of the

                    tomorrow, since he left Camp. </p>

                <p>Our Chaplain <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev</abbr> McFarland left us <orig
                        reg="today">to day</orig>. He was mustered out of the service, because of
                    the letters he wrote to the "Presbyterian." We are sorry to part with him, as he
                    was a very consistent and conscientious man, but the powers that be ordained
                    that he should leave. He will go to Washington and Philadelphia and probably in
                    the course of a week or two will be in Pittsburgh. He has promised call up at
                    the house. I sent <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> home a "package of <hi rend="underline">old</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">letters</hi>" which I wish you to put away. I also sent
                    that "locket" for fear it might get lost in our marching around. The "<unclear>
