                <p>I feel it is to be a great pleasure to be permitted to write to you. I hope you
                    are well <hi rend="underline">my</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">Dear</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">John</hi>, &amp; will be a <hi rend="underline">brave
                        boy John</hi>. I have no news just waiting to hear all I can from you all.
                        <hi rend="underline">Uncle Temp</hi> got your letter. We are so glad to hear
                    from you write often as you can. John do you get enough to eat &amp; is it
                    fit to eat, how I wish I could send you something <hi rend="underline"
                    >nice</hi>. I saw Sallie <unclear>Harope</unclear> yesterday she said I must
                    remember her to you, I didn't think she had so much feeling. We both cried when
                    we talked of you. <hi rend="underline">John</hi> you dont know how much <pb
                        n="2"/> we all think about you all &amp; I dont suppose you ever think
                    of us but we will excuse you - I know you have something of more importance.
                    John had you heard John Eagan was married, Lizzie Marrit told me she had gotten
                    a paper with his marriage. John what do you think is to become of us at Home. I
                    think we are in as much danger as those who have gone to war. But John we will
                    trust in Providence for protection.</p>

                <p>John little did I think when I saw you last it was to be the last for a long time
                    &amp; perhaps forever but I will not think so for I know I will see you
                    again but <hi rend="underline">John</hi> if we never meet on <hi
                        rend="underline">Earth</hi> may we meet in <hi rend="underline">Heaven</hi>.
                    We are both <unclear>liable</unclear> to <hi rend="underline">Death</hi>
                    &amp; may we prepare to meet again <hi rend="underline">my dear Cousin</hi>.</p>

                    read a letter from George Fitch he told us all the particulars. I must make my
                    letter shorter as I want to write to Charlie &amp; some more of my friends.</p>
