                    but on account of her incumbrance, both children being entirely dependent, the
                    elder a cripple and badly deformed, she could not, probably, secure another
                    place in this neighborhood where she would be able to support her children by
                    her labor, her only resource, and if <hi rend="underline">Mr. Crawford</hi>
                    should discharge her, as he contemplates, in order to secure another servant

                    right to retain the same to meet any exigency that might arise while enroute,
                    for on account of her age, ignorance and inexperience in traveling she might
                    meet with some unforseen trouble or delay enroute.<lb/>If the Bureau concludes
                    to furnish her the necessary transportation, I would respectfully suggest that

                        <hi rend="underline">does support an Institution</hi> for the <hi

                    many suffering freedpeople are not inmates of the Institution that, perhaps
                    should be. It is the class of person who are unable to provide for themselves,
                    all the necessaries of life that apply to this office for aid. And as the Bureau
                    has provided clothing for distribution among destitute freedpeople, of this
                    Division, the same has been given these applicants. It was not the expectation
                    that the within named family would become so indigent as to be dependent on the
                    County for support if they remained here, that prompted me to make the statement
                    contained in my endorsement of 24th ult. ("would become 'partially' dependent on
                        <abbr expan="Government">Govt</abbr> for support") - but that <hi
                        rend="underline">Catharine</hi>, if discharged by her present Employer,
                    would be unable to support her dependent family without aid from some source
                    &amp; as the Bureau is the resort of all freedpeople in distress it is
                    reasonable to suppose she would come too, and impartiality in the administration
                    of the duties of this office would require its incumbent to provide for this
                    family, as well as others to the extent allowed &amp; granted by the Bureau.
                    To this degree would this family become dependent on the Bureau for
                    support.<lb/>Roswell Waldo<lb/><abbr

                <p>One Beverly White, colored, living in this place for several years past, asks me
                    to write you to know whether transportation could be furnished by the Bureau to
                    his wife &amp; 2 children living at Mount Meridian Augusta County Virginia
                    to this place. He left there seven years ago and now wants to get his family to
                    this place, his home. Will you please advise me what the Bureau can do for him
                    &amp; oblige</p>
