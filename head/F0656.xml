                <p>we have had a very hard march yesterday (sunday). we were marched at a <orig
                        reg="forced">forsed</orig> march all forenoon towards the <del hand="h1"
                        >long</del> chain bridge and the general impression was that we were going
                    into Maryland but a dinnertime we stopped got our dinner rested a little and
                    marched back this far again. we marched as fast back as we did forward. about
                    half the <abbr expan="regiment">regt</abbr> were lying along the road. our
                    company numbered 42 men but I think they are all here now. some of the men threw
                    their blankets away and last night <orig reg="someone">some one</orig>
                    <orig reg="borrowed">borowed</orig> my blanket while I was at preaching. he
                    brought it back this morning. I lay down on part of Bruces
                    <unclear>gum</unclear> blanket and put my<pb n="2"/> over coat on it was wet
                    with dew this morning. the wagons have not come up yet and the impression is
                    that we will go on. John Orth <orig reg="said">sayd</orig> tell pap to send his
                    money on to Washington and if he gets any more soon send it too. we have a
                    battery of 8 pieces in our brigade and some cavalry I have not seen the cavalry
                    yet but it is a splendid battery. you need not fear that the
                    <unclear>rebels</unclear> will ever get in to washington this way it is one
                    continuous chain of forts and entrenchments. I did not <unclear>leave</unclear>
                    the ranks yesterday some of the men filled their canteens with water in the
                    stream where <orig reg="there">their</orig> were dead horses. I saw horses with
