                <p>Henry A. Wise, former Governor of Virginia (1856-1860) and Confederate brigadier
                    general, writes again to Alexander H. H. Stuart. In a recent letter (February 2,
                    1869), Wise requested that Stuart confirm the report of a speech recently given
                    by Stuart in Staunton (see the Valley Virginian, January 28, 1869). Stuart's
                    comments appeared to be critical of Governor Wise. This letter is a reply to
                    Stuart's response (February 5, 1869). Clearly put out with Stuart, Wise explains
                    his own actions and warns Stuart to "seek better company" the next time he
                    visits Washington, D.C.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Yours of the 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> inst. is <abbr expan="received">re<hi
                            rend="super">d</hi></abbr>. The Report of your speech, an extract of
                    which I sent you, certainly made "injurious reflections" upon me, and contained
                    matter "personally offensive." This, now, you fully disclaim; and, of course, I
                    understand you as <hi rend="underline">not</hi> approving or sanctioning the
                    Report.</p>

                <p>You know that Mr. Wells &amp; myself are extreme antipodes. If he opposes the
                    "New Movement" for reasons of his own, I oppose it for reasons opposite to his
                    own. I oppose <hi rend="underline">both</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">Evils</hi>, and he <hi rend="underline">one</hi>, and it is
                    hard for me to say which is worst. If yours be the <hi rend="underline"
                    >better</hi> of the two, <hi rend="underline">the worst may, perhaps, be most
                        easily escaped from</hi>. I will take neither. Either must be <hi
                        rend="underline">forced</hi> upon me, and I will not only contest it for
                    life, but have the contest to be carried out by my heirs forever. I dont hold to
                    your logic that it follows that the Enquirer &amp; I must be wrong "because
                    of the association we were thrown into." - We have been thrown into no
                    association whatever with Mr. Wells. The Enquirer &amp; I are doing, what
                        <hi rend="underline">you</hi>
                    <pb n="2"/>were doing but very lately, <hi rend="underline">opposing both Wells
                        and Negro Suffrage</hi>. <hi rend="underline">You and he</hi> are now both
                    advocating it, and you have joined him in yielding to the wisdom of Congress the
                    whole "organic law" of this old State; and the Enquirer &amp; I are
                    continuing our opposition to you both.</p>

                <p>But, if "Noscitur a Sociis" is to be the test, and you dont desire to be judged
                    by your companions, let me tell you there are worse people than Wells to beware
                    of - people who are not Wells nor Wises - and you had better seek better company
                    when you next visit Washington. Your very mission there throws you necessarily
                    into bad "association, I say this in the most fair &amp; friendly spirit of
                    a comrade who by signing the Ordinance of Secession with you, on the 17<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi> June 1861, counseled the people of Augusta to fight for
                    their Constitutional Liberty and for their rights of Self-Government.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Yours respectfully</salute>
