                    many children, and the continued adjustment of blacks to their new status in

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I have had personal interviews with the several officers commanding the Military
                    Districts and Sub Districts embracing the counties assigned to me and received
                    assurances of their assistance and cooperation in the promotion of the objects
                    of this Bureau, and arrangements have made for the distribution of troops, in
                    the best manner their limited numbers would allow, for the support and
                    protection of the Assistant Superintendents.</p>

                <p>The Freedmen are generally at work and for able bodied men the demand exceeds the
                    supply. Women with three (3) or more little children find it very difficult in
                    obtaining employment and there is no authorized system of apprenticeship by
                    which such children might be permanently provided for and the mother,
                    disencumbered, be able to support herself. Cases of this kind are comparatively
                    infrequent but difficult to meet when they occur because there are no vacant
                    habitations accessible in this District and the cases are distributed over a
                    territory which from its extent and difficult communications renders relief
                    establishments impracticable.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>There will be numbers of infirm and helpless freedmen, besides some among those
                    who were called "fire <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>," for whom support some local provision
                    must be made; and I again <del hand="h1">respectfully</del> support that the
                    local authorities, as Overseers of the Poor, may be made to take care of them as
                    they best can, for the inhabitants <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> them have a personal
                    interest in the matter, and permit the use of vacant cabins which they would now
                    rather burn than have them occupied under the auspices of the "Freedmen's
                    Bureau."</p>

                <p>The freedmen are rapidly becoming familiar with and accustomed to their new
                    relations to the Whites, and give encouraging evidence that with facilities for
                    education, and unobstructed entry into fields of labor and business they will
                    soon <unclear>cease</unclear> to be regarded as an incubus upon the state or as
                    subjects for the tutelage and guardianship of everybody, particularly those whom
                    they already surpass in patriotism.</p>
