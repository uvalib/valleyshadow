                <p>William H. Clarke of Halifax wishes you to send him a barrel of your best
                    Whiskey, care of I. Pannell Shockoe slip Richmond--send the very best--Nothing
                    was said as to price--</p>
                <p>You have doubtless seen with pleasure that Wm. Stuart has distinguished himself
                    at Bethel. I understand that he was especially complimented in the official
                    dispatches.</p>
                <p>He is very much in want of a horse. How would our young Brown Mare answer? If she
                    will do, let us give her to him--If she will not, then let us get one that will
                    suit, &amp; send him to William. Get Byers or some good judge to buy one.</p>
                <p>The weather is awfully hot here. I have rarely felt it so oppressive--We cannot
                    tell how long our session will last--Possibly we may adjourn next week--possibly
                    not for six weeks.<pb n="2"/> I should be delighted to get away.</p>
                <p>What of Placo? If he comes down, send me a few bottles of best whiskey for my
                    friends here--</p>
                <p>I have not <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a line from home since I arrived
                    here. The Post office seems to be abominably managed.</p>
                <p>I paid a visit to Toombs a few nights ago--the other dignitaries, I have not yet
                    seen--I will call on them after a while.</p>
                <p>Troops are constantly coming on, but not as fast as I could wish--The enemy are
                    in great force, &amp; augmenting their strength daily--We have no news
                    today--There will be big battles before long--one is expected near Yorktown,
                    &amp; there will probably be one at Harpers Ferry or Manassas Gap.</p>
                <p>My Committee on Constitutional reforms met last night--I think they will sanction
                    substantially, my recommendations with the exception of election of Governor by
                    the Legislature. They prefer<pb n="3"/> the election by the people--I hope
                    before the convention adjourns, we shall have a good constitution.</p>
                <p>We have a most miserable spirit prevailing in the Convention--a spirit of carping
                    &amp; bitter hostility to Letcher--Such men as Harris, Ambler, Garnett seem
                    disposed to assail him on every frivolous pretext--Their purpose is to organize
                    a party of extreme men to monopolize the offices! They are a sorry
                        <unclear>creed</unclear>!</p>
                <p>I hope you will write some &amp; let me know how every thing is getting on.</p>
                <p>Love to Sandy &amp; any of my folks who may be with you.</p>
