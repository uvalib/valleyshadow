                <p>I have only time this cold Sunday morning to write you a line. Indeed I have
                    nothing of interest here to write you. I come out safely after taking a very
                    active part in late fight at Saltville. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>
                    Burbridge U.S.A. was punished <hi rend="underline">very</hi> severely for
                    bringing his mixed white &amp; Blacks in the vicinity of Saltville where we
                        <hi rend="underline">Reserves</hi> could strike them a blow. Let it be said
                    "never more" that the silvery haired men &amp; the beardless &amp; downy
                    cheeked youths of old <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> will not fight. They
                    have of late made their own record &amp; the faithful Historian, &amp;
                    future generations will give them a high place in the annals of their country.</p>

                <p>The fighting for the Season in this country is over, &amp; I have accepted
                    the appointment of<pb n="2"/>"Medical Director &amp; Chief Surgeon of the
                    Reserve &amp; Local Forces of West &amp; <abbr
                        expan="Southwest Virginia">SW.Va.</abbr>" &amp; have established my Head
                    Quarters at this place &amp; am on duty.</p>

                <p>"I am in fine health, hoping when these few lines come to hand they'll find you
                    enjoying the same God's Blessing."</p>

                <p>I have just read a letter from <abbr expan="Brother">Bro.</abbr> Gabl. &amp;
                    Daughter Mollie giving account of depredations &amp;c of the Yankees. <hi
                        rend="underline">They</hi> now know &amp; feel what I knew &amp; was
                    made feel near four years ago-- only they have never been made suffer from the
                    vandals as I have suffered. They have not felt &amp; known what it was to
                    mourn over the loss of a darling child-- the victim of a wicked relentless foe.
                    But enough. God is just &amp; merciful-- &amp; the day of Retribution
                    for the wicked ones who have stricken so many hearts &amp; laid waste our
                    beautiful &amp; once happy country is not<pb n="3"/>a far distant. Let it
                    come-- I repeat it let it come-- God speed it. Amen.</p>

                <p>Remember me kindly to your parents &amp; Sister-- would like to see you all.
                    With fraternal affection be kind enough please to remember me to Sammie
                    &amp; Mat. I wrote Mat a letter &amp; enclosed it to you-- She never
                    answered it, or if she did, I never recd. I love her very dearly, <del hand="h1"
                        >but</del> &amp; it distresses me because she neglects me. Suppose she
                    got mad at me because Sammy foolishly <unclear>did</unclear>. I never wantonly
                    abused or wronged or injured any one.</p>

                <p>I remember very pleasantly our delightful Boat ride-- I remember your kindness
                    &amp; affection towards me. I will not forget it or cease to remember you
                    kindly &amp; <abbr expan="affectionately">affly.</abbr></p>
