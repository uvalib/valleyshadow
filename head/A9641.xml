                <p>William tells Kate that he believes the Confederates will evacuate Winchester in
                    the near future. He also says that he, along with 35 members of his company, has
                    re-enlisted for the duration of the war, and expresses disappointment that
                    Kate's brother did not do so. He suggests that there will be "excitement in old
                    Augusta" with the approaching Confederate draft.</p>

                <p>I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> your much welcomed letter a <orig
                        reg="few">fiew</orig> days ago and now seat my self to drop you a <orig
                        reg="few">fiew</orig> lines. My health is very good &amp; hope this may
                    find you enjoying the same blessing. The health of the <abbr expan="Company"
                        >Com.</abbr> is very good at <orig reg="present">presant</orig>. We have
                    evacuated Camp <unclear>Zollicoffer</unclear> &amp; <orig reg="camped"
                    >Campt</orig> in a half mile of Winchester. I believe that we are going <pb
                        n="2"/> to evacuate Winchester, as <orig reg="they">thay</orig> are <orig
                        reg="moving">mooving</orig> all the <orig reg="Government">Guvernment</orig>
                    property <orig reg="back">pack</orig> to <orig reg="Strasburg">Strausburg</orig>
                    &amp; all the sick are <orig reg="hurried">hurryed</orig> back. It is
                    reported that the Yankees have posession of Martinsburg, Charles town &amp;
                    Berryville but I do not believe it and still hope that we may be ordered back to
                    our <orig reg="cabins">Cabbins</orig> before long. The question was asked our
                        <abbr expan="Company">Com</abbr> yesterday, whether we would enlist for the
                    war or not. Thirty five enlisted for the war the remainder <pb n="3"/> say <orig
                        reg="they">thay</orig> will stand the draft. I am no longer a <orig
                        reg="volunteer">volintier</orig> but a regular for the War be it long or
                    short &amp; my prayer is that the God of Nations may keep me as the apple of
                    his eye. I will look to him at all times for he is able to save in the darkest
                    hours of peril. It is an assurance most dear to know that he will not forsake
                    those that put <orig reg="their">thare</orig> trust in him. I was very sorry
                    that your Brother did not <orig reg="re-enlist">reinlist</orig> as I would like
                    to have his <orig reg="company">Combany</orig> as a <orig reg="guide">gide</orig>
                    <pb n="4"/> through this tempestuous world of war. I suppose <orig reg="there"
                        >thare</orig> is a <orig reg="great">grate</orig> deal of excitement in old
                    Augusta at this time on account of the draft that is to be made this month. I
                    hope that it may hit some of the speculators &amp; hope I may have the
                    pleasure of getting home on furlough before long. I would like very much to see
                    you. Remember me in your prayers, that I may hold out <orig reg="faithful"
                        >faithfull</orig> to the end. Write soon.</p>
