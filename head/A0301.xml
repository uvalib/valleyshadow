                <p>Your letter of the 9th May was <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> last night. I
                    hasten to reply.</p>

                <p>First let me express great satisfaction your Statement of facts affords me. I was
                    slow in believing that the veterans once commanded by our beloved and the
                    departed Hero, the Immortal Jackson, could or would ever falter in the discharge
                    of their duty. </p>

                <p>I will briefly state the the occurrences of Sunday May 3<hi rend="super">rd</hi>
                    in order that you may understand <hi rend="underline">why</hi> I reported to
                        <abbr expan="Major General">Maj. Gen.</abbr> R.E. <unclear>Rodes</unclear>
                    that I had passed over <unclear>Jones'</unclear>
                    <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr> and a <hi rend="underline">part</hi> of <abbr
                        expan="General">Genl</abbr> Paxton's. Having been in the advance Friday and
                        <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat.</abbr> our Division was placed in the 3<hi
                        rend="super">rd</hi> line on Sunday. Soon I was ordered to advance to the
                    support of our 2nd line. Arriving at the enemy's first line of breast works at a
                        <unclear>dary</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <unclear>crisis</unclear>. I found behind this line a large body of troops 3
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> sometimes 6 deep. I immediately halted my <abbr
                        expan="Brigade">Brig.</abbr> &amp; told these troops the order was to
                    advance. Directed them to move forward, that I would support them. Not a man
                    moved. I then <orig reg="inquired">enquired</orig> what troops were there.
                    Several men answered "I belong to the Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade"
                    >Brig</abbr>" I asked for <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Paxton, whom I knew
                    as a brave man and true. They could not tell me where he was but stated he had
                    moved to the Right. I then moved on to the right, asked again about 75 or 100
                        <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> from the men I had just questioned. As above,
                    what troops they were lying in my front. I was answered "We belong to the
                    Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>" I hastened on to the right. About
                    fifty <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> further to the right <pb n="2"/>when I
                    found an Officer in Majors uniform. In answer to my questions he told me that he
                    belonged to Jones <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig.</abbr> that <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen'l</abbr> Jones was not there and that <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    <unclear>Garnett</unclear>
                    <abbr expan="Commander">Comd.</abbr> of the <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>
                    had been killed. The troops on his right were those of Jones' <abbr
                        expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>. These troops I urged to go forward. They did
                    not move. The crisis was <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. A general advance of the whole line I
                    knew had been ordered. Therefore I ordered my <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>
                    forward over those of <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Jones' and <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">over those who told me that they were of the
                        Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>.</add> and my officers &amp;
                    men have been under the impression that they ran over Paxton and Jones Brigades.
                    I am happy to correct an impression which does injustice to the Brigade called
                    after the Immortal "Stonewall", which I will do most cheerfully by having your
                    letter published to <unclear>the very</unclear> troops at Dress Parade.</p>

                <p>The number of men who said they belonged to the Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade"
                        >Brig</abbr> I do not know. I take it they were rather lost from their <abbr
                        expan="regiments">regts.</abbr> &amp; were skulkers or were other than
                    they represented themselves to be.</p>

                <p>I have sent to all that I have always deprecated all miserable jealousies between
                    troops from Sister States <unclear>contending</unclear> for a common and
                    glorious cause and this matter has been spoken of by me with caution and regret.
                    In order to explain any terrible loss more than 1/2 of the force carried into
                    action I conceived it to be my duty to report to <abbr expan="Major General"
                        >Maj. Gen.</abbr> Rodes that though frequently sent for <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">after my <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig.</abbr> advanced to come

                    from a gap on my right flank, from which position he was pouring a destructive

                    men.</p>
