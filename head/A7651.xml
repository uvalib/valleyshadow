                <p>Notwithstanding your entire silence since I left home I propose
                    <unclear>to</unclear> write you again.</p>

                <p>I have been setting in my room this entire day desolate &amp; alone except a
                    doctor came in &amp; remained with me an hour or so I am ever
                        <unclear>afflicted</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> my eye <unclear>something</unclear> better but by no means well
                    I have been blistering my temple today which is quite severe. In the <unclear/>
                    here alone I assure you I have the <unclear/> if there be such <unclear/>. I am
                    anxiously waiting to hear from you to <unclear>know</unclear>
                    <unclear>from</unclear> M<hi rend="super">r</hi> P if it is best for me to
                    remain here until my <unclear>cures</unclear> are passed over or for me to
                        <unclear>return</unclear> at once. If not particularly to my advantage to
                    thus remain away I will return at once <hi rend="underline">even in this
                        condition</hi>. I wrote you on Friday last <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >also before that</add> &amp; am anxious to know how all things are
                    going and to my surprise you have not written me since I left (<hi

                <p>If anything important is going on a Telegram will reach me here in few hours
                    &amp; an answer return</p>

                        <hi rend="underline">r</hi>
                    </hi> Riddle can give you all information as to his &amp; my affairs I wrote

                        <hi rend="underline">r</hi>
                    </hi> P. &amp; expect to hear from him tuesday In my last I stated fully
                    what G Kilmer had better do as to<pb n="2"/> moving farming &amp;c
                    &amp;c If George has <orig reg="not">note</orig> plowed any on your land
                    yet, under all the circumstances he may let it alone &amp; not plow it
                    unless he thinks he will have full time to plow that &amp; the land where he
                    moves. As he moves late I fear he may not be able to put it all in, &amp;
                    the both fields can be put in wheat in the <unclear>fall</unclear> &amp;
                    will pay better but if at it let him go on if he can accomplish it all in time</p>

                <p>Now I am anxious to know all these things if you intend to write me &amp;
                    give me such information as you can do so And <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                    >if</add> you <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> intend writing just drop me a note
                    saying so &amp; then I will not look for any, and not be disappointed. As
                    this course is to bad for any one to pursue</p>
