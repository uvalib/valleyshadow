    <p>We spent last night at Winchester &amp; today are marching on toward Martinsburg,
     Shepperdstown, through the dust as usual -- it has been very warm. -- We spent the first night
     after we left Staunton at Mr. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, near Mt. Crawford -- he was very unwilling for
     us to encamp on him but that did no good -- he played the churl decidedly &amp; had some
     old shrew there that made the air vocal with her croakings. We went the next night beyond Big
     Spring, to Mr Cousins -- two of the red headed damsels there had gotten married since we
     stopped there in 1862 -- the next night we went to near Mrs. Jackson, to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Mt
     Airy (Moe Jordan's daughter's) -- had a good supper there -- the next day brought us to
     Strasburg &amp; yesterday to Winchester -- I took dinner at Inck's in Harrisonburg, he did
     not <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Mr Kinney has not succeded in paying off his debts -- John T. Hams was
     about -- the people there speak bitterly of <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp; Robert Gray -- say they
     shall bring them to an account for the same -- Mr. Inck lives in <abbr expan="Harrisonburg"
     >H</abbr> -- in P<del rend="none" hand="h1"/>'s house. I called yesterday evening at Mr.
      <unclear>Hicoronineces</unclear> to thank them for their kindness to Allie -- found them at
     tea &amp; took tea there -- they are very nice people indeed &amp; they have many
     beautiful flowers -- the two daughters are at home -- they are sweet girls -- The <orig
      reg="enemy's">enemys</orig> cavalry made a dash into Winchester yesterday morning <del
      hand="h1"/> stay was short &amp; we soon came in follow<del rend="none" hand="h1"/> -- they are much
     alarmed along the border, but do not <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> what is coming -- we got the Baltimore
     Papers of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>st yesterday -- <unclear>Mr. Lincoln</unclear> has passed an
     emancipate act -- Chase has <unclear>issued</unclear> -- I saw a <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> from <abbr
      expan="Baltimore">Balte</abbr> -- who says gold is four for one -- We encamp tonight at
     Leetown -- 8 miles from the Potomac -- We drove the Yankees out of Martinsburg &amp; away
     from the <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R.</abbr> at Kernysville Our cavalry had a fight with them
     here we had some 25 killed &amp; wounded -- The enemy does not make much resistance<pb
      n="2"/>We captured some stores &amp; they burned some -</p>
    <p> I hope you are all well -- I am, thank the Lord, in fine health - </p>
    <p> Be of good cheer &amp; may the Lord's blessing be with you -- Love &amp; kisses for
     all -- Write soon </p>
