    <p>I got to Staunton by half past five and had time to get all my errands attended to before the
     cars started then got along very well to Orange <abbr expan="Court House">C.H</abbr>, &amp;
     there Mr. Shaw invited me to spend the night at his house, so after paying my respects to Gen.
     Lee &amp; chatting a while with Maj. Harman I went up &amp; had a good night's rest on
     a <hi rend="underline">feather</hi> bed &amp; I tell you my Dear I stood in need of it, for
     my early start, hard seat &amp; a little cold &amp; the all <orig reg="day's"
     >days</orig> ride in the cars had wearied me much &amp; I was decidedly <hi
      rend="underline">nervous</hi>, but the night's rest refreshed me. William got there in good
     time. This morning I got up early, breakfasted with Harman &amp; then rode down with Maj.
      <abbr expan="Harman">H.</abbr> to <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> fifteen miles --
     quite a pleasant ride, the air bracing. I found them at Morton's House, "The Hall" a very nice
     place &amp; all in the house, though the tents are up in the yard "for <orig reg="charm"
      >charn</orig>" Mr. Robinson had a room in the house -- big fire &amp;c, so I am quite
     comfortably fixed &amp; though somewhat jaded, hope to stand it very well. Everything is
     quiet &amp; there is no prospect of fight at present, though one is expected here before
     long --<pb n="2"/> I hope you were not made sick by your many labors of the day before my
     leaving. Please send me back my letters -- you can put them all in one of yours. Tell Mrs. Wise
     I saw the Rev. Mr. Slaughter who had seen some people lately from Culpeper &amp; they said
     Meade had his quarters at Mr. Wollocks &amp; had a large drove of cattle in that vicinity
     -- The ladies that came out lived near Mitchell's Station &amp; were compelled to come away
     for want of food, they had to ask Gen. Warren (Fed.) for something to eat before they could
     come to our lines -- it was said the Yankees had killed a Mr. Nelson at Culpeper <abbr
      expan="Court 
 House">C.H.</abbr> -- but in general they had behaved very well -- I found all
     very well &amp; enjoying their comfortable quarters. My snack was delightful -- Maj. Allen
     &amp; brouther ate with me -- Gen. Rodes got on the cars at Charlottesville -- he said he
     had got a <hi rend="underline">fine boy</hi> &amp; his wife was doing well. <orig
      reg="Ain't">Aint</orig> he a lucky man? I forgot to tell Allie that I did not get a chance to
     see Capt. <abbr expan="Sterrett">S.</abbr> privately - - sorry I did not -- but she must be of
     good cheer &amp; hope for a change -- time mends all things even rheumatic joints.</p>
    <p> I shall write to you again in a few days &amp; send some money -- I wish to go to the
      <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> tomorrow.</p>
    <p> Kisses &amp; love for all the children including allie &amp; the rest if there
     &amp; a full <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for you my Love -- Write to me soon -- very soon: By the way
     I left a roll of paper on the pile of big books, which I want sent to Lt. Koemer, Staunton care
     of Maj. Bell -- send it soon to Maj. <abbr expan="Bell">B</abbr> -- Good bye &amp; God
     bless you </p>
