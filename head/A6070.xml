    <p>I take my pen in hand to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well &amp; hope
     that when these lines come to hand they may find you enjoying the same blessing I received your
     letter and the Cheese, Apples, &amp; Caps, you sent by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Jarvis. I
     am very much obliged to you for sending them The caps I gave to those who were worst<pb n="2" entity="Smiley41b" pid="uva-lib:503213"/>
      off. there is no bareheaded men in our part of the army The most
     of the men have good hats or caps. This week has been very disagreeable raining almost every
     day. I suppose it is snow with you as it is much warmer here than in the <orig reg="Valley"
      >Vally</orig>. We are very comfortably situated now the men all have cabins or tents with
     chimneys on which we do our cooking. I think that as long as the weather keeps bad we will have
     the <orig reg="priviledge">privilige</orig> of remaining in our quarters as the roads are too
     bad for the moving of an army There is a good many troops going from here to North Carolina but
     they are altogether North Carolina troops<pb n="3"  entity="Smiley41c" pid="uva-lib:503214"/>
      We have a <orig reg="Courthouse">Court house</orig> &amp;
     Church built and some of the men are now building a Theatre It will be finished in a few days I
     suppose As I have nothing of any interest to write you I will close by asking you to excuse all
     mistakes and write soon</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>Give my love to all inquiring friends &amp; receive a large share yourself from
      your affectionate nephew</salute>
