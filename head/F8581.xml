                <p>This letter from McClure relates more information about the maneuverings
                    regarding Lincoln's cabinet positions. According to McClure, Cameron attempted

                <p>I have just returned from Chambersburg court, where I was detained a full week. I
                    find nothing new of special interest here.</p>

                <p>Cameron himself asserts with entire confidence to his friends that he will be in
                    the cabinet. He assured Taggert so on Sunday last: and all his friends who are
                    active in the matter, treat it as settled.</p>

                <p>Last night however a special messenger came from Cameron to Curtin stating that
                    the whole responsibility was upon him now, &amp; that if he would yield and
                    write a letter to Lincoln assenting to the appointment, it would be <hi
                        rend="underline">harmoniously settled</hi>
                    <pb n="2"/>Curtin refused to give the letter, so that it is reasonable to infer
                    that Mr. Cameron does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> yet consider the matter
                    harmoniously settled. In support of this view, I may mention the fact that <orig
                        reg="today">to-day</orig> one of <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Cameron's
                    chief managers called upon me, as he said, with full powers to make a treaty of
                    peace, and the short-term Senatorship or any thing else I might like better
                    should be at my command -- the consideration, of course, that I should join in
                    getting the <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>
                    <hi rend="underline">harmoniously</hi> into the cabinet. The offer was attended
                    with the stereotypical declaration that the <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>
                    would go into the Cabinet at any rate, &amp; I might as well assent to it
                    &amp; make the most of it. I need hardly say that the treaty <pb n="3"/> was
                    not concluded.</p>

                <p>I see that the Tribune of yesterday seems to have some definite information on
                    the subject. Do you know what it is? &amp; the exact source of it?</p>

                <p>I have had no word from Lincoln for several weeks; <orig reg="although"
                    >altho</orig> he then said he would write me soon again on the subject.</p>

                <p>I have positive evidence, in a confidential way, that immediately after the
                    election Cameron induced certain men in the State to write Lincoln protesting
                    against the appointment of Wilmot and asking for a <hi rend="underline"
                        >conservative man</hi>. When he had Wilmot half-butchered he made him put
                    the finishing stroke to himself.</p>

                <p>Write me how matters look. Can anything more be done? I am <pb n="4"/> ready for
                    anything &amp; can now give it proper attention</p>
