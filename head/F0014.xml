                </opener>
                <p>Yours came safe to hand. I was in Washington the day before &amp; got the
                    Express Agent to send on to Wheeling for the box, but I am glad you took it back
                    to take out what was spoiled. Could Polly Harvey put in her mince pies this
                    time. You need not send more than one pair of socks now as I got 1 good pair
                    from Mother &amp; 2 good pair from Uncle Sam which are done already
                    &amp; I got a good pair a day or two ago of very good ones. I told James
                    Doughtery to tell you to send the box to S.M. Potter Washington D.C. in care of
                    Surgeon of 16th <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa</abbr> Cavalry. I want you to take
                    the best care of yourself as the care of your health is a duty which you must
                    faithfully perform. The letter Mr. Roney sent never came &amp; I think you
                    sent a letter I never got as Mary wrote to me about Uncle <orig reg="John's"
                        >Johns</orig> boys. She say she said something about them in a letter she
                    sent. This one was lost I expect. We have 9 patients in the Hospital now
                    &amp; we sent some a day or two ago to the General Hospital in Washington
                    City. What my pay will be I do not know yet as the paymaster has not been around
                    yet. I suppose about $20 twenty dollars a month. I think I told you what my
                    duties are. There are two stewards of us. One Dr. Carey Ainevah Green <abbr
                        expan="County" cert="no">Co.</abbr> attends to the writing reports &amp;
                    outdoor duty. My duty is to attend to the drugs to put up medicines for the
                    sick. See to their nursing diet &amp;C. We both do whatever comes to hand
                    towards helping one another. Our first Surgeons name is Gominger of
                    Philadelphia. He has been out for about 18 months &amp; understands his
                    business well. The second Surgeon is from Philadelphia too. A young Dutchman
                    very good. You have not been to church for some time. Well I have not either
                    since we left Camp Curtis. Yesterday was the quietest Sabbath Day we have had
                    since we have come here. I still entertain the hope that we will have the
                    privilege of going to the House of God together &amp; enjoying ourselves in
                    all the blessings he sends to us. Well Mary I thought when I left home my office
                    stove would be of no use but it is well I left it up. I find it is needed yet.
                    Well let it stay up, as long as it is of use. I would like to have the privilege
                    of going to church as often as you do. We have no Chaplain for our <abbr
                        expan="regiment">Reg.</abbr> yet &amp; likely will have none. As one
                    Company is gone to the Chain Bridge to guard &amp; two more are ordered to
                    go to Centerville probably we will be split up. We have a Company to vaccinate
                    this afternoon which will keep us busy for awhile. Cynthia I want you to get
                    some good matter &amp; vaccinate all the children &amp; Jimmy Sloan
                    Potter too. Be sure &amp; see to it. Maybe you could get some good matter
                    from Dr. Davidson to do it with. Josey, Lucy &amp; Bell will let you make a
                    picture in their arms &amp; be good children too. I know they will take good
                    care of you too Cynthia &amp; the children I want to go home someday to
                    enjoy your company. Dreams pass away with the morn. I want to enjoy the reality
                    once more. I have nothing at present except I still enjoy good health &amp;
                    hope you may be in the enjoyment of the same. Give my love to the children
                    &amp; all friends. </p>
