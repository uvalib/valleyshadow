                <p>I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> your welcome lines and it gave me much
                    pleasure to hear that you are still enjoying good health and I must say that we
                    are all in a good state of health. </p>

                <p>Your Brother John came home on the 4th of July, he is well also and has been
                    since he is at home. In your last letter you desired me to send you some money.
                    I sometime ago sent you a letter with $200 and I dont think that you will ever
                        get<pb n="2"/> it. and according to your letter you will not stay long where
                    you are and as you have not given any direction I think it best not to sent any
                    money but as soon as you get to a place that you think you do stop any time,
                    give me your full address and I will sent you some money. you also ask in your
                    last letter about your <orig reg="cloth">clothe</orig>, we have <orig
                        reg="received">recieved</orig> yours and also Cyrus <orig reg="Engle's"
                        >Engles</orig> so that is safe, I will enclose 50 cents and as it is a risk
                    I will only sent this to see if you<pb n="3"/> get it and if you get it write
                    immediately and I will sent you more we have not much news so I will close
                    hoping these few lines will find you still enjoying good health and also hope
                    you will soon return home as we would all be glad to see you Come home, answer
                    soon and <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> forget to give your address </p>

                <closer>
