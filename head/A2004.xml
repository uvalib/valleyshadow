     <salute>Dear Ma</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I rec'd your letters on Monday &amp; Tuesday the last by Mr Hanger. I am very glad to
     hear that you are all well. I am very well myself I think soldiering agrees with me. I am
     behaving myself &amp; keeping good company as I promised you. I am very much oblige to you
     for the box of provisions. I just got them this evening. I got the clothes. I think they will
     suit very well. The pants are not very fine but are the kind for service. I just gave Ed
     Waddell his package &amp; helped him to eat a piece of the wedding cake it was very nice. I
     forgot to give Grandma the present I told you I intended giving her when I was there but will
     send it to her in a few days. Tell Pa I did not take as much money with as he thought as I
      <abbr expan="paid">pd</abbr> $35 for my pistol before I left home and $30 for my rifle the
     other day besides paying mine &amp; Clinton's fare. When I need any money I will have to
     call on Pa or you but I intend spending very little as I know it is hard to get &amp;
     intend to be as saving as possible. Clem Fishburn came here today I saw him. He says Elliott
     will be well in a few days to attend to his duties. I think though that he will try &amp;
     get him a furlough for a few days to go home &amp; see his parents. I gave Oliver Evans his
     shoes. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know whether mine have come or not. I expect to go out
     on Picket tomorrow and then I will write Sallie a long letter. I am in the Guard Room writing.
     All of the boys have gone to bed. I was down at Col Harman's night before last. He was very
     glad to see me &amp; invited me to call again said he was very glad to hear Pa was getting
     well &amp; told me to give him his respects when I wrote. Rev'd Mr Killian is here he came
     up to see us yesterday. Mr. Hill looks better than I ever saw him. I <orig reg="don't"
     >dont</orig> know that I will need the flannel bands you sent me as I intend wearing flannel
     shirts all summer. Tell Mrs Sam Withrow that little Finley got his clothes but could not find
     any name on them. I have a very good time here much better than I expected. Ma you must excuse
     the bad writing as I have a very bad light &amp; pen. I saw Morgan <unclear>Estes</unclear>
     here yesterday. Well as I am getting sleepy I will stop. I will write to you by Dorsey Hanger
     &amp; try &amp; write you a longer &amp; better written letter than this. Give my
     love to all kiss Bettie Hugh &amp; little Ginnie. Tell Clinton &amp; Chas to be good
     boys. Write soon. Give my respect to Mr Slough &amp; Evans. Tell Ned Jane &amp; Harry I
     am much obliged to them for the cakes.</p>
