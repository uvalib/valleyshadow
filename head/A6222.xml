                <p>I returned from Mr <orig reg="Ferror's">Ferrors</orig>
                    <orig reg="Tuesday">Tusday</orig> morning in time to get your dear letter which
                    I read many times over wondering in my heart how you could Ever, Ever doubt my
                    love for you that was truly the first doubt you have had of my affection
                    &amp; could you then have read my heart you would have seen there only the
                    deepest, &amp; truest love for <orig reg="yourself">your self</orig>
                    &amp; that you were dearer <orig reg="than">then</orig> a whole world of
                    Ferror's could ever be to me. I had no <pb n="2"/>idea of such a doubt in your
                    mind until you spoke of turning back to Mt. Solon, but my heart is glad
                    &amp; willing to say that you are freely &amp; entirely forgiven. how
                    often have I doubted you &amp; how often have you in your goodness of heart
                    forgiven me. I cannot forget it the many times I have been so cruel to you in
                    that way since I have loved you.</p>

                <p>but I do ask you never to doubt me again my love. You are too dear to my heart
                    for me ever to give you <unclear>one</unclear> pain in any way. I do not I
                    cannot love <orig reg="anyone">any one</orig>
                    <pb n="3"/>but your own dear self. You are the choice of my heart, the dearest
                    of all on Earth to me, &amp; I am happy, &amp; deeply thankful for your
                    precious love I ask for no other love <orig reg="than">then</orig> yours as long
                    as I live, for I do love you with all the deep &amp; unchanging devotion of
                    my heart, &amp; Soul, &amp; ever shall. It seemed to me that I had been
                    to Mr Ferror's a month, &amp; had not seen you all that time. Oh but I do
                    want to see you my love more <orig reg="than">then</orig> I can tell. I am so
                    delighted to think you are coming early Saturday morning. I wish I could see
                    your <pb n="4"/>dear face <orig reg="today">to day</orig> I should be so happy
                    &amp; glad. I can scarcely wait until you do come I am so anxious to be with
                    you I love with my entire nature. I was just looking at the last photograph you
                    gave me it is so much like you. how I did wish it could speak to me &amp;
                    then I felt as if I could not wait until Saturday came before I can see you. May
                    God let you come Saturday to one who loves you more <orig reg="than">then</orig>
                    her own life. I will tell you of my visit at Mr. F's when you come. Come soon in
                    the morning if you live. Oh! I do want to see you with all my heart. The fishing
                    hooks were right Hamie sends thanks to you for them. I love you with true
                    &amp; undying devotion of my heart, &amp; Soul, &amp; will while I
                    live. I love to live only for you, to think of you, &amp; above all I love
                    best to be with you. All send love. I send a loving kiss to you. Come I shall be
                    so happy &amp; thankful to have you with me again. God bless you my love</p>
