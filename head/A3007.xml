     <salute>My Dear Annie,</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I have just returned from witnessing the execution of ten North Carolinans belonging to the
      2<hi rend="super">nd</hi> Bridgage of our Division. They were shot for desertion, or rather
     for killing the officer who was arresting them. The <unclear>affray</unclear> took place near
     Scottsville Albemarle County Virginia. I tell you it was a solemn scene to witness. Each one of
     the men were tied to seperate stakes placed about 10 paces apart in a large field. Out entire
     division was then formed in two ranks around the field; <unclear>there</unclear> were so many
     men detailed out of the different Companies to shoot them &amp; they were divided into 10
     squads, with a reserve to each. After everything was ready the command fire was given All
     firing at the same time: the shots did not <add hand="h1" place="inline">all</add> take effect.
     Consequently the reserve had to be called in, this <pb n="2"/>looked still harder, to see them
     shot at the second time when they were in the agonies of death! but such was their lot. I trust
     they were prepared, and are now uniting their songs of praise with the Angels of God around his
     throne on high.</p>
    <p>I must close for the present as it is now getting so dark I can scarcely see. Good night.
     Good night.</p>
    <p>How are you this morning? Well I hope! I will add a few lines, although I am sorry to say
     that I have no news worth relating. The most news and the most we have now is, that we are
     going to <orig reg="Tennessee">Tenessee</orig>. It is said one division of our Corps has
     already gone. I trust however <hi rend="underline">we</hi> will not go: would rather not. <orig
      reg="Everything">Every thing</orig> remains quiet on the Rappahannock up to this time. Some
     little canonading has been heard in the direction of Fredricksburg during the past <pb n="3"
     />week. Charleston still continues to hold out &amp; the greatest confidence prevails among
     the men &amp; the people of that place. Last Saturday week there was a <hi rend="underline"
      >picnic</hi> given by the Commissary <unclear>&amp;</unclear> Quartermasters &amp; of
     our division as a testimonial of their regard to <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Johnson. All
     our <abbr expan="Generals">Genls</abbr> with the exception of Lee was present together with
     more than 100 ladies from the surrounding <unclear>Country</unclear>. They danced from early in
     the morning till sundown. <orig reg="everyone">every one</orig> seemed to enjoy themselves very
     much some one way &amp; some another, strange to say I did not speak to a lady on the
     occasion but was merely an idle spectator. had the crowd been graced with <hi rend="underline"
      >your</hi> presence, I then could have enjoyed myself. But I must close.</p>

    <closer>
     <salute> My love to all &amp; believe me to be as ever <hi rend="underline">yours</hi>.</salute>
