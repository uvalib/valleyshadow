                </opener>
                <p>I have waited a few days before answering your last letter dated Feb. 6th. Josey
                    was playing nurse to Jimmy &amp; Bell &amp; Lucy playing ring around the
                    rosey. You think if Pa was at home he could nurse Jimmy to be a better boy. Well
                    the reason is I suppose he could be nursed more when you are busy. I feel glad
                    of your getting such a nice lot of wood. Your neighbors are very kind &amp;
                    I think you had better stay there a while yet. You say you want to stop the
                    newspaper. Well use your pleasure about it. If it is any pleasure for you to
                    read it let it run &amp; if not stop it. I <orig reg="hear">here</orig>
                    there is a letter for me in the Postoffice so I will wait until morning
                    &amp; get it. The paymaster has not come yet. Feb 22<hi rend="super">nd</hi>
                    Today your letter of the 15<hi rend="super">th</hi> was <orig reg="brought"
                    >brot</orig> to the Hospital &amp; I am glad that you are all well. It is
                    Sabbath Day and we have quite a snowstorm. The Cannon are firing salute in honor
                    of Washington's birthday. The snow is about 1 foot deep &amp; still snowing.
                    We have had no preaching here &amp; have not had since we left Camp Casey
                    about six weeks since. I would go through this storm (if I was at home)
                    &amp; hear <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> McKee very cheerfully
                    &amp; more cheerfully if my whole family were in the seat with me. I often
                    picture to myself the old church &amp; its pleasant pastor &amp; his
                    kind sociable people sitting comfortably on the Sabbath listening to the Words
                    of Life &amp; singing the songs of Zion. &amp; wish I was there too. You
                    told me in one of your letters not to go too close to the rebs. Well I got
                    acquainted with a young man from Canonsburg who is a cousin of John Boyce
                    &amp; who came over to see us occasionally &amp; invited us to go over
                    &amp; see him. For sake of a change Mr. Miller &amp; I went over to
                    where Mr. Reed is guarding a private house &amp; took dinner with him,
                    getting cornbread. We all went over after dinner to the Kott to see the boys
                    there &amp; found them well. I saw Jimmy Sloan nearly as big as his father,
                    the old preacher. &amp; also Bub Emory. They are both hearty. Their fathers
                    were both down to see them about a week ago &amp; started to come over to
                    our regiment but could not find the way. Well after staying there a short time
                    to get a spyglass we went down to Fredericksburg. We got on the river bank
                    opposite the city &amp; could see them playing ball. Could hear them
                    laughing &amp; talking &amp; saw a number who had blue overcoats on
                    which they took off our dead soldiers. Mr. Reed who was in the battle could show
                    us the rebel batteries &amp; also a stone fence which our men tried to take
                    a number of times &amp; were mowed down by hundreds. He pointed out a number
                    of fields back of the city which were literally covered with our dead after the
                    fight &amp; still left after our men recrossed the river. We saw quite a
                    number of houses with holes in them made by our cannon balls. We also saw where
                    several houses were <orig reg="burned">burnt</orig> down. The rebels &amp;
                    our pickets do a good deal of trading the rebs being scarce of coffee will give
                    a pound of tobacco for a pound of it. &amp; also exchange a Richmond
                    newspaper for a northern one. Well we returned safely to the Kott &amp; then
                    I took supper with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Vance &amp; then
                    returned here sound in body &amp; limb. You made inquiry about <abbr
                        expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Gunn well the Surgeon said that he is not
                    able to ride a horse for any length of time &amp; consequently unable for
                    the Cavalry Service. His resignation came back the other day. It was wrong in
                    some little point &amp; so it will be a week yet before he will get it. I
                    feel very much like being at home this Sabbath evening with everything around me
                    peaceful &amp; happy &amp; hearing my little ones recite the catechism
                    &amp; would like to talk to them &amp; hear them talk to me. Does Lucy
                    &amp; Bell learn any questions &amp; do they say them well. Can Bell say
                    her little prayer yet. (Now I lay me down to sleep) I suppose Lucy can say it
                    all by herself by this time &amp; I suppose Josey as a good boy has learned
                    a good number of questions. You speak of your neighbors giving you some more
                    wood. They are very kind to you &amp; I hope they will be suitably rewarded
                    for their kindness. I see by <orig reg="Elizabeth's">Elizabeths</orig> letter
                    that <del hand="h1">th</del> Wills family has a good deal of sickness. I feel
                    sorry for them. </p>
