                <p>It was very cheering to me to receive a letter from you once more, though it did
                    contain such discouraging accounts of your Father &amp; Mother-- however, we
                    hope by this time, both are more comfortable, if not restored to their usual
                    health-- this, we can scarcely expect, regarding Uncle, as he has never been so
                    feeble since his health first failed. All that can be done in his case, I
                    suppose, is to soothe for the time. I do trust he may be gently dealt with,
                    &amp; mentally, as well as bodily, receive that strength, which God alone
                    can give <pb n="2"/> with "that inward peace, the world can neither give, nor
                    take away." I should have written before, but about the time, your letter was
                    received C Reynolds was sick &amp; required my attendance, &amp; after
                    that, I was not at all well myself &amp; quite unfit for letter writing. We
                    do not cease to regret you could not be with us at the wedding, though we knew
                    you were in the path of duty. We hear from them all very frequently. Now Lizzie
                    is comparatively alone. Jane has gone to <abbr expan="Baltimore">Balt.</abbr> on
                    her way to <abbr expan="Frederick">Fredk</abbr>. Bettie returned on Tuesday
                    night, &amp; Lizzie Law left for Virginia on Tuesday, her Pa having gone on
                    for her, she is to join Lizzie at Christmas to spend it here, &amp; then
                    return with her to Georgetown. She is perfectly delighted, with <orig
                        reg="everything">every thing</orig> &amp; <orig reg="everybody">every
                        body</orig> &amp; the other girls say, she is more admired than any one
                    they ever saw. When <pb n="3"/> they come here, parties are to be given at Mr.
                    Maulsby's &amp; Mr. <unclear>Bungh's</unclear>. Jane &amp; Bettie will
                    probably go back with them. Very likely Lizzie Law has written you all about her
                    visit. They all insist upon your cousin C - returning to Georgetown with them,
                    which she hopes to do &amp; then John &amp; I will have the house to
                    ourselves <add hand="h1" place="inline">for a while</add>, as Mr.
                    <unclear>Tyler</unclear> will have to go to Annapolis the 1<hi rend="super"
                    >st</hi> of <abbr expan="January">Jany.</abbr> to stay during the Session of the
                    Legislature. All are as well as usual at the Dr.'s -- also at the <abbr
                        expan="Colonel's">Col.'s</abbr>. I have not seen any of them since the
                    wedding. I have so much head ache <orig reg="today">to day</orig>, that you must
                    excuse this hurried letter. I cannot notice all the news you give me in your
                    letter I had a letter from Sarah the other day. As regards those children I am
                    greatly interested about them &amp; feel much for <pb n="4"/> Mr. and Mrs
                    Wallace. To me, the best plan would be to place them at the Schools at Thorndale
                    and <unclear>Glenburn</unclear>, under the care of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. They
                    would be near each other &amp; as well-cared for in every respect, as if
                    with their mother. The Session has just commenced, &amp; they could not be
                    received if desired, for both are full--but application ought to be made early
                    for the Spring Session commencing in May. You can thing about it. All write in
                    much love to you, Uncle &amp; Aunt. I suppose Mrs McC. is at home again.
                    Write very soon--</p>
