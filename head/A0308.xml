    <p>I will surprise you with a few words + jokes.</p>

    <p>I am again in camp enjoying the pleasures &amp; braving the hardship &amp; dangers
     incident to such a life. As to any enjoyments they are many &amp; various consequently I
     will not endeavor to enumerate them. I have had some pretty hard times since I came down. I
     have marched over 100 miles since leaving Winchester <pb n="2"/> Thursday morning Jan <del
      hand="h1">29</del> 30. We had to march yesterday morning and I didn't get time to finish your
     letter. We marched 8 <abbr expan="miles">mls.</abbr> yesterday &amp; are now 5 <abbr
      expan="miles">mls.</abbr> from Winchester on the <unclear>Pughtown</unclear> road. We are in
     winter quarters, are yet in our tents, but will continue building our cabins tomorrow. I think
     it probable that we may have some rest now for awhile</p>

    <p>We left Romney on the 23rd. It rained all the time we were there &amp; was very muddy
     &amp; disagreeable. Romney is a very nice town I suppose in time of peace, but it is
     overrun with soldiers + abused now. <pb n="3"/>There are a few pretty girls there; some of were
     very kind to me &amp; others were more <hi rend="underline">"union than secesh"</hi> I
     think.</p>

    <p>There are several pretty churches there &amp; a good many nice private residences
     &amp; also a very commodious Court House, though the Yankees have torn the floors &amp;
     every thing from the inside of the Court House. </p>

    <p>The Federals left a great many things when they "vamoused" from there. I could have gotten a
     number of trophies but had no way of taking care of them. Its the most mountainous regions
     between here and Romney I ever <pb n="4"/>saw. There are 8 mountains between here &amp;
     there &amp; The Pastures about Burnissis Springs is a paradise to the be best part of
     Hampshire County. The people of some places can look up the chimney &amp; see the sheep
     &amp; goats on the hill side above. There are some children out there that never saw the
     sun. </p>

    <p>The Yankees have burned all the houses for 20 miles in this side of Romney. But I guess they
     won't burn any more soon</p>

    <p>Write to me soon. Direct to Winchester. In care of <abbr expan="Captain">Cpt.</abbr> H. J.
     Williams, <abbr expan="Company">Comp'y</abbr> D. 5th <abbr expan="regiment">reg'mt</abbr> Va
