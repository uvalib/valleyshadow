                    My dear brother I am very sorry to hear of your having another dry season and
                    another failure in crop. You have been truly unfortunate in that respect for the
                    last few years I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> wonder at your having an desire
                    to leave. It seems to me were I in your place though I <orig reg="don't"
                    >dont</orig> like to advise I would try and rent out my land to some good
                    reliable man that would take care of the place and keep it up and would try and

                        >buisiness</orig> that would pay better than farming, I think I told you
                    when I was there that I thought you had a turn for the nursery <orig
                        reg="business">buisiness</orig> if that would suit your taste you might pay
                    us a visit and get an insight into the <orig reg="business">buisiness</orig> and
                    see what you could do this man Davis who has a nursery near Staunton has made a
                    great deal of money. he and Tom Calbreath went into the <orig reg="business"
                        >buisiness</orig><pb n="2"/> together below Richmond were raising peaches
                    and sending to the New York Market I think before the war and were making money
                    at it by the way <unclear>J.</unclear> Calbreath has turned out badly is
                    carrying on a distillery on the old place and is in the habit of drinking
                    himself A great many persons think there is nothing to be made here farming now
                    when <orig reg="labor">labour</orig> is all to hire but when we are so
                    successful in cropping as we have been this year I think we can make something
                    although our expenses are very heavy there was finer crops of wheat made in this
                    country <add hand="h1" place="inline">this year</add> than has been made before
                    I suppose for ten years and then we may calculate again for ten years more there
                        <orig reg="won't">wont</orig> be near as large crops of corn made as there
                    was last year My crop started very badly in the spring and I had almost
                    despaired of a corn crop this year but rains set in about the right time and has
                    been showery so I will make a good-deal of corn having cut about 40 acre if
                    frost keeps off long enough though last night was very cool and so is <orig

                    day</orig> and he said there was frost last night said there could be no mistake
                    about it that he examined closely and saw some on clover but there was certainly
                    none to do any damage, but I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> like to hear of it am
