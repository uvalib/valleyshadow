                <p>Nadenbousch responds to his wife's worries regarding confiscation of their

                <p>Through the extreme kindness of a friend I propose to try &amp; get you a few
                    lines. I have been quite disabled from Rheumatism for some three (3) weeks most
                    of the time confined to my room &amp; a good portion to my bed &amp; now
                    whilst I write I am in the greatest misery, but hope so soon as the weather
                    clears up &amp; settles I will be relieved Louise, Hen, &amp; Jenny are
                    all well, fat &amp; saucy We are still running the machine &amp; doing
                    quite well My papers not yet come on look for them daily</p>

                <p>I heard through a friend a few days ago from you in which I am <orig
                        reg="informed">enformed</orig> that you are in a peck of trouble about the
                    confiscation of our property Well first no property will be permanently
                    confiscated until after the war (<hi rend="underline">certain</hi>) and a claim
                    to it now is all a farce &amp; of short duration. So far as ours is
                    concerned if they will take it now let it go. I have plenty here to keep us well
                    during our lives if properly managed. <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> let this
                    matter weary you one particle but just take it as it comes &amp; if
                    unpleasant for you there or if you are in any way in need come out here at once
                    or at any time you can &amp; may desire <pb n="2"/> I have a good place here
                    for you and only wish you were here now, to help to cheer up my dull gloomy
                    hours that I spend in my lonely room only relieved occasionaly by the dropping
                    in of some friend The doctor being my most constant <orig reg="visitor"
                    >visiter</orig>. George Schoppert rubbed my back by the fire last night until it
                    is now in blisters. his family is well. M<hi rend="super">

                <p>The last word I got from you was dull &amp; gloomy and in a desponding tone
                    which I regreted much to see as previously you spoke so hopefull &amp;
                    cheerful &amp; all things seemed bright. But I hope you will soon dispel
                    these dark gloomy cloud<hi rend="super">s</hi> &amp; look forward to
                    brighter days. I spend portions of my time in reviewing your pictures thus
                    calling to mind lovely recollections of the past similar to which I hope soon to
                    be returned</p>
