                </opener>
                <p>Your most welcome letter was received yesterday evening relieving me very much on
                        <orig reg="Bell's">Bells</orig> account, as I was more uneasy about her
                    since leaving home than I was when there. I am glad you did not wait to answer
                    my letter as it would have kept me longer hearing from home. When I wrote last
                    the regiment had taken some quarters deserted by <orig reg="infantry"
                    >infrantry</orig> since we had to come here and build quarters for ourselves.
                    The first night or two we camped out on the snow. Since, the Doctor has taken a
                    house for our quarters &amp; we have a very comfortable place. The Doctor
                    expects his wife in a few days so he rented a furnished room with a feather bed.
                    Until his wife arrives I am sleeping with him in a warm room in a feather bed.
                    As you will see by my last letter I got here on Saturday the 2<hi rend="super"
                        >nd</hi>. On Sunday I wanted to see my wife &amp; felt in my pocket for
                    that picture when <hi rend="underline">lo</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline"
                        >behold</hi> it was gone. The Doctor &amp; I looked all over our tent,
                    under the bed up &amp; down. So I gave it up for lost when I got a letter
                    informing me where it is. I am glad that it is not lost &amp; hope you will
                    send it in your next letter. As we have no woman here but an old dried up
                    vinegar-faced Virginian, who is cross as an old bear because of her fences and
                    so on I want a good looking woman to look at, so send the pictures along. Any
                    time you have a chance to get pictures of the children I wish you would have
                    them taken &amp; send them to me. The weather has been very cold since I
                    came out. Today the sun is shining brightly making a little mud. I got two of
                    your letters since I came. Perhaps I told you the Regiment was out on a raid
                    into the Shenandoah Valley &amp; have returned. They burned some tanneries,
                    captured some horses &amp; some rebs. You need not be uneasy about my
                    blanket as I am sleeping very comfortably &amp; hope it will help to keep
                    you warm. Wisby gave me the mittens &amp; I have to thank you for your
                    trouble as they keep my hands warm. I guess you need not make any catnip tea for
                    me as my headache has left &amp; my cold is getting better. I would like
                    very much to be at home with yourself and the children as it is the pleasantest
                    place I have found in all my travels &amp; as a matter of course there is
                    where I want to be, to hear Josey's drum, to hear Lucy &amp; Bell singing
                    &amp; have Jimmy running to get up on my knee &amp; then jump down again
                    like a little mischief &amp; then to have Cynthia making catnip tea
                    &amp; curing my headache. How pleasant our prayers have been heard &amp;
                    we have been permitted to have one reunion. The same God is still the hearer
                    &amp; answerer of prayer. Let us still look to him for blessings &amp;
                    among them the privilege of meeting again around the family altar praying that
                    God may keep you all in his care I remain </p>

                        without it. We will try to save money enough to buy the Anthony house
                        &amp; lot for you in the spring. </seg>
