     <salute>Dear Brother </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>I take this opportunity to inform you that I am well and hope these few lines may find you
     and all the balance at home enjoying the same blessing. Plecker and Craun arrived here on the
     26th Dec. we were very glad to see them and hear from home especially when they handed out
     those nice boxes of provisions prepared for us by the good folks at home. I am very much
     obliged to you for the box you sent me. Tell Jane that I am very much obliged to her for those
     nice gloves she presented to me. also the envelopes blackberries apples and paper and other
     things she has sent me. We thought we were going to have a dry time during the holidays but it
     proved otherwise. Our boys have been in good spirits ever since those boxes arrived. We lost a
     man out of our Company on the 26th De by the name of Robert Gorden. We were guarding the
     trenches. five companies of us on the hill. we lay in some unfinished cabins. about daylight he
     got up to go out. he fell and struck his head against a log in the cabin. he lived about five
     minutes after he fell. it was thought the fall injured his brain some way. his skull was not
     fractured. we have lost three men out of our company now Martin L Bell Newton Hogshead and
     Gorden. we expected an attack here on the 3rd. the evening before fires were discovered down at
     Greenbrier. scouts were sent out and discovered Yankees camped there. the 44 regiment from
     crabbottom and Colonel goods regiment was ordered here from Strait Creek immediately. the 44
     Colonel Scotts regiment arrived here about 2 0 clock in the night. Goods regiment from Strait
     Creek about 8 0 clock next morning but the yanks never come. So our regiment and the 12th
     Georgia were ordered down to Greenbrier. when we arrived there they had left. we seen where
     they camped at camp Barto and burnt some cabins and tried to destroy the fortifications there.
     it is thought that they come down of <orig reg="Cheat Mountain">cheat</orig> for the last time
     to destroy what they could. Goods and Scotts regiments went back to day. we do not expect an
     attack hardly here now since we are fixed so well. I received your letter mailed the 18 on the
     19th. your letters been coming very promptly. Our company is changed to F now. direct your
     letters Company F. Silas Jones is here. he belongs to the 31st regiment Captain Myers Company
     Highlanders. he sends you all his best respects. Frederick Craun is well. he went along to
     Greenbrier on the 3rd. the balance of my Messmates are well. five or six reported sick in our
     company but one serious Stephen D Elliot. they think he has got the fever. William H Fry has
     some Money he wishes to pay me. he says his wife will pay it over to you for me about one
     hundred dollars more or less and I want you to give it to Esq Fulton and fix it so I am safe if
     you can. it you cant fix it so I am safe dont take it. he has written a letter to you to the
     same affect. let me know if you can fix it or not. the weather here has been very favorable
     here for about three weeks or more. no snow of any consequence during this time. I believe this
     is all I have to write this time. </p>
