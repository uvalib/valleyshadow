                <p>My heart &amp; soul both thank you for your dear precious letter of <orig
                        reg="today">to day</orig> by Ada it came to me like a bright ray from
                    Heaven, cheering my lonely heart as nothing else could in all the world but your
                    own dear self. I was so glad so truly glad to hear from you whom I love with all
                    my Soul. You &amp; your precious love are all the world to me I could not
                    live if you did not love me. it is the dearest &amp; sweetest blessing of my
                    life to have <pb n="2"/>your love. The world would be desolate to me without it.
                    The one cry of my heart to you is Oh love me love me only I know you do my love
                    &amp; that fact is the most precious joy of my life. I have been trying
                        <orig reg="today">to day</orig> for dear papa's sake to be cheerful
                    &amp; contented with our Mountain Palace but I do not feel as I can ever be
                    pleased to stay here you &amp; dear Ella are right in saying a mountain life
                    does not suit my taste it does not &amp; never can unless I could be with
                    you. perhaps if I had never known &amp; loved you I might have been more
                    satisfied but you <pb n="3"/>my love fill all my heart &amp; thoughts now.
                    before I loved you I was contented at home with my dear pa &amp; Ma but now
                    I am happiest with you <orig reg="anywhere">any where</orig> for you are more to
                    me <orig reg="than">then</orig> all on Earth father Mother sisters &amp;
                    brother I love but not with the deep absorbing devotion of heart &amp; soul
                    I have for you. You are my all of Earthly happiness &amp; you only. I
                    beleive my heart would break if you would cease to love me Oh how I did want to
                    go back with you Sunday eve. I felt as if I could not give you up &amp; that
                    my very life had gone when you left me. <orig reg="Today">To day</orig> when the
                    cars passed by I cried to think <pb n="4"/>they were going where you are
                    &amp; I could not go too I did wish to be in them &amp; go to Staunton.
                    Three trains went down &amp; two came up. Capt Walton <orig reg="stopped"
                        >stoped</orig> the cars just above us &amp; let Ada off we were standing
                    on the porch <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Capt Walton Mr. Dunlop &amp; another gentleman waved their
                    hands at us until the cars passed out of sight. Capt Walton says he will stop
                    for us <orig reg="whenever">when ever</orig> we want to go or come. Dear pa
                    leaves on the morning train for Baltimore we will be made lonely <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, without him &amp; <unclear>may</unclear> God bless dear
                    papa &amp; let him come back to us soon is my Earnest prayer. I am so
                    anxious to go with you to Staunton Sunday if we live but pa is not willing for
                    me to leave home until after his return from Baltimore. what must I do duty
                    calls for me at <unclear>home</unclear> &amp; love calls me at Staunton. To
                    my heart it would be sweetest to obey the call of love &amp; go with you. I
                    cannot leave Ada only with the children they would be so lonely pa &amp; ma
                    both gone</p>
