                <p>I have the honor to state that the condition of the Freedmen in this District is
                    substantially the same as at my last report.</p>

                <p>Bureau affairs have undergone some change, I having at last secured the presence
                    of a company of Infantry at Harrisonburg which gives me effective jurisdiction
                    in the large county of Rockingham. <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Tubbs at
                    Lexington reports the withdrawal of troops from Botetourt <abbr expan="County"
                        >Co</abbr> and says that without them he can do nothing in that county. I am
                    also led to believe that the troops are taken from Bath and Highland Counties in
                    which case it would be simply useless to attempt the maintenance of agencies
                    there.</p>

                <p>In the counties last named there are but few freedmen and their relations to the
                    Whites generally <unclear>restrictive</unclear> and <unclear>obscure</unclear>.
                    In Botetourt they are in larger numbers and need instruction and protection <pb
                        n="2"/>and I again call attention to the fact that Botetourt County may be
                    best superintended from Lynchburg.</p>

                <p>Overseers of the Poor are generally unable or unwilling to provide for pauper
                    freedmen and in common with other local authorities appear to be awaiting some
                    supposed action of the State Legislature which may, if in accordance with their
                    wishes and expectations, enable them to exhibit their <unclear>patent</unclear>
                    (state) law-abiding proclivities.</p>

                <p>Partial issues of subsistence are thus rendered imperative, and fuel is now
                    necessary to relieve and prevent great suffering among the poor freedmen in this
                    cold mountainous region.</p>

                <p>I have received from the Freedmen's Aid Association in Philadelphia a
                    considerable quantity of clothing which I have been and am distributing among
                    the poorest of the freedmen to their sensible relief, returning their heartfelt
                    gratitude to the donors.</p>
