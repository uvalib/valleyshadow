                <p>I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> your letter of June 25th <abbr
                        expan="instant">inst</abbr> on Friday evening, while Cousin Lizzie <abbr
                        expan="received">recd</abbr> her same date on Monday. I have written a
                    number of letters home since I last heard some or all of which I hope you have
                        <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> ere this.</p>

                <p>I rode out Friday to find poor Robert's grave. It is in a very quiet place, not
                    on the battlefield, but at the foot of a walnut tree near the house of Mrs
                    Starke. He is buried beside <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Terrell. The lady
                    at the House said she intended to have the graves enclosed as soon as it could
                    be done. Cousin Lizzie &amp; every one else seem to think that the <del
                        hand="h1">body</del> remains had better not be moved until <orig reg="they"
                        >the</orig> are to be taken home.</p>

                <p>I have never experienced such a blow as <hi rend="underline">his</hi> death; I
                    could do nothing for several days. I loved him to the exclusion of nearly all
                    else, and <pb n="2"/> that he returned my devotion in full measure, I well know.
                    He alone had my confidence and he alone never blamed me. I had feared his fall
                    for I knew how brave he was and any one who has seen the rain of death missiles
                    on a battlefield will wonder more that any escape than that any particular one
                    was killed, yet I had hoped he would escape.</p>

                <p>When I saw him in the army, we had a great deal of conversation, he seemed to
                    have no fear of death at all, and said he was ready and willing to meet any
                    emergency; still he would talk of what we would do after the war. Poor dear boy,
                    I have often said and felt, and now, more than ever, that if I saw death coming
                    towards him I would gladly push <pb n="3"/> him aside and plant myself in his
                    footsteps that he might be saved rather than I. I would gladly have fallen in
                    his place. He used to put his arms around me and tell me how much he loved me
                    and show me the mug that I had given him years before &amp; how he had <del
                        hand="h1">left</del> held on to it &amp; prized it. <del hand="h1">above
                        all</del> And to think <hi rend="underline">he</hi> was killed, it was <hi
                        rend="underline">too too</hi> hard. He told me much of what he intended to
                    do for you &amp; that I must attend to his matters if he should be killed
                    &amp; carry out his plans as far as I could. Which I shall certainly do. The
                    day that Dr Brown got word that the body had been found I was not at congress,
                    nor the office. I did not feel like work &amp; had paid a man to write the
                    proceedings for me. Dr B. only had an hour &amp; a half's ticket <pb n="4"/>
                    and in that time could not find me, though he looked for me. I had gone to a
                    friends house for rest &amp; have quiet. As soon as it is practicable I will
                    have the body taken home.</p>

                <p>I will go home as soon as possible. I had fully expected to have gotten off
                    today, but my business keeps me here. I have suffered more with neuralgia for
                    the last six weeks, than for many <del hand="h1">weeks</del> months past. And
                    lost time in consequence.</p>

                <p>I rejoice that the Yankees did <unclear>harm</unclear> so little home, though
                    they have been such a scourge <unclear>with</unclear> lately. I had
                        <unclear>enclosed</unclear> the daily Enquirer the set of some two months
                    ago &amp; supposed it was going, but it seemed the <orig reg="necessary"
                        >neccisary</orig> direction had been lost. I found the Sentinel had been
                    stopped, but had it continued. I started over to Chimborazo Hospital yesterday
                    (Sunday) to find John Wright, but had to turn back, not being <pb n="5"/> able
                    to walk over. I went up last night &amp; saw Dr Voden, surgeon in charge of
                    one of the Divisions &amp; he will find him if he is there, and tell me this
                    evening. I will write immediately, if he is found.</p>

                <p>John Humphreys is in Albemarle. Tell William I will write him today or tomorrow.</p>

                <p>I grieve to hear of Mary Lou's sickness, do hope it will be of short duration. I
                    have done all in my power to get a letter to James, but it is impossible to do
                    so. I will write to some friends North &amp; tell them that he is in <abbr
                        expan="Fort">Ft</abbr> Delaware. I can send letters through to persons
                    living North, but not to a prisoner of War.</p>
