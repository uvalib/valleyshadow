                <p>Hotchkiss writes to Governor Letcher on behalf of a Colonel Heck, who was
                    captured and sent to a Union prison. He asks Letcher to consider a prisoner
                    exchange so that Heck's regiment may be reorganized as it once was before the
                    war.</p>

                <p>At the request of the officers and men of our regiment, the one formally
                    commanded by Lt. Col. Heck, I write to you to ask that you will have our
                    regiment reorganized as it was before, by having an exchange of prisioners with
                    the Lincoln government, if posssible, that our Captains and privates may come
                    back to the regiment, as they all desire, and that we may again be put under the
                    command of Col. Heck- who had and still has the respect and confidence of all
                    who were formally under his command and whose conduct, in trying circumstances,
                    was worthy of all praise, and his last act before the surrender, urging another
                    attempt to escape and showing that it was practicable (and it was proven to have
                    been so by the fact that soon after he did so he did escape) proves that he was
                    worthy to command.</p>
                <p>I am sure that you will endeavor yourself more than ever to a large number of the
                    best men of Augusta, Rockbridge, Pendelton, Highland, and Upsher if you will
                    grant as yours did and the power you have in the matter, in reorganizing a
                    regiment that was a credit to the state when complete and in active service, and
                    that when broken by the fortunes of war has kept up its own organization, and
                    all of its members have kept immaculate the honor of the state in the midst of
                    insubordination and misconduct on the part of other regiments. Therefore with
                    the most confidence we ask this favor of your excellency.</p>
                <closer>
