                    SubDistrict in obedience to Circular No 5. Series of 1864 from Head Quarters

                    <hi rend="underline">First Division</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">Frederick County</hi>
                </p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The general condition of the
                    freedpeople is much improved since last report. With the spring came employment
                    for all who were able to work, and except in cases of sickness or old age, the
                    colored people have acquired a certain degree of independence which if properly
                    directed will have a moral force which even their enemies must <pb n="2"
                    />respect. The "lazy drunken Niggers" so often heard of have disappeared and the
                    "white gentlemen" have more than filled up the vacuum.</p>

                <p>On occasion of decorating the graves of the confederate dead in Winchester on the
                        6<hi rend="super">th</hi> June a scene of drunkeness and riot presented
                    itself throughout the day which more than equaled the puny efforts (compared
                    therewith) of the whole colored population of the County for the last twelve
                    months. She sure went down on that day, remarkable only for swearing, fighting,
                    drinking shouting and horse-racing and had the colored people indulged in a like
                    manner, on a similar occasion, on the Union dead, the County Jail could not
                    contain their numbers.</p>

                <p>I am sorry to report that outrages on the colored people have been of more
                    frequent occurrence within the past quarter, than formerly and that Justice is
                    discriminating in favor of the white man and I regret to state that in such
                    cases, when appeal is taken to the Military Commissioner, they do not receive
                    the attention which they seem to demand.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>Except in cases of sickness or extreme old age, but very little suffering exists.
                    The County Authorities have shown every disposition to care for both cases, and
                    also for such others as had a legitimate claim for public aid.</p>

                <p>Very few contracts for labor have been made at this office, as the freedmen have
                    grown distrustful of the intentions of employers to honestly abide by and
                    faithfully perform their duty in such cases. The experience of the two past
                    years has convinced them that at the expiration of long contracts they almost
                    invariably find themselves in debt to the employer, or if a balance be due them,
                    they have to resort to litigation to obtain it, and the expense of legal
                    proceedings would generally more than counterbalance the sums due.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">nd</hi></hi> The hope of impartial justice
                    to colored people in cases where they are interested against whites is remote.
                    She who was supposed to be blind has so far recovered the use of one eye, as to
                    see and punish the offences of the freedmen, which are always brought within the
                    range of her vision, while with the imperfect <pb n="4"/>sight of the other, she
                    blindly winks at the white man. Not only is this the case in Jury trials, but
                    even Magistrates will stretch the law to convict a colored or acquit a white
                    man.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Marriage Register for the
                    division is believed to be complete. No additions are made to it, and all
                    persons contemplating marriage are now referred to the County Clerks for a
                    license.</p>

                    >d</hi></hi> No opportunity is lost to instruct the freedpeople as to their

                    >rd</hi></hi>The Civil Authorities take no action to abate lewdness and
                    adultery, and although every effort is made by us, both through the churches and
                    otherwise, bastardy is alarmingly common.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Paragraph">Par</abbr> 4<hi rend="super"
                    >th</hi></hi> Only one surname is used by the Freedpeople.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The County and corporation
                    provide adequate means for the care of their indigent citizens. <pb n="5"/>and
                    the treatment of the races is believed to be impartial. Many Freedpeople,
                    however, from a general superstition will not avail themselves of the privileges
                    of the poorhouse.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The supply of labor is equal
                    to the demand. During July and the continuance of harvest many more could find
                    employment, but only for a short period. As there is a consant floating
                    population to meet all demands, no encouragement can be given for the
                    importation from other sections, of any considerable number of laborers.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The schools, which have been
                    well attended during the past three months have closed, with one exception.
                    Notwithstanding opposing influences attendant on sectarian quarrels, there has
                    been a more marked degree of improvement in all the schools, than in any former
                    session. The Methodists have opened their church and a Summer school will be
                    continued therein. The people of the Bethel Church are erecting a building to be
                    used jointly as a church &amp; Schoolhouse. It will be <pb n="6"/>ready by
                    fall. The Baptists also have some funds on hand for the purpose of building a
                    church and Schoolhouse, so that by another year Winchester will be amply
                    provided with the necessary buildings to accomodate all who may desire or be
                    induced to attend school. A school at Newtown was organized during the quarter
                    and sustained without expense to the Bureau. By having the rent paid by the
                    Bureau another year, sufficient inducements may be offered to procure the
                    service of a more competent teacher at the above place.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Second Division</hi> comprising the Counties of <hi
                        rend="underline">Clarke</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Warren</hi> &amp; <hi
                        rend="underline">Page</hi>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> In this division no
                    perceptible change in the general condition of the freedpeople is apparent.
                    Although all are employed no cases of suffering are reported, yet as no
                    considerable number of freedpeople are congregated at any one place, it is
                    difficult to estimate the general <pb n="7"/>condition.</p>

                <p>At the principal places, namely Berryville, Clarke <abbr expan="County"
                    >Co</abbr>, Front Royal in Warren County and Luray in Page County, there is
                    evidence that the freedpeople as a class are not far behind many of their white
                    neighbors.</p>

                <p>The schools in this division have been as well attended as could be expected, and
                    the people generally are believed to be industrious, temperate and prosperous.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The likelihood of full justice
                    being given to freedpeople in cases against whites is very questionable.
                    Frequently on colored people applying for redress of grievances to Magistrates
                    their complaints are met with excuses, and only on application of the officer of
                    the Bureau have such complaints been attended to. If official restraints were
                    removed I do not think full justice would <add hand="h1" place="inline">be</add>
                    given to freedpeople.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Marriage Register is
                    supposed to be complete for each County of this Division.</p>

                    >d</hi></hi> No notice is taken by the Civil Authorities of lewdness or adultery
                    and bastardy is not publicly looked upon as <unclear>Criminal</unclear>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline"><abbr expan="Paragraph">Par.</abbr> 4</hi> Only one surname
                    is used by colored people.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> Each County provides for its
                    own poor, of both colors. The means as regards buildings, are poor and the
                    feelings of the freedpeople are so strongly opposed to the poorhouse, that it
                    would be difficult to induce even the most destitute to enter them.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The supply of labor is not at
                    present equal to the demand. Many more could find employment at perhaps $10 to
                    $12 per month with the usual allowances farming hands alone are wanting.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The schools having closed
                    with the exception of one at Berryville, I can only observe that the
                    qualifications of the teachers were not of a character to reasonably expect much
                    from Schools in their charge. Mrs. Jackson, <abbr expan="colored">col.</abbr> at
                    Berryville is however an exception wither the two months of her administration a
                    perceptible improvement is observed. <pb n="9"/>The demand for schools in other
                    places than where held last winter, are not urgent, and if organized it is
                    doubtful if a sufficient number of pupils would attend to warrant the experiment
                    of employing a teacher and other expenses.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Third Division</hi> comprising the Counties of <hi
                        rend="underline">Shenandoah &amp; Rockingham</hi>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> All the Freedpeople are
                    employed and as in the 2<hi rend="super">d</hi> Division they are well
                    distributed, except at Harrisonburg, and their general condition is prosperous.
                    At the latter place there is a good schoolhouse, the property of the colored
                    people well attended, and showing a degree of efficiency commendable to Miss
                    Phoebe Libby the teacher. This school also closes on the 1<hi rend="super"
                    >st</hi> July, much to the regret of parents, and pupils. Reports of unprovoked
                    assaults on Freedpeople and known Union people are well founded, and the recent
                    outrage perpetrated at Woodstock before reported is perhaps the best indication
                    of popular opinion which can be cited. While the freedpeople are industrious <pb
                        n="10"/>peaceable and temperate, showing every disposition to become good
                    law abiding citizens, they are not always permitted to enjoy the fruits of their
                    industry quietly, but are cruelly maltreated by vagabonds, publicly known in
                    their locality as "White gentlemen. The frequent absence of Mr. <hi
                        rend="underline">Hall</hi> from his division and his reticence in affairs
                    taking place during such absences no doubt stimulates offenders to repetition of
                    such unlawful practices. A second outrage was perpetrated on the colored girl
                        <hi rend="underline">Celina Jackson</hi> during my recent visit on
                    inspection to Woodstock.</p>

                <p>While the girl was walking quietly into Church on the Sabbath she was assaulted
                    and struck across the face with an umbrella by <hi rend="underline">Robert
                            <unclear>Law</unclear></hi> one of the party who on a former occasion
                    was fined "one cent" by a Jury for whipping Mr <hi rend="underline">George
                    Rye</hi>, present State Treasurer.</p>

                <p>If practicable I would respectfully recommend that the officer of the Bureau at
                    Woodstock may also be appointed Military Commissioner, with full power to
                    correct abuses which are totally neglected by <pb n="11"/>the Civil Authorities,
                    and which if permitted to increase will eventually lead to serious results.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The liklihood of full and
                    complete justice being given to freedmen in cases where they are interested
                    against whites is hopeful in Rockingham County but the indications in Shenandoah
                    County are such as to leave no room for hope, unless a radical change takes
                    place in the community, and a more determined effort is made by the officers of
                    the law to execute their duties with fidelity.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Register of Marriages is
                    completed, and each of the four paragraphs contained in Circular 11 series of
                    1866 are believed to be fully carried out.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The County authorities have
                    ample provision for caring for their own indigent poor, and freedpeople are
                    received and treated as are the White inmates. Outdoor relief, where the
                    necessities of the case require is also given.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The demand for labor is
                    greater than the supply except at Harrisonburg. Many families could find
                    employment in both Counties at about $10 per month.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi> The schools at <orig
                        reg="Harrisonburg">Harrisonburgh</orig> and Woodstock which <pb n="12"/>are
                    now closed, were in excellent condition, well attended and well conducted, with
                    the advancement as progression and rapid as could be expected.</p>

                <p>Edinburg, Mt. Jackson, Strasburg &amp; New Market in Shenandoah County
                    require schools, but nothing can be expected from the people towards their
                    establishment or support.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Fourth Division</hi> comprising the counties of <hi
                        rend="underline">Augusta</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Highland</hi>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="super">st</hi></hi> The affairs of the
                    freedpeople in this division indicate that steady advancement is gradually being
                    made by this class.</p>

                <p>They are all employed at reasonable wages, are generally industrious, and show
                    that they are disposed to make themselves a thrifty, self-supporting and
                    law-abiding population.</p>

                <p><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    <hi rend="underline">Jordan</hi> the officer in charge reports that from the
                    indications, they are losing their interest in political matters, that is so far
                    as allowing political meetings to interfere with their occupations. From
                    conversations, however <pb n="13"/>with many of the people themselves, I find a
                    very lively interest manifested, with an intelligent discrimination as to their
                    interests, and decided convictions as to who are their friends and who are not.
                    I would also remark that their appreciation of the relation they sustain to each
                    other, especially in regard to the marriage relation is assuming a more
                    substantial aspect. It is believed that as far as the general condition of the
                    freedmen is concerned they are prosperous, intelligent and happy nevertheless
                    intemperance and immorality are far too common and no efforts made by the local
                    authorities, to prevent drunkenness or lewdness.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> In cases where a colored
                    person is a party to the action and especially if the other party is an
                    influential and popular white man prejudice in the lower Court controls both
                    Court and Jury to a much greater extent than do the facts or evidence. In the
                    higher Courts also the statement of a colored man, as compared with that of a
                    white man does not appear to have the same weight. I cannot believe that a
                    colored person could obtain full and complete justice in any of the Courts if
                    the Military Authority was withdrawn.</p>

                <pb n="14"/>

                <p><hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi></hi> The Register of Marriages is
                    complete for Augusta County. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Jordan has not as
                    yet had the time necessary to complete it in Highland County. The first three
                    paragraphs of Circular No. 11 are carried out. The neglect of the Civil
                    Authorities to prevent or punish lewdness or adultery is not calculated to
                    improve the morals of the Freedpeople. But one surname is used.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">4<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi>
                    <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
                    <hi rend="underline">Jordan</hi> reports that he is informed the authorities are
                    able, but not willing to provide for their own poor, and that the overseers of
                    the poor take but very little substantial interest in the subject. No complaints
                    however are made and at present the same aid is extended to all regardless of
                    race or color. The authorized appropriation for this purpose in Augusta County
                    is $5000 and in Highland County $1000 - which would seem to be ample. There are
                    now a number of both races, who because of old age or helplessness are receiving
                    aid, in both Counties, both in and out of the poorhouses.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">5<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> The demand for labor is
                    greater than the Supply <pb n="15"/>and all who are disposed to work are
                    employed at reasonable wages.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">6<hi rend="super">t</hi></hi> As in the other divisions of
                    the Sub District the Schools are now closed. The interest of the freedpeople in
                    them is unabated and proportionate to their circumstances. Mount Crawford and
                    Mount Sidney in Augusta County and Monterey in Highland County are favorable
                    locations for the establishment of schools, but little or no assistance could be
                    expected from the inhabitants towards their support.</p>

                <p>On the tour of inspection, reports of the freedpeople were everywhere
                    encouraging. They are generally sober, industrious and peacable. They are
                    strictly observant of the law; have firm and abiding interest in religion and
                    education, show a commendable spirit and an intelligent appreciation on all
                    public questions which are calculated to affect their prosperity as a race, and
                    are surely and steadily progressing to that scale of manhood which will command
                    for them equality before the law, and <pb n="16"/>eventually the respect of even
                    their enemies.</p>

                <p>The relations existing between themselves and the white race, up to the middle of
                    May was hopeful. Numerous outrages since that time have been committed against
                    colored people, which the law has dealt with so leniently, as would seem to
                    invite future aggressions. A well grounded appeal taken before the Military
                    Commissioner at Winchester has been production of no good, and the freedpeople
                    (with the exception of the mockery of a trial) are <orig reg="defenseless"
                        >defenceless</orig> against the assaults of white persons.</p>

                <p>Education the freedman's anchor of hope is embraced with fervancy and its power
                    will shortly have a telling effect. By it they are gaining that confidence in
                    themselves which will elevate them above the dependence upon the white man,
                    which slavery taught them was indispensible to their very existence. Freedmen's
                    schools now dot the land in this Sub <abbr expan="District">Dist.</abbr> like
                    village churches, and are at least as well attended. <pb n="17"/>Every village
                    also has its sabbath school, with an attendance of from ten upwards.</p>

                <p>At the several stations the official records and papers were in a satisfactory
                    condition and except in one case, no complaints were made against the officers.</p>

                <p>The continuance of the Bureau for one year longer is a source of rejoicing to the
                    freedpeople as well as their friends, and as far as I can judge, its practical
                    workings has given general satisfaction.</p>
