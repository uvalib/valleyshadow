 <p>Your letter of the 3<hi rend="super">rd</hi> inst was received last  
 week, and I was very glad to hear from you for I had not had a letter from you  
 for some time.  I would have <orig reg="written">writen</orig> Sooner if I could  
 have Sent it.  The mail has not gone from here for the last week.  I thought I  
 would write this and have it ready when it does go.  I suppose<pb n="2"/> 
  
 you have arrived Safe in old Callensburg.  You will be quite a Stranger there  
 after being away so long.  And no doubt you will be very lonesome for a while.   
 It must be very quiet about the old Town; I would like very much to pay you a  
 visit this fall.  But I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know <orig  
 reg="whether">wheather</orig> I will or not.  It is pretty hard to get away, and  
 we can only get from twenty to twenty-five days leave and that is a short time  
 to go so far.  I would only have a few days to stay at home.  It is now over a  
 year since I saw you all at home.  And it seems like a long time.  But I hope  
 that this cruel war will<pb n="3"/> 
  
 soon be over (not that I am tired of fighting for the Cause in which we are  
 Engaged) so that we may be able to return to our homes and Enjoy peace and  
 happiness once more.  I suppose the <hi rend="underline">young</hi> <hi  
 rend="underline">gents</hi> that just returned from the <hi  
 rend="underline">War</hi> have been telling you of the many <hi  
 rend="underline">thrilling</hi> <hi rend="underline">adventures</hi> and  
 <hi rend="underline">hairbreath</hi> <hi rend="underline">escapes</hi>  
 which <hi rend="underline">they</hi> <hi rend="underline">have</hi>  
 made.  I suppose there was quite an Excitement about the time the Draft was  
 made?  No doubt there was a great many very uneasy.  We have one consolation.

 Father that I am looking for a letter from him.  I suppose Mother is busy  
 putting up Tomatoes.  give her a kiss for me.  I believe I have <hi
