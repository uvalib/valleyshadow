                <p>Horace Greeley urges Edward McPherson to support Thaddeus Stevens, who formerly
                    lived in McPherson's district, for the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
                    in the House.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Excuse the liberty I take in making a few <unclear>suggestions</unclear> with
                    regard to the organization of the House. I write to you because since you
                    represent the district in which Mr. Thaddeus Stevens formerly lived, I presume
                    what I have to say will meet your concurrence and perhaps secure your
                    cooperation.</p>

                <p>It seems to me desirable that Mr. Stevens should be Chairman of the committee of
                    Ways and Means of the new House. I know no other mem- <pb n="2"/>ber thereof who
                    is his superior in ability, in experience, or in the earnestness of his devotion
                    to those principles which I trust the Union is about to stamp with its approval.
                    It seems exceedingly desirable, moreover, that the action of the house, at
                    least, on the Tariff question should be in <unclear>accordance</unclear> with
                    the wishes and the interests of Pennsylvania. Who understands these better or
                    can't <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> them more eficiently than Thaddeus Stevens? I know of no
                    one.</p>

                <p>Mr. John <unclear>Sherman</unclear> of Ohio seems almost certain to be Speaker --
                    provided we triumph in the organization. It seems to me but <pb n="3"
                    />reasonable that, if Ohio has the Speaker, we should concede the position of
                    leader on the floor to Pennsylvania, provided the latter present one of her
                    foremost men and <unclear>bless</unclear> him with reasonable unanimity. Now I
                    fear that Mr. James H. Campbell, having been a member of the Ways and Means in
                    the XXXIVth Congress, may insist on being Chairman -- or at least on that
                    Committee -- now, and so divide your delegation and throw that position out of
                    your State. I cannot, of course, interpose against Mr. Campbell; but <hi
                        rend="underline">you</hi> can do much that I cannot. Are you disposed to
                    consult your Members, and ascertain how many of them can be induced to write in
                    requesting the appointment of Mr. Stevens to this important post? I write <pb
                        n="4"/> only to <hi rend="underline">suggest</hi> what seems to me
                    important, especially for your State, which must be heartily with us in '60 or
                    we lose the fight. If you disagree with me, drop me a line; at all events,
                    consider this letter confidential and believe me</p>
