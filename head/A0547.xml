    <p>I received your letter in due time. I have been busily employed since I wrote last either
     reading or working. I have been reading Prescott's Conquest of Mexico in three volumes of more
     than five hundred pages each. I will soon be through with the last volume. These volumes belong
     to the Summerville circulating library I wish there was public spirit <add hand="h1"
      place="inline">enough</add> in Talladega to get up a public library. After I get through with
     Mexico I will try to get Prescott's Peril and History of "Ferdinand and Isabella". I feel that
     my health is greatly improved since I came here. I was at church yesterday in Summerville. Rev.
     Mr. The. Smith preached. I went home with Mr. Gilkeson and stayed all night. Next morning Mr
     Gilkeson, Willie, and myself went over to M rs. McCrae's and stayed awhile. I came <del
      hand="h1"/> way back <add hand="h1" place="inline"> to Grandpa's</add> in the evening I'd
     spent an hour at Mrs. Rounceville's. David is recovering his strength <unclear>

     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> start ba ck to the army Friday. Were any Talladega companies in the battle
     below Richmond? I am anxious to know how they fared. I can't comprehend the reason you give for
     secession that the North and the South did not love each other. With what cruel hatred do the
     most pious people of the North regard the Southern Rebels "Rebellion is as the sin of
     witchcraft." The pious and highly conservative Dr. Engles declares that our <unclear>
      <orig reg="moment">mo</orig>
     </unclear>ment of piousness Consigns the South to Execr ation! Malignant fanaticism fills the
     best minds in the north. The Christians of the North are as much justifiable for Supporting
     this war as the pious Catholics were for supporting the Inquisition. </p>
