    </opener>

    <p>Your sweet little letter came to me day before yesterday, much to my gratification as I had
     not heard from you since my leaving so unceremoniously; so you may be sure I was pleased to
     find you in such good humor (by the way there is one of the worst rattle brains the world ever
     saw -- Tom Sneed a red- headed mischief of the <abbr expan="Engineer">Eng.</abbr> Corps, at my
     elbow <unclear>raising</unclear>
     <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> -- so there will not be much coherency in my letter. I should have written
     before but yesterday the Yanks came up towards Orange <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> as
     though they thought of fighting, so we had to pack up, start the train to the rear, get the
     troops together and go away through the fields to find them, but our cavalry started them back
     before the infantry got near -- so all we got for our move was a good ducking, a tramp through
     the mud, had our tents to put up about dark, in the same place <pb n="2"/> on wet ground
     &amp;c. but we got it all done, carpeted our floor with boughs and leaves and so got along
     very well -- I had an attack of cholera <unclear>Morbus</unclear> yesterday morning, a chill
     first -- <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> imagine how I brought it on unless I ate <orig reg="too"
      >to</orig> many fried apples -- for, though blackberries are very abundant in the field where
     we are, and we have a plenty of them all the time, I do not think they would hurt me, but I got
     along yesterday &amp; last night took a cup of tea and slept soundly and so feel very well
     today. We are to have a quiet Sunday, no business going on -- Gen. Lee has ordered that no
     business shall be transacted in any of our armies on Sunday -- a very good order. The Gen. just
     told the <abbr expan="Adjutant General">Adj. Gen.</abbr> not to issue any passes today too, so
     there will not be much moving about. I told you, before, about our camp, what a nice place it
     is in, but it is very hard to get anything to eat, save what we got from the Commissary. I want
     Nelson <pb n="3"/> to buy, if he has not got them, and send me a basket of onions and two
     baskets of potatoes, in a barrel to Gordonsville, but I will write to him, and we want ten
     pounds of butter, buy it of Mrs. Wilson, or some one and you work it over &amp; put it up
     as you did the crock for me in Staunton, so it will keep as that did, and send it too, we are
     now in a mess of four and share the expenses so we want these things, cost what they may I send
     you a sprig of cedar from Montpelier, the residence of <abbr expan="President">Pres.</abbr>
     Madison, and also another which you will please give to Allie from the same place -- we are
     encamped not far from Montpelier -- in the Red lined region of the State -- the land is red
     clay -- all red &amp; everything is stained with the same color -- but it is rich and
     productive and abounds in fine scenery -- The enemy occupies a considerable of the Piedmont
     country -- mostly in the <pb n="4"/> county of Culpeper and Madison scouting up this way some,
     &amp; occasionally coming in as far as the by stations of the <abbr expan="Railroad"
     >R.R.</abbr> -- but they have not caught any train or done much damage yet and usually are made
     to pay for their temerity very soon. Two prisoners were just brought in -- they are from Ohio,
     but claim to belong to the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Va. Cavalry -- say they are very tired of
     the war -- dull looking cattle -- they want to be paroled, but not exchanged.</p>
    <p> Let Nelly learn to write, by all means -- the three R's, as the old field teachers call
     them, are the foundation of education, book education, and they must be well learned to begin
     with -- the pencil and slate first, the pen &amp; paper next -- I will get the things you
     want if I can find them -- I do not know when we shall move, or where we may go to -- I shall
     draw my pay at the close of this month and will send you some more money -- I do not know when
     I may be home -- but will come as soon as I can --</p>
    <p> I am sorry you did not get a good bye kiss -- but I trust I shall be home again before very
     long -- love to all and kisses for the children. Tell <orig reg="Allen">allen</orig> his time
     will come yet -- Write soon --</p>
