              <p>Thomas M. Smiley did not write "1863" on the letter. It is difficult to determine if the
        date is on the envelope's postmark. A family member or archivist wrote the number 9 in the
        upper right hand corner of the first page.</p>

    <p>I take my pencil in hand this morning to write you a few lines to let you know how I am I am
     still in the hospital but expect to go to camp <orig reg="today">to day</orig> or tomorrow.
     there is four others of our company in this place J.B. M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Cutchen John
     Wade George Baylor and James Snyder but they will all get out soon. John M<hi rend="super"
     >c</hi>Kemy C Baylor and Almarine Gay are also sick and in private houses. The people of
     Winchester are very kind to the sick and wounded soldiers visiting them and giving them books
     and tracts to read in order to pass the long and weary<pb n="3" entity="Smiley48b" pid="uva-lib:503230"/>
      hours pleasantly away. We are very well waited on in this hospital
     the rooms are kept nice and clean We have cots to lay on three placed in every room some of the
     large rooms have more The Doctor says there is 175 sick at this hospital but they are <orig
      reg="generally">generaly</orig> getting better. There has been one death here since I came A
      M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Walker from Georgia he died of fever the only case that has been here
     John Beard arrived here tuesday morning and give an account of how things were going on in
     Augusta he said the militia had been ordered out every man of them some of them <orig
      reg="were">wer</orig> disposed to make fun when we left saying that we missed it<pb n="4" entity="Smiley48c" pid="uva-lib:503231"/>
      when we Joined a volunteer company but I guess it will come home
     to them now as the volunteers have easy times to what the militia have The militia here are
     employed in throwing up breastworks and planting cannon while the volunteers are laying in
     their tents and drilling occasionally. We were looking for a battle to come off before this but
     it has not come off yet but a battle is expected before long as the enemy are encamped only
     about 12 mile from us should they see fit to attack us on that side we will be able to give
     them a merry reception. But I must bring my scrawl to a close as I am too nervous to write</p>
