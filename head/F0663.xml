                <p>I take this chance of writing to you as we expect to move this evening or
                    tomorrow morning and I may not have another opportunity for a few days. I am
                    well and Jacob is well with the exception of a Slight cold. We have been paid
                    and received our bounty up to the Second of November. I sent thirty five $35.00
                    to be expressed at Washington by our <unclear>adjutants</unclear> and two days
                    after we drew our <unclear>bounty</unclear> 27$ which I put into <abbr

                    <unclear>Craig</unclear> to Washington and expressed there. ours will be sent to
                    Mr. Grove. You will get it there and write Immediately and let me know whether
                    you got it. We drew three months pay <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> one day <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> we were mustered in one <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> it was $38.55 and our <unclear>bounty</unclear> which was
                    $27.00 I sent <unclear>sixty</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and kept $5.55. had left of <unclear>amount</unclear> $3.50
                    which leaves me $7.05<unclear> which I think will be as much as need carry with
                        me and I can write for some of mine should I run out but I think this will
                        see me out. If any thing unusual happens I will write of it in a few
                    days.</unclear> I think you got a cheap pair of mules if they are anything <del
