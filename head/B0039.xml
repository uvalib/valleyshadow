                <p>I have just <abbr expan="received">Rec<hi rend="super">d</hi></abbr> your letter
                    this evening and hasten to reply. At the time of writing to <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen</abbr> Schofield I did not know that you were
                    established at Staunton or I should have written to you instead. I have no
                    complaint to make of an official, either Military or Judicial as I believe they
                    are all prompt executing the law when called upon. That which I complain of as
                    being <hi rend="underline">intolerable</hi> is horse stealing and the trouble is
                    to get officials on the task in time and not in any want of of promptness on
                    their part. In Some neighborhoods in Augusta County the citizens are forming
                    themselves into vigilance committees for their <pb n="2"/> own protection
                    against this nuisance, and we were about doing the same, and I had written to
                    the <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr> as one of the
                    Committee for instructions not wishing to go into an arrangement of that kind
                    unless with the sanction of the Commandment of this <abbr expan="District"
                            >Dis<hi rend="super">t</hi></abbr> horse stealing has highly become
                    intolerable here a short time since there were five horses Stolen from this
                    immediate neighborhood in one night from different persons the <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">time</add> that would, necessarily have been consumed in
                    getting officials would have enabled them <add hand="h1" place="inline">(the
                        theives)</add> to make their escape but by pursuing them at once they were
                    over taken in the north mountain and the horses recovered. But for want of arms
                    the theives escaped which is to be regreted by every law abiding citizen. <pb
                        n="3"/>Since then there have been other horses stolen in the <orig
                        reg="neighborhood">neighbourhood</orig>, no doubt by the same individuals so
                    that no one was safe at any time. It was with a view to break up this band of
                    marauders that the letter was written and not designing to call in question the
                        <unclear>promptness</unclear> of any offical whatever <del hand="h1"
                        >(Scratched out writing)</del> Hoping this explanation may be satisfactory. </p>
