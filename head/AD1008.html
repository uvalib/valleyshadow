<p><i>Revisions to the electronic version: </i>May 2001:  Susanna Michele Lee,
                    <br>Proofread against the transcription obtained from the
collections of the Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania County
Battlefields National Memorial Military Park in
Fredericksburg, Virginia.  According to the original
transcriber:  "The diary is in one note book, strung together
with a lot of commas, very few periods so the paragraphs are
my doing.  I read it into a tape recorder and wrote it out in
long hand and then typed it, so the original spelling and
maybe some of his meaning was lost."  Typographical errors by
the original transcriber, like "founght" for "fought," have
been corrected without comment.  The version from the National
Memorial Military Park contains notations in parentheses by
the original transcriber.  These notations have been tagged
according to TEI guidelines.  Dates in parentheses in the
version from the National Memorial Military Park have been
retained in this version.  In addition, for the sake of
clarity, this version of the Diary of James E. Beard includes
dates in [brackets] which are not in the version from the
National Memorial Military Park.<br>January - July 2008:  Scholarly Resources migration staff, University of Virginia Library,
                    <br>Converted markup (originally TEI Lite) to comply with the UVa Library TEI DTD (uva-dl-tei).<br></p>
