                </opener>

                <p>This evening I seat myself with pen in hand to inform you that your kind letter
                    of the 27th came to hand this morning.</p>

                <p>I was much rejoiced to know that you were all well. Through the Mercy and
                    Goodness of God, I can <orig reg="thank">that</orig> that I am well-both in
                        <orig reg="Soul">Soule</orig> and body. Hoping that these few imperfect
                    lines may find you all enjoying the same blessings of health.</p>

                <p>We are still in Camp yet, not knowing how soon we may get orders to go out on a
                        <orig reg="reconnoiter">reconnoter</orig>. I do not think that we will make
                    a general move till, May as we cannot <orig reg="move">mover</orig> our <orig
                        reg="artillery">artilery</orig> before that time through the swamps of
                    Virginia. Although at this time the weather is very pleasant and has been for
                    some five weeks.</p>

                <p>We had some rain and a few pretty cold days. A few days ago it commenced to snow.
                    The snow only fell about 1 inch deep. The weather here changes very soon. And it
                    does not take very much snow or rain to make it very <orig reg="muddy"
                    >mudy</orig>.</p>

                <p>I have not heard <orig reg="whether">wether</orig> General <orig reg="Kilpatrick"
                        >Killpaterick</orig> has returned to camp or not. I will know 'ere long if I
                    live.</p>

                <p>While the weather is pleasant no doubt the <orig reg="cavalry">cavelry</orig> may
                    make some raids; if they do then we will be very apt to support them. The raid
                    that was made the 6th day of February, we supported them or as I say our Corps
                    will support this present raids. The 6th Corps supports them while we are kept
                    in <orig reg="readiness">rediness</orig>. We got orders to prepare 3 days
                    rations last Sunday Morning at 7 O'clock and to be ready to march at a moment's
                    warning.</p>

                <p>On the 6th of February the time we marched to the <orig reg="Rapidan"
                    >Rapidon</orig>, General Warren, Our Corps Commander-while General Hancock is
                    not here Warren is in his place, to make this <orig reg="plain">plaine</orig> as
                    I can to you in my ignorant way of writing. General <orig reg="Caldwell"
                    >Colwell</orig> commands the first Division.</p>

                <p>Now, this is our Division. General Hays did command or was commander of the 3rd
                    Division at that time. Well, General Warren, acting Corps Commander, while
                    General <orig reg="Hancock">Hanock</orig> is at home recruiting for our Corps.
                    Warren told Hays to advance to the Rapidan and not to cross or <orig
                        reg="attack">atack</orig> the enemy. But him having his senses deranged with
                    whiskey took the 3rd Division across. Made his men wade the river; Some of the
                    men got drowned while <orig reg="crossing">crosssing</orig>. Then he had to
                    march by the flank in front of the enemy's <orig reg="artillery">artilery</orig>
                    while they showered with grape and shell into the ranks of the 3rd Division. The
                    report was 250 killed, wounded and missing. But I do not believe it.</p>

                <p>The 3rd Division was not all across. Well, then, our Division stayed on this side
                    of the river from where we stayed we could not stop the <abbr expan="rebels"
                        >rebs</abbr>. The object was to draw the <abbr expan="rebels">rebs</abbr>
                    attention there while <orig reg="Kilpatrick">Kipppaterick</orig> would make a
                        <orig reg="raid">raide</orig>. You will understand there was only 2
                    Divisions on that reconnoiter here.</p>

                <p>I will tell you how a Corps is divided. There is 4 Regiments in 1 Brigade. 4
                    Brigades in 1 Division and 4 Divisions in a Corps.</p>

                <p>I cannot think but there was more men killed than was reported. I hope there was
                    not that many killed.</p>

                <p>Well, at home the war is only a matter of report but here it is a reality.</p>

                <p>I have not heard from A. and Ashway for some time.</p>

                <p>I sent a <orig reg="memorial">memmorial</orig> of Our Company to Rachel some time
                    ago. But I expect that it got lost, well, I think that the <orig reg="rebellion"
                        >rebelion</orig> must soon <orig reg="totter">toter</orig> and fall to rise
                    no more. May the Lord hasten the time.</p>

                <p>Well, I must close. You will soon here from me again. Rachel sent me some post
                    stamps but they all are gone. If you can handily <orig reg="send">sent</orig> me
                    some you may <orig reg="send">sende</orig> some.</p>

                <p>Write soon. Give my respect to all <orig reg="inquiring">enquiring</orig>
                    friends.</p>

                <p>My love I send to you all. Hoping if it is the Will of God to meet you all again
                    on earth and if not His Will I hope to meet you all in Heaven.</p>

                <closer>
