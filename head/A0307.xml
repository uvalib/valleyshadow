                <p>In this letter, McCutchan lists the towns his company has marched through in
                    northern Virginia near Harper's Ferry, and he describes their current camp at
                    the Virginia-Maryland border, just across from Union troops. He also writes of
                    the town of Martinsburg and the military hospital there.</p>

                <p>. . .I am not disposed to censure any body for not writing I know that I don't
                    get more than half the letters that are written to me. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>,
                    probably you don't get half of mine.</p>

                <p>The last time I wrote to you I was at the Ferry, but since then we have been on
                    the march a good <unclear>bit</unclear> &amp; have been shifted about from
                    one place to another right often. - We have been in Shepherdstown, Charlestown,
                    Brucetown, Winchester, Bunker Hill, (Buckleburg), Martinsburg, &amp; now we
                    are encamped near Hanesville, about 5 miles N.E. of Martinsburg - We have a very
                    pleasant encampment in a beautiful grove, cool &amp; shady &amp; here
                    beneath these old oaks of the forest I love to stay &amp; when night comes,
                    to root myself in my blanket &amp; lay down with the earth for a bed
                    &amp; the blue heaven for a cover. - There are about 4,000 troops here
                    &amp; a number more within a half days march of this place.</p>

                <p>It is not more than 6 miles to an encampment of Yankees consisting, (according to
                    report of 6,000 men). They are encamped near <abbr expan="Williamsport">Wm's
                        Port</abbr>. This is the lowest point down the river than can be crossed,
                    all the bridges along the river have been burned, &amp; they have encamped
                    there in orders to prevent us from going into <abbr expan="Maryland">MD</abbr>.-
                    Well we don't want to cross over, but we will be very apt to keep them from
                    crossing over here.- They had been crossing over before we came here &amp;
                    had destroyed a quantity of property belonging to secessionists, had entered the
                    house of a widow lady &amp; destroyed her fine furniture.- Our scouts are
                    along the river everyday, &amp; have been fired on twice this week by the
                    blue bellied Yankees on the other side. One of the Waynesborough Cavalry was
                    dangerously wounded in the <orig reg="breast">brest</orig> yesterday while on
                    duty near this river, but we got a yankee to pay for him.</p>

                <p>Martinsburg is a beautiful town, though there are a <unclear>maj</unclear> of
                    unionists there, though the secessionists that are there, are just as kind as
                    they can be. I was there yesterday to see some of our men that were at the
                    hospital, &amp; there were about 20 young ladies, the
                    <unclear>pride</unclear>, beauty &amp; aristocracy of Martinsburg there in
                    that dingy old hospital laboring to <unclear>promote</unclear> the comfort and
                    welfare of the sick soldiers. - <hi rend="underline">Who</hi> would not fight
                    when there are such women as these to fight for?</p>
