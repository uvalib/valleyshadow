                <p>Dr. Cyrus Alexander writes John H. McCue, saying that a Miss Lucy has left
                    Virginia for Ohio with her "Catnip." Alexander also writes of a possible nurse
                    for McCue, John Brown's Raid, and expresses his support for Millard Filmore and
                    opposition to Wise, Seward, and Douglass.</p>

                <p>Yours of --- is to hand, and I am sorry to say that your friend Miss Lucy is no
                    longer an inhabitant of this Commonwealth, for some unknown cause -- probably
                    because the "<hi rend="underline">Species</hi> were not propagated fast enough
                    in this region. She emigrated to Ohio last Spring, with no intention of <hi
                        rend="underline">ever</hi> returning. Does it not make you <hi
                        rend="underline">weep</hi> to think that you have forever lost the services
                    of Lucy &amp; her "<hi rend="underline">Catnip</hi>". As she has <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">always</add> been a necessary <hi rend="underline"
                        >institution</hi> in your Domestic affairs, I see no other channel for you
                    in the future, than to "shut up shop" and discontinue the Business. Tell Liz.
                    that I have some idea of paying her a Visit about the first of the new year,
                    &amp; that if she will make her <hi rend="underline">arrangements</hi> to
                    that time, that I will carry with me some Catnip, &amp; that you &amp; I
                    will put her <orig reg="through">thro</orig> all the phases of Lucy &amp;
                    the Catnip.</p>

                <p>I know of no one whose services as nurse could be had, except your Aunt Ginnie
                    Martin -- she is a fine woman &amp; an excellent nurse, but I do not know
                    whether she could be induced to go so far from home. Sarah is quite smart, but
                    is slightly afflicted with the same epidemic under which <unclear>Liz.</unclear>
                    is labouring.</p>

                <p>No news of interest. Times are <orig reg="dull">Dul</orig> &amp; weather
                    cold. There is considerable War Spirit in this country. We are seeing in the
                    Harpers Ferry affair, the legitimate consequences of the <abbr expan="John">Jno</abbr>
                    <orig reg="Letcher's">Letchers</orig> election -- that result justified Old
                    Brown &amp; friends in believing that a Majority of Virginians were ready to
                    join them. The Democracy are responsible for it, &amp; should be held so,
                    for all this slavery agitation they have kept it alive for years. Elect Millard
                    Fillmore President, &amp; I would guarantee that before the expiration of
                    his term all would be quiet. I would like to see Wise, Seward, Douglass and a
                    few others Hanged as high as was <abbr expan="John">Jno</abbr> Brown.</p>
