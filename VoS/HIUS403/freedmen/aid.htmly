The South suffered severe economic damage, and a collapse of the 
slave-based labor sytsem during the Civil War and Reconstruction. This 
tumultuous time 
was characterized by economic difficulties in both white and black 
communities. Many of 
the South's resouces were expended or destroyed during the war years 
leaving the entire South, including the Shenandoah Valley in a dire economic 
condition. As a result, there were many requests for aid for very basic 
items, including food, clothing, and shelter.
<P>
Just as in every other function of the Bureau, funding was very limited for 
aid. Jackson expressed a 
desire to grant aid for many destitute individuals, however, he was 
overruled by Captain John A. McDonnell of the Bureau on a number of 
occasions. There are 
many examples of letters where either Jackson or his supervisor 
McDonnell, who was stationed in Winchester, had to 
limit the amount of aid doled out. Even in desperate circumstances, 
Jackson was very careful with <A HREF="rejection1.html">where to allocate 
his resources.</A> McDonnell, similarly, recognized the scarcity of 
funds, and <A HREF="rejection2.html">rejected aid for individuals who 
seemed to 
desperately need it.</A> These measures were necessary because of the 
<A HREF="aid3.html">small quantity of aid available to Jackson</A> and 
other Bureau agents.
<P>
Just as in the construction of schools, one method for the Bureau to fund 
efforts to relieve the suffering of the destitute was to use the funds of 
northern aid societies. These societies donated a wide variety of goods, 
including clothing and food. <P>
One aspect of the Bureau that held back its success was the high level 
of <A HREF="bureaucracy.html">bureaucracy.</A> Even when funds existed, often 
<A 
HREF="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~ela/freedmen/incompetence1.html">
miscommunication or 
mistakes </A>led to it not being appropriated. This was a 
result of mishandling which on Jackson's part can be partially attributed 
to the huge task he was charged to carry out, and also to the <A 
HREF="incompetence2.html">paperwork and bureaucracy </A>which he had to work 
through. He was perpetually reminded by McDonnell that he had to 
fill out more forms or make his forms more accurate. The strict attention 
to procedure demanded much of jackson's time; time which he could have 
devoted to the freedmen and destituite whites.<P>

Despite the many difficulties the Bureau encountered it still actively 
tried to make aid available for both <A HREF="aid6.html"> whites</A> and 
freedmen. There are records of <A HREF="aid4.html">clothing, rations, and 
other aid being 
distributed </A>by the Staunton Bureau. These goods came from both  northern 
aid societies and <A HREF="aid5.html">Bureau 
funds.</A>

Jackson attempted to help the Freedmen with what limited resources he was 
allowed to use, and he did have some positive effect. Destitute freedmen 
and whites were fed and clothed by the Bureau. It clearly made a real 
contribution to the lives of these individuals. Yet, the Bureau could 
have truly been revolutionary as a welfare agency by lifting these 
individuals out of their desperate condition rather than just aid them 
occasionally when funds were available, had it been given a larger budget 
and more attention by both legislators in Washington and the local community.
