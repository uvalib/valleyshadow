I respectfully acknowledge receipt of your communication (personal) under 
date Ap 22/67 by requesting me to "report the time from which his (Mr 
Tukey's) sevices commenced im<U>mediatel</U>y" and  "if a continuances of 
his service are necessary (that I) you will make application to this 
(your) office to" Mr. Tukey has performed no services in connecton with 
the Bureau business of this office since my arrival here and is now 
absent from Staunton, as several times during this month, on private 
buisines.  If the permission to employ extends to "o<U>ne month only</U> 
I see an objection reporting him as clerk although the business of this 
office is much in arrear as regards the claim of Freedmen and with the 
additional duites of Registrar accepted by me, I shall hardly be able 
alone to satisfy myself.  So far I cannot find in either Magisteral Dist, 
if Stuanton a qualified for Registring officer who can talk the present 
adn my present intention is to recommend Mr Tukey as a proper person for 
the position.
