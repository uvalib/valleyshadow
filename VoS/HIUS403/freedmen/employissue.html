The Freedmen's Bureau in Staunton was involved both in the <A 
HREF="laborplace.html">placement of 
laborers</A> and in the termination of labor relationships.  White employers 
wrote to the Bureau seeking farmhands, cooks, nannies, and other 
laborers.  They also wrote to the Bureau <A 
HREF="dismisslabor.html">seeking advice in dismissing laborers,</A> and 
displayed some anxiety as to handle the termination 
of the freedmen.<BR>
<P>
White employers also wrote to the Bureau to dispute 
the 
claims of the freedmen they had employed, demonstrating the difficulty 
the Bureau had in ensuring that freedmen were entering into clearly 
contracted labor situations.  The arguments that arise in the letters 
sent to the Bureau indicate that too frequently, the Bureau only became 
involved in <A HREF="disputes.html">employment disputes</A> after a contract 
had been negotiated and its terms came into contention.<BR>
<P>
Another issue that seems to have occupied the Bureau's attention is 
pressure placed upon the freedmen by their employers to<A 
HREF="contracts/ltr_II105.html"> vote 
for candidates approved by the white population,</A> demonstrating another 
pressure placed upon the freedmen as they struggled to assert themselves 
as free citizens without dangerously alienating the white population that 
still controlled so much of their lives.<BR>
