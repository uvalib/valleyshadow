<TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH="65%">
We selected articles from three newspapers located in Staunton: the 
Staunton <I>Spectator</I>, the <I>Valley Virginian</I>, and the Staunton 
<I>Vindicator</I>. Although we have presented hundreds of newspaper 
articles about attitudes towards blacks and the Freedmen's Bureau, in 
none of these papers did news of the freedmen dominate, or even play a 
major role.
<P>
Each paper took a different tack on the issues regarding the freedmen. 
The <I>Valley Virginian</I> was clearly the most accepting of the 
Freedmen, repeatedly publishing articles urging the white 
population to accept 
the new situation, and to cooperate with the freedmen. One possible reason 
for this attitude is that this newspaper only started in 1865, and 
perhaps this is why it does not demonstrate the racism attitudes that were 
endemic 
in the other two papers.  The editor of the <I>Valley Virginian</I> issued 
a statement which was published in the Staunton <I>Spectator</I> on 
February 5, 1865.  In it he wrote, "Having no regrets or apologies for our 
past course, we can only promise in the future to do our duty, and we 
hope by energy and devotion to business, to merit the generous patronage 
already bestowed on our paper."
<P>
The Staunton <I>Spectator</I> seemed to be the largest and most 
established paper. it took a middle of the road approach: including 
clearly racist material, but not going as far as the <I>Vindicator</I>, 
whose racism is very apparent.</TD> </TR> </TABLE>
