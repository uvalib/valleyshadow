	This website was built by four students at the

	Our goal was to discover how productive the Freedmen's Bureau in 
Staunton, VA was during Reconstruction. We based our research on records 
from the National Archives in Washington DC, two newspapers: the Staunton <I>
Vindicator </I> formerly known as the <I> Spectator </I>, and the 
<I> Valley Virginian </I>, and a variety of secondary resources. Please see our <A 
Href="http://cti.itc.Virginia.edu/~ela/freedmen/bibliography.html"> 
bibliography </a> for a full listing of resources we used.

<P>
<P> 
	One stumbling block we ran into was the lack of records and 
images regarding the Bureau. The individuals and organizations that we 
consulted in Staunton include  the Staunton Historical Society, the 
Staunton Public Library, Mary Baldwin College, and local historical 
experts. These sources had little, if any, information regarding the 
Bureau. We believe this trend is not indicative of the failings of these 
organizations, but rather shows that during Reconstruction the Staunton 
community largely ignored the Bureau. As a result, our information is 
primarily drawn from the Bureau's records, local newspapers, and secondary 
sources.

<P>
<P>

	We hope this website portrays what the Bureau was empowered to 
do, and how it coped with the many problems which it faced.
