We learn that a skirmish occurred between two parties of Freedmen, on the outskirts of town, one night last week. It seems one party were having a dance and the other, jealous of their sport, attempted to break up the "hop." -
<P>
The Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau is energetically investigating the matter and the guilty will be brought to trial.
