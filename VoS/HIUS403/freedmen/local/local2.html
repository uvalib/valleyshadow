PERSONAL.--In our issue of the 5th inst., we took occasion to notice what 
seemed to us an extraordinary exhibition of gallantry on the part of a 
teacher in the "Freedmen's School," in escorting a colored woman down one 
of our principal streets.  The teacher, objecting to our article, handed 
us what he stated to be an explanation, which being of a character to 
provoke further controversy we declined to publish, but deeming it but 
right to give him the benefit of explaining the occurence thro' the same 
channel in which it had been noticed, and notifying him of our views, he 
wrote an explanation which we published, giving him the full benefit 
thereof, without one word of comment on our part.  We thought that we had 
done all that justice and fairness required at our hands, but it seems 
that the Ass't Sup't of the Freedmen's Bureau does not agree with us, and 
has handed us another communication on this subject.<BR>
<p>
We do not deem it incumbent upon us to publish this communication, but, 
since Mr. Tukey has shown a disposition to act with fairness to our 
people and feels called upon to notice this affair, we give it an 
insertion.  But in inserting Mr. Tukey's article we also feel called upon 
to prevent any erroneous impressions it might make.  Our atticle was not 
entitled "Miscegenation in Staunton."  That our article was personal we 
do not deny, for the occurrence in our view justified it and we intended 
it so to be.  We knew of what we wrote, and the fact of the gallantry 
exhibited, as we described it, viz. that the teacher came down on one 
side of the street side by side with the negro woman, pointed the way, 
when she hestitated, and walked across the street with her, and having 
reached the other side, in a very gallant manner have her the inside of 
the pavement, has not been controverted, nor even sought to be 
palliated, and surely the want of a hymn book on the part of the woman is 
not excuse for the scene witnessed by us.  Mr. Tukey seems to think that 
under the circumstances the teacher did nothing improper, and that he 
would have acted precisely as the teacher did.  Of this we need not 
speak, but we will say, that if the two intelligent and influential 
citizens, spoken of, had witnessed teh specimen of gallantry, as we did, 
they would be far from saying that they would have acted as did the 
teacher, and should they ever act thus we promise they that they shall be 
handled with gloves off.<BR>
<P>
As to Mr. Tukey's belief of what the Editor would have done, place in the 
same circumstances, we can only say, that it would require all the 
circumstances attendant on thsi case, an entire uprooting of our 
sentiments and feelings, an utter abnegation of self and self-respect, 
and a total disregard of the feelings and sentiments of the community at 
large, ere we could be quite so gallant.<BR>
<P>
Before this occurrence, we had been led to regard the teacher very 
favorably, from the fact that, in one instance which came to our 
knowledge, he would not permit his pupils to do an act calculated to 
wound the feelings of our people, and from his remarks since are 
charitable enough to give him the benefit of the assertion that he did 
not think that he was doing any thing wrong, (though at the time, after 
signs of disapprobation were shown, he acted in a manner which we 
characterised as "brazen effrontery,") yet that he did act in such a 
manner as to disgust every witness of the affair, and would not be 
sanctioned as proper by the two intelligent gentlemen, or even Mr. Tukey 
himself, had he witnessed it, we do not hesitate to assert.   With this 
brief statement, we publish the communication in another column, not that 
justice requires us to publish it, after giving publicity to Mr. Scott's 
explanation without cmment, but from the fact that Mr. Tukey has been 
actuated by a spirit of fairness to our people and desires its insertion.
