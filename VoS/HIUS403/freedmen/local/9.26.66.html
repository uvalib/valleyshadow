The Colored Church.--The Colored Church, at the old Market House, was sold 
by the Committee last week to the Presbyterians for $2,000, an advance of 
$800 on what they gave for it. The colored people have purchased a 
beautiful lot near the Academy, known as the Sealy lot, and intend 
erecting a fine church on it.--They have the best wishes of the community 
in their interests.
