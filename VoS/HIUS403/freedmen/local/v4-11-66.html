Mr. John Scott, of Waterbury, Conn., to whom we alluded under the heading of "miscegenation in Staunton," in our last issue, sends us a communication in which he makes his explanation of his conduct Sunday week.  
<P>
We give him the benefit of his explanation.  He can't see how any one could possibly "deny so plain a fact."
<P>
He says:-
<BR>
"under the above title appeared an article in the "Virginian," in which, from a want of knowledge of facts, probably, the writer was <I>extremely sever</I> in his denouncement of the conduct, of one whom he called a 'Disciple of Miscegenation,' &ampc. The

 facts were these ; which we give, hoping to correct a false impression.
<P>
"At the close of Sabbath School, a pupil, wishing to obtain a hymn book, was told, that those for sale were at our house.  Being determined to obtain one, she watched us start and came down the walk at the same time.
<P>
We thought of asking her to walk behind, lest we might be misrepresented.  But the thought that she was, as we supposed, known to be a pupil, and that we were going nowhere else than from School home, and that it was known that our business brings <I>us</

I> necessarily into contact with these people, more than it does citizens, would, we thought, save us from being misunderstood in our motives.
<P>
As to "Miscegenation in Stuanton" we will not deny <I>so plain a fact</I>; but <I>do most emphatically deny</I> being a "Disciple" ourselves, as no man can be more opposed to the doctrine than we are, and have ever been."
