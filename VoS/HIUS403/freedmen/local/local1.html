". . . With the exception, therefore with the change made in the civil 
status of the slave, who, henceforth, is entitled to occupy the position 
of the free negro and the mulatto, and must, henceforth, be treated, both 
civilly and criminally as such, your jurisdiction of enquiry and 
presentment remains the same as before the war. 
<P>
"By reference to the code 
under the head of the slaves, free negroes and mulattos you will see that 
divers offences as well by bond as free, based uponthat relation, such as 
the unlawful assembly of slaves, trading with them by the whites, 
the extending to them of undue privileges or liberties by the master, 
owner, or overseer, stealing of them, the mode of trial awarded to them 
for felonies, various offences committed by them to which different trial 
&c., punishments are assigned, to those awarded to the white man and free 
negro for the same offence, are virtually repealed or rendered 
inoperative by their emancipation, indeed some of them are expresesly 
repealed by the Legislature of the restored government at Wheeling and 
Alexandria.
<P>
"When we consider that sudden, compulsory emancipation, however 
inconvenient and unjust to us, was not brought about by the slaves 
themselves, but was thrust upon them, as passive recipients of the boon, 
without their asking., by the interposition of others--an interposition 
if not uninvited, justified or excused by our own conduct in inaugurating 
the war, was at least palliates, and when we remember their loyalty, 
fidelity and exemplary obedience during a bloody struggle of four years 
in our and their midst, in their behoof, it seems to me we owe them a 
debt of gratitude to be repaid to them in kindness, generosity and 
humaninty to the utmost extent of our ability and and its compatibility 
with our peace and safety. 
<P>
"For myself I feel no resentment against them 
on account of their emancipation (and I but echo the general if not 
universal sentiment in Virginia,) a boon, whether imaginary or real, 
which when tendered it is not in human nature to reject, but the rather 
reconcile myself, now that the irrevocable deed is done, to the 
situation, by the consolitory hypothesis, that it was the work of an 
all-wise, mysterious and inscrutable providence; of that God who can make 
the wrath of man to praise him and restrains the remainder of wrath; and 
to whom it may have seemed good to make the rashness and morbid 
sensitiveness of the peculiar and superservicable friends of slavery, the 
means and the instrumentalities of its destruction; seeing that we went 
to war for the merest abstraction, the right to carry slavery into the 
territories, we had not and never might acquire, and we have lost slavery 
in the States, where but for the war it might have remained indefinitely 
or until gradually abolished. 
<P>
"May we not hope that its abolition, in the 
manner in which it has been effected, was designed by providence will 
prove a future blessing in the disguise of a present evil, the timely 
removal or eradication of a political and social evil before, by the 
multitude of slaces, it should become irremovable or ineradicable, 
without the destruction of one or otherm or of both races. But be the 
design of providence in its permission or accomplishment what it mayu, 
whether of mercy to the slave and chastisement to the master, or of 
eventual an unexpected mercy to both; whatever the motive of the human 
agents employed to accomplish it, of one thing there is no doubt, the 
deed is done and it is irrevocable. Therefore interest, duty and 
necessity all concur in counselling on our part calm submission and 
cheerful acquiescence in the fiat that has made our former slaves 
freemen. 
<P>
We must discharge our duties to them not only in a spirit of 
justice and humanity, but of liberality and generosity, and leave to the 
future the solution of the prpoblem, (involved in so much perplexity,) of 
their future destiny and of our own, so far as it may be dependent on or 
effected by theirs. . ."
