A number of the respectable colored people of Staunton, publish a card of thanks in to-day's Virginian.  The also warn us against certain persons going about under false colors.  
<P>
We take pleasure in publishing this card, as the characters of those who sign it are well know to our people, and we are glad to see the proper spirit manifested. 
<P>
With such feeling on the part of the colored people, and kindness and consideration on part of the whites, we can never have any trouble.

</I><BR>
A Card of Thanks from the Colored People.
<P>
Sir:- The members of the colored M.E. Church, through the columns of the Virginia, would take occasion to thank the white citizens, of Stuanton, for their valuable aid at the Fair recently held by them.
<P>
We would take occasion to inform the citizens of Stuanton, that we have in our midst, one Emily Rodney, of Pennsylvania, of the Bethel Church, soliciting subscriptions under a false misrepresentation of facts, and would say that if the white citizens fee
l disposed to further aid us in paying for our Church, they will please be careful who they pay money to, as we have been informed of several gentlemen have contributed, thinking it was for the benefit of the M.E. Church, Colored, when it was intended for


 the Bethel Church.
<P>
They regret to learn that an impression seems to exist among the citizens, that the colored people wish to "draw out from among the whites," and in church and business matters, become independent of them; thus acknowledging little obligation to them. 
<P>
We are sorry to hear that this doctrine is taught by some of our color form the North, who are endeavoring to form a sect, new to us, here, but so far as <I>that</I> is concerned we have no sympathy with them.
<P>
We do not desire this foolish independence, but are very thankful for sympathy and aid from the whites, and respectfully acknowledge our obligations.
<P>
Rev. E. Lawson, Pastor; James Scott, Local Preacher; Phillip Rosshell, Exhorter; Henry Davenport, Aaron Shoveler. Frances Overton, Phillip Ransome, Oscar Morris, Adison King, F. Parris, Thos. Campbell, William Denny, James Carter, John Harris, John Napper


, Nelson Shelton, and David Devenport.
<P>
To MAJOR A. M. Garber, JR.
