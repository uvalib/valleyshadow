The Mulatto Convention--The "Mulattoes" are the favorite terms used to 
designate the despicable set of rascals, known as "Southern Loyalists." 
we object to the term. It is an insult to respectable colored people, and 
does not convey a proper idea of the lowest depths reached by this sort 
of people. "Southern Yankees," are the only two words that do.
