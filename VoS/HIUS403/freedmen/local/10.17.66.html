The Negro--"The negro is not to be neglected," justly and sensibly 
remarks the Nashville <I>Christian Advocate</I>, because he is no longer 
our slave. He must be enlightened, not left in ignorance--drawn to us, 
not driven from us--treated kindly, not coldly--as if <I>he</I> were to 
blame for all the evils which have come upon our land--he must be 
encouraged to labour, and that, too, in the cultivation of the soil, not 
trusting to a precarious and perhaps dishonest support, in towns and 
villages. Let him see that his old master is still his best friend; and 
that the Churches which have done so much for him will do still more, by 
the blessing of God, if he will not refuse their aid."
