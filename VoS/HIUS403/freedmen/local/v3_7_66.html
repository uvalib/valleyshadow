John Briggs, one of the most
respectable colored men of Staunton, was
robbed last week by a negro, of specie, 
&ampc. John took the case and the robber,
before Mr. Tukey and was satisfied with 
the result.  In this connection we are pleased
to notice that Mr. Tukey is doing every thing
in his power to regulate the Freedmen,
and his decisions give general satisfaction.
In this good work he should have the
assistance of all good citizens.
