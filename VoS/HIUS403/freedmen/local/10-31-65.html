There is no problem more difficult than the future of the "freedmen." 
half a million of ignorant and helpless people, have been turned loose in 
Virginia, with no capital to begin business, no skill in mechanic arts, 
and no means of providing for themselves and families. . .<P>
No observing man can have failed to notice the traces of care nd anxiety 
on the faces f the once happy negro. We no longer hear th "loud laugh 
that speak the vacant mind." A moody and anxious expression marks their 
countenances. It is not surprising it should be so, for a  gloomy time is 
before them in the coming winter.
<P>
The fate of the poor negro is a hard one. Their professed frends in the 
North have cut loose the ties which bound them to their masters and 
secured for them comfortable homes and ample provision for all their 
wants in sickness and in health. . . <P>
The negro now seems now destined to be crushed between the upper and the 
nether millstone. The South does not want him, and the Northw ill not 
have him. What is the poor darkey to do? He must live in some way. He 
will not willingly starve. If he cannot get work, he mut steal.
<P>
This brings before us the question: "What is the policy and duty of the 
South in regard to him?"
<P>
We are inclined to think that if the legislature will pass a system of 
wise laws to fulfill the system of labor contracts, similar in its 
general features to the regulations prescribed for the freedmen of 
Tennessee, it will be best for Southern people to employ negroes. they 
are among us--they are accustomed to the cultivation of our staples--they 
suit our climate--and they delight in corn bread and bacon, the peculiar 
diet of Virginia. When the intoxication of freedom passes, and the 
pressure of want come, they can be made to work. . . <P>
We pray pur people not to take counsel from their prejudices, but to 
consider this suggestion calmly and carefully. . .
