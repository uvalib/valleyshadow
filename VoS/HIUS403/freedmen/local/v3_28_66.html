The Charlottesville Chronicle says: "The
strict impertinent thing of the session is the late
resolution of the Conservative Senator 
Steward, of Nevada, for universal suffrage
and universal amnesty as a compromise.--
We may save our necks and get into 
Congress by universal negro suffrage;
this from a Conservative Republican.
We suppose the Radical ground is, suffrage to
the negroes in the South, and to nobody
else. --
Senator Steward offers this as an olive-
branch to the South, for the consideration of 
each State.
<P>
This reminds us of two negroes who got
into a fight, and the big one beat the
little one almost to death, who
hallooed "nuff."  They got upon their feet, when
Ceasar seuzed Pompey (the little nigger)
firmly by the collar, and addressed him
thus: "Now, Pomp, I don't want any bad
feelings atixt us, and I pose to comp'mise
--just take orf your shirt, old fellar, and
I'll hit you, Pomp, 150 lashes--and then
you can put on your shsirt again and go
about your business--and no questions axed
--I offer you, Pomp, <I>a universle amnesty</I>."
