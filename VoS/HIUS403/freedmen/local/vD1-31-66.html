Mr. W. J. Dewes assumes all the responsibility for getting up the mysterious petition that has been circulating in this County, for the supposed purpose of bringing the troops back here.
<P>
Mr. Tukey had nothing to do with it.
<P>
He (Dewes) declined to show us the petition but promised that it should be forthcoming in a few days, as soon as he could see other Union men.  
<P>
Now, we protest against the secret circulation of any petition in which all are equally interested, but we forbear comment until the petition is produced, and then we will have a word to say.
