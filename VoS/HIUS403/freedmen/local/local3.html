STAUNTON, VA., April 18th, 1866.<BR>

W. H. H. LYNN, Esq.,<BR>
Editor of the Staunton Vindicator;<BR>
<P>
Dear Sir:--Having seen in your issue of 5th inst., an article headed 
"Miscegenation in Staunton," and thinking that it contained a greater 
degree of personality and unfairness towards the gentleman spoken of, 
than was called for by the circumstances, I waited until a second issue 
to see if upon sober thought justice would not be done; finding it was 
not done, I have thought it proper to say, on behalf of the family, that 
while we all expect to hold ourselves subject to the criticisms of the 
community in which we live, and are willing to be governed by the 
ordinary usages of its society, yet we claim, and not only claim, but 
think we have a right to demand, when such criticisms are to be made, 
first, that the party making them shall have full knowledge of the facts 
as to which he speaks; second, that they shall be stated in a fair and 
impartial manner and that they be divested of that personality of tone 
and manner, which, in polite society, is always regarded as inconsistent 
with the dignity and character of a gentleman.<BR>
<P>
In reference to the particular case under consideration--that of a 
teacher of the Freedmens' Schools, I have only to say, that after hearing 
his explanation of the circumstances, I am of opinion that I should have 
done precisely as he did;--a sentiment which, I think, would be concurred 
in by a large number of the intelligent, reflecting portion of the 
community; in fact, I have been informed by two intelligent and 
influential citizens, that they had no doubt they would have acted in a 
similar manner; one of them, who holds a high official position informs 
me that he has done so, many times during the past six months; indeed, so 
far from being an event of unusual occurrence, or calling extraordinary 
comment from the Editor, I am constrained to the belief that had the 
Editor himself been placed in the same circumstances, he would have done 
precisely as the Teacher did; that is allow a colored woman who called on 
him on business, to walk with him to his office.<BR>
<P>
Preferring to have my conduct speak for itself, rather than to have it a 
subject for defence in the public press, I am led to thse remarks, not 
from any desire to evoke a controversy, or from a spirit of captious 
criticism, but simply from that sense of justice and fairness, which I 
conceive to be essential at this time in promoting sentiments of 
forbearance and moderation, so desirable to all parties.<BR>
<P>
Very Respectfully, &c.,<BR>
<P>
