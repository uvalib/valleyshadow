We have the statement from an unquestionable source, that at one of the 
precincts in Amherst couty, on election day, a negro after voting, said 
to the officer in charge that he wanted his "forty acres of land and a 
mule."  An explanation being asked for, he stated that he had been told 
that every negro who voted was to have forty acres of land and amule 
given him, immediately after voting, and he wanted his then and there.  
The disappointment, disgust and indignation of the deluded darkey were 
intense, when told that he had been fooled, and that neither land nor 
mule were there for him.  The old negro further said that numbers of 
others on the ground had also been told the same that he was, and had 
come to the election with the same bright anticipations of the riches 
that were to be theirs.
