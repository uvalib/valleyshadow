On Friday evening last, two colored persons, a man and a woman, got out 
of the stage at the American Hotel, and, presuming upon social equality, 
went into the sitting room of the Hotel and seated themselves upon one of 
the sofas, whilst another was occupied by white ladies who had just 
arrived. As soon as the Proprietor discovered the unwarrantable liberty 
taken by this "gemmen ob color," he showed him in a <I>striking</I> and 
<I>forcible</I> manner that he had wholly mistaken his social status. The 
negro sought redress by reporting the case to the Provost marshall, who, 
after hearing the facts, told the negro that he had received the kind of 
treatment he deserved, but not to the degree to which his improper 
conduct justly entitled him. We suppose the negro doubts whether "de 
bottom rail be on de top now."
