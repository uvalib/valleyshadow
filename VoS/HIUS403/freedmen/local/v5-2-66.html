We understand a terrible riot occurred at Fahmouth, Stafford county, on the 29th ult., between the negroes and whites, in which fifteen negroes were killed outright and a large number wounded.
<P>
One white man is reported morally wounded and others slightly.
<P>
The affair has created the most intense excitement.
<P>
Owing to the lateness of the hour, we are unable to ascertain, before going to press, the cause which led to the disturbance-but presume it the working of the "Civil Rights Bill."
<P>
We warn our people to be prepared for each and every emergency.
<P>
The negroes lured on to their own destruction, by the low, mean and cowardly white wretches we have among us; will in all probability seek supremacy in our midst.
