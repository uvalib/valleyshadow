"This meeting, deeply impressed with the importance of a speedy

the blessings of peace and prosperity; and heartily approving of the 
Convention proposed to be held in the city of Richmond on 1st of Aug., to 
take into consideration the important subject of reconstructing the State

parties and without distinction of color, promptly and in good faith, to 
give their aid to the work of reconstruction, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Military Bills.<BR>

owes allegiance first to that government:  and it is only in reference to 
the reserved powers that his allegiance is due to the State Government.<BR>
<P>

Speeches were made by Mr. Fultz, Henry Davenport (colored) E. L. Houff, 
Phillip Roselle (colored,) and Mr. Jackson, Agent of the Freedmen's

conservative in their tone, and those of the colored speakers very 
amusing, bringing down the house repeatedly with the happy points made.<BR>
