We learn from a member of the Freedman's Court, that, by late orders 
received, the Court is suspended until further orders, and no new cases 
will be tried by the Courts.  The cases now being investigated will be 
continued until completed.  As far as Messrs. Tukey & Risk, members of 
the courts, are concerned, we are pleased to state that they have 
discharged the duties imposed on them to the satisfaction of all parties.
