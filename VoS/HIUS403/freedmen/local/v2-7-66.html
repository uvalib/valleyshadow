We understand that a number of persons in this county, summoned to appear at the Freedman's court have refused to appear.  If this is so they do a great wrong to our people in town, for if they do not appear it gives an excuse for sending troops hers.  
<P>
Let every man summonded appear and give no excuse, to the little squad of "so-called" union men in this county, to inflict troops upon us.
