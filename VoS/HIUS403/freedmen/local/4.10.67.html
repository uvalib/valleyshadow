Population of Augusta and Voters.--The census of 1860 gives the whole 
population of Augusta at 27,764. Whites, 22,212; negroes, 5,552. Taking 
one-fifth of the number of whites as voters, this gives 4,442 white 
voters, from which deduct about 100 for disfranchised. Averaging the 
negro vote at the same it gives 1,110 negro votes--making a total of 
5,452 voters, or say 5,000, which gives the whites 8,000 clear majority; 
allowing that the negroes will vote against us in a solid body, which we 
do not expect. Since the census another has been taken by the freedmen's 
Bureau, which gives the negro population of the county at 4,700, a 
decrease of 853. These facts should impress upon the colored people the 
utter folly of going against their best friends--the majority of our 
people--and being led astray by designing white men. While it is sacredly 
our duty to protect them in all their rights, it is none the less theirs 
to co-operate with us in our efforts to save the State from ruin. Proper 
efforts on the part of our intelligent white and colored people, will 
make everything work towards one great end--the welfare and prosperity of 
all classes.
