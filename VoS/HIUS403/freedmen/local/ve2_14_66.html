Mr. Tukey, the 
Assistant Superintendent of the Freedman's
Bureau in this place, ahs been to 
Richmond and did not demand
troops to be sent here, but only asked enough
to enforce a summons if necessary. Now our
people might as well look facts into the
face and obey the summons of the Freedman's
Court.  It is folly to commence fighting after
the war is over,a nd we are ahppy to state that the 
cordial co-operation of the civil authorities with 
Mr. Tukey makes it certain that no troops
will be brought here.  If any one refuses to recognise
a summons from teh Freedmen's court, the
civil authorities will make the arrest.
