Sunday morning, our citizens were shocked and disgusted, by an exhibition on John Scott, from Waterbury, Conn., a teacher in the Freedmen's School, made of himself, by escorting negro girl down New Street.  
<P>
On Coming down the street white persons "hissed" this creature, Scott; soon afterwards, the girl came back by herself, and the coloured people, collected on Crawford's corner, "hissed" her.  
<P>
She had evidently disgraced in their eyes, by associating with this fellow, and we agree with them.  
<P>
We saw a notice, the other day of the arrest of an officer for the same offence, in Petersburg, and we call attention those in authority to the disgraceful conduct of this man Scott. -
<P>
The Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau owes it to himself: to the ladies who teach in the School, as well as to this community, to discharge this dsciple fo Miscegenation at once.
<P>
If he wants to marry the negro, let him do so, if she is willing; and speedily emigrate to Liberia or some other congenial clinic, where, to his heart's content, he can dwell in the sweet embrace fo the <I>"negro del' Afrique</I>."
<P>
He don't suit this country.
