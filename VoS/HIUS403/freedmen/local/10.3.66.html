A Good idea.--It has been suggested that one or more reliable colored men 
be selected and put under the control of the Chief of police, with 
authority to keep "watch and ward" over the negro population. This plan 
has been adopted in Columbus, Mississippi, and other Southern cities, and 
works well. There are colored men in Staunton who would and could attend 
to such duty efficiently, and we have no doubt but that much of the 
annoyance and trouble now complained of would soon be stopped by this plan.
