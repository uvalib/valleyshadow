At our quarterly county court, a white man and several freedmen, convicted 
for the most part of larceny, were sentenced by the court to be punished 
with stripes.<BR>
<P>
We understand that Captain Tidball, the Provost Marshal and Bureau Agent, 
here, protested against theis punishment as barbarous, and stated that he 
had forwarded a report of the circumstances (so far as the negroes are 
concerned) to his superior officer.  He also stated in his report that at 
the same time a white man was sentenced to similar punishment.<BR>
<P>
We suppose from this that it is proposed to prescribe a code of criminal 
law to the Southern States.  If Massachusetts abolishes capital 
punishement and a negro man is hung in Virginia, the agent of the 
Freedmen's Bureau will at once communicate the fact to General Howard.  
If Massachusetts fixes three months imprisonment as the punishment for 
rape, Virginia is, on grounds of humanity, to do the same thing.  When 
they decide in New England that "taking is no stealing," Virginia must 
trim her sails in conformity.<BR>
<P>
"Barbarous!"  Who made Massachusetts a judge of "barbarity?"<BR>
<P>
Here they have given us a Civil Rights bill of the most outrageous 
character compelling us to mete out the same punishment to the black man 
that we do to the white--and now when we do it, we are met by the cry of 
"barbarity"--twenty or thirty stripes administered to a thief 
"barbarity!"<BR>
<P>
If the punishment was hanging, drawing, and quartering, it is no concern 
of Captain Tidball's, or any man not a resident of Virginia--and it is no 
concern of his except to remonstrate with the Legislature of 
<I>Virginia</I>.<BR>
<P>
Where is this devilish persecution to stop?<BR>
<P>
We hope that the sentence of the court will be promptly executed.  It is 
a matter with which Captain Tidball has nothing to do by any law, human 
or divine, or congressional.--<I>Charlottesville Chronicle</I><BR>
