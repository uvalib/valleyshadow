When the war ended, the newly emancipated slaves clamored for education. 
Not only children, but middle aged and elderly blacks filled schoolhouses, 
and, when schoolhouses did not exist, they took their lessons in fields to 
learn from a teacher who 
often was barely literate, but the most well educated person available. 
Under slavery their opportunities to improve their minds were limited and 
often barred by law. As soon as they were freed, however, blacks quickly 
attempted to set up schools with whatever resources available.

The Freedmen's Bureau was very helpful in establishing these schools. 
Although in most areas the Bureau was hesitant to offer monetary aid, 
it did show a willingness in regard to schools. There are many examples 
of <A HREF="school5.html">schools being funded by the Bureau.</A> It 
participated in 
the construction, furnishing, <A HREF="school1.html">upkeep </A>of schools 
and also the purchase of 
schoolbooks. Regarding education, the Bureau seemed to have more latitude 
and funds available than in other areas.

<P>Northern aid societies played an active role as well, and the Bureau 
facilitated their involvement by corresponding with them and acting as 
the intermediary for the freedmen. These societies include the American 
Tract Society and the Freedman's Union Commission. One role they served was finding teachers who were 
adequately trained. They sent recommendations to the Bureau 
which in turn <A HREF="school4.html">consulted with the freedmen</A> about 
who to hire. <A HREF="school2.html">These 
teachers were then "furnished" by the aid societies.</A>

In addition to the logistical support of the aid societies, these 
charitable organizations 
contributed funds and schoolbooks, such as the one pictured to the left. 
The aid societies, 
regarded by local whites as "meddlesome," were very active in 
establishing and funding schools. There 
are numerous correspondences between the various aid societies and Jackson. There was even some discussion of establishing a <A 
HREF="national/1.9.67.html">"Freedmen's 
College" </A>with northern funds. 

The Bureau was active in Augusta County 
setting up schools, and 
<A HREF="school3.html">dedicating them.</A> They tried to insure that 
<A HREF="waynesboroletter3.html">schooling was available</A> to all of the 
free blacks. The Bureau's success was not unilateral, and it still ran 
into problems such as 
opposition from whites, and a lack of funding. Although not without its problems, the 
Bureau, in conjunction with the freedmen and northern aid societies, did 
establish several schools for freedmen.
