<I>Newspapers display the feelings of a period in a broader way than any 
single letter or collection of letters can. This archive of articles 
from Staunton newspapers reflect local, state and national feelings 
regarding the freedmen and the Freedmen's Bureau. The number of articles 
each year reflects the interest or apathy of the Staunton community. Many 
articles appeared in the early years of the Bureau when the local 
populace was outraged that it was being forced upon them. The newspapers 
reflect the interest of local whites in the changing laws and Bureau 
activity governing blacks' and whites' 
behavior towards them throughout the life of the Bureau. </I> </CENTER> <HR>
