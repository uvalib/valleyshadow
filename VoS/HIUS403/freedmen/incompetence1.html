Sir,
<BR>
In your reporting Bureau affairs for April you state "I regret to find 
myself without food or clothing to ration."
<P>

On the second of March last, Mr. Tukey, your predecessor, reported to 
this office, that he had received two (2) boxes of clothing for 
gratuitous distribution. Since that time, no application for clothing has 
been made from your sub-district at this office.
<P>

No Estimate of Rations required to prevent destitution has been received 
from your sub-district since the month of February, as required by 
circular 32. ---
<P>

You will at once send to this office the Estimate of Rations required by 
said circular for the present month, and a List of clothing necessary to 
prevent suffering.
<P>

Very Respectfully
<BR>


Your Srvt.
<BR>
