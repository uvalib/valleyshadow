Sir.I have just Rec..d your letter this evening and hasten to reply. At 
the time ____ to Gen Schofield I did not know that you were established at 
Staunton or I should have written to you instead. I have no complaint to 
make of an official, either Military or Judicial as I believe they are 
all prompt executing the law when called upon. That which I complain of 
as being <U>intolorable</U> is horse stealing and the trouble is to get 
officials on the task in time and not in any want of on their part. In 
some neighborhood in Augusta County the citizens are forming themselves 
into rigilances committees for their own protection against this 
nuisance, and we were about doing the same, and I had written to the Genl 
as one of the Committee for instructions not wishing to go into an 
arrangement of that kind ____ with the sanction of the Commandment of 
this Dis of horse stealing has highly become intolerable here a short 
time since there were five horses Stolen from this immediate neighborhood 
in one night from different persons that time that would, necessarily 
have been consumed in getting officials would have enabled them to make 
their escape but by pursuing them at once. They were over taken in the 
north mountain and the horses recovered. But for want of arms the theives 
escaped which is to be regreted by every law abiding citizen. Since then 
there have been other horses stolen in the nieghborhood no doubt by the 
same individuals so that no one was safe at any time. It was with a view 
to break up this land of marauders that the letter was written and not 
designing to call in question the promptness of any offical whatever 
(Scratched out writing) Hoping this explanation may be satisfactory.
<P>

Yours
