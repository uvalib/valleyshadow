"...as regards the claims of the freedmen and with the additional duties 
of Registrar accepted by me, I shall hardly be able alone to satisfy myself."

Commissioner John A. McDonnell on April 24, 1867 </H3>

The Bureau was established in March 3, 1865, and was directed by General 
O.O. Howard, who was appointed by President Andrew Johnson. It was staffed 
by approximately 900 agents throughout the South. 
<P>
Each of the ten state under reconstruction was assigned to an  
assistant commissioner. Virginia had three assistant commissioners from 1865
to 1869. Below the assistant commissioner were sub-assistant commissioners. 
Captain John A. McDonnell was the sub-assistant commissioner in charge 
Sub District 9, which included Augusta County.  Capt. McDonnell was 
stationed in Winchester, VA, about 100 miles north of Staunton in the 
Shenandoah 
Valley. 
<P>
The Staunton office, similar to the Freedmen's Bureau nationally, was understaffed. Only one agent was assigned to address the needs of all 
freedmen in Augusta County.  Assistants were only a temporary luxury 
since the Bureau budget had very little money to spare.
<P>
Mr. F. S. Tukey was a civilian appointed as the Superintendent of the 
Freedmen's Bureau of Augusta County from 1865 to 1866, when Captain 
Thomas P. Jackson received his commission for the position. Jackson was 
highly regarded for his abilities, and commended for the two years 
experience he had in addressing the problems of the freedmen before 
his appointment. Colonel O. Brown, the Virginia Assistant Commissioner 
in 1866, wrote a letter of recommended Jackson for the position, describing him as "a gentleman of high Christian and moral character, of superior intellectual 
attributes and of industrious habits. His devotion and faithfulness to 
the interests of the freedmen deserve some recognition."
It evident that Jackson was a agent honestly devoted to helping 
African-Americans succeed as freedmen, however his efforts were 
hampered by the many obstacles he encountered.

The demands on the Freedmen's Bureau were enormous and almost 
impossible to meet by one lone agent.  In addition to his duties 
as the Freedmen's Bureau agent, Jackson was in charge of the 
registering voters in the middle of 1867.  At that time, Jackson
 was fortunate enough to be <A HREF="perm.html">granted permission 
to hire Mr. Tukey</A>, his predecessor for one month to assist him. 
However, Jackson was not always so lucky.  In September 1867, Jackson was 
<A HREF="dis.html">ordered to discharge his messenger</A>, Charles 
W. Teagle. 
<P>
Jackson, like many agents, was a soldier and lacked administrative 
skills.  He was constantly behind in his paperwork or having to correct 
mistakes on previous forms and reports.  (<A HREF="paperwork.html">

<A NAME="discharge"></A>
On March 23, 1868, <A HREF="discharge.html">Jackson was discharged</A> from 
his duty as Agent of the Freedmen's Bureau for Augusta County.  Colonel 
John W. Jordan took Jackson's position as Agent in April 1868.  Jordan 
continued to assist the freedmen with the distribution of clothes and other aide.

It is unknown when Jordan was replaced, but Roswell Waldo was the 
Freedmen's Bureau Agent for Augusta County at the time when the Staunton 
Bureau office, along with the national Freedmen's Bureau, was preparing 
to close. Waldo was 
<A HREF="close.html">ordered to sell the property of the Bureau</A> 
at a public auction in a letter from McDonnell dated December 10, 1868.
<P>
The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands and all its local 
offices were closed on January 1, 1869.
