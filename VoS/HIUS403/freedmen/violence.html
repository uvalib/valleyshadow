Although the issues of violence and justice were not originally main 
concerns of the Freedmen's Bureau, the lack of help from local 
authorities in dealing with these two issues forced the Bureau to absorb 
many cases not taken by the courts. Following the end of the war, many southern 
whites resented both their northern occupiers and newly freed blacks. 
This resentment fills 
the newspapers, diaries, and letters of the period. One way southern whites 
expressed their anger and frustration was by attacking both 
northerners and freedmen.  These victims rarely found protection or justice 
from the local civil athorities, which were often dominated by
the same whites who had been the aggravators. With civil outlets closed, the 
local Freedmen's Bueau office appeared as a haven 
for victims. The Bureau received letters from both blacks and whites 
complaining of attacks, mistreatment, and other criminal actions. In 
dealing with these claims, the Bureau's hands were tied and the cases 
never were addressed by the local athorities. As a result, unprosecuted 
assaults, abuse, an thefts remained a common occurance in 
reconstruction Virginia. <P>

<LI><B><A HREF="mainassault.html">Assault and Abuse:</B></A> Although the 
Civil War ended at Appomattox, violence still plauged the occupied South, and 
Augusta County was no exception. The Freedmen's Bureau in Staunton 
received numerous complaints and requests for help concerning assaults 
agianst both black and white residents. In the case of abuse, Freedmen 
Bureau agent Thomas Jackson and the Bureau tried to intervene in all cases 
brought to his attention. His efforts, however, were in vain.

<LI><B><A HREF="maintheft.html">Theft:</B></A> During the Civil War 
the Shennandoah Valley hosted roving armies moving north and south 
between the the Blue Ridge Mountains. This traffic by both 
Conferderate and Federal armies resulted in almost total destruction of 
the land. As the war progressed, stealing increased on both sides with 
horses being a favorite target for horse starved cavelry and artillery 
units.  After the war, law enforcement was inaccessible to many, 
especially blacks, and victims of thefts often turned 
to the Bureau for assistance in recovering lost goods.
