Respectfully returned to <U>Tho. P.Jackson</U> Agent<BR>
The proper course to be pursued in these cases is to have the parties 
brought before a magistrate for examination and committed for trial by 
the county court.<BR>
It will there become the duty of the Com Atty to prosecute, and any 
neglect of duty on his part will be promptly reported to and his removal 
requested by the military commissioner for Augusta Co.
