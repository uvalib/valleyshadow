One of the primary functions of the Bureau was to address the day to day 
problems of the freedmen and destitute whites. These included providing 
clothing, food, and other aid. The Bureau received many applications for 
such aid, but was limited in what it could provide due to its small 
budget. The freedmen also sought the Bureau's aid in establishing 
churches and schools. While the Bureau did not have funds for this 
purpose, it was able to put the freedmen in contact with Northern aid 
societies which appropriated funds for land, buildings, teachers' salaries, 
and basic necessities such as books and furniture. The Bureau received 
more letters from freedmen and destitute whites seeking aid than on any 
other single topic.

After the war, freedmen had few options for religious services, because 
for the most part blacks had been offered no formal religion in the 
South. The Bureau aided in the construction and founding of a number of 
churches in Augusta County. <P>

aid 
societies for the construction and funding of schools for the freedmen.

<A HREF="aid.html">Aid</A>: As in all areas, funding was very limited for 
aid, however the 
Bureau was able at times to provide funding for aid for both destitute 
whites and freedmen in the form of clothing, rations, and other provisions.
