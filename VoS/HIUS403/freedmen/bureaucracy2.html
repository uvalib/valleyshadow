The Bureau was established in March 3, 1865, and was directed by General 
O.O. Howard, who was appointed by President Andrew Johnson. It was staffed 
by approximately 900 agents throughout the South. Each of the ten states
 being reconstructed had an 
assistant commissioner. The assistant commissioner for Virginia was 
General Orlando Brown. 
Below the assistant commissioner were sub-assistant commissioners. 
Captain John A. McDonnell
was the sub-assistant commissioner in charge of Captain 
Thomas P. Jackson's district, 
and was stationed in Winchester, VA, about 100 miles north of Staunton in 
the Shenandoah 
Valley. 
<P>
The commissioner received a salary of $3,000 and was given bonds in the 
sum of $50,000. The
assistant commissioner's salary was $2,500 and he received a bond of 
$20,000. <Peirce, 44-45>
<P>
The Bureau was understaffed nationally, and this nature was reflected in 
Staunton as well. 
Thomas P. Jackson was the only agent in Augusta County for most of the 
Bureau's life. 
His responsibilities included caring for the welfare of the freedmen who 
numbered more than 
<A HREF="local/4.10.67.html">5,000 in 1867</A>, and some destitute 
whites. The accomplishments of its agents were further hampered by its 
highly bureaucratic nature.
<P>
As Reconstruction came to an end in Virginia, so did the Bureau. The 
Bureau in Staunton was ordered to close on December 21, 1868.
