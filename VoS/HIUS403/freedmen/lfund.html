I respectfully renew my application to you under date April 20 by "that I 
may be furnished at as early a day as possible with a suitable horse."
<P>
In addition to the general business of this office the Circuit Court for 
Highland Co. is now sitting, and as much complaint has been made of 
injustice to refugees & Freedmen, whose cause has been tried there. i was 
desirous to attend, but am unable to do so as the horse at this post is 
blind and unsafe even for good roads.
<P>
Your servt.

Jackson had already sent a letter requesting a horse saying that this one 
was not suitable, and mcDonnell ultimately responded to this 
communication, and sent a horse which he deemed as "skittish, but not at 
all dangerous."
