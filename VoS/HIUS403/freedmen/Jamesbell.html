Capt T.P.Jackson
<P>
When I drew that suit out of court between James Bell (a man of color) 
you promised in the pressence of Danil Whetesel that you would remove J. 
Bell if he did not behave himself, he is abusing me my family and little 
children and what is worse suffers his children to do so too, moreover he 
curses you the Bureau myself and every white man now Capt according to 
your promise if you will remove him this week I will not enter suit but 
if not I have instructed my lawyer to enter suit agian Mr Bumgardner will 
wait on you so soon as you get home.<BR>
I want you to attend to it directly for I cant stand it anh longer, his 
garden is no pretext for him to remain there is nothing in it but weeds 
he is to lazy to work it and hence it is worth nothing which any man can 
see if he will look at it.
<P>
Yours very respectfully<BR>
