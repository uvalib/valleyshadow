Assaults which were reported to the Freedmen's Bureau were almost always 
refered to someone else.  Agent Jackson had neither the authority nor 
the support from the local police force to pursue any cases beyond 
written requestes for justice. <A HREF="lfund.html">The lack of funding 
</A> also rendered the Bureau inaffective in its pursuit of justice. 
Resentment in Augusta County was strong toward both freed blacks and northern 
carpetbaggers. Of the 
many letters sent to the Bureau concerning assaults, Agent Jackson 
received a letter from two brothers who had served in the Union army, 
asking for legal assistance after 
<A HREF="attackunion.html">they had been attacked by some local men.</A> 
In the letter, the two brothers ask for advice in how to pursue 
the matter. The two men feel that since they had served the Union 
government, they should receive help from that same government, in the 
form of the Freedmen's Bureau.
<P>
Receiving aid in the prosecution of southern whites who had assaulted either 
blacks or northern whites was difficult.  Agent Jackson made this piont 
painfully clear when he reported to his superior officer in Winchester, 
Captian John A. McDonnell, that 
<A HREF="assultblacks.html">"the prosecuting officer will not willingly 
perform his duty as a public officer"</A> when Jackson asked him to
prosecute any attackers. 
Jackson writes about three cases involving whites firing upon freedmen 
and expresses his concern that no retrobution will be taken.   <P>

Cases of abuse were also reported the Bureau. When complaints of abuse 
were received by the Bureau, Agent Jackson, and later Agent Jordan, 
responded by writing an official letters to the defendents, requesting them 
to explain their actions.  In the case of an unidentified man from 
Waynesboro, 
Virginia, Agent Jordan wrote him after receiving a letter from Algernon 
Haleman, a black youth who was "bound" to him.  In a responce to Jordan, 
this man deninies that he had <A HREF="Childabuse2.html"> abused the black 
youth.</A> In his reply, this unidentified man states his innocence to Jordan,
and says that not only can his neighbors testify to his innocence, but so 
can a "black man living with me for the past twenty years."  There is no 
record of this case ever being brought to trial.
  <P>
Agent Jackson also had to deal with reports of child abuse.  In a letter 
to Joseph Milsted of Augusta County, Jackson states that he received a 
notice from a black man named Peyton Harris complaining 
<A HREF="childabuse.html"> "of bad treatment of his child"</A> by Milsted's 
wife and that Milsted had tried to break an agreement made with Harris. 
Jackson 
sternly reminds Milsted that he has no right to either threaten or break 
contracts with any black 
citizens.  Again, this case was never resolved.

In one case, the Bureau received a letter from a white man named Kline, 
complaing that Jackson had not followed up on a promise to 
remove an abusive black man named James Bell living with his family.  The 
letter 
details that Kline had dropped a court case between Bell and 
himself on the grounds that Jackson would dispose of Bell.  Kline claims 
that Bell was abusing his family and his own children and 
states that Bell <A HREF="Jamesbell.html"> "curses you the Bureau myself 
and every white man."</A>      

<P>
Jackson and the Bureau received numerous letters concerning 
assault, each more different from the next.  Whether a letter 
decribed <A HREF="assult1.html"> a simple assault </A> or 
<A HREF="spousalabuse.html"> a shooting,</A> the complaints were 
difficult to handle.
Some attacks were white on white, white on black, and in one case a 
black woman even attacked another black woman<A HREF="pitchfork.html">
with a pitchfork. </A> In any case, little could be done by the Bureau.  
<P>
Local prosecuters and courts refused to prossess any of the charges, and 
the Bureau was hamstrung by its lack of authority to intervene in local 
legal affairs. Agent Jackson wrote Commonwealth Attorny Bumgarner on 
numerous occasions, asking him to prosecute the many assaults which 
had been reported to him. No mention 
of any of the cases refered to Bumgarner by Jackson could be found in the 
Augusta County court records.  The Bureau could only refer the cases 
elsewhere when they could, namely to other agents in other districts.
