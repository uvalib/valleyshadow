Contracts arrived in the hands of the Bureau for a variety of reasons:  
advice, safe keeping, dispute, and so forth.  Contracts had obviously 
been a rarity before the war, and were now a necessity as the South 
adjusted to a free labor force.  As a result, contracts ranged from the 
simple to the complex, the fair to the unreasonable, and were entered 
into for every imaginable type of labor.<BR>
