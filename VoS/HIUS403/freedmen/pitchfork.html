Staunton.</U>
<P>
My name is Nancy Burns I live in John Edmunds house have been living 
there since the 7th day of March 1868. On Tuesday June 2nd I was washing 
a pan preparing to cook my dinner. Peggy Soyers came in and said dont you 
use my water. I said I have not done so she said you are a liar 
<U>Madam</U>. I told her it was my own water. She then ran out a got a 
iron Pitchfork and coming towards me said I will run you through and 
through you old whoring bitch. I will have your life and if is had not 
been for John Edmunds throwing her down and taking it from her she would 
have done me a deadly injury being over 80 years of age and crippled The 
above is a true statement.
