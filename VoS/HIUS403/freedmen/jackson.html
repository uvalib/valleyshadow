There were only 900 Bureau agents throughout the entire South, and each 
was charged with providing services to large numbers of people--often too 
many people and concerns for them to realistically address. Most of these 
agents were northerners who had served in the Union army during the Civil 
war. many agents were incompetent, or served the interests of the white 
population. Others viewed their positions simply as a way of receiving a 
paycheck. However, there were some in the Bureau who attempted to protect 
and improve the condition of the freedmen. The local white population 
resented the Bureau, and regarded its agents as carpet-baggers.

Captain Thomas P. Jackson was the head of the Freedmen's Bureau in 
Augusta County from 1866 until 1868. He was preceded by Mr. F.S. Tukey, 
who there are no military records for. Jackson was highly regarded for 
his abilities, and recognized for the two years experience he had in 
addressing the problems of the freedmen before his appointment. Colonel 
O. Brown wrote a letter of reference on Jackson's behalf: Jackson is "a 
gentleman of high christian and moral character, of superior intellectual 
attributes and of industrious habits. His devotiona and faithfulness to 
the interests of the freedmen deserve some recognition."

The evidence shows that Jackson was a capable and caring agent, however 
his efforts were hampered by the many obstacles he encountered.
