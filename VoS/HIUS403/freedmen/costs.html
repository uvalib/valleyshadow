One of the largest problems which the Bureau faced was a lack of funding. 
This can be seen in every area of the Bureau's activities. It limited the 
Bureau's ability to provide social services, family services, and 
protection from violence.
<P>
When the Bureau was first established, one of its primary functions was 
to address the issues of the abandoned lands. Thousands of acres were 
confiscated by the Union army, and were subsequently leased to freedmen 
and others. The funds collected were used to finance the projects of the 
Bureau. Shortly after the war ended, virtually all of the confiscated 
lands were returned. This was a severe disappointment to the freedmen who 
had expected to be given the lands, arguing that it was their hard work 
which had improved them. It also took away a great deal of the funding of 
the Bureau, causing there to be tight financial constraints in every issue 
which the Bureau addressed.
<p>
Jackson saw the minimal funding which his office was allocated when he 
was unable to attend meetings because the Bureau did not provide him 
with a suitable horse. He wrote to McDonnell that he <A 
HREF="lfund.html">"may be furnished as early a day as possible with a 
suitable horse."</A> It was things such as this that really hurt 
Jackson's ability to perform his function as a Bureau agent.
<P>
Jackson also faced financial restraints in acquiring other supplies for the 
Bureau 
office. This is evidenced by the fact that the Bureau ceased using 
stationary, and had to limit their use of postage. In fact, all bureau 
supplies had to be <A HREF="cost.html">"used with all economy."</A>
More 
importantly, the 
Bureau was unable to provide adequate aid to the many destitute persons 
who requested it. Jackson was instructed that he had to <A 
HREF="aid3.html">use 
his supplies sparingly</A> due to their small quantity. There are 
numerous examples of letters where Jackson was forced to <A 
HREF="rejection2.html">reject 
requests for aid due to the lack of availability of funds.</A> 
<P>
<A HREF="national/national1.9.html">The funding for the entire Bureau was 
very limited.</A> This was also the case in Staunton. this was perhaps 
the biggest drawback to the organization. It is inevitable that an 
organization established to operate as a welfare agency will fail if it 
is not given proper funding. Jackson was overwhelmed with too many cases, 
too many problems, and not enough funds to successfully operate the Bureau in 
Staunton.
