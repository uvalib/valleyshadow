<P>This team will focus on the transition from war to peace and the role
of the Freedmen's Bureau on the local level in Augusta Co. in that transition.
Augusta Co. included more than 5,000 African-Americans in 1860, almost
20 % of the whole population. Many of these black Augustans lived in slavery,
only 583 blacks were free blacks in Augusta in 1860. Reports from the newspapers
indicate slavery crumbled during the war, as African-Americans ran away
to freedom or were impressed to work for the Confederate government. By
August 1865 the Freedmen's Bureau had placed a subassistant commissioner
in Staunton. The Freedmen's Bureau field offices, such as the one in Staunton,
offer a local view of the struggle over emancipation and Reconstruction.
