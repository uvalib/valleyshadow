Hiam Thompson (cold) who lives near Fishersville in Augusta Co. states 
that a General Long an officer in the rebel army has in his possesion at 
or near Leesburg, Loudon Co. Va. a Bay horse, (black leg, mane + tail, 
nearing 8 years old) which is the property of said Hiam Thompson and was 
stolen from his stable during the war, by a Lieut. Hunter of Rockbridge 
Co. and by him transfered to Genl. Long in exchange for another horse. 
Thompson claims to have information that his horse is not branded and was 
claimed by Genl. Long as his private property when Gen. Lee's army 
surrendered. Thompson attempted to reclaim the horse immediately after it 
was taken from his stable, but while he was seeking evidence required, the 
command to which Lieut. Hunter was attached left Staunton, taking off the 
horse. Thompson has an excellent character and reliable neighbors say 
there will be no difficulty in identifying the horse which was well known 
as a valuable animal of Morgan _____. I am further informed that the 
horse was taken by Lt. Hunter without any authority whatever and has 
never been known as a public animal. I have the honor to request such enquiry
be made as will restore the horse to Hiam Thompson if above fact can be 
proved.
