James Harris (col'd) left his wife Elizabeth and 
child at this place and went to Danville.
He writes to her from that place, Sept 23 / 27,
stating he had found a home and would 
send for her to join him.  Since, Elizabeth
has not heard from him and asks enquiry
be made for him and he either send for send for her 
or return her to take care of her.
He speaks in his letter of his "uncle John's
people" at Danville, which may be a clue 
to his whereabouts
