I respectfully refer to a letter from the office in 347
12/67 Nov 29/67 asking enquiry be made at
Danville Va for James Harris (col'dd) who left his
wife and child at this place for the pur-
pose of procuring work.  No answer having been
received and Elizabeth having fear ordered to have 
the place where she was living, she being within one
or two months of confinement.  She hopes James
be sought and found that he came to her or send
her some means of support.  I enclose the
letter she received from him which may
assist in finding him
