I have the honor to ask instructions on behalf of Daniel Collins (col'd) as to what will be his proper course in relation to his wife Hannah Collins (c) reported by your endorsement Aug 31 on my communication of Aug 28 / 67 as living with George W. Grey at Winchester as his wife.
<P>
Daniel Collins and Hannah Reed (Collins) are Registered in Augusta Co. as husband and wife (No 632) and Daniel states Hannah has certificate.
<P>
Daniel wants of course to be clear from Hannah and I respectfully ask if erasure from Register with statement of facts will be sufficient or if he must apply to the Court for relief and divorce.  His means are limited for the latter.
