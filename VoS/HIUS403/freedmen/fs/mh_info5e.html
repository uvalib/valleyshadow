Dear Sir,<BR>

I have diligently searched the records of my Office to find the order of 
Court, directing the "Overseers of the Poor" to bind Mary Gordon to 
Stewart C Slaven. and can find no such order, I searched the records for 
the past twenty years=Neither do I find any "articles of Indenture" 
between such parties, filed in my Office. I think there must be some 
mistake in regard to her being bound by the Overseers of the Poor of this 
County.
