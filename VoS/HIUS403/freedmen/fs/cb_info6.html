In reference to your com- munication dated 20th ________ concerning Cynis Bannister, I will state that I visited him this morning, read him your letter.  He stated that there had been some difficulty between them which induced him to leave.  Has been absent about three years.

I endeavored to impress upon him the importance of caring for his children. He directed me to say that he intended to return this spring, perhaps about a month hence.
