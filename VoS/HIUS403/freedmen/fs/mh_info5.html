<P>
Respectfully returned to Capt.
R.S. Lacy Agent 7 Sub Dist
Va with the information that
I visted Bath County and 
could find no record in the 
clerks office in regard to
the binding of Mary Gordon 
by the Court to S.C. Slavin
To settle the matter definitely
I obtained the enclosed letter
from the clerk of the 
Court who told me he 
had them in the office this
been years + could see no note
of such a transaction in any
of his books.
<P>
