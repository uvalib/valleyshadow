The involvement of the Freedmen's Bureau in the establishment of 
African-American family structure is rarely discussed as one of the 
Bureau's major activities.  Although the Bureau is though of having been 
ineffective overall, many historians credit the Bureau for having succeeded in the providing freedmen with education and the power of negotiating fair labor contracts.  These two services are often cited because the right to education and the right to cho


ose one's employment are commonly thought of as 
the two most important rights that were denied to slaves.  However, the 
cruelest aspect of slavery may have been the denial of a slave's right 
to a secure family structure.
<P>
Current social theorists emphasize strong family relationships as being 
paramount for an individual's emotional and mental health.

A stable 
nuclear family was almost impossible to maintain under slavery.  Marriage 
between slaves was not legally recognized.  Slaves requested permission 
from their masters to be allowed to marry and the recognition of the union 
only came from within the slave community.  The slave marriage ceremony, 
if one was held at all, varied from the couple jumping over a broomstick 
together to exchanging vows in front of a white minister.  Whatever the 
nature of the wedding ceremony, slave marriages ultimately depended on 
the will of the masters.  Some slaves were forced into "marriage" for 
breeding purposes.

Husbands, wives, and children were often separated 
when sold.  To many whites, the slave family consisted of transient 
members who could be easily exchanged emotionally by the slave as they 
could physically by the master.  Because of this, slaves obtained a 
reputation among whites as being immoral and devoid of family values.

<P>
To the surprise of many whites, countless number so freed slaves attempted 
to find their long lost relatives at the end of the war.
(<A HREF="../bibliography.html#litwack">Litwack 229</A>)  
Unfortunately, 
the chances of locating a family member were slim.  Years had past and 
physical appearances had changes and information, which was mainly 
obtained by word of mouth, was often outdated or inaccurate.

The Freedmen's Bureau Agents did their best to help freedmen reunite 
and establish families according to the accepted practices of white 
America.  The Bureau functioned as a clearinghouse of information, 
assigned its agents to investigate leads to the whereabouts of family 
members and spouses, and sometimes provided transportation to reunite 
families.  
(<A HREF="../bibliography.html#litwack">Litwack 231</A>)
Freedmen and freedwomen turned to the Bureau for assistance 
in resolving domestic problems such as abandonment and divorce.    The 
establishment of a stable family structure for among freedmen was believed 
to be an essential for integrating ex-slaves into civilized life.

<P>
The Staunton Freedmen Bureau Office of Augusta County received hundreds 
of letters requesting help to locate relatives.  Many of these 
cases involved searching for family members in other states and required 
a great deal of cooperation between bureau offices.  The majority of 
the cases were referred to the Bureau Headquarters in Richmond and then 
passed on to the respective Sub-District if the case involved people 
from within Virginia; otherwise, the case was forwarded to the national 
headquarters in Washington, D. C.  to be referred to the respective agency.
This was a lengthy process that usually did not yield positive results.

Alice Moore, a 16 year old freed girl, solicited the help of the Staunton 
Bureau in may of 1865 to locate her parents Roderick Moore and Sally Moore, 
who had belonged to William Hayward and Nicholas Bess respectively, in North 
Carolina .  Alice had been sold in Richmond in 1864-5 to Wm McFall of Augusta 
County.  Alice provided a great deal of information to the Bureau, including 
the location of the each of the plantations.   This case was passed through 
the Virginia Headquarters, then the national, and then the agencies of the 
North Carolina.  After three months, the case was returned to the Staunton 
Bureau without success.  Roderick Moore and Sally Moore had apparently 
left their former masters moved to New Berne, but the New Berne agent could 
find no trace of them.

Most cases brought before the Bureau had very little information to start 
the investigation with.  Every possibility was explored in attempt to find 
lost relatives.  In December 1867, 
the Agent Thomas P. Jackson of the Staunton Freedmen's Bureau 
office requested that the Assistant Commissioner, John McDonnell, find a 
former slave only known as "Uncle Flemming" in order to question him about 
the whereabouts of the slave trader who had sold the children of Nancy 
Thornton.  <BR>

<A NAME="process"></A>
<P>
This situation was typical of the process to find relatives.  Freedmen had 
barely any information to start with.  Slave traders were often sought with 
the hope that they would remember to whom the family member was sold to.

However difficult it was to locate a lost family member, it may have been 
more difficult to reunite them because of finances.  The Bureau did provide 
transportation to freed people, but only in rare cases.  The Bureau had very 
little money and it was believed the responsibility to provide such services 
fell upon local authorities.  In the case of Betsey Brown, the Augusta Agents 
attempted to reunite this African-American family despite the fact that the 
Virginia State Bureau had refused financial aide.  Betsy Brown had traveled 
a long journey to Staunton from Mississippi in search of her father Gabriel 
Brown who was reported to be living outside of Winchester.  Betsy Brown had 
three children with her and had run out of money before she could complete 
her 
journey.  Inquiry was made and Gabriel Brown was located, but he was too poor 
to pay for his daughter and grandchildren's passage.  After the State Bureau's 
rejection of the application for transportation, Assistant Commissioner 
McDonnell instructs the Staunton Agent Jackosn to find the "lowest price" 
for 
the passage of Betsy Brown and her children to Winchester.  This cases 
attests to the dedication of the Augusta County Bureau officers to provide 
for the needs of the freedpeople regardless of the opposition from within
the organization.

In the case of Marian Hall, the 
problem was legal rather than financial.  Marian Hall was attempting to regain 
custody of his daughter, Mary Elizabeth who had been taken away from him 
during slavery.  S. C. Slaven currently possessed the girl and claimed 
that she was indentured to him as repayment for the years he had provided 
for her.  
The legalities of the case were eventually resolved and Slaven 
was ordered to had the child over to her father, however,  then arose 
the problem of financing her travels to him.  No record was found as to 
whether Marian Hall was reunited with his daughter, but it can be assumed 
so from his anxious nature to be reunited with her. <BR>

For many black men, being the head of a strong family was a sign of their 
freedom and their masculinity.  The stable family gave freed people the 
recognition in the eyes of the white society that they were capable of living 
within the structure of civilized society.  
(<A HREF="../bibliography.html#taylor">Taylor 164</A>)
However, the respect for marriage
and family was not shared by all freedmen.  This was undoubtedly due to the 
fact that the sense of parental responsibility and marriage fidelity were 
retarded by slavery.   Under slavery, marriage was not legally binding and 
parents had little control over the fate of their children.   Although masters
were sympathetic to the bond between and a mother and child, they had no 
qualms about selling the father away from the family.  Because of this, some 
black men felt little or no paternal responsibility and many black women 
felt no loyalty to their husbands.

In 1868, the Staunton Bureau investigated the whereabouts of Cynis Bannister 
who had been reported by his wife, Angeline Bannister to have left Staunton 
in 1864 for Parkersburg.,  Agent, S. C. Colburn, who interviewed Cynis 
Bannister "endeavored to impress upon him the importance of caring for his 
children."  Cynis stated that marital problems induced him to leave but that 
he was planning to visit his wife and children in the spring.  The fact that 
it took four years for Angeline to search for her husband
or for Cynis to plan a trip to visit his wife attests to the weakness of the 
marital bond between this couple.

In the case of David Collins, devotion to the marriage was strictly one way.  
David Collins' wife had left Staunton for Winchester in September 1866 to visit her mother.  Having heard nothing from her since, Collins solicited 
the Bureau for help in finding her.  The Bureau did locate her, but she was 
living with a new husband.  The right to legal marriage and divorce was 
evidently valuable to David Collins as an aspect of his freedom.  Collins 
immediately requested information on how to legally nullify the marriage.

<A NAME="polygamy"></A>
<P>
Many cases of polygamy surfaced after the war when freedmen located their 
spouses.  Slaves frequently remarried after their spouses had been sold.  
Many polygamous relationships arose from attempts of freedmen to care for 
the two or more wives and families whom they had been reunited after the 
war.  
(<A HREF="../bibliography.html#taylor>Taylor 165</A>)
Other polygamous arrangements arose from a freedmen's ignorance or 
disregard of legal marriage laws.  In the other extreme of regarding legal 
marriage as a sign of freedom, some blacks engaged in free love and
 moved from mate to mate.

Elizabeth Harris petitioned the Staunton Bureau for help in locating her 
husband, James Harris in December 1867.  James had apparently left Staunton 
for Danville and had not been heard from since.  The  Bureau did locate him 
working for the railroad outside of Danville, but discovered that he had two 
other wives.

<P>
The Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau in Augusta County did their best to help 
the freedmen establish a strong family structure.  Although its efforts were 
noble, the Freedmen's Bureau could do little to reverse the sociological 
effects 
of decades of slavery and had almost no funds or staff to to support in- 
depth investigations to locate loved ones.
