On the 27 of May Marian Hall (c) made com-
plaint at this office that S.C. Slaven of Highland Co 
witheld from him his daughter Mary Elizabeth 
on the ground said child had been bound to him 
by the County Court of Bath Co. Va. I wrote to Slaven 
on the 30 of May but received no reply.  Since, looking 
over some papers, I find letter from S.C. Slaven received 
some time before I took charge, which I respectfully transmit 
asking that the records of the court of Bath Co. be ex-
amined to see if the indenture will be recognized 
as fair and valid by the Bureau.  The father claim he is fully 
able to support the child and was when taken from him 
but being himself a slave the authorities would not 
allow him to retain or provide for it.<P>
