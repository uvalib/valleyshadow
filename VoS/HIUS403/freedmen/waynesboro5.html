Capt. T.P. Jackson,

	Sir, Mr. Potter called me this morning and requests that you go 
to Col J B Baldwin and request him to draw up the deed for the lot No. 20 
so that he can have his brother Joseph and wife Susan, Sampsonm and wife 
Sarah sign with him bounded by B. Turrel on the East. Brown on the west. 
Turnpike on the North and an alley on the South, etc.

	I will take this occasion to state that this lot is not is not 
one on which the the house was burnt as I represented to you but 
adjoining it on the West. I was not aware of this until this morning and 
perhaps it would be as well if you would come and see before purchasing, 
yet in my opinion the lot is a cheap one. Do however as you think best.

					Very respectfully
