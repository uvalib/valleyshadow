<P>Sir

<BR>	The assistant commissioner has authorized the expenditure of $100 
for furnishing the schoolhouse at Staunton with desks.

<P>	You are therefore directed to have desks made for this school at 
an expense not to exceed $100-and to forward the accounts for services 
and material to this office for payment. The account should be forwarded 
in time to reach the office on or about the 25th of the month in which 
the services are rendered, or the materials purchased. The purchases 
should be reported sooner if possible.
<P>				
					Very respectfully
					<BR>Your Obd. Svt.
