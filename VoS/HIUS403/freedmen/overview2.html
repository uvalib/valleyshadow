The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands was established 
in March 1865. Its primary role was to safeguard the freedom of the 
recently emancipated slaves.  It was empowered to help Black and White 
refugees who had been dispossessed by the war to return home.  The 
Bureau helped support them with sustenance, medicines, transportation, 
direction, and care.  It resolved disputes involving violence and 
theft, and helped negotiate contracts between Freedmen and white employers. 
The Bureau helped establish shcools and churches with the aid fo Northern 
charities.

<P>
One of its primary achievements was the esablishment of schools which 
awakened blacks to the need for educuation and established public 
education in the South.  The contracts it negotiated often perpetuated a 
system of black subservience as they often served the white employer's 
purposes more than the black employees'.  The job of an agent of the 
Bureau was sometimes very dangerous, as many were northerners who were 
regarded as 
"capetbaggers."  In Texas 13% or 31 out of 234 agents were victims of 
some sort of violence.
</P>
<P>
Its success was tempered by a lack of funding and support from the 
federal government in conjuction with opposition to it on the local level.

Below are a variety perspectives of the Bureau:
<LI> "The local Bureau agent was expected to win the confidence of blacks 
and whites alike in a situation where race and labor relations had been 
poisoned by mutual distrust and conflicting interests." -- <A

<LI>"It is not...in you power to fulfill one tenth of the expectations of 
those who framed the Bureau.  I fear you have a Hercules task." --

<LI>"The real test of the Freedmen's Bureau was...whether the insitution 
could use the power Congress had granted to it to meet the most pressing 
needs of the freedmen." -- Historian

William S. McFeeley </A> in reference to the Bureau's inability to 
prevent blacks from dying of malnutrition.

"[The Freedmen's Bureau]... didn't rank very high in the records around 
here.  We lost a war and it had been forced onto us. [It 
was]...distasteful in the eyes of the citizens, so they tended to ignor 
it." --
