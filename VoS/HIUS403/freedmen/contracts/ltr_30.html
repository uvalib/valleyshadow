Mr. Jackson,<BR>
<P>
I did not give Joshua an order & shall not do anything further in the 
matter until the whole matter is investigated by disinterested persons.  
My accounts must be examined to see that they are correct.  If so--I am 
not owing Joshua anything--If I choose to give him the board of the boys 
I can do so, but I will not be forced to support servants and take all 
their impositions passively.<P>
Yours Respectfully, <BR>
Annie E. Branham<P>
