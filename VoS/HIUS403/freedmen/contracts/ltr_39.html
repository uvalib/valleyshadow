Near Middlebrook, June 1st 1866<BR>

Agent Freedman's [sic] Bureau<BR>

Dear Sir:<BR>
Yesterday Archibald Smith came for the things that Ellen Taylor had left 
in my care until she sent for them; these I let him have & such other 
things as I could spare.<BR>
<P>
I too was greatly astonished, when I saw the letter from you, concerning 
the wages of said Ellen as I thought we were square.  As to the crop of 
<U>Corn & Potatoes</U> raised by Toby Taylor (Ellen's Husband) I will say 
that I 
had to study awhile before I knew what it meant; then I recollected that 
told Toby that he might have a piece of corn (about an Acre) if he would 
attend to it; but unfortunately for him he took sick and died before the 
corn was gathered.<BR>
<P>
I also told him he might have a piece of ground for <U>Potatoes</U>; he 
planted them, but they were never gathered in, they rotted in the 
ground.  This you see was before the negroes were free (in 1864) so I 
think I am clear of that.<BR>
<P>
As to <U>Ellen's wages, I told</U> her when she first was set free that I 
would give her her victuals & clothes if she would stay with me.  She 
stayed until about 2 months ago, when she left; and now I think it would 
be great injustice for me to have to repay her.<BR>
<P>
I sent you a note by A. Smith stating that I would be in town in a few 
days & see you but other arrangements makes me write this to you instead.<BR>
<P>
I hope this will make all things right.<BR>
<P>
Yours Res.<BR>
