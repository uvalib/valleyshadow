I have the honor to enclose a claim of Joshua Harris (col'd) against Mr. 
Jaccheri of Charlottesville (who kept a restaurant at White Sulphur 
Springs) amount $18.75<BR>
<P>
Jaccheri has paid Harris nothing and makes as I understand no excuse 
except that six (6) Knives & forks were lost.<BR>
<P>
Harris claims that even if the knives were lost the room was open day & 
night by <U>order</U> of Mr. Jaccheri and their value is very far below 
$18 75/100.  Harris is a faithful, respectable man and bears a first 
class character for honesty.<BR>
