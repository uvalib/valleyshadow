Mr. Thompson<BR>
Dear Sir:<BR>
<IMG SRC="block.gif" WIDTH="5%" HEIGHT="2">I worked for two months for 
Captain Trice Miles from Waynesburrow [sic] before 
Christmas, and he promised to pay me $12, I have been to him several 
times and he won't pay me any thing  I offered to take it in wheat by he 
wont pay any way  I am living with Mr. Harden now been here four or five 
months and it is a busy time with him he is about threshing his wheat and 
cant conveniently spare me at this time  So I thought best to write to 
you immediately as Cpt Trice expects to go away the 16 of this month.  I 
would be glad you would take some action on it as I worked hard for it 
and am wanting the money<BR>
<P>
respectfully<BR>
Richard Banks
<BR>
If you write to me direct to the care of Mr. James Harden at Waynesburrow
