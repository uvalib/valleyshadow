<IMG SRC="block.gif" WIDTH="5%" HEIGHT ="2">Yours of 3rd inst. is before 
me, to which I hasten to reply.  Nelson 
Walker (colored) was discharged from the Service of this Asylum for 
repeatedly violating an important regulation of this institution.  He was 
employed in one of our wards occupied by the insane.  He left his post 
and remained away all night without the consent or knowledge of those in 
charge.  This he repeated not less than two or three times after I had 
reasoned with him & pointed out the great importance of this regulation.<BR>
<IMG SRC="block.gif" WIDTH="5%" HEIGHT="2">You have herewith, statement of 
his acct. and copy of contract.<BR>
<IMG SRC="block.gif" WIDTH="5%" HEIGHT="2">Mary Jane Scott, after long 
indulgence & repeated admonition, was finally 
discharged for disturbing the peace & quiet of the institution.  She 
quarled with the other servants and her last act was to attack her 
husband in such a manner as to produce an excitement throughout the 
department in which she was employed.  You have herewith copy of her 
acct. and contract.<BR>
