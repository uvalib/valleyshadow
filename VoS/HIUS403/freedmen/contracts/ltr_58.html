August the 4 1867<BR>
Mr. Thompson  Dear Sir<BR>
<P>
I hired a woman <U>Honner Tines</U> in the spring by the month to cook, She 
was not stout and dont suit as a cook, and we find her so quarrelsome and 
disagreeable with the other negroes that they wont agree to stay with 
her,  They have gotten it in their heads that she is a conjurer and are 
all affread of her,  we cant get along without other hands on the farm,  
all say they will leave if she dont,  we dident rent the house to her 
only hired her by the month her time is out and we have paid her two 
weeks ago, now she says she wont leave before Christmas,  that we have no 
right to put her out   We dont want any fuss or trouble with her  So I 
write to you to know what to do about it,  she is a very disagreeable 
creature, hard to get along with  We want the room she is in very badly,  
you will please answer this immediately and let me know what course to 
pursue.<BR>
<P>
Most Respectfully,<BR>
Mrs. James Harden<BR>
