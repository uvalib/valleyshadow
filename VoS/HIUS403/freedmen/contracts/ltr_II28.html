<P>
Dr. Sir<BR>
Your favor of Jan 29th is rec'd.  The boy Jesse [Lewis (c)] commenced work 
for me on 
the 8th of Oct last, having agreed to work by the month from that date @ 
$28.00 per mon; Sometime before his month was out he ran away without 
giving me any notice or leaving me with anyone to supply his place thus 
breaking his contract & depriving himself of all claim on me.  I was away 
during the most of his stay here & my clerk informs me that he was 
utterly worthless & did not earn his board.<BR>
<P>
Very Respectfully,<BR>
J. A. Hefelfinger<BR>
