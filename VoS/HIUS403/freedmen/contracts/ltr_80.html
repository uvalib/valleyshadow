Mr. Thos. P. Jackson<BR>
<P>
Dear Sir<BR>
In answer to your note of the 8th in regard to Henry Alexander['s] claim 
against Estate of John P. M. McCutchen Dec.  Said Alexander did apply to 
Capt. Tukey, Agent Bureau at Staunton for the recovery of money from said 
McCutchen, and the facts being stated to Mr. Tukey by said McC in his 
lifetime the case was dismissed.<BR>
<P>
Should the claim you refer to be for service rendered by said Alexander's 
children it can be proven that McCutchen agreed with the wife of said 
Alexander that her and her children might go, or remain with him, till 
they could do better andhe would furnish them supplies as he had done 
before and house &c till they could find a place to move to, and after 
remaining some time in that way they concluded to leave.<BR>
<P>
McCutchen's books show no indebtedness to Alexander.<BR>
<P>
I have learned the above facts from Mr. Judson O. McCutchen, who I 
believe was living at his uncle's at the time on the place.<BR>
<P>
Should you wish to make any further inquiry about the matter write me on 
the subject and I will be glad to give you all the information I can.<BR>
<P>
Your obedient Srvt.<BR>
G. W. McCutchen<BR>
