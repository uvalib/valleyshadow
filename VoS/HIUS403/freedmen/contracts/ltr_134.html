Went in Feb-Mar and left at Xmas 1866<BR>
<P>
Sir.  James Wait desires me to make a memorandum of the articles Mr. 
Burdett gave his sister Dorcas Wait last year when she was living with 
him.<BR>
One new calico dress<BR>
One mouslaine [sic] dress a second one belonging to one of his daughters<BR>
also a linsay dress which was taken from her and a pair of shoes at $2.50 
he was to pay her $4 per month and she lived there ten months<BR>
he also gave her a shaker at 50c.<BR>
<P>
If Mr. J. is not at home James Wait would be very glad if you would get 
the money for his sister and enclose it to Mrs. M. Tate, Greenville  he 
has been trying all year and has entirely failed.<BR>
