Mr. Jackson,<BR>
<P>
I am owing Joshua $24.90 balance on services rendered.  He is owing me $20 
for children's board and $3 for Table ware broken by self & children.<BR>
<P>
I did not send for you to come to my house to settle with Joshua, but 
told him that you said you would attend to it today & that you would be 
round after a while--about dinner time.<BR>
<P>
Yours Respectfully,<BR>
