Sir.  Yours of 3rd. inst. is before me, to which I hasten to reply.  
Nelson Walker (colored) was discharged  from the service of this asylum 
for repeatedly violating an important regulation of this institution.  He 
was employed in one of our wards accupied by the insane.  He left his 
post and remained away all night without the consent or knowledge of 
those in charge.  This he repeated not less than two or three times after 
I had reasoned with him & pointed out the great importance of this 
regulation.<BR>
<P>
You have herewith statement of his acct. and <A HREF="ltr_12B.html">copy of 
contract</A>.<BR> 
<P>
Mary Jane Scott, after long indulgence & repeated admonitions, was 
finally discharged for disturbing the peace & quiet of the institution.  
she quarreled with the other servants & her last act was to attack her 
husband in such a manner as to produce an excitement throughout the 
department in which she was employed.  You have herewith copy of her 
acct. and contract.<BR>
<P>
Your obd't Servant,<BR>
