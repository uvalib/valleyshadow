<P>
At the request of Mr. Alexander Anderson of Augusta Co. I have the honor 
to transmit a claim made by him against the United States for property 
seized by and furnished to U.S. troops from June 7 to 9th 1864, amounting 
to $476 00/100.<BR>
Many similar claims have already been presented and will be almost 
numberless if the U.S. govt. commences paying them.<BR>
For Mr. Alex. Anderson I can only say that his account is a just 
statement of his losses and that his loyalty throughout has been decided 
and unconditional.<BR>
