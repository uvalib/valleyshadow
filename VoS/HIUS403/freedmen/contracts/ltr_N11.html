Yours of this date is received.  Mr. Cheroning the [?] notified me a 
short time ago not to pay any of the men employed on his [?] as he had 
assumed obligations for many of them which were to be paid out of their 
wages.  I therefore refer you to him and if you will obtain from Mr. J. 
J. Cheroning a statement showing the amt. due William Meredith after 
deducting such obligations (if any have been incurred on his account) I 
will pay the amount found to be due.  The payroll for April has not been 
received at this office & I do not know what is due Wm. Meredith for that 
month.<BR>
