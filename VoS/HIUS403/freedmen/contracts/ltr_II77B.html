<P>
Captain<BR>
I respectfully refer to a communication from Brev. Lt. Col. James Johnson 
S.A.C. 6th Dist. Va. dated May 1/67(returned to your Head Quarters May 
12/67 with an endorsement thereon made by me. May 12/67) asking [?] to 
collect a claim of $130 said to be due to the children of Henry Alexander 
(col'd) by James McPhetus McCutchen, deceased, late of Augusta Co.  
Claimant in behalf of the children of Benjamin Moten (col'd)<BR>
<P>
The heirs dispute the claim and the administrator notifies me that unless 
legal proof is presented he cannot pay the amount or any portion 
thereof.  As the estate is solvent and must soon be settled, I ask Henry 
Alexander's children present me at once with proper legal proof of the 
solidity of their claim.<BR>
<P>
Very Respectfully<BR>
