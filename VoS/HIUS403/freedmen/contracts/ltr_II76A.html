I have the honor to transmit inclosed here with account of John Brent 
(col) against Henry Miller & Son of Brownsburg, Rockbridge Co. and letter of 
Daniel Brown JR in answer to an enquiry made by me.<BR>
Brent comes to this office and insists that Miller is indebted to him as 
per act and that at the examination befroe the Justice Brown his 
witnesses were not heard nor any credit given to his own statement .  As 
to the watch for which a credit of $25 is given Brent says that it was 
extended to Miller to have a new hand to put on but he (Miller) retained 
it as appeart by account.  Brent appears a quiet, steady man and I 
respectfully ask the matter be investigated by the proper officer in 
Rockbridge Co.<BR>
<P>
Very Respectfully<BR>
