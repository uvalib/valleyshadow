Dear Sir<BR>
I wish to hire a good cook & worker for my family 5 persons.  For a good 
reliable woman I will give $6.00 Six Dollars per month the year round.  I

steps of the kitchen & the wood always in the House.  The Labour is very 
light any Harty [sic] woman can do the work with ease & not employed 2/3 
of her time.  if you know of such a One or one should call at your office 
for hire let them know of the situation.  I live in 1 mile of Waynesboro
