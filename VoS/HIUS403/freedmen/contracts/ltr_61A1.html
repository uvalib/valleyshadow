<P>
I respectfully forward copy (evidently imperfect) of indenture Punch Fox 
to John H. Rippitoe.  Both parties reside near Staunton.  Fox claims that 
Rippitoe so far from teaching him the trade of "brick mason" hired him 
out year after year as farm hand and received and kept the whole amount 
of such hire.<BR>
<P>
Both in default to teach him the trade of "brick mason" & settlement 
subsequent to the expiration of apprenticeship Fox claims that Rippetoe 
has defrauded him.<BR>
<P>
Can you have the copy enclosed compared with the original on record in 
Nelson County and the omission between the words "Punch Fox" and "in the 
craft" &c supplied or correct copy made.<BR>
<P>
