I have the honor to transmit herewith enclosed paper in reference to 
claim of Henry Alexander's heirs (col'd) against estate of J. McPhetus 
McCutchen, deceased, asking the matter be referred to Military Com 14th 
Divn. for investigation.  Benj. Moten came here from Fredericksburg but 
found legal expences [sic] too much for him to prosecute the claim and 
further he could not absent himself from his business in Fredericksburg.  
The other claimants who live here are too poor to sue in court.  The 
estate is solvent, and the adminstrators a loyal honorable man who is 
will admit the claim if proper proof is furnished, and a recipt given 
which will be admitted as a valid voucher in his settlement of accounts 
with the estate.<BR>

Very Respectfully<BR>
