I return corrections on your Reported rations--from which it appears that 
only 30 rations were issued to 1049 persons. You evidently mistake what a 
ration is--a ration is the allowance to an adult for one day, or to two 
children one day. Supplies for 10 men 10 days would be 100 rations. so 10 
children 10 days =50. Please correct it in that particular. Second-You 
are directed to make good report correspond with the Previous returns 
sent in. If you afterwards issued to more than -- drawn for they must not 
be repeated. If they are, your report will not agree with the 
Commissary's abstract which he makes up from the Previous Returns 
received. You will return corrected report by first mail.

<P>

Very Respectfully
<BR>

Your Obd. Svt.
