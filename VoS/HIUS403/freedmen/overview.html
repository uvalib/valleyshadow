The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands was established 
in March 3, 1865 after two years of bitter debate. The Freedmen Bureau, 
as it was commonly called, was to address all matters concerning 
refugees and freedmen within the states that were under reconstruction.  
The Bureau was not appropriated a budget of its own, but was instead 
commissioned as a subsidiary of the War Department and depended upon it 
for funds and staff.

<P>
The Freedmen's Bureau was headed by Commissioner General O. O. Howard who 
was appointed by President Andrew Johnson with the consent of the 
Senate.  Commissioner Howard was received a salary of $3,000 and gave 
$50,000 
in bonds.  Assistant Commissioners were appointed to each of the ten states 
under reconstruction in the same manner.  The Assistant Commissioner 
received a salary of $2,500 and gave $20,000 bond.  The salaries of other 
positions were not stated in the bill, so the majority of the positions 
in the Bureau were filled by army officers.

<P>
In the beginning, the Freedmen's Bureau did not suffer from lack of 
funding.  The Bureau sold and rented lands in the South which had been 
confiscated during the war.  However, President Johnson undermined the 
Bureau's funding by returning all lands to the pre-Civil War owners in 
1866.  After this point, freed slaves lost access to lands and the Bureau 
lost its primary source of funding.
<P>
The majority of historians believe that the Freedmen's Bureau made a very 
small impact, if any, on the freedmen during reconstruction.  A few of 
the reasons for the Bureau's failures as a provider for social welfare 
include the following:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>lack of funds</LI>
<LI>weak organization of the Bureau's internal structure</LI>
<LI>opposition from conservatives</LI>
<LI>and apathy of the Southern community</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Despite the many criticisms, the Freedmen's Bureau did help 
African-Americans gain access to the rights that they were denied during 
slavery.  This site will address four of these rights.

<LI><B>Social Services</B>
<BR>
The Freedmen's Bureau helped black communities to establish schools and 
churches. Under slavery, blacks had been denied the right to education and 
religion. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Violence and Justice</B>
<BR>
The Freemen's Bureau monitored the civil authorities in cases that 
involved African-Americans.  Initially, the Freedmen's Bureau conducted 
its own court of law when it was illegal for a black to testify in court 
in the majority of Southern sates.
</LI>
<LI><B>Labor and Contracts</B>
<BR>
The labor system of the South had to be completely restructured after the 
war.  Many former slave owners attempted to trick former slaves into 
entering contracts under the same terms as under the slavery system.  The 
Freedmen's Bureau acted on the behalf of blacks to negotiate fair 
contracts for labor and property.
</LI>
<LI><B>Family Services</B>
<BR>
Freedom offered blacks the opportunity to establish a firm family 
structure.  The Freedmen's Bureau acted as a clearinghouse of information 
to aide blacks in finding lost relatives and mediated domestic disputes.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The advocates of the Freedmen's Bureau had genuine intentions to aide the 
African-American population prosper as freedmen, but the lack of funding 
and support from the federal govenment in conjuction with opposition at 
the local level tempered the Bureau's success. <P> <P> </TD></TR>
