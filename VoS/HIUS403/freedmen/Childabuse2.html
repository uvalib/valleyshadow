Dear Sir,<BR>
In reply to yours of the 6th inst. stating that Algernon Haleman a cold. 
boy bound to me had charged me with abusive treatment of him.  I 
pronounce the charge utterly false. I can as I think satifactorily prove 
to you by all my near neighbors and men of as respectable moral 
characters as any in the county. I have also an old blackman who has been 
living with me for the last twenty years who will testify that I have 
never abused him in any particulars, on the contrary my great fault has 
been our indulgence. The boy last year done very badly. He got to running 
about at night + frequently not getting home untill late in the morning+ 
then would be so stupid as to he unfit for work. He frequently rode my 
horses without my knowledge or consent + for all. . .
