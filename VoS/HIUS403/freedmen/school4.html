<BR>Sir,

<P>	In reply to your application for a teacher at Waynesboro, I have 
to state that Mr. Brackett will furnish a teacher on the following terms; 
the freedmen to board him, furnish fuel + pay him $10 per mo.

<P>	Mr. Waring a very intelligent colored man representing another 
society which is operating in the valley will furnish a teacher if they 
will pay him $5 per month and fuel etc. for the school.

<P>	Please ascertain at once which proposition (if either) they 
accept. I would of course recommend the latter.
	
				
					<P>Very Respectfully
					<BR>John A. McDonnell
