One of the many functions the Freedmen's Bureau addressed was the 
issue of justice. Following the end of the war, Southern whites resented 
both their northern occupiers and newly freed blacks.  This resentment 
can be seen in newspapers, diaries, and letters, and one way whites released
their aggression was by attacking freedmen.  Victims rarely found 
protection or reparatiom from the civil athorities, which were 
often dominated by the same whites who had been the aggavators . With 
civil utlets closed, the local Freedmen's Bueau office appeared to be a haven 
for victims. The Bureau received letters from both blacks and whites 
complaining of attacks, mistreatment and other criminal actions. In 
dealing with these claims, however, the Bureau's hands were tied and the cases
seldomly were addressed by the civil athorities. As a result assults, 
abuse, an thefts remained a common occurance in reconstruction Virginia.
