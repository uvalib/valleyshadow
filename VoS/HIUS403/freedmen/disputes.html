Employment disputes arose from a variety of reasons, and frequently the 
tenor of letters to the Bureau indicated that employers felt some 
resentment about having to adjust to a free labor force.  Whites also 
often expressed the opinion that the Bureau was more worried about 
distributing aid to the freedmen than about helping them become gainfully 
employed, as the poster shown above demonstrates.<BR>
