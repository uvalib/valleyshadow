Colonel Brown, Assistant Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau for the 
State of Virginia, has just submitted to General Howard a proposition for 
the removal of all negroes, residents of that State, to the unoccupied 
lands of Florida. This would necessarily involve Congressional action, 
but gEneral Howard has not yetfully determined what course to pursue in 
the matter.--Staunton <I> Vindicator </I> December 12, 1865
