Dear Sir I will state to you that since I was at your office in Staunton I have returned to my house in Highland and have gotten into a right Serious difficulty which I will State. Some of the facts. My Brother and Myself were attacked on the road by Some





 Rebels who threw Rocks at us and pursued us to the house and Commenced an attack upon us there. They buroke upon windows threw rocks into the house. They kept up the attack for some time hurraying for Rebels and Cursing yankees. My Brother was badly injured from being struck in the face with a Stone. One other man and Myself were Slightly injured the ____: an other union mans house was Stoned The Same night we got a warrant and had one man by the name of Ratcliff arested he said the Reason why we were treated So was because we were claimed Radicals he gave bale for his appearance at Court but I have no Idah that he will be punished and him and others I understand have been making Threats against union men. I wish to know of you if we Cant get some protection by the Military. I think after Soldiered for the Union I diserve protection in it. I wish you to write to me imediately and let me Know what to do. I Think that I am well able to prove that David Hicks was engaged in this thing the man that you saved





 form punishment last summer he is now Threatening union men. I am able to prove to you that he is nor never has been a loyal man and Charges against him is Correct and he never was employed by the government and I advise you to let the civil law have it 





affect upon him. Said in this letter by Reliable men. Please write imidiately and let me know what to do yours truly F.M. Bird
