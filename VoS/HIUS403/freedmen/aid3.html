Dear Sir,
<P>	In answer to communications addresssed to Headquarters of Bureau 
by you in regard to the supply of medicines for indigent sick Freedmen I 
will state that if a list is made out of articles which are absolutely 
essential for the treatment of indigent sick, and but a moderate quantity 
of the several articles is asked for, I will try to furnish them. you will 
see that this requisition <U>must be small</U>, as there is no one who 
can formally receipt the medicines at Staunton and I must furnish them 
from the dispensary supplies receipted for by a medical officer here.
<P>
				Respectfully yours,

<HR>
The signature is illegible, but the letter comes from the Bureau office 
in Richmond.
