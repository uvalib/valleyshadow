The Freedmen's Bureau in Staunton was deeply involved in labor issues 
arising in both the black and white communities.  Contract disputes were 
frequently brought to the Bureau's attention for settlement, and Bureau 
agents also played a role in helping the freedmen negotiate labor 
contracts with their former masters.  Claimants of both races also turned 
to the Bureau for aid in filing claims against the United States 
government to collect on contracts made by military officers for property 
commandeered or destroyed during the war.<BR>

Despite the sizable flow of paperwork resulting from the Bureau's 
involvement in labor and contract issues, it is difficult to ascertain 
the degree of success that the Bureau acheived in furthering the cause of 
the freedmen.  Much of the correspondence that survives is written by 
white citizens, from which a picture of the freedmen emerges that is less 
than flattering.  Also, while the Bureau did play some role in aiding the 
freedmen to negotiate fair contracts with their former masters, more 
often it was called in after the fact, to referee disputes arising from 
unclear contracts, or more often, from contracts that clearly took 
advantage of black laborers.<BR>

The Freedmen's Bureau also operated as an employment agency, fielding 
requests for labor from white employers across a wide area.<BR>
