An Industrious Negro--Timothy Dixon, colored man, living in this county, 
informs us that he has put out during the past season one hundred acres 
of wheat and seven acres of rye, assisted by only one hane. He has a 
prospect for a fine crop nxt summer. It would be much better if all the 
colored people would follow his example, than lying around the towns and 
cities of the state.
