</UL>
<P>
<UL>
2d. That the sale of a slave in Virginia, in the Confederate lines, prior to the 10th of April, 1865, was valid and binding, notwithstanding the emancipation clause in Alexandria Constitution.

The case was ably argued by Judge Brokenborough, of Lexington, for the plaintiff, and Robert Whitehead, Esq., of Nelson, for the defendant, Judge Brokenborough maintaining the affirmative, and Mr. Whitehead the negative of these positions.
