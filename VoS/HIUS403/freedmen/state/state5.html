The result of the Virginia election should satisfy every observing man in 
the North, that Congress will be filled with negro representatives from 
the South.  This will be the legitimate fruit of universal negro 
suffrage, and, so far as we are concerned, they shall enjoy it to their 
hearts content, and their personal annoyance too.  We trust that not a 
white man in the whole South will ever be sent to a Radical Congress.  We 
would dose them with nigger until they cry, "hold, enough!"--<I>Lynchburg
