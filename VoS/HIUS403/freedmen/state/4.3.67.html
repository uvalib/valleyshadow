A united and harmonious white population will suffer little inconvenience 
from universal suffrage. A little kindly conciliation and patient 
teaching on our part will soon enable the newly enfranchised colored man 
to see that his own interest requires him to co-operate with his former 
master and, after all, his best friend, rather than to follow the lead of 
designed deceivers, who would rob him of his paltry savings and lure him 
into a destructive contest of races.--<I>Roanoke Times</I>
