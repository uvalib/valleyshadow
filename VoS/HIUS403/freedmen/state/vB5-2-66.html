An article in the Richmond <I>Examiner</I>, charges upon this gentleman the responsibility for the passage of the Civil Rights Bill, stating that his influence brought directly to bear upon the Hon. Waitman T. Willey, here tofore conservative, induced tha
t member to desert to the radical ranks.
<P>
This is the second time, since his occupancy of the Gubernatorial chair, that Mr. Peirpoint has openly disregarded every interest of the people over whom he, much to their regret, presides.
<P>
His testimony before the Reconstruction Committee, was an insult to every Virginian, as well as a hindrance to pacification, and this last blow is aimed at the vitals of Virginia's weal.
<P>
It is to be presumed that negro suffrage is the next step he will advocate.  Only that can ever return him to office.
<P>
There seems to be no chance of getting rid of this foundling until another election ; we can put up with him until then ; but is mercey's sake let us have from the Legislature an enactment prohibiting forever from inscription on that list of Governors, wh
ich has been illustrious from colonial days, the unworthy name of Francis II Peirpoint -- <I>Norfolk Virginian.</I>
