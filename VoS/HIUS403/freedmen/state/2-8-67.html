A dispatch from Richmond. Published in the newspapers says: "In 
consequence of the prolonged cold weather, there is great suffering among 
the poor whites and freedmen in this State. It is reported that over two 
thousand freedmen have been thrown out of employment by the suspension of 
work in the tobacco factories. The Freedmen's Bureau is issuing rations 
to the destitute, and Gen. O. H. Browne, assistant commissioner of the 
Bureau, is in Washington endeavoring to procure relief for them."
