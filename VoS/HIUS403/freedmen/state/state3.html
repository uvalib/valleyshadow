The White Man and the Negro--We commend the subjoined illustration to the 
XXVIII and the IX, as well as to their aiders and abettors in the work of 
negro equality.
<P>
The illustration is by a negro in a speech upon this subject to his 
fellow auditors:
<P>
"My friens, God a mitty made de white man white. He made de black man 
black--nobody can't make 'em nuffin else. You know the turkey he roos' on

he roos' on de fence, nigger on the groun'.
