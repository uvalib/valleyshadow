The following law was passed by the
Legislature at its last session:
<P>
An Act to Regulate Contracts for Labor 
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Between White and Colored Persons,
and to Impose a Fine on Persons 
Enticing Laborers from the Service of 
their Employers under such Contracts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
1. <I> Be it enacted by the General
Assembly</I>, That no contract between a white
person and a colored person for the labor
or service of the latter for a longer period
than two months shall be binding on such
colored person, unless the contract be in
writing, signed by such white person, or
his agent, and by such colored person, and
duly acknowledged before a justice or
notary public or clerk of the county
or corporation court or overseer of the poor or
two more credible witnesses in the
county or corporation in which the white
person may reside, or in which the labor 
or service is to be performed.  And it shall 
be the duty of the justice, notary, clerk,
overseer of the poor, or the witnesses to read and 
explain the contract to the colored
person before taking his acknowledgment
thereof, and to state that this has
been done in the certificate of the acknowledgment
of the contract.
<P>
2. If any person shall entice away
from the service of another any laborer
employed by him under a contract, as provided by 
this act, knowing of the existence of such
contract; or shall knowingly employ a 
laborer bound to service to another, under
such contract, he shall forfeit to the 
party aggrieved not less than ten nor more
than twenty dollars for every such offense
to be recovered by warrant before any justice 
of the peace.
<P>
3. This act shall be in force from and after the 
1st day of April, 1866, and the first section shall not 
apply to any contract
made prior to that date.
