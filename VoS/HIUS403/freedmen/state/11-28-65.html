The <I>Richmond Whig</I> says that the statistics, collected by a 
Northern contemporary, show that the mortality among the freedmen of the 
South ranges from thirty to fifty per cent, varying in different 
localities and according to the circumstances in which they are placed, 
and this with all the aid extended by the Freedmen's Bureau. At this 
rate, it will not require many years to put them all under the sod. there 
is, we believe, but one thing that can arresy this fearful mortality, and 
that is the protection and guardianship of the Southern whites. It is 
manifest to the whole country that they must occupy the relations of the 
wards. If they remain here they must be wards of the whites. "God moves 
in a mysterious way," and it may be that their sufferings  in the past 
few months were inflicted to convince them and our Northern countrymen 
that the negroes must have guardians, and to reconcile them both to the 
guardianship and protection of those among whom their lot is cast, since 
other guardianship is, confessedly, impossible.
