The Negro Population<P>
From the returns of the commissioners of revenue in all the counties and 
towns in the State, except Spotsylvania, Fluvanna, Buchanan, Accomac, and 
the city of Lynchburg, from which counties there were no returns, there 
appears to be 73,004 male negroes over the age of twenty-one, which 
multiplied by 4.5, would show a black population of 328,518. Add 12,000 
for the counties and city from which there are no returns, and we have as 
the entire population of the State on the 1st of February last 340,519. 
The Rule of Multiplying the adults by the sum 4.5 was adopted by Mr. 
Bennett, late Auditor of the State, and found to be correct.
<P>
In 1860 the whole negro population, including free and slave, within the 
present limits of Virginia, was 531,000. Comparing this with the amount 
of the same population in February, we discover that there has been a 
loss in the numbers of blacks in Virginia of upwards of  190,000! If 
their diminution has continued in the same ratio since the first of 
February as from 1860 to that time, the number of negroes now in Virginia 
cannot be much over 300,000. This is a terrible result of emancipation to 
these people.
<P>
A very remarkable fact developed by the same returns is that the adult 
male white population of Virginia was larger in February last than it was 
before the war. While the negro population  has fallen off with a fearful 
rapidity, the white Virginians have been increasing in the face of 
calamities of war and of partial famine.
<P>
It is true that a number of negroes left Virginia during the war, but not 
enough to explain the immense falling off in their numbers.--<I>Richmond
