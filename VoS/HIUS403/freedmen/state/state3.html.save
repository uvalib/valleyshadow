The White Man and the Negro--We commend the subjoined illustration to the 
XXVIII and the IX, as well as to their aiders and abettors in the work of 
negro equality.
<P>
The illustration is by a negro in a speech upon this subject to his 
fellow auditors:
<P>
"My friens, God a mitty made de white man white. He made de black man 
black--nobody can't make 'em nuffin else. You know the turkey he roos' on 
defence, and de goose he roos' on de groun' You pull de turkey off de 
fence an' he git up ag'in.--You crap his wings, but some how or anuder, 
he guine to git back on de fence. Now, you sot de goose on de fence and 
he fall off, he don' b'long dar, Now dats white man and nigger; white man 
he roos' on de fence, nigger on the groun'.
