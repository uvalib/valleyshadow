Respectable Negro. - "I've nothing to do with it, sir; but I believe the coloured folks think of something of the sort.  I see no use in it; it can't do any good."
<P>
Despicable White. - "No use! It will show these infernal rebels that they are down, and that you know it, and that you intend to keep them down.  Gen. Grant has rejoiced over them - why shouldn't you?"
<P>
Respectable Negro. - "I wish to do nothing of the kind. I have no such feelings."
<P>
Despicable White. - "Ah, but you should have. You and every other coloured person in the city should join in the proceedings, and use every effort to make them as humiliating as possible to these insolent traitors."
<P>
Respectable Negro. - "I don't think so, sir, and I mean to keep away."
<P>
Despicable White. - "That is cowardly.  These damned secessionists have been whipped, but not half enough.  By - half of them need to have their cursed necks broken.  I want to see them crushed into the dust and the negroes triumph."
