Captain Thomas P. Jackson was the agent of the Freedmen's Bureau in 
Staunton, Augusta County from 1866 until 1868. He was preceded by Mr. F.S. 
Tukey, who appears to have been a civilian since there are no military 
records for him and he is not addressed in any correspondence 
with a military title.  
<P>
The Staunton community regarded the Freedmen's Bureau as a policing force 
and not much else.  One of the earliest mentions of the Freedmen's Bureau's 
was in <A HREF="local/vD1-31-66.html">January 31, 1866 </A>in the 
<I>Valley Virginian</I>.  This article reported that a fight had occurred 
between two parties of black men and that the Freedmen's Bureau was 
investigating the case.
<P>
In all other senses, the community considered the Freedmen's Bureau as a 
symbol of hostile Northern intentions to advance the black community at 
the expense of the whites.  Many Southerners believed that freedmen should 
turn to their <A HREF="local/10.17.66.html">former masters </A> for aide and 
that a government agency for such a purpose was unnecessary.  
<P>
People associated with the Freedmen's Bureau were considered to be Northern 
radicals and were under constant watch of the local community.  
In <A HREF="local/vD1-31-66.html">January 1866</A>, it had to be publicly 
declared that Mr. Tukey, the Superintendent of the Staunton Freedmen's Bureau 
at that time, was not involved in circulating a petition to return Union 
troops to the Valley. In <A HREF="local/v4-4-66.html">April</A> of the same 
year, the Freedmen School teacher in Staunton, John Scott was accused of 
having an affair with a black student when he was seen "escorting" her down 
New Street. 
<P>
The local Freedmen's Bureau and its functions were mentioned only a few 
times in Staunton newspapers, indicating that the people in the community 
neither cared much for the agency or its purpose to aid freedmen.  No record 
of the opening of the Bureau's office in Staunton could be found in the 
newspapers.  There are no records of the exact location of the Freedmen's 
Bureau office itself, although an article in the <I>Valley Virginian</I> in 
1866 mentions that a saloon opened near the Court house and the Freedmen's 
Bureau, putting these two offices within a block radius of each other. Very 
little information to the history of the Staunton office could be found.  
No announcements could be found in the local papers about the opening of 
the office, the changing of agents, and so forth.  
<P>
The information provided in this section has been pieced together from Bureau 
correspondences, available local newspaper articles, and secondary sources.
Overall, the Freedmen's Bureau of the Augusta County did their best to 
fulfill their duties to aid the black community but was limited in its 
effectiveness by lack of funds and community support.
