I have the honor to report three cases of assault upon colored persons, 
and to ask instructions, as from what transpired this morning, I cannot 
but infer that the prosecuting officer will not willingly perform his 
duty as a public officer.<BR>
On the 1st inst Hartwell Baker (col'd) was assaulted by Patrick O'Nole who 
snapped a pistol at him several times, but as it did not exploded he beat 
him with the butt of the pistol. Taken before a magistrate O'Nole was 
fined $1%"" __Hartwell coming to me I sent him and his witnesses to Mr 
Bumgarner the Com Attyn No action yet taken.<BR>
On the 1st inst Hugh Jackson (col'd) complained that on Oct 31st James L 
spencer assulted him with a knife. I referred him also to Mr. Bumgarner- 
and no action yet taken.<BR>
Nov 8. Abraham Wallace (col'd) complained that on that day Henry Ford 
discharged a loaded pistal three times and snapped a cap the fourth time 
at his wife Eveline Wallace.  This morning I addressed enclosed letter to 
Mr Bumgarner making  a mistake in his intials which are famed. He opened 
the letter, said to Wallace I had no right to write anything to him and 
without givinf Wallace any advice or satisfaction returned my letter by 
him.<BR>
Sentiment is so strong against Freedpeople here (not withstanding their 
quite deportment) sice the election, that I fear unless such outrages are 
promptly checked there will be trouble between the two classes.<BR>
I respectfully ask instructions as to what steps I am autherized to take 
in such cases.
