The people of Augusta County appeared to have 
neither cared much for the 
Freedmen's Bureau nor its purpose to aid freedmen.  
This is indicated by the fact that the local 
newspapers rarely mention the 
Freedmen's Bureau and its functions in Staunton, 
although the Bureau 
correspondence records indicate that the office 
was actively involved 
with the local black community. 
<P>
Generally, the community considered the Freedmen's Bureau as a 
symbol of hostile Northern intentions to advance the black community at the 
expense of the whites.  Many Southerners believed that freedmen should turn 
to their <A HREF="local/10.17.66.html">former masters </A> for aide and that 
a government agency for such a purpose was unnecessary. The general community considered the Freedmen's Bureau to be only useful as a police force.
One of the earliest mentions of the 
Freedmen's Bureau's was in <A HREF="local/vD1-31-66.html">January 31, 1866 
in the <I>Valley Virginian</I></A>.  This article reported that a fight had 
occurred between two parties of black men and that the Freedmen's Bureau was 
investigating the case. 
<P>
People associated with the Freedmen's Bureau were considered to be Northern 
radicals and were under constant watch of the local community.  
In <A HREF="local/vD1-31-66.html">January 1866</A>, it had to be publicly 
declared that Mr. Tukey, the Superintendent of the Staunton Freedmen's Bureau 
at that time, was not involved in circulating a petition to return Union 
troops to the Valley. In <A HREF="local/v4-4-66.html">April</A> of the same 
year, the Freedmen School teacher in Staunton, John Scott was accused of 
having an affair with a black student when he was seen "escorting" her down 
New Street. 
<P>
Despite the community's suspicion of the agents of the Freedmen's Bureau, 
the local newspapers did not report on the Bureau office's administrative 
changes. There were no announcements in the local papers about the opening 
of the office, the changing of agents, and so forth. The personnel history 
of the Staunton Bureau office has been pieced together from Bureau 
correspondence.  The Augusta Freedmen's Bureau was opened by Agent F. S. 
Tukey, a civilian, in 1865, then taken over by Agent Captain Thomas P. 
Jackson in 1866 until the middle of 1868.  Agent Colonel 
John W. Jordan succeeded Jackson and the office closed by Roswell Waldo 
on December 31, 1868.  Each of these men performed all the 
functions of the Freedmen's Bureau in Augusta County individually during 
their terms as Agent of the Staunton office.

The financial and administrative problems suffered by the national 
Freedmen's Bureau hindered the work of the Staunton Bureau at the local 
level. The Staunton office had an extremely limited budget for its aid 
programs.  The Bureau could hardly afford to 
furnish the Staunton agent with adequate supplies to complete his job.

In addition, the Freedmen's Bureau was a subsidiary of the war department 
and the majority of its agents were military men, not administrators. Many 
of the agents had risen through the military ranks during the war and had 
received little or no training in the administrative aspects of being an 
officer. Very few agents of the 
Bureau were civilians with experience in filling out forms and following 
bureaucratic procedures.  However, the Freedmen's Bureau on the national 
level demanded that protocols be strictly followed, leading to an immense 
amount of paperwork for the local agent who, alone, was responsible for all 
the functions of the Bureau in his district.

As Reconstruction came to an end in Virginia, so did the Bureau. The 
Bureau in Staunton was ordered to close on December 21, 1868.  The modern 
historical society has no record of the Freedmen's Bureau in Staunton.  
The exact location of the Bureau office could not be determined; however, 
an article announcing the opening of a new saloon in the <I>Valley 
Virginian</I> in 1866 places the Bureau office within a block radius 
of the County Court House in Stauton. 
<P>
Overall, the Freedmen's Bureau of the Augusta County did its best to 
fulfill its duties to aid the black community but was limited in its 
effectiveness by lack of funds and community support.
