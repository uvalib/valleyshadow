Dear Sir: I am directed by the asst. comm. to write to you in reference 
to the school at Waynesboro, referred to by you in your communication to 
Capt. McDonnell.
<P>
	Referring to the original application of Wm. C. Echols for aid in 
erecting that house I find that he expressly states, in so many words 
that the building would be used as a house of worship for his church and 
as a school house "for all children without distinction of sect." On 
these terms the grant of $150 was made. It appears therefore that the 
Methodist Church has the right to the use of the house for religious 
worship and that the public has the right to it for school purposes. 
Please inform the church of this fact, and say to them trhat the Bureau 
expects they will do themselves no discredit and their people no harm by 
trying to make the school in any way denominational. Baptist and 
Methodist churches have in many instances been aided in precisely the 
above manner.
<P>
			Very Respectfully,
		<BR>	R M Manly Sup. Ed.
