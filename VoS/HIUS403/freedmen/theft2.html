I have the honor to report that Mr Alexander Curry now of Bath Co. later 
of Highland has been indicted in Highland Co for theft of a horse from 
Mrs Sarah Bird of Highland Co. during the war.<BR>
There is another of the suit instituted in Highland Co. against all in 
any way connected with 
federal troops during the War and scouting parties __ frequently sent out 
by them and  as enquary is now being made ___ some of these cases at 
Winchester. I notified Mr. Somers the Sheriff not to arrest Curry untill 
some decision had been given on such case. Without defending the conduct of 
such men in all cases, I am satisfied all such suits should be dismissed 
for as the courts are constituted in Highland the <U>same</U> law will not 
be administered if the ___ man is <U>plantiff</U> as if he is 
<U>defendent</U>.<BR>
The case of Curry may likely come at court held at Monterey Dec 12 67.<BR>
Respectfully ask instructions,<P>
Very respectfully<BR>
Yr ob serv<BR>
Thos. P. Jackson<BR>
Agent
