Jackson had to conform to the policies of the Bureau which included very 
precise paperwork, and careful attention to titles. Inevitably, Jackson 
made errors in his correspondences with other Bureau agents. He seemed to 
have been perpetually filling out forms and posting letters, as evidenced 
by the large number of documents that are simply receipts of letters 
sent, or correspondence required by Bureau policy.
<P>
There are many letters between Jackson and McDonnell that illustrate
the <A HREF="bureautitles.html">stress on 
titles.</A> There 
was an insistence on titles including both the 
Freedmen's Bureau title, such as "agent" for Jackson, 
and his military title, "Captain." 
<P>
Jackson often was drawn 
away from other duties by the <A HREF="incompetence2.html">high level of 
paperwork.</A> There was so much paperwork that Jackson faced, that there 
are examples of 
him simply <A HREF="repeat.html">not responding to queries from 
McDonnell.</A> This may have been 
an example of his incompetence or forgetfulness, but Jackson seemed to 
face such massive quantities of paperwork that he was <A 
HREF="miss.html">unable to 
respond</A> or accurately fill out everything. This may also have been a 
result of complicated policies which he was supposed to follow. Some of 
these policies seem to make little sense, and seem to be counterproductive.
<P>
The paperwork not only slowed Jackson down in the field, but also caused 
him to make mistakes, which resulted in confusion between him and 
McDonnell. This confusion <A HREF="incompetence1.html">hampered the 
distribution</A> of the scant supplies available.
<P>
These mistakes and miscommunications were problems endemic throughout the 
Bureau. The Bureau was staffed primarily by former military officers 
who had little, if any, experience with running such an agency, or having 
to comply with so many procedures. The vast majority of officers in the 
Civil War were not career military men, and therefore, were not trained 
by the military to face such a hierarchy or bureaucracy.
<P> <A 
HREF="circular.html">"Circulars"</A> 
were routinely sent out from Washington which required a 
response from the individual agents. They were forwarded by the 
sub-assistant commissioners, such as McDonnell, 
and mandated what procedures the agents should follow. This is another 
example of the behavior of the agents being dictated from afar. Their 
behavior is even governed away from their Bureau responsibilities. 
officials in Washington direct how they should behave in their daily 
lives so as to present an appropriate and positive image of the Bureau.
One example of this is a circular which states, "It is not thought 
advisable that Bureau Officers or Agents should attend political 
conventions."
