Peyton Harris (C) Complains of bad treatment of his child by your wife 
and that you attemped to break an agreement made with him for the present 
year.<BR>
I need not tell you that the law gives you no right to beat or threaten 
to beat anyone and before you can put Harris out of his house and garden 
you must assign sufficent reason, such a break of agreement on his part.
