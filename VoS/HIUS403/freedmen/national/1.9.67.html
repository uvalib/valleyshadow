The Freedmen's College--We understand that a large amount, say $500,000, 
has been raised in the north to establish a first-class College, for the 
colored peopl, in some healthy place South. We also understand that some 
of the respectable people of Staunton have asked that it be established 
here, and offered inducements that will probably secure it. A good idea.
