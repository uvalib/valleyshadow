. . . Then there is another thing I am waiting for. Why don't they 
rekonstrukt the niggers if they are ever goin to? They've give 'em a 
powerful site of freedom, and very little else. Nere's the big freedmen's 
buro, and the little buros all over the country, and the papers are full 
of grand orders, and special orders, and paragrafs, but I'll bet a possum 
some 'em steal my wood this winter or freezes to death. 
<P>
Freedman's buro! 
freedman's humbug. I say. Jest when the corn neede plowin the worst the 
buro rung the bell and and tolled all the niggers to town, and the 
farmers lost the crops; and now the freedman is gettin cold and hungry, 
and wants to go back, and there aint nothin for 'em to go to. But freedom 
is a big thing-Hurraw for freedom's buro! Sweet land of liberty of thee I 
don't sing! But it's all right.
<P>
I'm for freedom myself. Nobody wants any 
more slavery. If the abolishunists had let us alone we would have fixed 
it up right a long time ago, and we can fix it up now. The buro aint 
fixed it and it aint goin to.  It don't know anything about it. Our 
people have got a heap more feeling for the poor nigger than any 
abolishunist. We are as poor as Job, but I'll bet a dollar we can raise 
more money in Rome to build a nigger church than they did in Bostown. The 
papers say that after goin round for 3 weeks, The Bostown christians 
raised thirty-seven dollars to build a nigger church in Savannah. They 
are powerful in theory, but mighty [weak] in practice. . . .
