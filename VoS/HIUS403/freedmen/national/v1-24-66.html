The Washington Correspondent of the Baltimore <I>Sun</I>, in a few words, gives the true reason for excluding the South from representation in Congress. 
<P>
He says:
<BR>
Universal assent appears to be given to the proposition that if the States lately rebellious be restored to rights of representation according to the Federal basis, of to the basis of numbers enlarged by the enumeration of all blacks in the next census, t

he political power of the country will pass into the hands of the South, aided, as it will be, by Northern alliances. 
<P>
The South claims that this will be the fact, and the North does not dispute it. -
<P>
It is assumed, on one side, that this alliance will necessarily be ruinous to the country, and, on the other, that it will be beneficial,  However that may be, the North is not prepared to risk the experiment.
