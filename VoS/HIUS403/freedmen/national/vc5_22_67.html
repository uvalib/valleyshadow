The negroes who are employed in 
loading the Mississippi Transportation 
Company's barge, at Vioksburg,
struck for higher wages a day or two
ago.  They were getting a dollar and a half a day, but
demanded two dollars.  The company, by
construction of a plank road, managed
to get drays up to the barge, and 
dispensed with the services of the negroes
altogether, saving thereby at least $50
a day.
