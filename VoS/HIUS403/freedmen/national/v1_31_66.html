This question is often asked now by our people 
and it is a serous one, so serious to us that it is 
painful to attempt to answer to it.  If President Johnson's
policy had been carried out by Congress, our Country,
the South, would have now been on
the high road to prosperity and some hope 
of repairing the devastation of war could be
entertained.  It has not been carried
out, but, has been opposed by the Radicals
with consumate ability and spite.  
<P>
When
the armies of the Confederacy surrendered
and our people accepted thepledges of Andres
Johnson and Gen. Grant, they expected to be 
restored to all the rights and privileges of citizens of the
United States, to  which they renewed their allegiance. --
They accepted, in good faith, the results 
of hte war; gave up slavery and were prepared
to work out the problem of free negro
lavor, as best they could....
<P>
The Jacobin Radicals, in Congress, are
doing their utmot to make a war of racss ;
their speeches and their voes show it.--
Negro suffrage is to be enforced ad the 
negro placed ont only on an equality, but
made superior to the white man.  When
the contest opens, as we hope it never
may, the "times" in the South will indicate
the extermination of the negro race. 
<P>
All this and the confiscation laws make the
times look very black, and we can see but
one hopeful sign and that is in the old
saying, that "the man who killed a dog
for spite never saw him buried...."
