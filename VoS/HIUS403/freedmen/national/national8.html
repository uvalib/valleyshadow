Savannah, Ga., September 7-A.A. Bradley, colored, lateley expelled from 
the Georgia Legislature, held a republican meeting this evening. He said 
Cliftand the other carpet-baggers and Yankees are not to be trusted, and 
advised the negroes not to trust to white people, especially Yankees, who 
were the meanest people on the earth. He doubted if even mulattos could 
be trusted.--The white blood in their veins might gain the mastery. He 
said the recent action of the Georgia Legislature in turning out the 
negroes would increase the majority for Grant. He first thought the negro 
members would draw revolvers assert there rights in blood, which would 
have beniffitted the Democrats. He was glad they had done otherwise. he 
thought the coming election, whichever way it went, would cause 
bloodshed. the whole was of a rambling, contradictory character, many 
hearers being doubtful which side was supported.--He spoke nearly the 
whole evening. About 500 were present. The meeting passed off quietly.
