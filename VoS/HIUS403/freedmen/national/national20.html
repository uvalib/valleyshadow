The Lincolnton, (N. C) "Courier" learns from a reliable source that 
freedmen are being shipped from various points of the Southern coast, 
ostensibly as free emigrants to Liberia, but in reality to be disposed of 
as slaves to Cuban planters.  A gentleman from near Columbia, S. C., a 
prominent leader during the war, purchased a few weeks ago in Cuba, where 
he has a plantation, one of his former slaves, who had been landed and 
sold by Boston shippers.
