The Freedmen--General Howard has issued the following cirdular: 
"Hereafter, and until further orders, no fees or charge will be exacted 
by officers of this bureau for services rendered in making contracts 
between freedmen and their employers, either in examination, witnessing, 
approving or registering the contravt, or otherwise. He requests 
assistant commissioners to instruct their subordinates to the above 
effect. He recommends written contracts in all cases, as verbal contracts 
create confusion. The bureau agents are urged to do all in their power to 
secure contracts for freedmen, and in tendering their services for this 
object they should let it be understood that, they will be rendered 
without charge to the parties concerned.
