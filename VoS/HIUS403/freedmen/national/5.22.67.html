At a meeting of the Freedmen at the Charlotte Court-House some days 
since, a Dr. J. P. Brown and others became dissatisfied at not receiving 
an appointment at the handsof the court, after swearing they were good 
Union men $c. Brown, appealed directly to the Freedmen, was replied to by 
a colored man, Ned Nelson, of unusual intelligence and respectability, 
who stated that during the war it seemed to them that all the white folks 
were of one way of thinking, all fighting or helping those who did, and 
that he was surprised to find so suddenly that so many more white 
gentlemen than he espected were opposed to the war, and that he believed 
a man who came out flatfooted and says he was for the war, when there is 
no profit or advantage in his saying so, and when I hear another one say 
he was<I> against</I> the war when the advantages are on the other side, 
I must suspect himinstantly, and while some were quarelling about their 
loyalty in connection  with petty offices of the county, he would not 
have one if given to him. He went on to say that he desired to see the 
offices of the County bestowed upon the most upright and sensible men in 
the county.
<P>
He touched upon general topics with comparative case and correctness and 
all were gratifiedat the sound views expressed by him. He was elected one 
of the delegates to the Hunnicut Convention.--<I>Correspondent Danville 
Times.</I>
<P>
The views expressed by Ned are applicable to all sections of the country 
and our freedmen would do well to imitate his example.
