The New York <I>World</I> but utters a historical truth when, discussing 
the negro question, it says:
<P>
"There is no example in history of free institutions among any of the 
colored races. Mexico and the South American republics tried the 
experiment of free institutions, originating with the Spanish race and 
admitting Indians and negroes to the suffrage; but these republics have 
been a constant scene of anarchy. . . and should serve as a warning, not 
an example. We suppose no Republican will care to cite the history of the 
cut-throat inhaitants of San Domingo. The negroes vote in Jamaica, and 
are a majority; but Jamaica is notoriously the worst government of all 
the British colonies, and the state of things there would be intolerable 
if the home government did not constantly exert its restraining 
authority. If the Republican policy is carried out, three years will not 
elapse before th horrors of San Domingo will be re-enacted in every part 
of the South.
