. . . Whatever opinions may have prevailed in the past in regard to 
African slavery or the right of a State to seceded from the Union, we 
believe we express almost the unanimous judgment of the Southern people 
when we declare that they consider that those questions were decided by 
the war, and that it is their intention in good faith to abide by that 
decision. At the close of the war, the Southern people lay down their 
arms and sought to resume their former relations with the United States 
Government. Through their State Conventions they abolished slavery and 
and annulled their ordinances of secession, and they returned to their 
peaceful pursuits with a sincere purpose to fulfill all their duties 
under the Constitution of the United States; which they had sworn to 
protect. . . 
<P>
The idea that the Southern people are hostile to the negroes, and would 
oppress them if it was in their power to do so, is entirely unfounded. 
They have grown up in our midst, and we have been accustomed from 
childhood to look upon them with kindness. the change in the relations of 
the two races has brought no change in our feelings towards them. They 
still constitute the important part of our laboring population. Without 
their labor the lands of the South would be comparatively unproductive. 
Without the employment which the Southern agriculture affords they would 
be destitute of the means of subsistence, and become papers, dependent on 
public bounty. Self interest, even if there were no higher motive, would, 
therefore prompt the whites of the South to exrtend the negroes care and 
protection.
<P>
The important fact that the two racesare, under existing circumstances, 
necessary to each other is gradually becoming apparent to both, and we 
believe that but for the influences exerted to stir up the passions of 
the negroes, the relations of the two races would soon adjust themselves 
on a bsis of mutual kindness and advantage.
<P>
It is true that the people of the South, together with the people of the 
North and, west are, for obvious reasons, opposed to any system of laws 
which will place the political power of the country in the hands of the 
negro race. But this opposition springs from no feeling of enmity, but 
from a deep-seated conviction that at present the negroes have neither 
the intelligence, nor other qualifications which are necessaryto amke 
them safe depositories of political power. They would inevitably become 
the victims of demagogues, who for selfish purposes would mislead them to 
the serious injury of the public. . .
