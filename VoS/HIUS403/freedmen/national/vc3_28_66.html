An old colored preacher at Port Gibson,
Mississippi, recently baptized thirty 
colored converts, and after the ceremony he
charged them a dollar a piece.  On the
following Sunday he only succeeded in 
inducing two to present themselves who
were willing to pay.  Becoming indignant
at the parsimony of his congregation he
refused to baptize the two candidates for
glory, saying he warn't gwine to slosh
hisseff up for no two dollars.
