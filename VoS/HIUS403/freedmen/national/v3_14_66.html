A negro sentenced to forty days 
confinement and labor with ball and chain, at 
Macon, was recently, allowed to ascent to
the second story of the prison, from which 
he threw himself down.  He struck on the
top of his head, and was, of course, 
unhurt.  In consideration of the feat he
received a free pardon.
