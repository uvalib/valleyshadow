President Johnson vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau bill on the 19th inst., 
which caused great excitement in Washington.  In his message, stating his 
objections to it, he takes strong Constitutional grounds.  In these days 
of mania for Constitutional amendments, it is exceedingly pleasant to 
hear some one in authority speak out boldly for the maintenance of the 
Constitution as it is, and the administration of the Government as the 
Constitution directs.  This President Johnson has done, and he will be 
sustained by all who desire the future welfare of the country.<P>

We give the following telegraphic synopsis of the message:
<P>

WASHINGTON, February 19--The President to-day transmitted a message to 
the Senate returning the amendatory Freedmen's Bureau bill, with his 
objections.  He argues that the measure is not in accordance with the 
Constitution, and states that, among its powers, the one establishing an 
agent in every county or parish in the United States where freedmen 
abound, would place the Executive unlimited patronage, which could be 
exercised for the purpose of attaining political ends, if the appointing 
power so willed it.  The veto message is quite lengthy and deals with the 
bill not only in its general character, but, entering into details, 
argues against the justice and legality of various provisions contained 
in it.  The President takes occasion to express his views on the subject 
of representation as essential to the success and good management of the 
government.  
He thinks that the representatives from those States 
immediately affected by the Freedmen's bill, should have been present in 
Congress when a measure so closely connected with their interests was 
being discussed, and says he holds it to be his duty to recommend in the 
interests of peace and in the interest of the Union, the admission of 
every State to its share in the public legislation.  However rebellious 
the people may have been, they present themselves not only in a loyal 
attitude, but with representatives whose loyalty cannot be questioned, 
under any existing constitutional or legal test.  
<P>
He concludes as 
follows:  In accordance with the Constitution, I now return to bill to 
the Senate, in the earnst hope that a measure involving questions and 
interests so important to the country, will not become a law, unless, 
upon deliberate consideration by the people, it should receive the 
sanction of an enlightened public judgement.
