Our Colored People
<P>
The Baltimore<I> Transcript</I> of November 22d expresses some sensible 
views on a subject heretofore commented on by the Valley<I> Virginian</I>. 
In speaking about the colored people it says:
<P>
"There are one or two matters apparently trivial, but really important, 
to which we beg to call the attention of the Southern employer. The 
colored race in this country have a fixed aversion to being called 
"negroes" and particularly "damn negroes." When we  devote a little 
reflection to this subject, it really seems a trifling point to haggle on 
a thing such as this. It is hardly worth any gentleman's or lady's while 
to hurt the feelings of a dependent. If, therefore, they prefer to be 
called "servants," or "colored people," for Heaven's sake, let them be 
styled! This appears to be a small matter, but those familiar with 
African peculiarities, know that it is one of considerable moment.
<P>
With regard to extending the right of suffrage to the colored 
population. They might as well know now, once for all, that the South is 
fixedly opposed to it, and will never yield except upon compulsion.
<P>
We are opposed to extending this franchise, 1st, because the North 
insolently, unconstitutionally, and unjustly endeavoring to force it upon 
us. It is our affair and not theirs. We are opposed to it, secondly, 
because we do not think that the colored race are fit to exercise the 
right of suffrage. Many of us believe that there are too many white men 
who are not fit to vote, and that allowing them to do so, has been 
demonstrated to be a profound mistake. This we are not willing to repeat 
on such an extended scale. There are some few colored men who 
undoubtedly have the requisite intelligence, but they must be the first 
to acknowledge that the great mass of their countrymen are utterly unfit 
for the exercise of this most important right.
<P>
If the South is compelled by the North to yield in this particular, 
intelligent colored men can readily understand that this privilege of 
voting, obtained by these means, will bring about the speedy ruin of 
their people. Then will commence the clash of races at the South. Rather 
than have a hostile population in their midst, the Southern proprietors 
of land, the employers, the employers of the colored race, will speedily 
obtain from abroad the requistite supply of labor, and the African will 
disappear from this continent as surely and suddenly as the Indian. The 
places that know him now will know him no more, and he will become a 
thing of the past, "a school boy's dream, the wonder of an hoar."
