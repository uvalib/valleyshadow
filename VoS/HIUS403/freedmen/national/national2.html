One of the Radical candidates for the Legislature in Choctaw county has a 
little boy about fourteen years old who fell in love and engaged himself 
to one of the neighboring girls. His father, learning the fact, hunted 
the young man up, give him a good whipping and sent him home. The little 
fellow started on his way crying and met one of the neighbors, who 
inquired what was the matter. The little fellow replied that his father 
had whipped him because he wanted to marry.
<P>
"Why, my son," said the neighbor, "I would not care for that--plenty of 
time in five years for you to marry."
<P>
"Yes, but I do," replied the little fellow, blubbering, "I have got a 
chance to marry a white galnow, and the way dad's going on I'll have to 
marry a nigger."
