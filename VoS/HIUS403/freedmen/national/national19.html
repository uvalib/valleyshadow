Somebody yesterday asked Fred. Douglass (black man) why he didn't go down 
South along with the rest of the Republican orators, to help enlighten 
the minds of the freedmen, as to their political duties, etc.<BR>
<P>
"Because," said Fred., I want to train alone.  I want to wait till those 
mean whites get through with their talk, and then I will begin.  I notice 
that in all the speeches that Wilson, Kelly, and the rest of them have 
been making to the colored folks at Richmond, Mobile, New Orleans and 
other places, nothing is ever said about giving the colored men a Vice 
President of their own color.  But they've got to make that concession to 
us, and that's just what I am going down South to tell our folks to 
insist upon."<BR>
<P>
"But Fred., do you think the Radical managers will accede to that 
arrangement?"<BR>
<P>
"I have no doubt of it all, sar; none at all.  Wendell Phillips and 
Horace Greeley say they are in favor of it, and what they say has got to 
be done.  They are the men who run the Republican party along with old 
Ben Butler, and whoever would run with that party must do what they say."<BR>
<P>
"But, do you think, if they nominate Grant for President, that Grant will 
consent to have a darkey on the same ticket as Vice?"<BR>
<P>
"Don't think anything about it, sar.  Grant only counts one.  It is not 
for Grant, nor any other man, to dictate to the people.  We are the 
people.  Grant is but one of our servants, sar.  If he doesn't like his 
company, let him resign.  Plenty of others, sar, ready to take his place; 
plenty of others, sar."<BR>
<P>
"But, even if they nominate a darkey for Vice President, what good will 
that do you or your race?"
<P>
"Don't talk, foolish child.  It will do us a heap of good.  In the first 
place, it will make a colored man presiding officer of the Senate, and 
then, as the President may die, he may be President of the United 
States.  That's my plan of reconstruction, sar; and until it is adopted 
and made successful, sar, the Union will never be restored, and the 
country will never have peace."<BR>
<P>
There were other queries about to be submitted to the distinguished man 
and brother, but just at this moment Reverend Doctor Cheever came along, 
and after introducing Fred. to a blushing damsel (who was hanging 
lovingly on his arm) the whole party vanished in the direction of the 
offices of the <I>Anti-Slavery Standard</I>--<I>Correspondence of 
Louisville Democrat</I>
