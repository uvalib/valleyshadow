The South Carolina Ledger, a weekly paper published in the interests of 
the colored people, was established in Charleston sometime last autumn by 
T. Hurley & Co.  In his last issue Mr. Hurley gives the following 
wholesome advice to the freedmen:<BR>
<P>
Cultivate by every means in your power the good opinion of your former 
master.  Remember that they have suffered much and been severely tried 
the past five years.  Bear in mind, too, that they have their prejudices 
and the prejudices of their fathers to contend against; and that, 
besides, they cannot, from their very circumstances, be expected to 
regard innovations in their midst in the same light that Northern 
Eutopians do.<BR>
<P>
But be patient.  Recollect that when the time does come--that whatever 
claims or privileges are granted you by them--will, in their practical 
bearings, be worth to you far more than all the recognitions of the 
North.  But anything suddenly forced upon the whites by any party hostile 
to the South--that you can never enjoy!  In the North itself the negro's 
steps have been but of gradual measurement.  We have heard some of your 
so-called friends say that nothing short of another revolution could save 
the cause; and you may be told by interested parties--vampires who feed 
on the "cause"--that, in the event of collision between yourselves and 
the whites--the North would stand by you.  They would insinuate that, now 
you know the use of the cartridge-box, you should insist immediately on 
the ballot-box.<BR>
<P>
Yes the red man dared assert his claim to the fair country the Great 
Spirit had given him, and these men's fathers speedily  "improved him off 
the face of the earth;" and their descendants to this day ignore the 
claims of the colored man, as in Connecticut and other States!  Out on 
the canting hypocrites!  Be not deceived by these men.  If a collision 
occurs the government would of course be compelled to see order observed; 
but shoudl a war of races ever ensue, the whites would joind the whites, 
and the blacks join the blacks.  Your most implacable enemies are to be 
found among the white soldiers.  Their hartred towards your race seems to 
grow in intensity from the very moment they enter the service.
