A telegram from Washington, says Gen. Howard, grand Head Centre of the 
Freedmen's Bureau, intends to stop issuing rations to the destitute  of 
the South, thus throwing the support of the indigent of both races on the 
local authorities. Very good, so far as it goes, but why not carry the 
idea to its logical conclusion and relieve us of the Bureau too? All most 
of them have to do is eat, issue rations, and make mischief.
