FREEDMEN'S BUREAU OFFICERS--It now appears that the President has not 
ordered the arrest of all the officers of the Bureau engaged in farming, 
speculating, &c., but only those in the State of North Carolina.  He has, 
it seems, ordered Major General Howard to cause the arrest of every 
officer of the Bureau in North Carolina who is engaged or pecuniarily 
interested in the cultivation of plantations, and Brigadier General W. E. 
Strong has been dispatched to execute the order.  Judge Advocate General 
Holt has been instructed by the President to make out charges and 
specifications against those officers, with a view to their trial before 
a court martial.  The Rev. Fitz, the "bloodhound of Zion," and autocrat 
of the Freedmen's village in North Carolina, is under arrest awaiting 
trial.  On the showing of Generals Steadman and Fullerton he ought to be 
hanged.--<I>Richmond Times</I>
