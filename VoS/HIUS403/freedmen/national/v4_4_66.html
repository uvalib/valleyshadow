Leading jorunals North and in Washington, 
fear that another civil war is near at hand.
They say if President Johnson refuses to 
carry out the provisions of the 
civil Rights bill, after it is passed
over his veto, the Radical Congress

question  that now agitates the Country, unless
somebody "backs down."
