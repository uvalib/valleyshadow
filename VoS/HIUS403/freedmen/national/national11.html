Genl's Steadman and Fullerton are now examining into the workings and 
management of the Freedmen's Bureau in some of the Southern States, and 
have made a report of their investigations in Virginia and North 
Carolina, a few extracts from which in reference to Virginia we give 
below.<BR>

VIRGINIA--WHY THE NEGROES NEED ASSISTANCE.
</B></CENTER>
<P>
After stating the nubmer of Bureau officers and employees in this State, 
with their salaries, and that nine thousand negroes were supplied with 
rations last December, ten thousand two hundred and sixty in January, and 
nine thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight in February, the report says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"A majority of the freedmen ro whom this subsistence has been furnished 
are undoubtedly able to earn a living if they were removed to localities 
where labor could be procured.  The necessity for issuing rations to this 
class of persons results from their accumulations in large numbers in 
certain places where the land is unproductive and the demand for labor is 
limited.  As long as these people remain in the present localities, the 
civil authorities refuse to provide  for the able-bodied, and are unable 
to care for the helpless and destitute among them, owing to their great 
number and the fact that very few are residents of the counties in which 
they have congregated during the war.   The necessity for the relief 
extended to these people,  both able-bodied and helpless, by the 
Goverment will continue as long as they remain in their present 
condition, and while rations are issued to the able-bodied they will not 
voluntarily change their localities to seek places where they can procure 
labor."<BR>

THE AGENTS
</B></CENTER>
<P>
It then goes on to state that when the affairs of the Bureau have been 
properly administered there has been no conflict between it and the 
citizens, and adds:<BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"But in many places where the agents are not men of capacity and 
integrity a very unsatisfactory condition of many things exists.  This 
offensive interference of the agents of the Bureau with the relations 
between the planters and their hired freedmen, causing vexatious delays 
in the prosecution of labor, and imposing expense and costs in suits 
before the authorities[?] about trivial matters that could readily be 
adjusted by the friendly advice of a sensible[?] man.  The effect 
produced by the action of this class of agents is bitterness and 
antagonism between the whites and freedmen, a growing prejudice against 
the government among the planters and expectations on the part of the 
freedmen that can never be realized.  Where there has been no such 
interference or bad advice given to the freedmen by the agents of the 
Bureau there is a growing feeling of kindness between the races and good 
order and harmony prevail.<BR>

SPECIMEN OF THE DECISIONS OF THE BUREAU
</B></CENTER>
<P>
"As an evidence of the manner in which this arbitrary power is exercised, 
we would state that an agent of the Bureau, presiding in Accomac county, 
decided a question of title to land as follows:  A colored man, who was 
freed twenty years ago by his master, and who was permitted through the 
kindness of his master to make his home on the plantation wherever he 
chose, set up a claim to ten acres thereof around a cabin in which he had 
lived for ten years.  The agent decided that the colored man had acquired 
title to the ten acres by adverse possession, and forbade the owners of 
the plantation from bringing the question again before his court, or any 
other court on pain of imprisonment.<BR>
<P><P>
<CENTER><B>
A NEGRO DIVORCE CASE
</B></CENTER>
<P>
"These agents exert the widest latitude  in the exercise of their 
judicial functions, trying questions involving title to real estate 
contracts, crimes and even actions affecting the marital relations.  We 
witnessed the trial of a divorce case before the sub-agent at 
Charlottesville.  The trial occupied about ten minutes, and resulted in a 
decree of divorce."<BR>
<P><P>
<CENTER><B>THE BUREAU NOT NEEDED</B></CENTER>
<P>
The report recommends that the services of the officers of the Bureau in 
Virginia be dispensed with, and that the duties be performed by the 
officers commanding the troops in the department, and state that the 
recognition of the civil rights of the freedmen, as evidenced by the 
changes made in the laws of Virginia, render the freedmen perfectly 
secure if left to the care of the law and the protections of the troops.<BR>
<P><P>

WHAT NEGROES LOOK TO THE BUREAU
</B></CENTER>
<P>
On the subject of the influence of the Bureau, the report says:<BR>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
"In our judgement the affect produced has depended wholly on the 
character of the officers.   Prudent and industrious freedmen rarely call 
upon the Bureau for advice or assistance.  It is the idle and worthless 
who look to it for support.  Among these, however, we do not mean to 
include the infirm and helpless.  The mass of the freedmen have an idea 
that the Bureau possesses some mysterious power to serve them, and that 
if they fail to secure such a livelihood as they desire they can fall 
back upon it with a certainty of support.  These ideas, it will be 
readily seen, lessen their efforts to procure employment and to support 
themselves and their families.  They also regard the existence of the 
Bureau as evidence that the Government looks upon the white people of the 
South as their enemies, which is calculated to excite suspicion and bad 
feeling on their part."<BR>

CONDUCT OF THE OFFICERS
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Commissioners commend Gen. Brown for "laboring faithfully and 
zealously to harmonize and protect the interests of both races" and 
conclude by stating that they made an investigation into the conduct of 
the officers of the Bureau in Virginia, outside of their official duties.
