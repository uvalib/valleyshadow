We learn from the Wilson "North Carolinian" that the negroes an Radicals 
of Nelson, Edgecombe and Nash counties held a large and enthusiastic mass 
meeting at Joyner's depot on Saturday last, and nominated Jerre Bullock, 
colored, to represent them in the convention.  Major Tatten, the 
notorious thief who was caught robbing the warehouse at Weldon, was one 
of the ruling spirits in the meeting.  The "Carolinian" says:<BR>
<P>
"The Congress of the United States was at a very dignified piece of 
business when it conferred the great boon of American suffrage on a race 
of people whose utter disregard of honor and principle allows them to 
endorse men of no character, and who acknowledge as their leader a known 
thief and scoundrel."
