We publish below an extract from the speech of Hon. D. W. Vorhees, 
delivered at Indianapolis, on 8th, giving his vies on the rights of the 
negro, &c., which must be taken as the views of the unprejudiced people 
in the north, and are in striking contrast to the fanaticism of Congress 
and its consequent result, as exemplified in the mongrel Conventions now 
in session in the Southern States. From the acts of these conventions, 
the truth of Mr. Vorhees' views must be  impressed upon the people of our 
entire country.
<P>
"Give the negro all his civil rights.--Give him security for life, 
liberty and property; and the laws and courts open and free for his 
protection. throw him on his own resources, abolish the Freedmen's 
Bureaus and make him eat his bread in the sweat of his own face. Reserve 
the entire political control of this Government to our own race. Strike 
the negro from the basis of representation. Let him be no longer in any 
shape or way an element of political power, and then he will cease to be 
the sport of desperate factions. He should neither vote, nor serve in 
Congress, nor be represented there by others. Two races cannot commingle 
in the civil affairs ofa government. the world bears unbroken testimony 
on this point from the days of Israeel in canaan to the wretched mongrel 
tribes of Mexico. Let the negro be an object of Christian philanthropy, 
and not a co-partner in the government. Then he will work out in peace 
and happiness the subordinate destiny for which he was created."
