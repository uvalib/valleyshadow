President Johnson yesterday sent the following message to the United 
States Senate.<BR>
<I>To the Senate of the United States:</I><BR>
<P>
I have examined with care the bill which originated in the Senate, and 
has been passed by the two Houses of Congress, to amend an act entitled 
"An act to establish a Bureau for the relief of Freedmen and Refugees, 
and for other purposes."  Having with much regret come to the conclusion 
that it would not be consistent with the public welfare to give my 
approval to the measure, I return the bill to the Senate with my 
objections to its becoming a law.  I might call to mind, in advance of 
these objections, that there is no immediate necessity for the propsed 
measure.  The act to establish a Bureau for the relief of freedmen and 
refugees, which was approved in the month of March last, has not yet 
expired.  It was thought stringent and extensive enough for the purpose 
in view in time of war.  Before it ceases to have effect, further 
experience may assist experience may assist to guide us to a wise 
conclusion as to the policy to be adopted in time of peace.  I share with 
Congress the strongest desire to secure to the freedmen the full 
enjoyment of their freedom and their prosperity, and their independence 
and equality in making contracts for their labor; but the bill before me 
contains provisions which in my opinion, are not warranted by the 
Constitution, and are not well suited to accomplish the end in view.  
The bill proposes to establish, by authority of Congress, military 
jurisdiction over all parts of the United States containing refugees and 
freedmen.  It would, by its nature, apply with most force to those parts 
of the United States in which the freedmen most abound,and it expressly 
extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the Freedmen's Bureau with 
greatly enlarged powers over those States in which the ordinary course of 
judicial proceedings has been interrupted by the rebellion.  The source 
from which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is no other than the 
President of the United States, acting through the War Department and the 
Commissioners of the Freedmen's Bureau.  The agents to carry out this 
military jurisdiction are to be selected either from the army or from 
civil life.  The country is to be divided into districts and 
sub-districts, and the number of salaried agents to be employed may be 
equal to the number of counties or parishes in all the United States 
where freedmen and refugees are to be found.  The subjects over which 
this military jurisdiction is to extend in every part of the United 
States includes protection to all employees, agents and officers of this 
Bureau in the exercise of the duties imposed upon them by the bill.  In 
eleven States it is further to extend over all cases affecting freedmen 
and refugees, discriminating against by local law, custom or prejudice.  
In those eleven States the bill subjects any white person who may be 
charged with depriving a freedman of any civil rights or immunities 
belonging to white persons, to imprisonment or fine, or both; without, 
however, defining the civil rights and immunities which are thus to be 
secured to the freedmen by military law.  This military jurisdiction also 
extends to all questions that may arise respecting contracts.  The agent 
who is thus to exercise the office of a military judge, many be a 
stranger, entirely ignorant of the laws of the place, and exposed to the 
errors of judgement to which all men are liable.  The exerise of power 
over which there is no legal supervision, by so vast a number of agents 
as is contemplated by the bill, by the very nature of men, must be 
attended by acts of caprice, injustice, and passion.<BR>
<P>
The trials having their origin under this bill are to take place without 
the intervention of jury, and without any fixed rules of law or 
evidence.  The rules on which offenses are to be heard and determined by 
the numerous agents are such rules and regulations as the President, 
through the War Department, shall prescribe.  No previous presentment is 
required nor any indictment charging the commission of a crime against 
the laws, but the trial must proceed on charges and specifications.  The 
punishment will be not what the law declares, but such as a court-martial 
may think proper, and from these arbitrary tribunals there lies no 
appeal, no writ of error to any of the courts, in which the Constitution 
of the United States vests exclusively the judicial power of the 
country.  While the territory and the classes of actions and offences 
that are made subject to this measure are so extensive, the bill itself, 
should it become a law, will have no limitation in point of time, and 
will form a part of the permanent legislation of the country.<BR>
<P>
I cannot reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this kind with 
the words of the Constitution which declare that "No person shall be held 
to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a 
presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the 
land and naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in the 
time of war or public danger," and that "in all criminal prosecutions, 
the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an 
impartial jury of State or district wherein the crime shall have been 
committed."  The safeguards which the experience and wisdom of ages 
taught our fathers to establish as securities for the protection of the 
innocent, the punishment of the guilty, and the equal administration of 
justice, are to be set aside; and for the sake of a more vigorous 
interposition in behalf of justice, we are to take the risk of the many 
acts of injustice that would necessarily follow from an almost countless 
number of agents established in every parish or county in nearly a third 
of the States of the Union, over whose decisions there is to be no 
supervision or control by the Federal courts.  The power that would thus 
be placed in the hands of the President is such as, in time of peace, 
certainly ought never to be extended to any one man.<BR>
<P>
If it be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal within a State is 
warranted as a measure of war, the question immediately presents itself 
whether we are still engaged in war?  Let us not unnecessarily disturb 
the commerce, credit and industry of the country, by declaring to the 
American people and to the world that the United States are still in a 
condition of civil war.  At present there is no part of our country in 
which the authority of the United States is disputed.  Offences that may 
be committed by individuals should not work a forfeiture of the rights of 
whole communities.  The country has returned and is returning to a state 
of peace and industry, and the rebellion is, in fact, at an end.  The 
measure, therefore, seems to be as inconsistent with the actual condition 
of the country as it is at variance with the Constitution of the United 
States.<BR>
<P>
If passing from general considerations we examine the bill in detail, it 
is open to weighty objections.  In time of war it was eminently proper 
that we should provide for those who were passing suddenly from a 
condition of bondage to a state of freedom; but this bill proposes to 
make the Freedmen's Bureau, established by the act of 1865, as one of the 
many great and extraordinary military measures to suppress a formidable 
rebellion, a permanent branch of the public administration, with its 
powers greatly enlarged.  I have no reason to suppose, and I do not 
understand it to be alleged, that the act of March, 1865, has proved 
deficient for the purpose for which it was passed, although at that time, 
and for a considerable period thereafter, the Government of the United 
States remained unacknowledged in most of the States whose inhabitants 
had been involved in the rebellion.  The institution of slavery for the 
military destruction of which the Freedmen's Bureau was called into 
existence as an auxiliary throughout the whole country by an amendment of 
the Constitution of the United States, and practically, its eradication 
has received the assent and concurrence of most of those States in which 
it at any time had an existence.  I am not, therefore, able to discern 
in the condition of the country anything to justify an apprehension that 
the powers and agencies of the Freedmen's Bureau, which were effective 
for the protection of freedmen and refugees during the actual continuance 
of hostilities and of African servitude, will now, in the dawn of peace, 
and after the abolition of slavery, prove inadequate to the same proper 
ends.  If I am correct in these views, there can be no necessity for the 
enlargement of the powers of the Bureau for which provision is made in 
the bill.<BR>
<P>
The third section of the bill authorizes a general and unlimited grant of 
support to the destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, their wives 
& children.  Succeeding sections make provisions for the rent or purchase 
of landed estates for freedmen, & for the erection for their benefit of 
suitable buildings for asylums and schools, the expenses to be defrayed 
from the Treasury of the whole people.  The Congress of the United States 
has never heretofore thought itself empowered to establish asylums beyond 
the limits of the District of Columbia, except for the benefit of our 
disabled soldiers and sailors.  It has never founded such schools for any 
class of our own people, not even for the orphans of those who have 
fallen in the defence of the Union, but has left the care of education to 
the much more competent and efficient control of the States, of 
communities, of private associations and individuals.  It has never 
deemed itself authorized to expend the public money for the rent or 
purchase of rooms for thousands, not to say millions, of the white race 
who are honestly toiling from day to day for their subsistence.  Asylums 
for the support of indigent persons in the United States was never 
contemplated by the authors of the Constitution.  Nor can any good reason 
be adduced why a permanent establishment should be founded for one class 
of our people more than another.  Pending the war, many refugees and 
freedmen received support from the Government, but it was never intended 
they should henceforth be fed, clothed,educated, and sheltered by the 
United States.  The idea on which the slaves were assisted to freedom was 
that on becoming free they would be a self-sustaining population.  Any 
legislation that shall imply that they are expected to attain a 
self-sustaining condition, must have a tendency injurious alike to their 
character and their prospects.  The appointment of an agent for every 
county and parish will create an immense patronage, and the expense of 
the numerous officers and their clerks, to be appointed by the President, 
will be great in the beginning, with a tendency steadily to increase.  
The appropriations asked by the Freedmen's Bureau, as now established, 
for the year 1866, amount to $17,745,000.  It may be safely estimated that 
the cost to be incurred under the pending bill will require double that 
amount, more than the entire sum expended in any one year under 
Administration of the second Adams.  If the presence of agents in every 
parish and county is to be considered as a war measure, opposition,or 
even resistance might be provoked, so that to give effect to their 
jurisdiction, troops would have to be stationed within reach of every one 
of them, and thus, a large standing force would be rendered necessary.  
Large appropriations would, therefore, be required to sustain and enforce 
military jurisdiction in every county or parish from the Potomac to the 
Rio Grande.  The condition of our fiscal affairs is encouraging, but in 
order to sustain the present measure of public confidence, it is 
necessary we practice, not merely customary economy, but, as far as 
possible, severe retrenchment.<BR>
<P>
In addition to the objections already stated, the fifth section of the 
bill proposes to take away land from its former owners without any legal 
proceedings being first had, contrary to that provision of the 
Constitution which declares that no person shall be deprived of life, 
liberty, or property without due process of law.  It does not appear thta 
a part of the lands to which this section refers may not be owned by 
minors or persons of unsound mind, or by those who have been faithful to 
all their obligations as citizens of the United States.  If any portion 
of the land is held by such persons, it is not competent for any 
authority to deprive them of it.  If, on the other had, it be found that 
the property is liable to confiscation, even then it cannot be 
appropriated to purposes until, by due process of law, it shall have been 
declared forfeited by the Government.  There is still further objection 
to the bill on grounds seriously affecting the class of persons to whom 
it is designed to bring relief; it will tend to keep the mind of the 
freedmen in a state of uncertain expectation and restlessness, while to 
those among whom he lives it will be a source of constant and vague 
apprehension.  Undoubtedly the freedmen should be protected, but he 
should be protected by the civil authorities, especially by the exercise 
of all the Constitutional powers of the courts of the United States and 
of the States.  His condition is not so exposed as may at first be 
imagined.  He is in a portion of the country where his labor cannot well 
be spared.  Competition for his services from planters, those who are 
constructing or repairing railroads, and from capitalists in his vicinage 
or from other States, will enable him to command almost his own terms.  
He also possesses a perfect right to change his place of abode, and if, 
therefore, he does not find in one community of State a mode of life 
suited to his desires, or proper remuneration for his labor he can move to 
one where that labor is more esteemed and better rewarded. In truth, 
however, each State, induced by its own wants and interests, will do what 
is necessary and proper to retain within its borders all the labor that 
is needed for the development of its resources.  The laws that regulate, 
supply and demand, will maintain their force, and the wages of the 
laborere will be regulated thereby.  There is no danger that the 
exceedingly great demand for labor will not operate in favor of the 
laborer, neither is sufficient consideration given to the ability of the 
freedmen to believe that as they have received their freedom with 
moderation and forbearance, so they will distinguish themselves by their 
industry and thrift, and soon show the world that in a condition of 
freedom they are self-sustaining, capable of selecting their own 
employments and their own places of abode, of insisting for themselves on 
a proper remuneration, and of establishing and maintaining their own 
asylums and schools.  It is earnestly hoped that instead of wasting away 
they will by their own efforts, establish for themselves a condition of 
respectability and prosperity.  It is certain that they can attain to 
that condition only through their own merits and exertions.<BR>
<P>
In this connection, the query presents itself, whether the system 
proposed by the bill will not,when put into complete operation, 
practically transfer the entire care, support and control of four 
millions of emancipated slaves to agents, overseers, or task-masters, 
who, appointed at Washington,are to be located in every county and parish 
thoughout the United States containing freedmen and refugees?  Such a 
system would inevitably tend to a concentration of power in the Executive 
which would enable him, if so disposed, to control the action of this 
numerous class, and, use them for the attainment of his own political 
ends. I cannot but add another very grave objection to this bill.  The 
Constitution imperitively declares, in connection with taxation, that 
each State shall have at least one Representative, and fixes the rule for 
the number to which in future times each State shall be entitled.  It 
also provides that the Senate of the United States shall be composed of 
two Senators from each State, and adds, with peculiar force, that no 
State without its consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the 
Senate.  The original act was necessarily passed in the absence of the 
States chiefly to be affected, because their people were then 
contumaciously engaged in the rebellion.  Now the case is changed, and 
some at least of the States are attending Congress by loyal 
Representatives, soliciting the allowance ofthe constitutional right of 
representation.  At the time, however, of the consideration and the 
passing of this bill there was not Senator or Representative in Congress 
from the eleven States which are to be mainly effected by its 
provisions.  The very fact that reports were and are made against the 
good disposition of the country is an additional reason why they need and 
should have representatives of their own in Congress to explain their 
condition, reply to accusations, and assist by their local knowledge in 
the perfecting of measures immediately affecting themselves.  While the 
liberty of deliberation would then be free, and Congress would have full 
power to decide according to its judgement, there could be no objection 
urged that the States most interested had not been permitted to be 
heard.  The principle is firmly fixed in the minds of the American people 
that there should be no taxation without representation.  Great burdens 
have had to been borne by all the country
