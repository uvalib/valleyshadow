1.  The following portion of an act, entitled "An act relative to the 
testimony of colored persons," passed February 28th, 1866, by the 
Legislature of Virginia, is published for the information of the officers 
and agents of this bureau.<P>

"Be it enacted by the General Assembly,<P>

That colored persons and Indians shall, if otherwise competent, and 
subject to the rules applicable to other persons, be admitted witnesses 
in the following cases:"<P>
<CENTER>*     *     *     *     *     *     *</CENTER>
2.  "In all criminal cases and proceedings at law or in equity, in which 
a colored person or Indian is a party, or which arise out of an injury 
done, attempted, or threatened to the person, property or rights or a 
colored person or Indian, or in which it is alleged in the presentment, 
information or indictment, or in which the court is of opinion, from the 
other evidence, that there is probably cause to believe that the offence 
was committed by a white person in conjunction or co-operation with a 
colored person or Indian."<P>

Also, the following portion of "An act to amend and re-enact the ninth 
section of chapter one hundred and three of the Code of Virginia of 
1860,"&c.:<P>

"Be it enacted by the General Assembly,<P>
That any person having one-fourth or more of negro blood, shall be deemed 
a colored person, and every person not a colored person, having 
one-fourth or more of Indian blood, shall be deemed an Indian.<P>

"All laws in respect to crimes and punishments, and in respect to 
criminal proceedings, applicable to white persons, shall apply in like 
manner to colored persons, and to Indians, unless when it is otherwise 
specifically provided."<P>

II.  From and after the reception of this order, until further orders, no 
criminal cases will be tried by any officer or agent of the bureau, in 
this State, except such as may at that time have been commenced.<P>

III.  It will henceforth be the duty of the Assistant Superintendents to 
attend, in person, the trials of all criminal cases within their 
jurisdiction, including criminal trials or preliminary hearings before 
justices of the peace or other magistrates, to which a colored person may 
be a party, or in which, according to the law above quoted, the testimony 
of a colored person may be taken.<P>

IV.  When present at such trials or hearings, the Assistant 
Superintendents will not interfere at the time with the action of the 
court or magistrate, but will confine themselves to such friendly 
suggestions made to a colored party concerned, or the counsel for the 
same, as may be necessary.  They will not act as attorneys in such cases, 
or argue with the court or magistrate.  They will, however, make 
immediate report of any instance of oppression or injustice against a 
colored party, whether prosecutor or defendant, and also in case the 
evidence of colored persons should be improperly rejected or neglected.  
In such cases, all details possible will be forwarded.<P>

V.  They will also carefully examine and report if any instance a justice 
of the peace, attorney for the Commonwealth, grand jury, or other 
authority vested with the power of allowing or regulating the institution 
of criminal proceedings, has refused justice to a colored person by 
improperly neglecting a complaint, or declining to receive an oath or 
sworn information tendered by such person, whereby trial or prosecution 
might be prevented through partiality or prejudice.<P>

VI.  All Superintendents and Assistant Superintendents will, on the last 
day of each month, make a detailed report of the manner in which this 
order, by restoring to the State authorities jurisdiction in criminal 
cases over colored persons, has resulted, with reference to the intrests 
of the latter, within their respective districts and sub-districts, 
whether they have been treated with impartiality and fairness, and the 
law respecting their testimony carried out in good faith or otherwise.<P>
