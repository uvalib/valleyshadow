A Radical Estimate--General O.O. Howard, Commissioner of the Freedmen's 
Bureau, in a letter addressed to General O. Brown, Assistant Commissioner 
for Virginia alleged that the total cost of the Freedmen's Bureau from 
its formation to August 1, 1868, has only been $7,935,258.88.--By an act 
of Congress passed in July last, the operations of this Bureau are to be 
withdrawn from all the states on the first of January next.
