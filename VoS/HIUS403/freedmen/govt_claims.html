Claims against the government included personal property, crops, 
livestock, and just about anything else that the U.S. army could use 
while camped in Staunton.  From the dates of the claims submitted to the 
Bureau, it is evident that claimants could wait many years to be 
reimbursed.  Many claims were sent to the Bureau, apparently because it 
was a local arm of the federal government that seemed more accessible 
than sending a claim to a faceless official in Washington.  Despite its 
proximity, claimants would discover, the Bureau had no power to aid local 
citizens in recouping their losses.<BR>
