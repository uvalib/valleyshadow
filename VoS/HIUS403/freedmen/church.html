The Bureau took a role in arranging for churches to 
be built, and for space to be used by the freedmen. Whites resisted sharing 
their churches with the freedmen, and Captain Jackson repeatedly noted 
that sentiment was very strong against the freedmen. In this letter, 
Jackson request a white church to allow their property to be used for 
services by the freedmen, and  <A

that no demonstrations will be made interfering with the peace."</A>

The Bureau also helped establish churches where none had previously 
existed. Often these churches would bbe built in conjunction with 
schools, which the Bureau also took a role in establishing. Some funds were 
appropriated by the Bureau itself; some 
were solicited by the Bureau from Northern aid societys on the Freedmen's 
behalf, and others were raised by the Freedmen themselves. One church was 
erected in Staunton by the freedmen <A HREF="local/9.26.66.html">using 
primarily their own funds</A>. The Bureau records 
contain much information of one church which the Bureau in Staunton
helped to build in Waynesboro. The Bureau provided funding, aided in 
acquiring land, and helped in its 
dedication.This <A
