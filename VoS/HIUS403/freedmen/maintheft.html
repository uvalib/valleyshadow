When the Freedmen's Bureau was first established, one of its primary 
goals was to assist both black and white citizens in recovering property 
lost or stolen during the war.  With both Union and Confederate armies
roaming Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during four years of war, much of 
the valley's inhabitants either had land destroyed or had property stolen. 
During the war, horses were a favorite target for both Union 
and Confederate cavalry and artillery units. With local authorites lacking 
the will and 
ablity to resolve cases involving thefts which had occured during the war, 
the Freedmen's Bureau attemped to pick up the slack. Captain Jackson of the 
Staunton Freedmen's Bureau received letters from both black and white residents 
concerning the recovery of stolen property, especially horses. In one 
letter Captain Jackson writes Captain McDonnell of the Bureau's Winchester 
office detailing that he had received a letter from a black resident, 
Hiam Thompson of Augusta County, stating that his horse 
<A HREF="horse1.html">"was stolen from his stable during the war, by a 
Lieut. Hunter" of the Conferderate Army.</A> Jackon continues to inform 
McDonnell that Thompson knows that his horse is still alive and is 
residing with Hunter near Leesburg, Virginia. As is typically the case, 
it is not known if the Mr. Thompson ever recovered his horse.

Another issue which plagued victims' ability to recover stolen goods 
was that local officials did very little to help citizens. In 
multiple letters from Agent McDonnell in Winchester, to Agent 
Jackson, McDonnell enquires how the condition is concerning <A 
HREF="repeat.html"> "full justice 
being given to freedpeople by the civil courts." </A> 
An example of this problem can bee seen in a letter written by Staunton 
resident P.F. Earmary, who wrote to the Bureau saying that he 
was having trouble presuading the local authorites to address the 
increasing problem of theft which was plaguing the county. In his 
letter, Earmary sees this crime as "being intolorable" and even mentions 
that  
<A HREF="theft1.html">some local men were forming their own protection 
posses to protect their property.</A> Earmary also mentions in the letter to 
Jackson that he 
did not even know that there was a Freedmen's Bureau in Staunton or he would 
not 
have originally written to General Schofield in Richmond.  Schofield then 
informed 
Jackson of this matter and Jackson wrote to Earmany asking for more 
information concerning the thefts and the situation. The fact that Earmary 
wrote to Schofield and did not even know that there was a Bureau 
office in Staunton, shows that obviously the Bureau office in Staunton 
was not known to exsist by everybody in the area. 
<P>
Although we know that none of the thefts reported to the Freedmen's 
Bureau were prossessed in court we do know that at least one case 
involving theft during the war might have been brought to court.  In a 
letter from Thomas Jackson to Capt J. L. H. Hall, Military Commisionner 
in Woodstock Virginia, Jackson informs Hall that it is likely that 
Alexander Curry, <A HREF="theft2.html">an accused horse thief, will be in 
court</A> in Montery, Virginia. Curry, already had been indited in Highland 
County on another charge. This success was rare in Augusta. No records in 
the Agusta County Court House show any evidence that cases involving 
theft and freedmen were tried in court.
