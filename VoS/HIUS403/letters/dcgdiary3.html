<B>July 1st:</B>Leave Jarrett's Station and March nearly all day until we 
encamp for the night.  Within about 2 miles of Dinwiddie, C.H.
<br></br>
<b>July 2nd:</b>March to within 2 miles of Reams Station on the 
Petersburg&Weldon R.R. marching about all day.  Encamp there that night.
<br></br>  
<b>July 3rd:</b></br>Lie in camp all day.  Grateful rest!
<br></br>  
<b>July 4th, 5th, & 6th:</b>  Was put on Provost Guard duty today.  This 
"guard" was over prisoners, etc., termporarily.  My horse got badly 
chocked-thought he was dying for awhile.  He came around all right.
<br></br>  
<b>July 7th-27th:</b>In camp in woods near Petersburg.  Very hot.  But 
little to eat for man or horse.  Feed so scarce we waded a swamp near by 
and cut grass for our poor horses.  They even barked pine trees so 
famished were they.  Our fare was "hard(very hard)tack"-crackers which we 
cooked in grease from fat pork.  I went into Petersburgh one day and 
found 1/4 lb. of pepper!  Quite a find.  It cost me $2.50 for the 1/4lb., 
but it was worth it.  We used it to "season the hard tack and grease.  
With the pepper, it gave some tang to it and of course, pep too.
<br></br>  
<b>July 28th(1864):</b>"Boots and Saddles" was blown by the bugler at 
10:11 p.m. and we hurriedly moved out of camp and through Petersburg in 
the night and crossed James River on Pontoon bridges back again to the 
north side, and in the sultry heat and fearful dust of thousands of 
horses, we went into Camp about 6 miles below Richmond and remained there 
that night. (29th)
<br></br>  
<b>July 30th:</B>March down the Charles City Road a couple of miles.  
Halt in the hot sun a long time.  I buy a real loaf of bread and prize it 
highly, for I was really sick today.  Went back to our Artillery Camp for 
the night
