<P>This team will build a web site around the letters and diaries of the
Civil War from Augusta and Franklin Co.s Recetnly, Civil War scholars,
such as James McPherson, and popular historians, such as Ken Burns, have
used letters to tell the story of the Civil War. McPherson uses letters
to explain "what they fought for," while Burns uses letters selectively
at key points in his films to describe a battle or make a point about the
conduct of the war. This project will examine letters and diaries from
a different perspective and to a different purpose. Questions to consider:
to what extent were soldiers on the battlefield part of the community at
home, did the themes of letters change over time in the course of the war,
what were citizens at home writing to each other, what do diaries tell
us that letters do not. Most of all this team will find new questions as
the project develops. The team will consider soldier's letters as well
as letters from the home front to soldiers or to other home front civilians.
The team will conduct research at any archive that holds letters of the
Civil War from Augusta or Franklin residents or about Staunton or Chambersburg.
The team will need to consider how best to structure the site, whether
to build a database of letter writers, and what kinds of images to include.
