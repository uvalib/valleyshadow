The <a href="themes.html"> central 
issues </a> of home and family, military life, and spirituality 
resonate throughout the letters and diaries of both soldiers and civilians 
from Augusta County, Virginia and Franklin County, Pennsylvania in the years 
1861 through 1865. Although these common themes echo throughout the three genres 
of Civil War writings, the purpose varied, often dictated by the intended 
audience. Letters published in <a 
href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/vshadow2/cwnewspapers.html">local 
newspapers</a> had a large, public audience. 
On the other hand, <a 
href="lettersdiaries.html">personal 
letters and diaries</a> had a much more private 
and intimate audience. The audiences of the different genres of Civil War 
writings varied, but one fact remains consistent. The newspaper letters, 
personal letters, and personal diaries of Augusta and Franklin County all 
reflect the intense struggle for individuals to maintain a familiarity with 
home and family in a time of war. 

<P>

The<I> Pennsylvania Daily Telegraph</I> (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) published 
several letters written by officers of the 107<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsylvania 
Regiment, the 158<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsylvania Regiment, and the 
201<SUP>st</SUP> Pennsylvania Regiment from 1861 to 1865. The letters published in the <I>Telegraph</I> 
express the common themes of <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/FN0005.html">military 
service</a>, <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/FN0002.html">spirituality</a>, 
and <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/FN0007.html">home 
and 
family </A>. In addition to these reappearing themes, military men utilized 
the 
press to express their <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/FN0004.html">political 
and ideological opinions</a> about the war to 
the public. These opinions, however, rarely found a place in the personal 
letters and diaries of the soldiers from Augusta and Franklin County. 
Take for example the comments made by <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/FN0000.html">Captain 
William 
Tell Barnitz</a> of the 158<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsylvania Regiment, Company E

Since Beauregard'’s proclamation, exhorting his hosts to call all Union 
men Abolitionists, his allies in the North, seeing that thus they could 
deceive the masses and array them against the Government, spreading 
discontent and sowing disaffection broadcast, took up the cry, and every 
true patriot – every one who dared to raise his voice in behalf of the 
Government – everyone who favored the vigorous prosecution of the war, 
the confiscation of rebel property, or the subjugation of the rebels, the 
only possible means of crushing the rebellion – was trumpeted forth an 
Abolitionist and execrated as an enemy to liberty. Indeed so utterly 
blinded were many of the followers – so utterly and hellishly belied, 
betrayed and deceived – that they would have seen our armies annihilated, 
and rejoiced, and would have thrown themselves in the way for that 
arch-traitor Jeff Davis, to ride over in his triumphal entry to our Capitol. 
But, thank God, the film has fallen from their eyes in good time, the
bubble of treachery and deceit has burst, and clearer brighter skies glow 
around us… Let the fires of liberty, rekindled, be kept steadily burning; let that patriotic association, the Union League, be established in every city, town and township throughout the North.

<P>In addition to political opinions, military men wrote long detailed 
accounts of military engagements.  Take for example the letter written 
to the editor of the <I>Pennsylvania Daily Telegraph</I> on June 16, 
1862  by <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/FN0007.html"> 
Lieutenant J.A.C.</a>
 of the 107<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsylvania, Company E.

On Sabbath morning, June 1<SUP>st</SUP>, our brigade (Gen. Duryea’s)
composed of the 107<SUP>th</SUP> Penn’a. regiment, New York 105<SUP>th</SUP>,
104<SUP>th</SUP>, and 97<SUP>th</SUP>, made a charge through Front Royal, 
double quick through mud ankle deep amidst the booming of cannon. On making 
a charge of over five miles up the south branch of the Shenandoah we found 
that Gen. Shields’ artillery had a very heavy skirmish with the retreating 
portion of Jackson’s army. The 107<SUP>th</SUP> is on the right of our 
brigade, and the men acquitted themselves with great credit to themselves 
and the great State they represent.

<P>

The letters in the <I>Telegraph</I>, informed the public of military 
victories and military opinions, but they never ceased to remind the 
public of the soldiers constant struggle to return to his home, 
friends, 
and family. Lieutenant J.A.C. concluded the same letter quoted above by 
saying, "My prayer is, God will protect them and all of us in this noble 
cause, and restore peace to the country, and that we may return to our 
loved homes and enjoy the benefits of a free and happy people."

<P>

Personal letters and diaries were addressed to a much more private and 
intimate audience. The overall intimacy of these letters reflects the 
intense struggle for individuals to <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0321.html">maintain a 
familiarity with home and 
family</a> in a time of war. Men tended to shy away from <a 
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0319.html">bloody 
accounts</a> of 
battle in their letters. Moreover, recounting bloody battles in detail 
threatened to cut the ties with home and brought Augusta and Franklin 
County men into a realm of unfamiliarity. In order to maintain a
connection with home, family, and friends, Augusta and Franklin men wrote 
about familiar aspects of their lives with those at home. For instance, in 
the letters addressed to <A 
HREF="Miller.html">George 
Miller</a> of York County, Pennsylvania, the 
letter writers repeatedly talk about rabbit trapping, hunting, and 
fishing.  Take for example the letter written to George Miller by his 
brother John J. Miller of the 76<sup>th</sup> Pennsylvania Regiment on 
<a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/F0134.html">September 3, 
1862</a>.

<FONT SIZE=2>…we caught about five barrels of fish the first haul in about two hours. We had as many as the whole Regt wanted. The fish resembles a large heron and some Cat fish. We mostly catch the cat fish with hook and line. I cannot content myself 
fishing down here. I would like to get alongside the Godwins once again.

Augusta and Franklin men consistently evoked images and thoughts of home 
like the one above when describing their experiences in the field.  In 
contrast to the letters published in newspapers and intended for public 
view, the familiarities of home helped men at the front maintain a 
connection with their family and friends at home.
