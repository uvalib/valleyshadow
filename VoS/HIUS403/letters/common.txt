Common problems and solutions

1.  When I use WS_FTP to connect to xxxxxx, I get connected
    ok, as well as logged in, but the list box for the remote
    side remains blank.  In the status window the last thing
    i see is "DoDirList returned 4".

    Answer:  Change your MTU setting in your network stack
    to 576.

2.  When I use WS_FTP to connect to xxxxxx, I get connected
    ok as well as logged in, but the list box for the remote
    side remains blank or contains garbage.

    Answer:  Go to Options -> Session Options and change the
    host type.  Try "UNIX (standard)", "Sun Solaris", 
    "WinQVT/Net", "Ipswitch" and THEN any other types that
    may seem to be correct.

3.  When I use WS_FTP to connect to "ftp.uwp.edu" the host
    dialog boxes are not filled in correctly. 

    Answer:  Set the host type to WinQVT/Net  ** OR ** start
    your e-mail address with a hypen (-).  This is set in
    the Options -> Program Options screen.

4.  When I use WS_FTP32 to connect to a site, it gives me
    a "write error" when attempting to retrieve the directory
    listing.

    ANSWER:  Open a DOS window and enter "set".  Then create
    the directory specified by your TMP and TEMP environment
    variables.

5.  WS_FTP only returns NNNNN bytes of a file and can never
    retrieve the whole file.

    ANSWER:  Set your MTU in your program stack to 576.

6.  WS_FTP does not always return a complete file and leaves
    off from 50 to 512 bytes.

    ANSWER:  Trumpet Winsock 2.1d has a problem.  Get 2.1e.

7.  WS_FTP can only connect to the WS_FTP site and nothing
    else.

    ANSWER:  Configure your name server in your stack.  Talk
    to your internet provider for the proper values for DNS.

8.  WS_FTP32 won't run on Windows 95.

    ANSWER:  Use the built in Microsoft TCP/IP stack that
    comes with Windows 95.  You can NOT run a 32 bit network
    application on a 16 bit network stack on a 32 bit 
    operating system.  (At least until someone comes up with
    a new WSOCk32.DLL).

9.  How can I transfer directory structures?

    ANSWER:  Use WS_FTP32 95.07.05 or later.

10. How can I transfer multiple files?

    ANSWER:  Use the CTRL key with the left mouse button and
    select the files you want to transfer.  Then click the
    proper transfer arrow.

11. How can I transfer a file that contains special characters
    or is hidden?

    ANSWER:  Click the transfer arrow when NO file is selected
    and you will be prompted for the file name to retrieve.

12. Why don't you add the ability to retry a connection when
    it is busy?

    ANSWER:  It already has that ability.  Look for "retries"
    in the Advanced Connect dialog.

13. Why are files corrupted after transfer?

    ANSWER:  Make sure you transfer TEXT files in Text mode
    and MOST other files in BINARY mode.  If you still have
    problems, verify that you have hardware flow control 
    enabled on your modem.  If you have NetCom stack, turn
    in a bug report to NetCom.  If you have Trumpet 2.1d,
    update to 2.1e or drop back to 2.0b.

14. How do I transfer files from the command line?

    ANSWER: Please read the WS_FTP.TXT file that comes INSIDE
    the ZIP file.  It contains the command line info.


15. How can I change to a hidden directory?

    ANSWER: Click the right mouse button and select "FTP 
    Commands" and then select "CWD".  You can then manually
    enter a directory name to get to.

16. Where can I get the latest version?

--> http://www.csra.net/junodj/
    ftp://ftp.coast.net/SimTel/win3/winsock/ws_ftp.zip
    ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu/pub/pc/win3/winsock/ws_ftp.zip


MTU settings in the stack are the most common problems.  You
probably need to talk to your internet provider to get the 
proper setting (or read the excellent message from "Albert
P. Belle Isle" <belleisl@ultranet.com>).  You can try 576
as it seems to be a common proper value.  Another common
value is 552.
