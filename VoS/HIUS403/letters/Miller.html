The letters in the Miller Collection are addressed to George Miller of 
York County, Pennsylvania from his friends and family.  Although these 
letters were not written by Franklin County men, the authors, who 
resided in York County, Pennsylvania,  fought and lived side by 
side with Franklin County men in their respective 
regiments.  The letters addressed to George Miller by his brothers, 
cousins, and friends offer a glimpse into the Civil War soldier's life.  

<p>

The collection consists largely of the letters of John J. Miller, a 
private in 
the Seventy-Sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers.  John J. Miller was mustered into 
the regiment, known as the Keystone Zouaves, on October 16, 1861 as a 
private.  He served with the Seventy-Sixth until his death 
on November 14, 1863 in Richmond.  John Miller's letters to his brother, 
George, repeatedly discuss camp life on the Sea Islands in South Carolina 
and Georgia.  

<p>

Other letter writers include George Miller's brother, Jacob D. Miller, 
cousin, John Helker, cousin, Daniel Helker, and friend, William Hartman.
