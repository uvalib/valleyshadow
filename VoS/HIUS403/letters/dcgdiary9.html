<b>November 29th:</b>Left Petersburg and rode over the snow covered hills 
to a man named Dasher, where we had good rooms, though crowded, and 
plenty to eat. Dasher had a barrel of whiskey. Everybody nearly got 
"full" and there, as a "pillow fight" up stairs Holmes Conrad and Jim 
Thompson were in it. They acted like so many children all night. I shall 
never forget that night and its absurd and ridiculous events.
<br></br>

<b>December 10th:</b>It was this day (December 10th) upon our return that 
we went sleigh riding. We took the girls out and in crossing the little 
river our sleigh upset and Perkins and I got out in the water 2 feet deep 
and righted the sleigh and rescued the girls. Upon our return to the 
house, The Cunningham home, I was dripping wet and half frozen and Mrs. 
C. gave me a hot toddy. I shall never forget it.
<br></br>
<b>December 11th:</b> Sunday. No preaching for us. Captain Dawson, an 
Englishman who was on Rossers Staff, had a fine voice so he and the girls 
gave us some very sweet music. We certainly were in an oasis of plenty 
and comfort. Dawson after the war was editor of a newspaper in Charleston 
S. C. and married there. Became famous as a writer and was murdered by a 
man who was in love with Dawson's clerk, a beautiful girl. The murderer 
was Jealous of Dawsons influence over the girl who he (D.) had besought 
to throw the fellow over. But I think he was acquitted by a jury.
<br></br>
<b>December 14th and 15th:</b> Lie in camp. 

<br></br>
<b>December 16th:</b>March to Roller'sfather of Rev. Robert Douglas 
Roller, who was for many years was Rector of St. John's Church, 
Charleston,. Va.   It was near Mt. Crawford on the Valley Pike on our way 
to Winter Quarters.
<br></br>
<b>December 17th:</b> We march in the cold, very cold, weather to 
Staunton, General Rosser asks me to stay with Capt. Emmett, his Chief of 
Staff who lay in Staunton wounded badly. Lost his leg.
<br></br>
<b>December 18th:</b> Sunday. I stayed with Emmett most of the day to 
cheer him up and be of any service I could. I attended Episcopal Church 
Reverend Dr. Sparrow preached. Hugh McGuire and I ride
to Waynesboro. I to get a fresh horse and Hugh to court Sallie whom he 
later married. My horse had seen hard service and I had to get a fresh one.
<br></br>
<b>December 19th:</b> Hugh and I remain at home all day.
 <br></br>
<b>December 21st:</b> Learning that the Yankees have gone back down the 
Valley 
we again march back to Staunton and so on out to Swoope's about 8 miles 
West of Staunton, having ridden about 35 miles in the cold. We expected 
to go into Winter Quarters at Swoope's but heard the Yankees were on a 
raid towards Charlottesville, I started in Staunton to go to see Lou 
Trout but General Rosser sent for me. We were  to attend a so called 
"Musical Soiree."
