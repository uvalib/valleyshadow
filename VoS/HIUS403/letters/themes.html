The writings collected here are a representative sample of writings from 
Augusta and Franklin Counties.  While each writer had his own style and 
issues at the forefront of his thoughts, there is evidence of certain 
common themes.  Most frequently, soldiers seemed to write about home; 
wondering about particular people as well as general events.  Their 
letters often seemed to be an effort to reconnect with home, to hold on 
to the familiarity of home in the time of war they were experiencing.  
They wrote about love, local politics, agriculture, old friends, and 
other ideas that were connected with home.

Letters and diaries also reflected the military experiences of the 
soldiers.  Soldiers more frequently wrote about camp life than actual 
battle descriptions. Detailed descriptions of camp experiences -- food, 
living conditions, interactions with other soldiers and military 
authority, and marching from camp to camp -- filled these letters and 
diaries.

It is also interesting to see how the soldiers confronted issues of 
spirituality in their writings, especially in the face of death and 
mortality.  Religious sentiments were often invoked when they spoke of 
death, although sometimes their descriptions were quite cold and distant.
