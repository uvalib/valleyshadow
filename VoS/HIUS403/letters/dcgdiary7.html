<b>October 20th</b>We fell back to Mt. Jackson about 20 miles south. The 
Yankees did not follow us.
<br></br>
<b>October 31st</b>Ordered to go to Staunton and have blanks printed ant 
go OD "leave" for a few cars. I rode into New Market, about ? miles away. 
Spent the night at Major Hawk's Head Quarters He was General Early's 
Chief Commissary Staff Officer. I sent my horse back to camp.  Left New 
Market on the stage. I found Fred Effinger of Staunton top of stage and 
be and I enjoyed the ride. He told me there was a girl in the stage who 
had run off from home with a soldier and she bad been in camp with him,of 
"easy virtue" etc., They discovered her in a soldiers uniform and sent 
her home. In passing an old frame house the stage came to a stop and the 
driver called to a woman standing in the door and said, "Here is your 
daughter!" I can even now see that awkward girl in uniform running up the 
walk crying and her poor old heart broken mother coming to meet her. 
Arrived in Staunton that night.
<br></br>
<b>November 11th</B>We advance across the Cedar Creek and gave a lively 
fight there. Dick Hill killed. A fine brave boy he was. We fall back 
across the Creek driven by an overwhelming cavalry force out-numbering us 
about four to one.
<br></br>
<November 12th</b> We again cross Cedar Creek and fight. Again 
overwhelmed end fall back towards Fisher's Hill on the Pike. "Doc" Long a 
brave boy, was killed today in a charge we made.
<br></br>
<b>November 13th</b>We again go to Rude's Hill to camp for the night.
<br></br>
<b>November 14th</b>Our Regiment goes in picket duty at Landis Mills. 
Clay Pilson and I are on post together all day and night.
<br></br>
<b>November 15th</b>Our Squadron was relieved today of  picket by Co'. "G 
and H" and we returned to the Reserve.
<br></br>
<b>November 20th</b>General Rosser sends me to Staunton. It rains very 
hard. I ride in the rain and stay all night at John Partins about 6 miles 
from Staunton.
<br></br>
<b>November 26th</b>March to Bowman's near Mathais, and to Moorefield, 
Hardy County. Last night; we (Rosser's Head-Quarters) had supper at a 
house where we bad a sumptious meal. There were seven kinds, of preserves 
on the table, sausage. etc People delighted to see and feed us. Just as 
we were about to go into camp we ran into about 300 Yankees who had come 
out from New Creek  (Now Keyser) on the Baltimore  Ohio R. R. on a 
scouting expedition. We pitched into them and routed them badly capturing 
one piece of artillery and some prisonersamong them was "Nate" Goff, of 
Clarksburg, who was ~ent to Libby Prison Richmond. He became famous while 
sent prison because when the Confederate government threatened to hang 
him if the Yankees hung a certain Confederate, Off wrote a letter saying 
"Do not consider me if it is your duty to hang that Confederate.  I am 
willing to be sacrificed." Goff afterwards became U. S. District Attorney 
of West Virginia, then U.S. Judge and Secy. of War and finally U. S. 
Senator and still lives in Clarksburg. His son Percy Married Carrie 
Bassel, who is an older sister of Martha, my son Miller's wife. Goff and 
I often spoke of his capture by us, and he was and is one of the finest 
men I ever knew. A. the purpose of the raid was to surprise and capture 
New Creek and its garrison, General Rosser knew that the Yankees whom we 
struck at Moorefield would ride all night to warn the New Creek garrison, 
he decided also to ride all night and get there first. So we rode all 
night in the rain through the mountains, guided the short way by some of 
our boys from that section. We beat them there and about 9:00 a. m. we 
came in sight of their camps, one on each side of the little narrow 
valley of New Rosser sent Major  Sweeney of Wheeling in front with about 
20 men to rush and capture their picket in the road, which we could see. 
This picket had erected as was often the case a red fence across the road 
and they on the inside of it, so that if surprised, the attacking party 
would be delayed by taking down the fence and they could gallop back in 
the meanwhile and give the alarm.
