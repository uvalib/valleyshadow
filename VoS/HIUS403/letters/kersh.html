Adam Wise Kersh was born on November 16, 1828, in Wise Hollow, 
near Centerville, Augusta County, VA.  He served as a Private in Company 
F of the 52nd Virginia Infantry from July of 1861 until May of 1865.  
Before the war, Adam had become a member of St. Michael Church, and made 
his living as a cabinet and furniture maker.  His woodworking shop was 
located on a farm in Augusta County, where he lived with his brother George.
<P>
Adam enlisted at Staunton, VA on July 31, 1861 at the age of 33.  
Throughout his early career in military service Adam tried repeatedly to 
find a paid <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0332.html">substitute</a> 
but failed to do so.  Adam served with the 52nd 
Virginia from the time of his enlistment until July 11, 1864, and again 
from December 31, 1864 until May 11, 1865.  Kersh was wounded in action
at the fight near Bethesda Chapple on May 30, 1864.  In his time away from 
service Adam returned to home and was listed as AWOL from his regiment.  He lived 
at home for several months, hiding in his attic whenever someone 
approached.  He returned to his Company and to service apparently without 
punishment, and was eventually paroled at Staunton, the place of his 
enlistment, after the ceasing of hostilities.
<P>
Adam lived the remainder of his life in Augusta County until his death on 
March 22, 1905.  The 25 letters in this collection were written mainly to 
his brother George, living on their farm in Mt. Crawford, VA.  The 
letters begin on September 15, 1861 and run throughout the war, the last 
letter being dated February 7th, 1865.  Throughout his letters, Kersh 
portrays himself as a dutiful soldier (except for his AWOL experience), 
complaining very little and expressing no political or ideological views 
on the progress of the war.  Wise wrote down what he saw and heard 
throughout his war experience, but cast a <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0351.html">knowing 
doubt</a> on the rumors he 
heard in camp.  His letters offer a matter of fact glance at many 
important issues that permeated the soldier's Civil War.
