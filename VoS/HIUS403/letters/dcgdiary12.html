<b>January 28th:</b>Leave Richmond and go to "Courtland" (General 
Rossers wife's home near Hanover C. H.) nearly fall in love with Sally 
Winston, Mrs. Rosser's younger sister. A lovely girl. She and I 
correspond for a while even while I was at the University later.
<br></br>
<b>February 10th:</b> Leave for Richmond.  See General Rosser there and 
he takes steps to have me assigned from Fitz Lee's division to Rossers.  
I go to find General Lee and find him at a dance, up on Franklin Street 
about Midnight.  He signs the transfer or Assignment of which I was very 
happy.

The winter of 1864-5 was fearfully cold and "The dark foreboding days of 
the Confederacy" in very truth Lee's army was practically starving down 
at Petersburg. All our sea ports were blockaded no supplies of any kind 
could reach us. Man' saw that the end wee near but still had stout 
hearts, "hoping against hope." In the valley there were but few 
Confederate troops left. General Early had been compelled to send ever, 
man he could spare to Lee. So he had left only Wharton's Division of 
Infantry and one of Rosser's Brigade remaining. The infantry were in 
Winter Quarters at McLures, near Fishersville and the Cavalry scattered 
at their homes and a few at Swoope's and picket was kept up and down 
about Harrisonburg The enemy was also in Winter Quarters and they too had 
a picket force near and below Harrisonburg. All operation by either side 
were stopped until the weather permitted the campaign to open in the 
early spring. everything was comparatively quiet in the Valley, except 
little dashes of the pickett force. We were all expecting now to be 
called out at any day. This was the situation until:
<br>/<br>
<b>March 1st, 1865</b>Tonight Capt. Hugh McGuire came home about midnight 
and alarmed us all by the news that the Yankees were coming up the Valley 
towards Staunton in heavy force. His squadron of Cavalry had been on 
picket at the bridge on the Valley Pike near Mr. Crawford, about 150 
Cavalry were all that were there between Harrisonburg and Staunton. His 
squadron made the best stand they could at the bridge, but the enemy sent 
a large force up the river, which they forded and come in behind our men. 
It then became a race up the Pike towards Staunton.  Some of our men were 
captured. Capt. McGuire lost his hat and rode to Waynesboro that night 
hatless. His account of that race was very amusing and thrilling too. 
Sheridan had started out from Winchester with about 9,000 picked cavalry 
to ride to Richmond and joint Grant at Petersburg. Some of the cavalry 
galloped to Fishersville in the night and gave the alarm to General 
Early. The Yankees rode into Staunton that night. Early at once moved out 
his infantry, about 2,200 only, from Fishersville down to Waynesboro, 
they arrived there about daylight.  Early and his staff came to my 
mother's for breakfast, where I saw him turn down a tumbler half! full of 
whiskey before breakfast. (This was a weakness of his.) It was a rainy 
blue morning in every way.   My Mother sent the slaves (negroes) horses, 
wagons etc., by my brother 'William across the Blue Ridge for safety. 
Everybody who had slaves, horses, etc., did likewise. Our wagons came 
very, near being captured for they had just turned off the Main Road to 
Charlottesville when the enemy galloped a thousand strong near them and 
rushed on after the fleeing Confederates. So fast did these fellows ride 
that they got to Greenwood Depot. ten or fifteen miles from Waynesboro, 
that they fired into a train leaving there with munitions.  They killed 
one of our men on the train. The mud was fearful and very amusing stories 
are told of that stampede of civilians, wagons, negroes. etc., over 
Rockfish Gap. This was the last fighting in the Shenandoah Valley.
