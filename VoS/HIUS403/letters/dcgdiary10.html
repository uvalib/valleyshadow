<b>December 23rd:</b> We march from Staunton to Waynesboro where General 
Rosser and some of us lunch at home and then we went across the Rockfish 
Gap, Blue Ridge Mountains. en-route towards Charlottesville, where we 
heard the Yankee raiders had gone back.  Hugh McGuire and I spent the 
night at "Mirador," where Mr. James Bowen then owned and lived. His grand 
daughter Mary Funsten was there, a beautiful charming Girl and a sister 
of the late Bishop Funsten who recently died in California. Col. Funsten 
was Col. of 11th Va. Cavalry, Rosser's Brigade, and his son "Boz" wee 
captain of the 11th and was there that night and got "lit-up"-very. Mr. 
Bowen had lots to drink and was very generous with it.  By the way, this 
country place "Mirador" later became famous as the home of Col. C. D. 
Langhorne father of the famous Langhorne girls, the "Gibson girls." 
Langhorne spent much money remodeling and beautifying this country seat 
and was buried there I think.'

<b>December 24th:</b> We ride down to Mechums River again and General 
Rosser went to Charlottesville and returned on the mail train. The 
Yankees having gone back to the Valley where they had started from, we 
also returned there arriving at Waynesboro about 11:00 p. m.

<b>December 25th:</b> Christmas day. Dull day. Preaching in the old 
Academy by Huston (Hale ? or William ) Hugh  McGuire, Col. William Morgan 
of the 1st Virginia Cavalry, Brigadier General William Payne, and Lieut. 
Diggs of the cavalry all spend the night at my mother's. We had a very 
poor Christmas Day but a good dinner,(the last Xmas of the war!)

<b>Decemberr 26th:</b> Moff  King, Surgeon of 18th Cavalry, William B 
Gallaher, Henry Bateler (Staying at my mother's) Ellie Fishburne, Charlie 
Gallaher and I all had some whiskey in Fishburn's lumber room; later we 
got egg nogg at old John Mann's little store.  All of us got sick!  
Whiskey in those days was enough to make anybody sick.
<br></br>
<b>December 27th:</b> The enemy and our troops in the Valley were 
practically going into Winter Quarters The weather being fearfully cold. 
Our people had so tattle to eat for man or beast most of the cavalry were 
permitted to go home until called out and rest up their horses. Each army 
had a picket force down the valley below Harrisonburg m watch each other. 
I was glad enough to remain at home a while. Some of our cavalry who 
could not get home (inside the enemy's lines) went to Swoops to remain 
awhile. General Fitz Lee was down at Bruce's on Main Street and the band 
gave him a daylight serenade. It was a sort of "gala Day" for old 
Waynesboro. Liet. Charlie Minnegrode of Fitz Lee's Staff was playing the 
devoted to Helena Withrow.  He was later in April badly wounded on Lee's 
retreat.  General Rosser at my mother's invitation went to Hanover and 
returned to our house with his his wife and baby and remained there as 
guests for some time. She was Bettie Winston, of Courtland (their home) 
near Hanover C H. and a lovely woman. Many years after in coming out of 
Richmond on the train with General Rosser ant wife, a young lady got 
aboard and recognizing me said, "come back and see Bettie." I did so. 
When I was introduced to "Sallie," the young lady with them, I said 'Miss 
Sallie," I have met you before!" "Where?" she said.  Why, at my mothers 
when as a baby I used to carry you around.

<b>December 28th:</b> Spent the day quietly at home.
