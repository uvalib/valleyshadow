<b><strong><center>A Home Coming Episode</center></strong></b>
<br></br> 
As we were marching along in lower Orange or Louisa County, I heard a 
wonderful cheering of our men.  The cause was that most of our Regiment 
and Brigade were from the section where the mountains were and the boys 
had been down in the God forsaken "lowlands" and were so sick of them 
that when they first caught sight of the Blue Ridge, their hearts were 
thrilled and a joyous shout and cheer went up.  It reminded one of the 
"Remtreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks" who cried with joy "Thalatta! 
Thalatta!" (The Sea! The Sea!)  When they got so near home! (See 
Zenophon's Anabasis for this.)
<br></br> 
<b>August 15th:</b>In camp near Front Royal.  Had a meal at a Mr. 
Buck's.  Enjoyed it.  Hear the Yankee Cavalry are in the neighborhood.  
We had expected this.  General Jubal T. Early, then in command of the 
Valley, had but few cavalry and had appealed to General Lee to send him 
some, as Sheridan's Cavalry had been running over the few cavalry that 
Early had.  Hence Fitz Lee's old Brigade (ours) was sent to him.
<br></br> 
<b>August 16th:</b>The Yankees came up and we attacked them.  We were 
badly managed and were repulsed at Guard Hill with some loss; went into 
the Camp of the previous night.
<br></br> 
<b>August 17th:</b>Some of us got a girl at the big mill near Luray to 
make us some real coffee.  Very fine.  Brucie Trout was the girl and she 
was very pretty and kind to us.
<br></br> 
<b>August 18th:</b>Marched to within 6 miles of Winchester on the Plank 
Road.  We had a scrap with Yankee Cavalry below Winchester on the 
Berryville Road.  It rained in torrents and we got soaked through and 
through.  Horrible night we had!  Hungry-wagons not up with us-fearfully 
tired, and sleeping in the rain.
<br></br> 
<b>August 22nd:</B> On the March I went to a man's house named Knode, who 
was a friend of my mother's family.  Got a "snack" there.  In camp at a 
Church in Lee Town (Jefferson County).  Rains very hard.  In the suburbs 
of Lee Town, Dr. Gregg Gibson, a cousin of Amelia, my brother William's 
wife, lived in the old Tucker home.  A beautiful old colonial house, with 
a grove of "ancestral" trees around it, and with an immense garden with a 
vine clad brick high wall all around it, radiant with flowers and 
beautiful shrubery.  Here, my sister in law, just married in that house 
was staying.  Her old home was in the Vicinity and William had taken 
advantage of our tropps being in possession there temporarily and had 
gone down and married Amelia.  I called to see her.  You can imagine the 
pleasure and surprsie that visit was!  I got off for a visit to Mr. 
Abel's that night and slept in a <i>bed!</i>  Met some girls there from 
the Luray Valley named Lionberger.  An old friend, Joe Crane had married 
one of them.
<br></br> 
<b>August 25th:</b>Rejoin my command at Lee Town, which had been inactive 
for several days, and in camp.  Marched through Martinsburgh and encamp 
at Falling Waters on the Potomac River, and nearly opposite Williamport, 
Md.  Here we found many old "union" farmers (sympathizers with the North) 
and we helped ourselves to their orchards and fine hay (for our weary 
horses.)
<br></br> 
<b>August 31st:</b>My horse "Don" which I had ridden from May all through 
our marches and fights becoming lame from a disease common in the army 
called the "greasy foot" starting from the "scratches" caused by going 
through so much mud and such hard service. We lay out in a big field 
nearly all day grazing our horses and taking it easy, as the enemy showed 
no disposition to attack us for which we were ready.  Took some flour to 
a Miss Dawes who lived nearby and she baked it for me.
<br></br> 
<b>September 2nd:</b>Encamped at an old Yankee CAMP near Winchester, our 
regiment ordered down on teh Opequon to "picket."  Late in the night we 
were ordered to go on a reconnoiter towards Berryville.  Saddled up and 
started, very dark and not knowing when or where we would run into the 
enemy.  We were sent down there, about 10 miles, to find out if the enemy 
was there in much strength.  Well, we found them!  As we rode into 
Berrybille, our company in advance, we rain right into a big column of 
Yankees starting out on a raid.  It was our Regiment against a Division 
of Cavalry.  We retreated in haste and our Company being in the front in 
the advance down there, of course we had to cover the retreat back 
towards Winchester.  It was pitch dark and as we flew up the Pike some of 
the boys got outside of the road, for there were no fences along there 
(the armies had burned them all up) and in the running through the woods 
along the road, two boys, Newt Finley and Sam Miller ran under an 
overhanging grap vine (as we learned afterwards), which caught and 
dragged them off their horses and were captured.  The enemy pursued us 
some miles and it was a race, sure enough.  The wonder is they did not 
capture the whole of our Regiment!  I shall never forget that ride on 
that dark night!  It was to laugh after it was all over, but not when we 
were riding for our lives and away from the capture or death or both.
<br></br> 
<b>October 15th to October 8th:</B> I spent at home on furlough and 
certainly did enjoy it.  General T.L. Rosser's command came to the Valley 
about this time and being an old freind of my family offered me a place 
with his brigade whcih was very welcome to me for I did not like my 
Captian, Tom McClung, a rough farmer who was tyrannical and abusive, 
especially to a boy who held himself as his superior socially.  The 
"insolence of office" was not all in "Hamlets Soliloquy."
