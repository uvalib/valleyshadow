<b>December 29th</B>General Early had withdrawn his infantry and 
artillery from down the valley to near Fisherville, where they erected 
huts, etc., and went into Winter Quarters. General Rosser and I rode up 
to see General Early who was at McCues near Fisherville.

<b>December 30th</b> 
General Early spent the night at our house. The ears ran off the track (a 
very frequent thing in those days of worn out rails,) at Christy's Creek 
below Waynesboro and Staunton. Generals Early and Rosser and I sit at the 
telegraph office all morning trying to get some telegraphic news.

<b> January 13th</b>A regiment of Cavalry encamp in our woods out at the 
farm and "society" in Waynesboro, the soldiers there and General Early's 
infantry in Winter Quarters near Fishersville added very much. They were 
a Ray lot. We have a dance at our house tonight. Although all realized 
the war was going against us, and dreaded the spring campaign soon to 
open, still all were disposed to say "on with the dance, let joy be 
unconfined" -often recall it and think we were dancing and Ray right at 
the Grave of the Confederacy.
