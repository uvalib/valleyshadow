<B>June 18-19-20:</B> March towards the White House Near the York River.  
Remain around there several days.  Fight with negro infantry.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 21:</B>March back to Battom's Bridge.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 23:</B>March in the night and long after daylight to near Charles 
CIty, C.H. and not far from Harrison's Landing on the James River.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 24:</B>Fight-a sharp one, with Greg's Cavalry near Charles City 
C.H. Our Regiment was dismounted and we were sent in on foot.  In 
determining who were to dismount, the Company was lined up adn counted by 
fours, that is; every fourth man was to hold the horses of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 
and his own of course, and take and keep them in there rear, as far as 
practicable out of danger, and to bring them up, if a retreat were 
ordered	or in any other emergency, when there was a terrible scramble to 
mount and then get away.  It fell to me to dismount and go in that day. I 
shall nver forget that day or the next!
<BR></BR>
<B>June 25th:</B>It was very warm, burning hot, and just before the 
charge was ordered we were in the edge of some woods and under fire of 
artillery and small arms, a peice of shell-called shrapnel now-struck my 
left boot and as I nearly fell some of the boys (Jim Kerr and Phil 
Coiner) wanted to carry me off, supposing my leg was broken.  When 
ordered to advance and charge the enemy there, we corssing an open field 
runnin as fast as we could, the Yankees began to "Skedaddle" and flee!  I 
got close up to a Gnereal, or a bunch of officers, trying to rally their 
fleeing men and took deliberate aim at him and can never understand why 
he did not fall as he galloped away.  He may have only been wounded. We 
followed them on foot for three or four miles in a blazing sun.  I was 
never so tired in my life carrying my carbine pistol and ammunition, but 
the excitement kept me up.  We drove them until it was too dark to 
follow.  They ran clean away into the night.  Oh How glad I was to 
again mount my faithful horse and go into camp for the night!

<B><CENTER>A Presentiment</CENTER></B>
<BR></BR>
<B>June 26th:</B>I was so stiff and sore from that running fight 
yesterday I could hardly saddle my horse and mount him.  Expecting an 
attack, for Grant was still pressing Lee, we were again ordered to go in 
dismounted and await the attack.  It again fell to my lot to dismount!
<BR></BR>
As Lee was falling back, I well knew that if in the fight our Regiment 
was ordered to retreat, I could not run-was too sore and stiff from the 
previous day's exertions.  I konw if we retreated I was sure to be either 
captured or killed.  I could not run back to our "Led Horses."  So I took 
off my jacket, fastened it to my saddle and took off a gold ring my 
mother had given me and told the boy holding my horse that I did not 
expect to be back again and to give or send the ring to my mother for me, 
and told him to send my horse home and that he could have my other things.
<BR></BR>
Well, down into the woods we went, ready for a fight and expected attack, 
but after lying there several hours we were recalled and again mounted 
our horses.  The Yankeed had gone in another direction, so we marched 
after them towards the famous "Malvern Hill" the  scene of a bloody 
battle the year before on McClellans; retreat, where driven by Lee, he 
(McC) sought th protection of his gunboats on the James River.  So much 
of my foreboding of prison or worse!
<BR></BR>
We cross on a pontoon bridge James River near Drury's Bluff, as Grant 
changed his attack on Richomond by placing his army on the south side of 
the river, near Petersburg, and most of our army followed to that side.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 27th:</B>We lie in the woods all day, the first real rest for 
about 50 days.  The last three days were terrible-very hot and the dust 
inconceivably thick, and men suffering.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 18th:</B>Moved camp to within about 6 miles of Petersburg 
overlooking the James River.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 29th:</B>Pass through Petersburg and fight and whip General 
Wilso's Yankee Cavalry, capturing 13 peices of artillery, all of his 
wagons and 300 or 400 runaway negroes whom Wilson had picked up and harbored.
<BR></BR>
<B>June 30th:</B>We follow Wilson's cavalry to Jarretts Station on the 
"Petersburg & Weldon Rail Road"-as it was then called, now he A.C.L., and 
encamp there that night.
