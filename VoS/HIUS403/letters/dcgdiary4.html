<b>July 31st:</b> Some of us were sent to Chaffin's Bluff overlooking 
James River to stop all cavalry men from going into Richmond-Stragglers, 
etc.  I found I was near a man named Hoppe, who knew my family.  I called 
at his house and they gave me something to eat.  We were called off our 
post about sundown and again crossed the James River aon a pontoon bridge 
(there were three of them) to the South side-so we had crossed all three 
pontoons-marched until after midnight and went into camp and slept like a 
rock.
<br></br>  
<b>August 1st(1864):</b>  Got up before daylight and marched through 
Petersburg again and went into camp just where we previously had been.  
Bath in a nearby creek.  It was fine after all those days of torrid heat 
and dust.
<br></br>  
<b>August 2nd(1864):</b>My 19th birthday!  How I spent it? My dinner? 
Cold water, cornbread (made of meal, grease, and water) and fat bacon!  I 
quote from my then taken notes-"How differently spent from my usual way 
of doing so!  Nobody to bestow upon me their smiles and gifts."  I was 
put on guard that night over some Yankees and vagabonds-stood two hours 
as guard in the night thinking of the dear home in the Valley.  Dave 
Drake came in from his home and gave me a snack.  Drake was a messmate 
and had been home on furlough.
<br></br>  
<b>August 3rd:</b>I go out "foraging."  Get some peaches and get a dinner 
at Mr. Carter's.  Ate very heartily!
<br></br>
<b>August 4th:</b>I did some writing for Captain Henry Lee in his tent.  
Today I bought a canteen of sorghum molasses.  Great treat!
<br></br>
<b>August 5th:</b>Went to see Sam Priller who was sick at a Mrs. Blick's 
and got my dinner there.  A "war-time" dinner.  Returned and "Boots & 
Saddles" blew-Marched back to old camp again near Petersburg.  Marched 
until 1:00 a.m.  Very tired out.  Had to rise at 5:00 a.m.
<br></br>
<b>August 6th:</b>Got up at 5:00 a.m. and marched to near Manchester 
opposite Richmond.  Went into town to get something to eat.  Camped near 
the town.

<b>August 7th:</b>(Sunday) Left camp and marched to and through 
Richmond-up Pearl to Main St., to 3rd to BRoad and to Brooke Turnpike.  
As we were riding along at corner of Franklin and 3rd St., someone called 
my name.  I found it was Miss Laura Kent, whom I had met and known in 
Waynesboro.  She begged me to accompany her to her home, corner of 1st 
and Franklin and get something to eat.  I was terribly dusty from 
marching in such clouds of dust as a Brigade of horses can and did 
raise.  Tried to beg off, though terribly hungry, but she insisting, I 
yielded.  The streets were full of Church goers at the time.  I tied my 
horse in front of her home and entered with her to the parlor, where 
interntaining some well dressed officers in flashy uniforms and shining 
boots, evidently swivel-chair sissy officers around Richmond, who looked 
almost shocked to see a private, dusty and not very neat sitting at a 
marble top table eating from silver and china!  I was so fussed and felt 
so akward, I really could eat but little.  So I told Laura I "jad a sick 
comrade" and if she would fix up a lunch I would take it to him.  She 
readily did so.  Bidding her goodbye, I rode away to overtake my 
command.  Needless to say, that soon after leaving, I threw my reins on 
the neck of my horse and the "sick comrade" ate and enjoyed that lunch.  
I ate every crumb of it.  I overtook my command at the Yellow 
Tavern(where our old Commander General J.E.B. Stuart was killed in the 
May previous) GO into camp for the night at Ashland.
