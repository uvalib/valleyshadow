<CENTER><H1><BIG><BOLD>The Audience of Civil War Writings, 
1861-1865</BOLD></BIG></H1></CENTER>
<HR>

<P>&#9;The central issues of home and family, military life, and spirituality resonate throughout the writings of both soldiers and civilians from Augusta County, Virginia and Franklin County, Pennsylvania in the years 1861 through 1865. Although these co

mmon themes echo throughout the three genres of Civil War writings, the purpose varied, often dictated by the intended audience. Letters published in local newspapers had a large, public audience. On the other hand, personal letters and diaries had a much

 more private and intimate audience. The audiences of the different genres of Civil War writings varied, but one fact remains consistent. The newspaper letters, personal letters, and personal diaries of Augusta and Franklin County all reflect the intense 

struggle for individuals to maintain a familiarity with home and family in a time of war. </P>

<P>            The<I> Pennsylvania Daily Telegraph</I> (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) published several letters written by officers of the 107<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsylvania, the 158<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsylvania, and the 201<SUP>st</SUP> Pennsylvania Regiments from 1

861 to 1865. The letters published in the <I>Telegraph</I> express the common themes of military service, spirituality, and home and family. In addition to these reappearing themes, military men utilized the press to express their political and ideologica

l opinions about the war to the public. These opinions, however, rarely found a place in the personal letters and diaries of the soldiers from Augusta and Franklin County. Take for example the comments made by Captain William Tell Barnitz of the 158<SUP>t

h</SUP> Pennsylvania Regiment, Company E.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>Since Beauregard’s proclamation, exhorting his hosts to call all Union men Abolitionists, his allies in the North, seeing that thus they could deceive the masses and array them against the Government, spreading discontent and sowing

 disaffection broadcast, took up the cry, and every true patriot – every one who dared to raise his voice in behalf of the Government – everyone who favored the vigorous prosecution of the war, the confiscation of rebel property, or the subjugation of the

 rebels, the only possible means of crushing the rebellion – was trumpeted forth an Abolitionist and execrated as an enemy to liberty. Indeed so utterly blinded were many of the followers – so utterly and hellishly belied, betrayed and deceived – that the

y would have seen our armies annihilated, and rejoiced, and would have thrown themselves in the way for that arch-traitor Jeff Davis, to ride over in his triumphal entry to our Capitol. But, thank God, the film has fallen from their eyes in good time, the

 bubble of treachery and deceit has burst, and clearer brighter skies glow around us… Let the fires of liberty, rekindled, be kept steadily burning; let that patriotic association, the Union League, be established in every city, town and township througho

ut the North.

<P>           In addition to political opinions, military men wrote long detailed accounts of military engagements in their letters to the editor of the <I>Pennsylvania Daily Telegraph</I>. On June 16, 1862 Lieutenant J.A.C. of the 107<SUP>th</SUP> Pennsy

lvania, Company E wrote:</P>

Sabbath morning, June 1<SUP>st</SUP>, our brigade (Gen. Duryea’s) composed of the 107<SUP>th</SUP> Penn’a. regiment, New York 105<SUP>th</SUP>, 104<SUP>th</SUP>, and 97<SUP>th</SUP>, made a charge through Front Royal, double quick thro

<P>           The letters in the <I>Telegraph</I>, informed the public of military victories and military opinions, but they never ceased to remind the public of the soldiers constant struggle to return to his home, friends, and family. Lieutenant J.A.C. 

concluded the same letter quoted above by saying, "My prayer is, God will protect them and all of us in this noble cause, and restore peace to the country, and that we may return to our loved homes and enjoy the benefits of a free and happy people."</P>
        Personal letters and diaries were addressed to a much more 
private and intimate audience. The overall intimacy of these letters 
reflects the intense struggle for individuals to maintain a familiarity 
with home and family in a time of war

en tended to shy away from bloody accounts of battle in their letters. Moreover, recounting bloody battles and details of battle severed their ties with home and brought Augusta and Franklin County men into a realm of unfamiliarity. In order to maintain a

 connection with home, family, and friends, Augusta and Franklin men wrote about familiar aspects of their life with those at home. For
