William Smith Hanger Baylor was born in Augusta County on April 7, 1831. 
He graduated from Washington College, and also studied at the University 
of Virginia.  Baylor married Mary Hawes in 1859, and was the 
Commonwealth Attorney for Staunton. In 1858, residents of Staunton 
formed a local militia company, the West Augusta Guard, a division of 
the 160th Regiment Virginia Militia. Baylor was Captain of the Guard, 
which travelled to Alexandria and Charlestown in late 1859, in the wake 
of <A
