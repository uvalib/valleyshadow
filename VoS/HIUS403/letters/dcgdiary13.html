The morning of this fight Genera1 Rosser with about 100 Cavalry (all he 
had there. for all the others were disbanded for the winter and many at 
Swoope's in Winter Quarters) rode up to within sight of Christy's Creek 
about 4 miles from Staunton. There we saw a blue column of Yankees 
coming. Rosser gave some orders to the officer in charge of the small 
cavalry force with him and taxing about ~ half dozen of us with him he 
rode into the woods in bridle path until we reached a country road and 
then rode to Greenville and Staunton Road about 10 miles astray. Rosser's 
object was to see for himself whether the enemy was going towards 
Lexington and Lynchburg or not, as Genl. Hunter had gone the year before. 
We rode in the rain all day,. We found no traces of the enemy on that 
road. Then we rode on to the Middlebrow and Staunton road and there found 
no sign' of the enemy. Rosser's idea was that the movement to. wards 
Waynesboro was a mere feint to cover his real movement to Lexington. But 
he was mistaken.
<br></br>
About 4 p. m. Genl, Rosser turned to me and said, "Clinton. (he always 
called me so) you go back to Waynesboro and tell Genl. Early that none of 
the enemy has gone this way. And careful you do not run into the 
Yankees." Rosser and the others remained to watch if possible the 
movements of the enemy.
Off I rode in the rain not knowing: where l would finally land, in 
Waynesboro, in prison or in another world. As I rode along I noticed 
every farm house closed. Not a soul to be seen. The people know the 
Yankees were near and had run off and hidden their horses, stock. etc., 
as best they could. Occasionally I noticed some one peering around the 
corner of a house or a tree watching me and no doubt they were wondering 
if I were a Yankee scout. I had a black oil cloth cape on to protect me 
from the rain, and of course, no one could tell whether I was a Yankee or 
Confederate.
<br></br>
Along about evening I heard a terrible rumbling and human voices as I 
neared the Staunton and Waynesboro road where the Tinkling Spring road 
passes it. To my amazement. as I drew nearer, I beheld the Yankee wagons 
going rapidly towards ( ! ) Waynesboro, about two miles away! The mud was 
terrible and the wagon drivers and soldiers with them were shouting and 
swearing at their horses.
