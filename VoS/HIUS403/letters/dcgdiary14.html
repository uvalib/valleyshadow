Rosser and all of us had heard artillery in the forenoon at Waynesboro 
and he remarked, "Well, I suppose Uncle Jubal has driven them off and 
they may come this way on their way to Lexington." How mistaken he was! 
Early had not drives them away. The shoe was on the other foot.
<br></br>
	I soon got away from the road and rode through a lane to old man 
Shirey's house to learn the news. It was about dusk. I had noticed some 
camp fires out beyond his house in the woods. I rode up to his gate and 
helloed. He came out and recognized me and was scared to death almost. He 
cried out "For Heaven's sake, get away. Don't you see those Yankees? Over 
there in the woods and down there at my spring?" He then told me Early 
had been routed. So I rode into a lane leading over towards South River 
keeping in view for some distance those Yankees at the Spring, who if 
they saw me, supposed I was one of their men. I was trying to get across 
the river to the Mountain for the night. I stopped at Jim Irvine's who 
then lived at the Ellis place on the hill. It was raining and cold and he 
told me all he had heard about Early's defeat and gave me some corn for 
my jaded horse who had had nothing to eat all day and begged me to remain 
all night if I thought it safe but I declined. They begged me not to try 
to ford the river which was very high and out of its banks. But I swam my 
horse, dark as it was, over the river and soon met Phil Coined of my old 
Company "E" 1st Cavalry, and he and I rode up into the mountains and 
slept on the ground all night. Old David D. Coined joined us soon after 
we laid down. He was frightened to death. All night long he kept saying 
"It's a terrible time, Terrible time."
<br></br>
The next morning we could see from the mountain Waynesboro and vicinity. 
I noticed a big fire and a column of smoke right in a line with my 
mother's house, which I supposed was burning. I afterwards found out the 
fire was from burning a lot of Early's wagons on the hill in front of 
Shows (now Anterooms) house on the hill.
<br></br>
	Phil Coined and I decided to ride into or as near as we could to 
Waynesboro as  we entered the town the last of the Yankees were leaving 
en-route to Charlottesville. I went home and got something to eat and 
listened to all that the Yankees had done while there. They ( Hun like) 
had broken into my mother's smoke house, taken her hams, etc., broken 
into her pantry on her back porch and taken almost everything they could 
find. However, some edibles were saved by the following incident. Dr. 
Hunter McGuire of Stonewall Jackson's old staff, but now of General 
Early's staff, and chief surgeon was captured by the enemy and asked to 
be paroled and allowed to go to my mother's. Being a non-combatant, and 
of very high rank he was allowed to go. He brought with him a staff 
officer of Sheridan's and my mother had them a nice meal prepared. While 
doing so, she came in and appealed to the Yankee Staff Officer, Lieut. 
Vail, for protection. He at once gave her a guard and drove the thieving 
rascals off.

<b>Dr. Hunter McGuires Capture:</b>
<br></br>
He told me he was trying to escape and had reached a piece of woods, 
where the "Brandon" Hotel now stands in Basic, and finding his pursuers 
very close behind him tries to jump his horse over a low rail fence and 
get into the woods. But alas! His horse fell with him! An officer told 
the fellow to put his gun down, saying "He's MY prisoner." The Dr. told  
me he was a Mason and that he made a Masonic sign ant the Yankee officer 
being a Mason also had saved his life. He said the enemy treated him very 
nicely and paroled him. My mother and children all hid in the cellar 
under our kitchen during the fighting. Fourteen of our men surrendered on 
our back porch where they had run when the stampede began. He also told 
me that while he and his Yankee protector were in our sitting room 
waiting for their meal, which my mother was preparing, (for our Negroes 
had been sent away except one woman, Mammy Jane,) the Yankee officer 
noticed a Knight Templar picture on the wall. It had my father's name on 
it. He inquired who this Hugh L. Gallaher was 7 When told he said, of 
course, he would protect his family and did. He also stopped their 
plundering ant burning down at the Tanyard nearby.
<br></br>
	I think: that he was a Col. Forsythia of Sheridan's staff. Hr 
wrote my mother after the war, as did Lieut. Vail. Stonewall Jackson had 
captured very many prisoners in 1862 at the battle of Port Republic about 
20 miles below Waynesboro. They were marches to Waynesboro and put in the 
fields above our house. They were nearly starved. Vial wrote a note to my 
mother wishing to buy something to eat. But she went with a servant 
herself to see that Vail and not Confederate guards got the basket. Of 
course she refused any pay for it. Hence Vail wrote her after the war 
very often.
