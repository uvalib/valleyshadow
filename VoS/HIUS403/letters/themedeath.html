<P>Occurrences of death and the spirituality upon their reflection formed a 
recurring theme in the letters and diaries of Franklin and Augusta 
County.  Men from both Counties took their religion (usually Protestant) 
with them to war, but often received a "baptism by fire", that is a 
personal confrontation with the carnage of war.  This personal experience 
with death in war, and especially the loss of close friends and family, 
often made soldiers change their spiritual outlook, and left them with 
serious doubts about the nature of their religion.  
<P>
There is no doubt that religion played a large role in the lives of 
soldiers.  Some commanders mandated that their soldier's attend a Sunday 
worship service.  More commonly, other soldiers voluntarily sought out 
one of the chaplains who held religious services on a regular basis.  Men 
often prayed before the coming of a battle, hoping to encourage the 
Almighty to spare them from harm.  Other soldiers held a <A

view</a> 
of military service that offered them comfort in the times of extreme 
terror, believing that no harm would come to them until their allotted time.

One of the deepest insights provided by the letters and diaries of 
Franklin and Augusta is to observe the matter-of-fact way the soldiers 
treated the death which greeted them in large numbers.  One soldier 
remarked that "Death is the common lot of all and the difference between 
dying today and dying tomorrow is not much, but we all prefer 
tomorrow." Beginning with the first casualties and increasing as the war 
went on, the coldness of death began to wear on soldiers, dehumanizing 
them to the criminality of the loss of human life.  Seeing friends die 
on the field from shot and shell, and in the camps of disease, soldiers 
looked upon the loss of life with indifference.

<P>
Men often comforted themselves with the notion that their military 
service was an obedience to duty, a duty to North or South, to family, or to 
God.  Other men saw in death the coming of a better world, where the 
blessings of God might be bestowed upon men who had acted to their 
best abilities in this life, enduring the hardships of war for a stake 
in a better life to come. Adam Kersh, reflecting upon the <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0341.html">death of 
his 
mother</a> solidified the feelings of many soldiers when he declared that 
"we ought to try and walk more upright and try to attain the rest which 
is prepared for the righteous in a better world than this."
  <P> 
The writers of Franklin and Augusta Counties filled their letters and 
diaries with comments about casualties and the loss of human life.  The 
mentionings suggest the above hypothesis, that death was an everyday 
occurrence and that a better world waited in the beyond for the soldier 
who left his life on the field.<br>
