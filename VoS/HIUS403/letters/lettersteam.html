<P>
The idea of a site about the Civil War letters and diaries of Franklin 
and Augusta County originated in the history class <A 
HREF="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~ela">HIUS 403: 
Digital History and the Civil War</a>, at the <A 
HREF="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia.</a>  
The larger context behind the class was the <A 
HREF="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/vshadow2">Valley of 
the Shadow Project</a>, one of the 
largest history web sites in the world, comparing the entire communities 
of Franklin and Augusta throughout the war years.  At the beginning of 
the 1998 Spring semester, four students were confronted with the task of 
developing and constructing a site analyzing the letters and diaries of 
both Franklin and Augusta Counties.
<P>
Starting from scratch, the Letters and Diaries team supervised all 
aspects of the site's construction, beginning with the collection of a 
great number of letters and diaries from the two communities. From there, 
the team absorbed the material, and selected certains works to transcribe 
in a TEI format, and completed the searchable database which forms the 
main portion of the site.  Upon completion of the database, the 
finishing touches were added and the site posted on the World Wide Web.
<P>
Throughout the course of the semester, the Letters and Diaries team 
constantly revised, retouched and updated the site.  The constant 
challenge was to tackle the new field of digital history, and present it 
effectively in a manner which allowed the user to take full advantage of 
the technology involved, without sacrificing the traditional interpretive 
history of the story.  We hope you enjoy the site as much as we have 
enjoyed creating it for you to visit.
<P>
This site would never have been completed without the help of many 
professionals along the way.  In this regard, the Letters and Diaries 
team extends its sincere thanks to the following:  Noel Harrsion of the 
National Park Service, Fredericksburg National Military Park, 
Fredericksburg, VA.  The staff of the Alexander Mack Library at Bridgewater 
College, Bridgewater VA.  The New Media Center at the University of 
Virginia.  The <A HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu">Electronic Text 
Center</a> at the University of 
Virginia.  The staff of St. Michael's Reformed Church, Centerville, VA.  
Thank you also to Charles Woodfolk, you know what you did.  
Lastly, the Letters and Diaries team would like to thank Professor Edward 
Ayers and Professor William Thomas for both their willingness to let us 
run with the site, and their advice when we ran a little too far.

<B><u>The Members of the Letters and Diaries Team:</b></u>
<hr>
<b>David Freed</b> graduated from the University of Virginia in 1998 
with a degree in history.  David's interests, besides history, include 
flyfishing, kayaking, and canoe tripping.  
<hr> <b>Sarah Richardson</b> is continuing her education at the 
Univeristy of Virginia.  She will graduate in 1999 with a BA in 
governement and a master's degree in teaching.  When not hard at work on 
the project throughout the semester, Ms. Richardson could often be found 
at the Biltmore Grill giving discourse to the patrons about the letters 
and diairies of Franklin and Augusta.

<hr>
<b>Matthew Kelly</b> graduated from the University of Virginia in 1998 
with degrees in history and philosophy.  When asked for further 
information on his participation in HIUS 403 Mr. Kelly could not be 
reached for comment.   Sources close to the Louisville, KY native 
believe he has taken his signing bonus, some cotton clothes, and his 
Jimmy Buffett CDs and fled to the tropics.  Today, Mr. Kelly is most 
likely sailing the Carribbean, writing adventure novels under an assumed 
pen name, and enjoying the local culture on and beside the ocean. 

 <hr> <b>Cenk Sensoy</b> a.k.a. "the diary man" fought a constant battle 
between finishing this class and his thesis, which he completed all in 
his 
first year of college.  Exhausted, he plans to spend his summer on the 
golf course.
