<b><center>General Rosser and General Custer</center></b>
<br></br>
They were cadets at West Point when the war came and classmates and 
intimate devoted friends, Rosser from Louisiana and Custer, I think, from 
Ohio. Each left West Point; Rosser to go with his state and Custer to go  
into the Union Army, bidding each other such a goodbye and with their 
personal blessing, as one can imagine. But the strain upon their 
affection and admiration for one another never weakened all during life. 
Rosser was an officer in the Washington artillery of New Orleans for a 
while and then made Colonel of the famous fighting 5th Va. Cavalry 
Regiment. Though only about 25 years old he became a Brigadier and 
finally a Major General of Cavalry. Custer soon rose too to a Brigadier. 
In the many cavalry fights their commands were opposed and fought each 
other. Custer was a dandy a dude as we now call it, but was as dashing, as 
brave and able a Cavalry General as the Union Army ever had and nobody 
realized this more than our cavalry men. Sometimes we saw him leading his 
men, easily recognized by his long flowing yellow hair down on his 
shoulders one of his vanities. He generally wore,  'tis said, a fancy 
jacket or roundabout, scorning a regular coat. Unhappily for us, he, as 
was nearly always in our fights or battles the case, generally far and 
away outnumbered us. Towards the close of the war, Rosser and Custer 
often were pitched against each other and each saw the other in our 
fights and maneuvers It was the dream of each to capture the other and 
many message. did they send each other. Sometimes the one falling back or 
retreating leaving a note, chaffing or indulging in good natured rivalry.

After the war Rosser without a dollar in (his) pocket in Washington: 
Custer then about to go out West got Rosser an appointment as a surveyor 
on the then building Northern Pacific R. R. Rosser invested in land along 
the R .R. made a fortune and lived in St. Paul, Minn. He later rebuilt 
Courtland into a beautiful estate. Custer's command was protecting the 
surveyors on that Northern Pacific R. R. from the marauding Indians and 
it is said that in some of their fights Rosser was in the front on all 
occasions. Poor Custer was killed in the Custer massacre in the Big Horn 
battle with the Indians. Major Reno of the Union Cavalry and a brave 
fighter in the War was in Washington after Custer's death and drinking 
and swearing about Custer, whom he disliked for some reason Rosser 
overheard him and not being willing to hear his old friend abused it is 
said he kicked the drunken Reno out of the hotel.

	Rosser lost his fortune and became Post Master in Charlottesville 
Virginia. Some years ago when I went from Waynesboro over to University 
of Virginia I called to see General Rosser at the Post Office. when he 
said for me to enter his private office he arose and threw his arms 
around me saying "Clinton God bless you! What are you doing here? He 
invited me to his house in the country and I have a thousand times sorely 
regretted that I did not go.  He said "Why Bettie, (his wife) would love 
to see you." He and his wife both are now dead. I have loved no man more 
than I did General Rosser. God bless him and his!
