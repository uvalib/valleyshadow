SRC="homesteps.jpg">During 
the war, the ligaments which connected home and battlefront 
were tightly stretched as soldiers traveled far away from home and 
experienced a life they had never known.  Writing letters home provided a 
mechanism to maintain those connections and to transport soldiers back to 
loved ones and familiar places. Letters, as well as diaries, were an 
outlet of expression for the range of events experienced by the soldier, 
from long days in camp to horrors of the battlefield, as well as the pain 
and loneliness they felt from being away from home.<br>
<P>
While mail was greatly desired on both fronts during the war, 
correspondence  
was often very difficult.  Especially in the South, it was sometimes a 
challenge even to find paper and pen. Mail service was slow at best, and 
soldiers often relied on furloughed soldiers and visitors to camp to 
deliver their letters back to their homes. Time to write was often 
limited as well, as soldiers spent weeks at a time marching and fighting. 
<P>
Soldiers longed to receive letters from home, as they were starved for 
information about family, friends, and local events. Many letters 
conclude with pleadings for quick replies and information. A letter from <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0317.html"> A.H. 
Byars</A> to his sister illustrates how much mail from home was desired: 
"Please excuse this short, badly written and disconnected letter and 
write soon, very soon and give me all the news...excuse haste and write 
soon."  Soldiers often wrote about what they wanted to hear, asking 
questions about particular family members or local issues. After long 
paragraphs asking questions and wondering about home, many letters would 
briefly state that there was not much news to report where they were.
<P>
Letters, in addition to asking about events from home, contained detailed 
descriptions of what aspects of home the soldiers were missing.  In a 
letter to his brother, A.W. Kersh writes at length about <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0331.html">acquaintances from home</A> that he has seen and any news that they have reported. 
Soldiers wrote about how much they would like to return home and see the 
people they love.  They missed not only people, but particular events or 
characteristics of their pre-war lifestyle. Sometimes these were very 
simple things, such as <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www?specfile=/web/data/civilwar/hius403/hius403.o2w&act=surround&offset=392115&tag=John+J+Miller+">Pennsylvania 
water</A> as described by John J. 
Miller. Similarly, in his diary Gallaher reflects about indulging in  <A 
HREF="dcgdiary10.html">whiskey 
and eggnog</A> while he was at home over Christmas. Other times, soldiers 
mention abstract themes, such as 
freedom. In a letter to his cousin Kate, James R. McCutchan describes<A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0314.html"> 
 what he misses about home:</A> "Here I am 
now cut off from my friends and all that is dear to one from society & 
enjoyment of every kind. How often I think of the past when I was free as 
the little birds that sing their songs among the branches. I did not know 
how to appreciate home, friendship, society, pleasures or anything else 
then but now I can see when I am cut off from all these blessings." These 
letters were a way to reconnect with those missed at home, and to keep in 
mind the joys of home in the face of the death, boredom, and harsh 
conditions with which they were dealing.
<P>
One particular aspect keenly missed by the soldiers was the ladies from 
their home towns. They describe how much they long for the sight or 
company of a woman. Soldiers often ask about particular ladies, and 
request that regards be given to them. Sometimes they just write more 
generally about missing women, as James R. McCutchan laments, "Here I 
never see the face of a woman. 'Ah woman - those whose form and whose 
(illegible word) are the light & the life of 
each path we pursue; Whether warmed at the tropic, or chilled at the 
pole, If woman is there, there is happiness, too.'" Again, the letters 
were a way for the soldiers to express their thoughts about the things 
they missed from home.
<P>
Contrasted with the harsh realities of war, letters to loved ones, 
especially wives and sweethearts, were strikingly tender.  The letters 
were a reminder of the sentiments felt by the soldiers, and a way to 
focus on something other than the war. <A 
HREF="mox.html"> The Lucius Mox 
collection</A> contains several letters to his sweetheart, Jennie, in which 
he makes many references to his feelings for her and his hopes for their 
future. He tells her, "Now, Jennie, you have heard what I have long 
wished to say I love you as truly as a man can love and ... if you will 
concent to become the wife of this 'ugly, mean, rascal' you will make me 
the happiest man in the Yankee Army."  Letters from soldiers to their 
wives also reflect a desire to be home. P.H. Powers writes to his wife: 
"A little stove keeping [our tent] warm, but not as comfortable as by 
your side. No other place can be. I miss you. how I long to be with you 
again."
Letter-writing allowed soldiers to mentally transport themselves to 
the life and places they loved. Thinking about home and the loved ones 
there, and writing 
about those thoughts, was a way for the soldiers to reconnect with the 
familiarity of home in the strangeness of war.
