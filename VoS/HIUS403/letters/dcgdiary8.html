To our amazement and delight when they saw Sweeneys men coming 
they thought of course it was their scouting party who had gone to 
Moorefield and was returning, and they actually tool: down the fence and 
hailed our men. It was raining and it was a dark misty morning and then 
too late they discovered their fatal mistake and every man of them was 
captured and very quietly too. So the alarm was not given at all! Rosser 
divided Into three parts; one rushed down the valley to the R. D. 
Station, one to the camp OD the left hill side and the third to the 
battery of artillery on the hill to the right. Never were people more 
surprised, for they had no idea any Confederates were within 100 miles of 
them! It was all over in a half bur. The main objective of the raid was 
to pet cattle for Lee's starving army. We gathered up about 500 fine 
cattle, several hundreds horses and about 700 prisoners and got away from 
there that afternoon. I picked up a wonderful little mule to send home to 
my little brother Hugh, who rode and kept him at home. That night many of 
our prisoners escaped and of these we cared little for we had a hard time 
feeding our own men and prisoners already in our prisons south. Many 
years after I met a member of the West Virginia Legislature who told me 
his brother, a Yankee soldier, was captured there and another brother was 
the officer in charge of the prisoners that night and the Confederate 
"winked at" the Yankee brothers escapee who was later killed near 
Richmond. We burned the depot and many supplies and I got a Sutlers trunk 
and found it full of nice clothing, notably fine woolen outside shirts, a 
fine pair of trousers, which after the war I wore and called my "New 
Creek. Pants." Also many years after when I was a member of the 
Democratic State Executive Committee in West Virginia, there was a fellow 
member, Col. Tom Davis, a brother of Senator Henry G. Davis. He told me I 
must visit him at Keyser.(formerly as stated "New Creek") I told him I 
was there once and recalled our raid there and when I told him we had 
burned a big white painted store, when I had filled a bag full of 
plunder, he said, "Why you little rascal! That was MY store!" He was a 
union man and we had a good laugh over it. The Yankees sent a large force 
to intercept us from out of Cumberland but they were too late and we got 
away with all our booty. That night, we rode back to a Union man's placea 
Mr. Babb whose son Charlie, I afterwards served many years on the Board 
of Regents of the TV. Va. University and we often talked of that raid.

<b> November 28th:</b>Left Mr. Babb and that afternoon stopped at 
Petersburg and stayed at a Mr. Cunninghams. They had several very pretty 
daughters and the family gave us a glorious welcome and those people had 
more to eat than we had seen anywhere during the war, for very seldom did 
any soldier of any army ever go there. The snow, a deep one, had fallen 
and some of us got out an old sleigh and took the girls out riding. I 
often me "Jake" Cunningham (who `` as the son of that family) in 
Charleston as he was an official in the Legislature. He said his family 
often spoke of me as the youngest and smallest one of our party there. We 
and our horses were certainly in cover there.
