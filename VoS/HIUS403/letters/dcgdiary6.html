<b>October 10th:</b>Arrived at General Rosser's headquarters, who 
welcomed me heartily, near Columbia Furnace in the "Back Road" in 
Shernandoah County.
<br></br> 
<b>October 15th:</b> General Rosser had me detailed to be at his 
head-quarters, nominally as a "courier," but really with all the 
privileges of a staff officer-riding and messing with him.  It was no 
soft place, however, for he was as brave as a lion and he expected 
everybody around him to be in the thickest of the fight, carrying orders 
to the front, and to be with him and at his side whatever the danger and 
had no use for any other kind.
<br></br> 
<October 16th:</b>Lie in camp all day.  I carrying orders and dispatches 
from General Rosser to the different commands.  He was then in command of 
Fitz Lee's whole division, as well as his own Laurel Brigade-the 7th, 
11th, 12th Regiments and Whites Battalion of the 11th Regiment.  Hugh 
McGuire was captain of Co. E.  He married my sister, Sallie, January 
12th, 1865 and killed on Lee's retreat, dying at Amelia Springs, 
Virginia.  No braver trooper ever lived!

<b>October 17th</b>We go on a raid at night and ride all night nearly 
and  surround and capture a picket of Yankees forty four in number.  Some 
of our boys who lived in that vicinity guided us on by-paths until we got 
between the picketing battalion and their main body. Our raid was for the 
purpose of learning the location of the enemy's cavalry as to which we 
succeeded fully.
<br></br>
	<b>October 18th:</b>We rest all day in camp but about 10:00 p. m. 
we saddle up and start towards the enemy, and about 3:00 a. m. we ride 
into their pickets capturing them and about daylight we gallop into their 
main body's camp. Many of them were up and getting their coffee, etc. 
They scampered away leaving many prisoner,  We followed and found them 
massed in thousands ready for us. These were all cavalry and horse 
artillery on the right flank of Sheridan's army. Soon, we heard heavy 
firing on our
right where the infantry were. It proved to be Gordon's Division mainly 
who in the night had scaled the mountain side on Sheridans left flank and 
broken into the camp of the 8th army Corps of Sheridan, before they were 
up out of bed, capturing great numbers, all their artillery, camp, etc. 
The Yankees were  dumbfounded and panic stricken and fled with a "devil 
take the hindmost" race. Sheridans whole army began to retreat in great 
disorder towards Winchesterabout 16 miles away. "The day was lost" as it 
seemed to them and to us. About 3:00 p.m. General Rosser sent me along 
our front to obtain some information and to my disgust and amazement I 
beheld our infantry scattered and plundering in the Yankee's recent Camps 
and the Yankees rallying and about to advance, which later they did and 
upon reporting this to General Rosser, he ordered our cavalry company to 
fall back to the South Side of the creek where his horse artillery 
galloped and went into position on the hills. There we awaited their 
snack, but they did not attack us, though we stayed there until after 
dark. From our position we could see our infantry retreating in great 
disorder just as the enemy had done in the early morning.  Briefly, the 
facts were these: Our men were half starved.  When they got into the 
Yankee's camp, and found "real stores of supplies they stopped and went 
to looting and plundering despite the efforts of their officers to induce 
them to follow the retreating enemy, but they moved not, except only a 
few.  Sheridan was in Washington that morning and hearing his army had 
been surprised and was retreating, he came on a special train to 
Winchester (100) miles and about 4:30 p. m. reformed 0a retreating army 
at Middletown or New Town end forced them towards our army, scattered and 
demoralized with plundering. As he had three or four times as many as Early,
<br></br>
the result was a terrible defeat for us. They captured hundreds, 
recaptured all their artillery which we had captured; the forenoon and 
nearly al1 of Early's arti1ery besides. There is a narrow roadway on the 
Pike along there and a bridge and there being a jam and stoppage of 
wagons and artillery there,
the capture was easily made of all our artillery (nearly) and a big wagon 
train.  Early fell back to Fisher's Hill that night about 4 miles from 
the early morning fighting.  About 9:00 p. m. General Rosser sent me over 
to General Early's on the Pike to learn the situation and to ask for 
orders. II was some miles away and about midnight I found him and his 
staff asleep near he Pike on Fisher's Dill. He was awakened
and sent word to Rosser fully as to his plans. Meanwhile, I delivered 
Rosser's request to General Early to have one of Rosser's Regiments 
called in which was picketting on our extreme right on detached duty, as 
our cavalry's main body was on Early's left flank. General Early said he 
had no one to send
and that I would have to call the Regiment in as he would fall back; at 
daylight. So I had to go. It was a rather ticklish business. The Regiment 
was some three or four miles away and the night very dark and I knew 
absolutely nothing of the roads.  I was told they were along: Cedar 
Creel;. So off I started, riding with ears open and my pistol in my right 
hand ready for trouble. Finally passing through some very dark; \woods, I 
was challenged by a picket. Not knowing if I had run into a Yankee or 
riot, I wheeled my horse around ready to escape, if I had struck; the 
enemy. I inquired of the picket "what Regiment is yours?" He replied and 
then, knowing who was in command of it that day, I asked him who was in 
command and he answering correctly; I advanced and told him to start out 
of there at once. So about daylight we reached the Pike where we found 
the army had left and only a rear guard just moving off.  Had we been a 
half hour later we would have been captured.  By this time, I was about 
"all in," and so was my horse for I had ridden on him tbe night before 
and all day and all night just gone, and had nothing to eat for either 
man or beast except a few crackers and some oats and corn gathered from 
the Yankee Camp.
