Peter Boyer served as a private in Company C, 117th Pennsylvania 
Volunteers, 17th Pennsylvania Cavalry.  He was musterered in to service 
on October 19, 1862 at Lancaster, PA.  Several other companies 
throughout the regiment came from Franklin County.  He served throughout the 
war, eventually being discharged on August 7, 1865, in Louisville, KY.
<P>
Peter's regiment consisted of mainly farmers, lumberjacks, and mechanics, 
yet was one of the most famed of all Pennsylvania units.  The 117th first 
saw action at the battle of Occoquan Creek, where they repulsed superior 
and larger Confederate  forces under the command of Jeb Stuart and Stonewall 
Jackson. <P>
In February of 1863, Boyer's company was assigned to escort General 
George Meade's Fifth Corp of the Army of the Potomac. Frustrated by the 
mundane duties of transmitting orders and acting as escort, Boyer relayed 
much of his frustration through letters to his father.  
<P>
Soon, however, Boyer and the 117th were placed under the command of General 
John Buford.  Boyer's company, escorted by shouts and cheers from the 
townspeople along the way,  headed north through Maryland and into 
Pennsylvania.  On July 1st, the 117th crossed through the town of Gettysburg 
and into action with a large number of Confederate troops under Jubal 
Early.  Badly outnumbered, Boyer and his fellow troops held the high 
ground for four hours, allowing General Reynolds time to move up with a 
large 
contingent of Union infantry.  This high ground, gained on the first 
days' battle at Gettysburg, proved essential to the Union victory.
<P>
Throughout the remaining year of the war, Boyer saw action at Cold 
Harbor and Petersburg.  The 117th finished the war at Appomattox, where 
surrender came on April 9, 1865.
