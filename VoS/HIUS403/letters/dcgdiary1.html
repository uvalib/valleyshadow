I accepted a position on General John D. Imboden's staff with the rank of 
Captain, as aide-de-camp, while his command was operating in the 
Shenandoah Valley.  Though he was very kind to me and I was "messed" with 
him and his stagg and we had orderlies and colored servants and 
everything to make a soldier's life comparatively pleasant, I very 
foolishly(I now think)became afraid the war would end without my being in 
some big battle.  So I, in October, 1863, resigned all the comforts of a 
staff officer and joined as a private in Co E, 1st Virginia Cavalry, then 
down with General R.E.Lee's army on the Rapidan River, Culpepper County, 
Virginia.  While with Imboden, we made one or two raids into Hardy 
County, now West Virginia, and had some sharp fighting; but I longed to 
be "with Lee" all the time.

General Grant crossed the Rappahannock and the Rapidan rivers May 2nd, 
1864 and from that hour until the 12th of May, the battle-the greatest of 
the war in duration and losses-raged fiercly.  Our Cavalry Command went 
after Sheridan's Yankee Cavalry raiders who were making for Richmond.  
General J.E.B. Stuart was killed at "Yellow Tavern," about 15 from 
Richmond and Sheridan went back and joined Grant, who was still pressing 
Lee with about four times as big an army as Lee's.  Captain Hugh McGuire, 
my brother in law, was wounded May 5th, at the "Wilderness" and 
afterwards mortally wounded on Lee's Retreat, April 6th, 1865.  Early in 
June (1864) Sheridan, with a very heavy force of Cavalry and Horse 
Artillery with all men mounted started out again to get to Richmond and 
capture it and libearte the Yankee prisoners there while Grant was 
holding Lee from protecting Richmond.

<B>June 11-12:</B>Fight at Louisa C.H., and a very hard one at 
Trivillians Station on the old Va. Central (Now Chesapeake and Ohio) Rail 
Road.  Here I got a fine Yankee Carbine (a short shot gun for cavalry), 
discarding my old one.  We badly worsted Sheridan so much that he tried 
to get back to Grant as fast as he could.
