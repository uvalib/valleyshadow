Collected in this website are 100 letters from Augusta County and 
Franklin County.  The letters contained here are primarily from 
enlisted men, representing  several divisions of 
the Union and Confederate Armies.  They also include correspondence 
from family and friends of these soldiers.  Letters were written from all fronts, as regiments from 
these counties traveled throughout Pennsylvania and Virginia, south to 
the Carolinas, and west to Tennessee. The letters span early 1861 
until the summer of 1865, after the Confederacy surrendered.

By using the searchable database, it is possible to see examples of the 
themes highlighted on the interpretive pages of this site.  For 
example, to explore the hypothesis that letters from both North and South 
were similar in nature, enter a keyword such as "home".  The search 
reveals 63 matches from letters of Franklin County.  Similarly, there are 
70 matches from the Augusta letters.  In keeping with the simple 
interests of soldiers from Franklin and Augusta, the keyword "fishing" appears a total 
of 9 times, while a controversial issue such as "slavery" appears only 
3 times.

The diaries presented in this archive offer an intimate view into 
the minds of soldiers and civilians of Augusta and Franklin Counties. The 
true feelings of 
the authors are reflected in their entries and we are left with an often 
blunt but honest representation of their daily experiences and outlook on 
the war. The diaries vividly represent that life during the Civil War was 
hours of sheer boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror. The 
diaries seem to have been an outlet for the writers to express their 
thoughts and feelings as they faced this new experience.
