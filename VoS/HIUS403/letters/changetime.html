The
outlook of soldiers in <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0314.html">1861</a> 
differed greatly from the opinion of the <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/F0115.html">hardened 
veteran</a> of 1865. In 1861, soldiers reflected upon the excitement 
of receiving their uniforms, news of friends from home in nearby 
regiments, and the possibility of seeing action in their first 
engagement. <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/F0154.html">Later in 
the war</a>, men spoke of <A 
HREF="themedeath.html">death</a> 
in a matter of fact 
tone, asked if their discharged friends had made it home, or concerned 
themselves with the remaining days of their own enlistment. 
<P>
	The historian Bell Wiley hypothesized that if the Civil War 
writings of both North and South were tossed into the air, it would be 
impossible to separate them again by original region. Indeed, it seems 
that the central issues the <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/F0134.html">Franklin 
County soldier</a> concerned himself 
with were the same as his <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0349.html">Augusta 
counterpart</a>. Regardless of ideological 
affiliation, soldier's thoughts surrounded the common themes of military 
life, spirituality, and life at home.
<P>
	The boredom and terror of military life affected all soldiers. 
<A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-hius403?specfile=/web/data/civilwar/hius403/hius403.o2w">Camp 
life</a> formed the greatest subject of writings, often describing 
monotonous duties such as picket or guarding prisoners. Soldiers to the 
best of their logistical abilities also cataloged troop movements. Battle 
scenes were often dramatic but closed quickly, leaving the details to 
the newspapers. It seemed the soldiers were more concerned with family 
and friends.
<P>
	The soldiers longed for details about life at home. They often 
requested "the particulars" of life at home, a description of the ladies, 
recent marriages, or details of business arrangements. Life at home went 
on during the war, and the writings of soldiers seemed to serve as a 
connection with the world they had left behind.
<P>
	Religion and spirituality emerged in unison with the previous 
themes of military service and life at home. Away from home, and 
surrounded by the death and carnage of battle, men exercised their strong 
beliefs, and questioned the value of human life. Testimonials to fallen 
friends characterized letters of both Augusta and Franklin. 
<P>
	Although they approached the war with great fervor in 1861, the 
reality of total warfare had set in by the <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0349.html">end of 
the war</a>. Throughout the 
war years, the issues of military service, home front, and spirituality 
maintained their utmost importance to the Civil War writers of Augusta 
and Franklin County.
