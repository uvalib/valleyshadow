DeWitt Clinton Gallaher was born in Sheperdstown in Jefferson County, 
Virginia on August 2, 1845.  As a youth he moved with his family 
to Waynesboro, Virginia.  Gallaher was educated at Hampden-Sidney 
College, Washington College (now Washington and Lee University), and the 
University of Virginia.

He moved to Charleston, West Virginia following the war and began practicing 
law. On July 27, 1876 Gallaher married Florence Walton Miller.
In 1919 Gallaher began compiling a booklet from the memo books and the 
scraps of paper that managed to survive the war. The experiences depicted in 
this diary reflect the period that Dewitt Clinton Gallaher served in the 
Confederate Army during the "War Between the States."

Gallaher served from the spring of 1863 until April 9, 1865.  Originally, 
he was 
assigned as a captain and aide de camp to General Imboden's staff.  Gallaher 
also  served in Company E in the First  Virginia 
Cavalry as a courier for General J.E.B. Stuart.  He later served 
under General Fitzhugh Lee and General T.L. Rosser.
