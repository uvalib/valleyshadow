Historians have often characterized the Civil War as long periods of 
drudgery and boredom punctuated by moments of extreme excitement and 
terror.  Soldiers often grew complacent with their life in camp, learning 
to perform the mundane tasks of drill and physical labor which consumed 
the majority of their days.  In times of battle, soldiers felt immense 
fear and panic, remedied quickly by terrible excitement and adventure.  
These two spheres of military life, camp and battle, formed the subject 
of many letters and diaries from Franklin and Augusta Counties.
<P>
Letter writing and diary keeping formed one of the main distractions from 
the <A 
HREF="rankin2.html">boredom</a> of 
camp life.  Soldier's writings reflected in large part many 
camp activities, testaments to the ordered life of a soldier, commanded by the 
bugle and drum.  Many writers described <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0338.html">fatigue 
duty</a>-- jobs such as 
cutting wood, policing deserters, or unloading cargo from wagons.  The 
duties of<a href="dcgdiary4.html"> 
  standing picket</a> and standing guard over prisoners also occupied 
time in camp.  <P>
Peaceful days in camp began with reveille at five or six o'clock 
in the morning, followed by drilling throughout the morning, and 
again in the evening.  Soldiers often spent free time readying quarters 
for inspection or enjoying recreational activities.  <A 
HREF="http://etext.Virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0349.html">Music</a>, 
gambling, and other entertainments such as <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/F0164.html">hunting</a>, 
sharpshooting, or writing 
filled the majority of a soldier's free time.  Late in the evening, 
the last roll call, or "tattoo", would send the soldiers off to 
quarters for the night.

Soldiers' wrote about other aspects of camp life as well.  These 
topics often included getting paid, which usually came late, 
sometimes six months after scheduled payment.  While soldiers were 
not wealthy by any mean, parts of their pay often accompanied 
letters home.  Another occupation in camp was to journal daily 
happenings, and in particular, <A 
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/civilwar/hius403/browse/A0340.html">the 
weather</a>.  Letters 
and diaries from Franklin and Augusta are sprinkled throughout with many 
references to seasonal conditions.
<P>
The terror in a soldiers' life came with the expectation and 
occurrence of battle. Soldiers often reflected upon the haste and 
excitement of battles in their letters and diaries.  Usually a 
feeling of fear dominated all thoughts, immediately prior to battle, 
but with the firing of the first shots, excitement took over, and 
men felt a certain sense of power and freedom as they engaged the 
enemy at first across the terrain and ultimately in hand to hand 
combat.
<P>
Not all soldiers made battles the main focus of their letters.  
Those with better educations often assumed their relatives might 
read the newspapers and obtain battle descriptions from the 
accounts.  Those with less of an education, often included long 
descriptions about the fight in their letters.  Regardless, the men 
of both Franklin and Augusta were anxious to let family and friends 
know of their surviving a battle.  Many times in the letters 
immediately following battle, writers asked of friends and family 
members' whereabouts and safety.
<P>
In using writing as a distraction from military life, the soldiers 
also found a way to escape much of the harsh realties of war.  Even 
if only in the portrayal of mundane events such as pay day or the 
taking of a prisoner, the men of Franklin and Augusta could relate 
their lives at the front, with the familiarity of home that they 
left behind.
