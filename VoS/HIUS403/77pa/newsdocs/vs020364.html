<body><center>The 77th Regiment Pa. Vols.</center>
<p>We understand from private sources, that the members of this gallant 
Regiment which covered itself with laurels on the hard-fought fields of 
the South west, have almost to a man, re enlisted for three years, and 
are now on their way home on a furlough of thirty days. The gallant men 
of the 77th deserve a cordial welcome and high honors.</p>
