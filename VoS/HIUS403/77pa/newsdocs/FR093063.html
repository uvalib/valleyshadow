A Word to Women</center><br><br>
The loyal women in every community have exerted a vast influence in 
sustaining the war and the government.  Let them remember that in no 
way can they better uphold thei country at this hour than by influencing 
votes <I>for</I> Curtin and <I>against</I> Woodward.  They can influence 
fathers, husbands, and sons.  To the young women we would say, that if 
after trying all their persuasive eloquence on their suitors they prove 
to be incorrigible Copperheads, give them the <i>mitten</i> all at once.  
Don't waste a smile on a fellow who refuses either by bullet or ballot to 
help put down the rebellion.  Make these bucks face the Union music 
square, or go under!  The sick and wounded soldiers everywhere bless our 
noble women. They will bestow upon them additional blessings if they aid 
in electing the soldier's truest friend, Andrew G. Curtin.
