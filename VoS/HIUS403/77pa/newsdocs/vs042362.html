<p><center>Great Victory at Pittsburg Landing</center></p>
<p>The booming of cannon and the sound of musketry accompanied by the news of victory has again thrilled the patriotic, loyal, American heart.  The past week has been one of incalculable importance to the country, and will form another memorable epoch in 
the history of the great American Republic.  Pittsburg Landing, a small and insignificant place on the Tennessee river, near the boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Mississippi, will forever hereafter be historic ground.  The greatest battle
 ever fought in this country was fought there in the beginning of last week, between the Union armies under Generals Grant and Buell, and the Rebel armies commanded by Generals Beauregard and A. Sydney Johnston.  The Rebel troops exhibited an obstinate br
avery and determination to succeed in the fight, worthy of a better cause, but they were compelled finally, after two days of terrific carnage, to give way before the invincible courage and indomitable energy of the Union Troops.</p>
<p>The battle commenced about day-break on Sunday morning, the 6th instant, and raged with incessant fury (night only excepted,) until about half past five o'clock on Monday afternoon, when the enemy's left began to waver, and Gen. Grant, in person, at th
e head of five Regiments, made a terrific charge upon their lines which decided the fate of the day, and victor perched upon the banner of the Union.  This closed the great battle of Pittsburg Landing, the particulars of which we give elsewhere in to-day'
s paper.</p>
