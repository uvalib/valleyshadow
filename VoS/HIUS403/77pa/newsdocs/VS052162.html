<P><center>From the Wars.</center></P>

<P>Nip Scott an individual of the kullered persuasion, who held the 
distinguished position of private commissary to the Colonel of the 77th 
Pennsylvania regiment, returned from the wars last week covered all over 
with glory.  Nip is quite a lion among the wolves of Wolfstown while 
fighting his battles o'er again and recounting his hair-breadth escapes 
on field and flood.  Nip called to see us and gave a "gleamy" account of 
our boys in Tennessee.  He considers the 77th the crack regiment of the 
army--that it did all the fighting, took all the prisoners and killed all 
the rebels at Pittsburg Landing he is quite sure.--It would excite Nip's 
belligerent propensities to a very unsafe degree to say anything against 
the 77th in his presence.  Nip has one trait about him that we 
admire--<I>his modesty,</I> and it would be worthy of imitation by all 
who have seen the elephant.  We inquired of Nip if he was in the battle?<br>
"No sa I warn't."<br>
"How near were you to the fight?"<br>
"Well you see de Colonel, in de afternoon you see, sent for me you see, 
to bring him somthin to eat you see.  I slung de habbersack ober my back 
and started for de field on de double quick you see, and got up shar de 
balls war wixxen and den--"<br>
"Well, what then Nip?"<br>
"I'd radder you wouldn't ax me anything more 'bout dat."<br>
"You didn't retreat I hope?"<br>
"No s-a-r.  Dat is not de word we use out dar--I <I>retired</I>, an in 
good order."<br>
"Did the Colonel get nothing to eat all day?"<br>
"No no, nuffin by dis individual nigger."<br>
"Were you afraid of being shot?"<br>
"No, sa, but I didn't want to be."<br>
Discretion is evidently the better part of valor in Nip's estimation, and 
it would be as well for all those who have a <I>natural aversion</I> to 
smelling powder to "acknowledge the corn" as frankly as Nip Scott.</P>
