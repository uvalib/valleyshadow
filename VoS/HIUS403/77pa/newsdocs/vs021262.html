<p><center>Recruits Wanted </center></p>
<p> Lieut. Joseph Thomas, of Company A., Sergeant Snider, of Company G, and A. K. Moor, of Company F., of the 77th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, now in active service in Kentucky, have been detailed to open a recruiting station at this place, and we 

are pleased to learn that they are meeting with very flattering success.  They are enlisting <I>specially</I> to fill up the ranks of the 77th Regiment, but will take recruits for any other Regiment, or for any kind of service, and will furnish transporta

tion to join anywhere in the army that the recruit may desire.--  We would unhesitatingly say to our young men, who design going into the army, that there is not better opportunity for enlistment than that offered by Lieut. Thomas.  He is an officer posse

ssing good knowledge of military affairs, and a man of integrity of 
character, whatever promises therefore he makes to a recruit, may be 
implicitly relied upon.  Recruits would do well to select the 77th 
Regiment in which to serve.  They will be sure of getting into active 
service right off, and have the honor of serving inder competent and 
experienced officers.--All who desire to aid the Government by enlisting 
in the army are invited to call, and whatever information they may desire 
will be cheerfully given.--Recruiting Office on West Market Street, 
directly opposite the residence of Dr. Boyle, a few doors from the Public 
Square.</p> </body>
