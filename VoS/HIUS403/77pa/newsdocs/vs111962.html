<title>Valley Spirit, November 19, 1862</title>
<body><center>Col. F.S. Stumbaugh.</center>
<p>We had the pleasure, a few days since, of again taking by the hand 
Col. F. S. Stumbaugh who is at his home in this place.  He has been 
compelled to retire, temporarily, from his command in consequence of 
impaired health.  The Regiment under his command has been in service in 
Kentucky and Tennessee for a period of more than a year, and has, in the 
different sections in which it was engaged, reflected Honor on the Old 
Keystone state.  The Colonel has, for some time, been in command of a 
Brigade, and by his efficiency and gallantry has merited and should 
receive a commission as Brigadier General.</p>
