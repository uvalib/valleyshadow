<P><center>Letter from the Battle Field.</center><P>
<P>We make the following extract from a private letter written by Lieut. 
Col. Housum from the battle field of Shiloh.  It contains the latest 
information from that quarter.</P>
<P>Near Pittsburg Landing, Tenn., April 10<P>
<P>Sonce writing yesterday we have moved our camp one and a-half miles 
further out on the Corinth road.  I was trying to have it done for 
several days past.  The stench from dead men and horses was awful.  Close 
to where my tent was, 14 rebels and two of our men were buried, about a 
half mile off, in one grave were buried over 200 rebels.  I have seen 
some most awful sights and hope to God I may never witness the like 
again.  On last Tuesday morning after the battle, we began to hunt up 
dead men scattered about singly.  At one place a cannon-ball had passed 
through a large oak tree and afterwards killed 5 rebels by passing 
through their breasts, and they all laid in one heap as they fell.  At 
another place 5 men were torn to pieces by the explosion of a shell and 
another 7 were killed by a shell.  I saw where one man had been torn to 
pieces, so much so that only about one half of him could be found, to be 
burried.  At one place, about the size of a lot, were found the bodies of 
about 60 rebels, many of them must have only been wounded; after they 
fell the woods caught fire and burned them all to death, burning the 
clothes entirely from their bodies.  That was the most awful sight I waw 
on the whole battle-field.  The rebels never sent back to bury their 
dead, or to take care of their wounded.  Many a poor fellow wounded lay 
out from Sunday until Tuesday before he was found.  I have no doubt but 
many of the wounded died who could have been saved if they could have 
been found sooner.  The ground on which this battle was fought is 7 miles 
wide by 10 miles long.  Some of our scouts returned last night and report 
the bodies of hundreds of rebels still unburied about six miles in 
advance, and almost within their lines.  It is most inhuman in them to 
allow their dead to remain unburied.  They carried some of their wounded, 
from the field on Sunday, dressed their wounds for them, filled their 
haversacks adn left them to die.  I saw one man on Wednesday after the 
battle who had been dead some time sith a cracker in his hand, as if he 
had been eating it when he died.  We suffered after the battle for want 
of water.  There were plenty of small streams running through the ground, 
but as a matter of course the blood would destroy it for drinking 
purposes.  I drank water that I could taste the blood in it, but latterly 
it tasted worse than that, and we cannot use it at all.  The Major of the 
34th Illinois, (Levanway,) had his head shot off by a cannonball soon 
after we got into action.  The Colonel of the same regiment is severely 
wounded.  The Colonel of the Indiana regiment, (S.S. Bass,) was badly 
wounded and has since died.  Our regiment escaped, how, I cannot tell.  
We had only eight men wounded and one missing.  One of the wounded, 
Thomas McElwee, has since died--[I have just learned that he is still 
living.]  The missing man is supposed to have been killed during the 
battle.  Horses were killed without number.  Our regiment at one fire 
killed over 20 horses, and 6 or 8 men, belonging to a rebel battery of 
Artillery, when they ran and left the cannon in our possession.  We fired 
into a regiment of rebel cavalry near the close of the battle, and some 
of the rebel prisoners say we killed and wounded about 50 men.  Our guns 
are splendid.  I consider them the best in the service.  The 77th is the 
only Pennsylvania regiment that was in the battle.  The battery came up 
day before yesterday. --They were in hearing of the fight but could not 
get here for which they appeared sorry.  For my part I am well satisfied 
that they were not here as it was a hard battle on artillerists.</P>
<P>Yours, &c.,<br>
