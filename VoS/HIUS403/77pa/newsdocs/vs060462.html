<body><center>Sick Soldier.</center>
<p>We regret to learn that Capt. S.R. McKesson, of Company A, 77th 
Regiment Penna. Volunteers, was obliged to leave his company on account 
of bad health, on the 15th of last month, at Pittsburg Landing, 
Tennessee.  At the time Capt. McKesson started for home he was very illa 
nd his company doubted his ability to accomplish the journey.  For 
several weeks he was not heard from when his family accidentally learned 
that he was in St. Louis, in one of the Military Hospitals, "doing well." 
It would seem that he took a St. Louis boat and being too sick to leave 
at C..., or for some other reason, went up to St. Louis, where the 
accommodations for sick soldiers are much better than along the Ohio.  We 
have no doubt he found friends there who provided for his every want, 
bring a member of both the Masonic fraternity and Order of Odd Fellows, 
he would be well cared for.  We trust he may regain his health, lost in 
the service of his country, as he proved himself a brave soldier on the 
battle field on that bloody day the 7th of April.  Capt. McKesson was one 
of our most highly esteemed citizens, and he has the best wishes of his 
entire community for his speedy restoration to health and safe return to 
his family.</p>
