<body><center>The 77th In Another Battle</center>
<p>A reconnaissance in force of the enemy's position on the Corinth road 
was made on the morning of the 24th ult., in which the 77th regiment P.V. 
took part.  This regiment was in advance of the Division and when about 
nine miles from the landing they came upon a rebel encampment.  The 
rebels formed in line of battle, delivered a volley and fled.  Our troops 
took possession of their camp, and a force was detailed to follow them 
up.  The 77th formed part of the detail and in the evening heavy firing 
was heard in front and some sharp work was supposed to be progressing.  
The result was not known when the account of the reconnaissance was 
written.  A letter from Col. Housum, dated 28th makes no mention of any 
of the Franklin county men being killed or wounded.</p></body></html>
