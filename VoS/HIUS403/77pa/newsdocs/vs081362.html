<p>Correspondence of the Spirit and Times.<br>
Lebanon, Ky. August 6th, 1862<br>
</p>
<p>Messrs. Editors:--<I>Sirs</i>--I had the pleasure a few days ago to 
get my hands on your valuable paper of the 16th of July, and was 
surprised to see my Thompkinsville letter meet with such good success, as 
to find a place in your columns, as it was my first attempt at newspaper 
correspondence.</p>
<p>Messrs. Editors permit me in the first place to correct an error in my 
last letter.  It being David H. Piper, who died at Gallatin Tenn. Martin 
Piper is now at home on furlough, and Jonathan Piper is at home as a 
paroled prisoner.</p)
<p>When this letter reaches you the news of our "skedaddle" from 
Thompkinsville will be old and stale.</p>
<p>After enjoying a month's rest at Thompkinsville, during which, time 
glided smoothly along, until Court commenced on the 7th of July, the 
citizens anticipating some trouble during court, Major Jordan was 
reinforced by Co. E., 2nd Batt., (Lt. Sullivan), in order to quell any 
disturbance,--increasing his force to about 250 effective men.</p>
<p>That same night (Monday) Maj. Jordan made and excursion over the 
Cumberland river to Celina, to see if there was any rebels lurking around 
there.  Seeing none, he marched back to camp, where he arrived at 1 P.M. 
Tuesday, haveing seen no signs of the enemy, we felt rather secure that 
night, having no idea that while we were crossing and recrossing the 
river at Celina, Morgan and his thieving band were crossing at Bennet's 
Ferry, a few miles above.  Wednesday, the 9th, at daylight, our pickets 
were driven in by Morgan's advanced guard, which rather surprised us.  We 
had barely time to dress, saddle up and form into line, when the enemy 
charged upon us. Although there was 8 to 1 we gave them a warm 
reception.  Morgan's force was 2,000, with 3 pieces of artillery, a 
Georgia regiment, a Tennessee regiment, and the Texan rangers who were 
defeated near Munfords-ville, by part of the 32nd Indiana, last winter.  
We gave them "Hail Columbia" until the shells commenced dropping around 
us, when Maj. Jordan ordered a retreat, shich was accomplished in good 
order till we got into the woods, when we were met by a volley from the 
Texan rangers.  By turning to the left we succeeded in getting throught a 
space they had not yet closed.  Although hardly pressed by the Rangers, 
our little band of patriots kept well together until the pooreer horses 
began to lag behind.  We were pursued about 5 miles, the Rangers 
succeeding in wounding the Major's horse in the shoulder and taking him 
prisoner, and killing Lieut. Sullivan of Co. H.</p>
<p>We retreated by way of Burkesville to Albany, where we arrived about 
10 p.m. and biovacked in the courthouse yard.  And instead of finding the 
protection there that we expected, from the 60th Indiana, Col. Owen and 
Maj. Brown with Co. K of the 9th Penna., we learned to our regret that 
they too had skedaddled, on the strength of the report that we had been 
cut to pieces by a large force who were advancing on Albany.  We left 
Albany at sunrise, Thursday, and overtook Col. Owen near the Cumberland 
river, which we recrossed and bivouacked for the night. That evening we 
got a light supper, after a fast of 48 hours and a skedaddle of 60 or 65 
miles. </p>
<p>The result of the enemy calling on the "Pennsylvania Dutch" at such an 
untimely hour should convince them that the "Keystone Boys" do not like 
to be disturbed before breakfast, as their loss was 30 killed and Col. 
Hunt of Georgia mortally wounded, who has since died.  Our loss was 4 
killed, Lieut. Sullivan of Butler county, Corp'l McClintoch of Perry 
county, and 2 unknown to me; 7 wounded and 20 prisoners, who were 
paroled, Jonathan Piper of Franklin, being among the paroled prisoners.</p>
<p>The officers and men of the 3rd Batt., 9th Reg't Pa. V.C. conducted 
themselves most gallantly.  The most remarkeable for coolness and bravery 
was Capt. Longsdorf of Company I. At no time during the action did he 
seem to be at aloss, until the Major gave the order to retreat which he 
seemed not comprehend the meaning of, as he only taught his men to fight 
and not to retreat.  During the fight he was in front of his company, and 
in the retreat he was found in the rear urging on the slower ones to make 
their escape, occasionally riding forward to get horses for them, and 
urging them onward.  Which was the cause of killing a fine blooded horse 
for him.  Although a strict disciplinarian, he askes nothing of his men 
only what it is their dity to do.  And in returns does all for them that 
is in his power to do. Consequently the boys think they have the best 
Captain, and he thinks he has the best company in the regiment.</p>
<p>Our 3rd Batt., lost everything except what they put on in a hurry, 
amounting to a loss of about 10,000 to the government.</p>
<p>Although we felt uneasy for the welfare of friends who were left 
behind, we still had some amusement on the road.  For the first 10 miles 
there was any amount of hats and caps to be seen, the bushes would pull 
them off and the boys would no stop to get them. So also revolvers.  To 
show the hardships that some endured that were so unfortunate as to be 
unhorsed on the way, I will relate a single circumstance: Sergeant Blain 
of Company C. was taken prisoner twice and escaped. C. J. Eckenrode was 
unhorsed on the way, and in trying to escape the pursuing rebels fell in 
with Sergeant Blain, and they did not catch up till Saturday night, 
having walked 42 miles that day, and a corresponding number each of the 
other days.</p>
<p>The most diabolical act committed during the present (accursed) 
rebellion, was done by one of the Texan Rangers while pursuing us.</p>
<p>They stopped at a house to get a drink, and after the young lady had 
satisfied their thirst, one asked her if she had seen any of "Lincoln 
hirelings" passing.  She replied that she had not, but htat she had seen 
some Union soldiers passing.  He then asked her which wasy they had went, 
and whe said she did not know, and if she did know she would not tell 
him, when he fired his gun at her and lodged a bullet and eight buckshot 
in her breast, lodging in her, visible throught the skin.  She lingered 
two days and died a martyr to the Union.</p>
<p>The 3rd Batt., and Company E of the 2nd with the 60th Indians, arrived 
here on Monday the 15th of July.  We rested till Friday when we drew 
fresh horses and new clothing and at noon started in pursuit of Morgan.  
At Danville we were reinforced by some of the 7th Kentucky cavalry, and a 
company of Home guards.  And at Richmond, which we took without firing a 
gun, we were joined by Col. Williams with the balance of the Lochiel, 
except Company G.  We continued to pursue Morgan at a safe distance, till 
near Somerset, when we were ordered back to Lebanon.  At Richmond (not 
Va, but Ky.) we were just 1 day behind Morgan, and though we had to take 
his leaving, we were most hospitably entertained by the loyal citizens.  
In fact every where we go here in Kentucky, we are treated very kindly, 
and sustain a good reputation.  We have been here now about ten days and 
at the fight have rejoined their respective commands.  We are under 
marching orders all the time.  Going so far once as to cook two days 
rations, and saddle our horses, which we had the pleasure to unsaddle 
again.  We are now under Gen. Clay Smith.</p>
<p>For fear of wearying the patience of your readers, I will bid you and 
them adieu for the present.</p><br>
