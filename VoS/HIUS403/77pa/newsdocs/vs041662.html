<p><center>The Chaplain of the 77th</center></p>
<p>Rev. J. M. Thomas, Chaplain of the 77th regiment, Pennsylvania volunteers, made a visit to this place on Wednesday last.  He left the regiment a short time ago at Nashville and the object of his visit here was to impart information, to those having fri
ends in that portion of the army, concerning their condition, and to take on his return any message they might have to send.  During his short stay here visited most of the families of those 77th regiment who reside in the place.  The Rev. gentleman gives
 a glowing account of the Franklin count soldiers.  He says their regiment is held in high esteem by the whole Brigade, and that in character and discipline it ranks among the best in the service.  He speaks in high terms of praise of the moral and physic
al condition of the men, few are ever observed intoxicated or heard using profane language.  Many hold regular prayer meetings, and other religious exercises, in their tents.  The general health, and physical condition of the regiment in every respect,  t
he Chaplain pronounces excellent.  The best felling exists among the officers of the regiment.  No bickerings, so common among military men, have taken place in the 77th.  The officers, one and all, are beloved by the privates and every attention that can
 in any way contribute to the comfort or happiness of the men is assiduously bestowed by their commanders.  We are much gratified to hear such a favorable account of our men through as reliable a source as the Chaplain of the regiment.</p>
