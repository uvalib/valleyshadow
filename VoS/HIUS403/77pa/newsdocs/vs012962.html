<p><center>Relief for the Soldiers</center></p>
<p>It gives us much pleasure to state that a number of our loyal 
philanthropic ladies are actively at work getting up boxes of hospital 
supplies to be forwarded to the 77th Regiment in service in Kentucky.  
The sick soldiers from our countyare in need of many articles to make 
them comfortable, and this noble effort to supplt their wants so promptly 
is deserving of all praise.  Any contributions for the sick soldiers, of 
the 77th Regiment, can be left at the Drug Store of Mr. J.S. Nixon.</p>
