<title>Valley Spirit, July 7, 1862</title>
<body><center>Col. Housum.</center>
<p>The 77th Regiment Pa. Volunteers are now encamped at Indian Creek, 
near Huntsville, Alabama.  They will, perhaps, return into Tennessee or 
Kentucky, as the rebels require some attention in those States and 
"Keystone boys" will accommodate them to their hearts content.  We are 
glad to know that the condition of Col. Housum's health will permit him 
to take command of the 77th at an early day.</p>
