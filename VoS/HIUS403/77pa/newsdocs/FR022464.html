<BR>
<P> We had the pleasure of a vist yesterday morning from three of our 
Federal Officers who recently escaped from Libby Prison, being a portion 
of the party of twenty-eight who had arrived at Fortress Monroe up to 
Tuesday evening.</P>

<P>Their narrative of escape is being prepared, and we shall take great 
pleasure in laying it before the public.  Suffice it to say that they 
were fifty-one days engaged in making their excavations, that through 
which they passed being sixt feet long.  They had previously made tow 
other excavations leading to the city sewers, but found that the sewers 
were two small to admit of their passage through them, and this mode of 
escape had to be abandoned.  The mode of excavating was with case knives 
and an old chisel.  An old spittoon, with two ropes attached to it, was 
used to draw the dirt out into the cellar.  One rope was kept in the 
hands of the operator int he tunnel to draw it back empty, and in the 
hands of the party attending at the orifice to draw it full.</P>

<P>The working parties succeeded in getting into the cellar undr the 
hospital, from which they operated, first through the wall, then into the 
sand. The earth they concealed under a pile of straw, where a number of 
old beds had been emptied, treading it down hard to make it occupy as 
little space as possible.</P>

<P>They commenced to make their escape at 7 o'clock in the evening, and 
some of those who have got through to Fortress Monroe did not leave until 
8 o'clock in the morning.  It took each man about five minutes to get 
through the tunnell, and it was dangerous for more than one to get into 
it at a time, there being a difficulty in breathing.</P>

<P>They first struck the outer surface in the middle of an unpaved 
street, but stopped up the hole by filling the leg of an old pair of 
pantaloons with earth and wedging it up in the hole.  They then dug on 
further, and came out under a tobacco shed, from which they made their 
escape.</P>

<P>Each man, as he emerged in the open air, sauntered slowly off, taking 
whatever direction he fancied.  They nearly all had on our blue army 
coats, which facilitated their escape, nearly all the military in and 
about Richmond wearing the same coats, having been supplied from the 
clothing sent through by the Government for our prisoners.  They allege 
that they were bought from our prisoners, but some doubt is entertained 
ont his subject.</P>

<P>They were pursued ont he Peninsula, and some of them tracked and 
captured by the aid of bloodhounds.  Five days were occupied in tracking 
their way to our line, and some were compelled from exhaustion to give 
themselves up.</P>

<P>A number of officers who desired to escape were compelled to abandon 
the effort on account of their corpulency, the tunnel being too small to 
admit of their passage through it.  Some of them undertook a depleting 
process to reduce their dimensions, but failed to come down to the
required thinness.</P>

<P>The work was secretly commenecd at first by a party of eighty, their 
fellow prisoners knowing nothing about it.  They finally notified a few of 
their friends, and the working parties were increased.  They were fearful 
to trust the matter to the general knowledge of the prisoners, though 
when the work was done and othe outlet open, all who were willing to make 
the attempt were notified of the fact.  It was regarded as a most 
hazardous adventure for freedom, with apossibility of being shot, a 
certainty of great hardship and exposure, and if captured the ball and 
chain and low diet.</P>

<P>After getting outside the lines around Richmond, they were greatly 
facilitated by the sympathizing negro.  In no case did they apply to them 
for direction as to their route, without recieving correct information 
gladly given.  They were told how to avoid the Rebel scouts and pickets, 
and where they would be most likely to strike the Federal lines.</P>

<P>They were finally met by the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry, twelve miles 
beyond Williamsburg, who were scouting through the country on the lookout 
for them.  They described their recpetion by these gallant fellows as 
mosyt cordial and enthusiastic.  Officers and men vied with each other in 
pressing their hospitality, and one private insisted upon taking off his 
pantaloons to furnish Capt. Clarke, who had lost one of his in the bushes.
They had been five days without any regular food, and were almost 
exhausted by exposure and hunger.</P>

<P>Their impression is that at least fifty, and perhaps more, of the 109 
who escaped, will reach our lines.  SOme few of them were re-captured in 
the city of Richmond.</P>
