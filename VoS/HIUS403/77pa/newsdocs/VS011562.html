EDITOR OF VALLEY SPIRIT:--Permit me to address you in a line in relation 
to the Seventy-Seventh.  The regiment, with the exception of one officer, 
now at his home in Fulton County on leave of absence, and about eighteen 
men, seven of whom are in the general hospital at Louisville, is in the 
enjoyment of excellent health and in fine spirits.  The men in the 
hospital are all improving, and a number of them unless some unexpected 
change in their condition should happen, will be sufficiently recovered 
in a few days to report for duty.  In the Infantry of my command three 
deaths have occurred,as follows--in Company A, (Capt. McKesson) Jacob 
Royer from near Waynesboro, his body sent home by express; in Company B, 
(Capt. Rose) Samuel B. Davis from Westmoreland Co., his body also sent 
home by express; in Company C, (Capt. McNally) James Ronlet from near 
Shippensburg--buried at Louisville.  One man has been lost from the 
Battery company, Daniel Levanite from Franklin Co.; but whether he was 
drowned or captured by the Rebel Cavalry I can not say.  The last time 
that he was seen was the afternoon of December 5th.  He was then leaving 
camp with a kettle to bring water.  The kettle was afterwards found near 
the river at a place where the Rebel Cavalry were reported to have been 
reconnoitering on the day he was last seen.  Since the day he 
dissappeared nothing has been seen or heard of him, and so his fate is 
hidden from us.  The loss of each of these men cast a gloom over the 
whole command.  Up to this writing there has been no Court Martial for 
disorderly conduct, although charges have been preferred against one man. 
The case yet to be investigated.  All the officers and men have seemingly 
vied with each other to excel in sobriety, honesty, obediency, and 
general good, soldierly conduct.  If there were nothing else to induce 
their commanding officer to use his best endeavors to make the regiment 
efficient in service and honor to the State, this alone would be 
suffficient.  It is indeed an honorto have command of a regiment composed 
of such noble officers and men.  The responsibility that attaches to the 
position of Colonel, is well calculated to make the individual fully 
sensible of his shortcomings and imperfections, which, if he bring an 
honest heart to the weork he can only hope to remedy by diligence and care.

The Battery attached to the "77th" is pronounced the finest in equipment 
and drill in this division of the army.  They have one more than one 
occasion won the prize against great odds at target practice.  I am daily 
in receipt of letters from wives and friends of soldiers in my command, 
in relation to remittances of money, certificates, &c.  I would 
cheerfully repy to all if time permitted.  The duties attached to the 
position I occupy require every moment from reveille till tattoo, and 
when not on Post Duty or at the Brigade School on Evolutions of the line 
after tattoo, consideration of health prompt me to take advantage of the 
night for rest.
</P><P>
Let me say, however, to the numerous class of correspondents above 
referred to, that while I do not have time to reply to their several 
communications, I will most cheerfully use my influence to have their 
husbands or friends in my command make their regular remittances, send 
certificates and do such other acts as are expected of them for the 
support of their families and friends left behind.  You will confer a 
favor by giving this publicity through the medium of your paper so that 
all may understand.  In consideration of which I promise, if time 
permits, to keep you informed of the doings of this division of the 
Federal Army and especially the "Seventy-Seventh."<Br><BR>
With sentim'ts of high esteem,<BR>
I am, your ob't serv't,<BR>
