<P>"On the 10th the men were roused early to prepare for the march.
The night had been intensely cold and stormy, freezing the ground
hard. The weather was the coldest yet experienced in Kentucky. Tents
were struck, wagons loaded and the march northward began. Soon after
the column had started, news came that our army under General Grant
had attacked Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, and that the
battle was then in progress. The effect of this news upon the men was
almost magical. They marched more rapidly from their eagerness to get
there in time to take a hand in the fight.  That night the command
stopped at Upton, fourteen miles north of Munfordville.  Owing to the bad 
conditions of the roads, the trains were unable to reach them,
and the men had to lie upon the frozen ground without covering other
than the blue vault overhead.  The night was clear and very cold. 
The ground froze hard.  The men tried to keep comfortable by burning
the top rails of the fences."  </P>

<P>"The movement south began on the 26th, when the division crossed
the river in boats, and bivouacked on the south bank. The following
day the march was resumed, and the camp was pitched that night near
Franklin, Kentucky, twenty-one miles from the river. On the 28th the
command marched twenty-two miles, about seven of which were through
feilds and on railroads, as the turnpike had been ploughed up in
order to retard the the progress of the Union army. As the wagons
could not keep up with the marching column of troops, the men were on
very short rations, each receiving only a very small piece of soft
bread during the entire day. On the first day of the march, fourteen
miles were covered before breakfast to Camp Negley, at the railroad
junction."</P>
