"The country was rough amd hilly, being mainly woodland and thick 
underbrush.  Here and there were a few small farms."

"Four months of incessant toit and fighting, almost without rest day or 
night, over a rugged mountainous country, in a semi-tropical climate, 
during the hottest, most sultry part of the year, was indeed in most 
severe test of the physical enduranse of the strongest and most robust 
nature.  Imagine an army of young men, under such conditions, in the face 
of a determined and vliant foe, toiling up the rugged sides of the 
mountains, fighting every step of their way up the rocky slopes, from rag 
to crag, and in many places, where the horses could get no foothold, 
dragging up the cannon by hand, often more then a score of men tugging 
with all their strength, at a single gun, and all this under the hail of 
shot and shell coming from the foe."
