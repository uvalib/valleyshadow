<P>"From the landing a dirt road ran through a deep ravine in the
bluffs, to the country back of the river, the soil of which is still,
tenacious clay almost impervious to water. There were none but dirt
roads which, in wet weather, became almost impassable and which were
at all times utterly so for heavy hauling. The country was thickly
overgrown with timber, full of dense underbrush. There were a number
of clearings under cultivation. About two and one-half miles from the
landing stood the small log meeting house called Shiloh church, from
which the battle took its name."</P>

<P>"The soilders from the 77th Regiment of Pennsylvania intended from
the beginning to fight the war to a finish, and we could easily
foresee that there was many another fierce and desperate battle to be
fought; many other long and toilsome march to be made(we had already
marched from Louisville, Ky., to this place); many another night of
shelterless explosure to cold and snow and rain to be endured, and
many thousands of other appalling danders to be encountered before
our country could be freed from its awful peril. Such was the outlook
on the last day of the great Battle of Shiloh."</P>
