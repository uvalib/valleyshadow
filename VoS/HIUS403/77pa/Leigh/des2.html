"The next morning at five o'clock the troops were again in motion.  After 
marching about three miles they were halted and ordered to countermarch 
over the Cumberland mountains.  Naturally the troops were 
extremely disappointed.  Here the mountains are rugged and rocky, layer 
upon layer they lie rough and steep, almost perpendicular at many places, 
and practically withoutroads over them.  Up these heights the artillery 
and heavy trains must be taken.  Whole companies were placed at the 
wagons, cannons, and caissons.  It was a pull, push and put shoulders to 
the wheels.  In some instances thay had to be lifted up bodily.  When the 
ascent had been very near accomplished, and the men had begun to rejoice 
that their arduous labor was nearly ended, another disappointment came in 
the orders to face about.  For what purpose they did not know.  Three 
days were taken up with the hardest possible work marching, and to no 
purpose, so far as the men could see or learn."
"Water was very scarce and hard to get.  Canteens were nearly all empty.  
More than once five dollars offered for a single drink of water were 
refused.  The intense heat added greatly to the discomfort of the the 
troops, yet that day they marched twenty-nine miles."

"It had rained the entire day, and the roads had become deep with mud and 
almost impassable.  A heavy fog covered the whole country, making the 
movement of troops very difficult."
