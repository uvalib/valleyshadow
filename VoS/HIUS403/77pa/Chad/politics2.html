The vast bulk of political articles ran in either paper from 1861-1865,
however, were not so much an examination of the political soldier, but of

soldier" was frequently done by both parties, and usually
found its ways into the print of the respective papers.  After the 77th
fought in McCook's Division at Shiloh, <a href="../images/curtin.jpg">Gov.
Curtin</a> was lambasted in the <I>Valley Spirit</i> for not providing
the soldiers with the <a href="./news/pitts1.html">proper acknowledgement
and praise</a>.
