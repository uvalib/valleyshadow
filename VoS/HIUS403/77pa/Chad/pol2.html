With a war brewing, discourse on the conflict at hand soon became a 
crucible for the world of politics.  Political leaders were bound to 
the fate of the soldier-- as both were in turn bound to the the pulse of 
the community of Chambersburg. The soldier, hundreds of miles away, 
remained at the heart of political discussion in the <I>Valley Spirit</I> 
and the <I>Franklin Repository</I> throughout the course of the war.
<br><br>
So, what was the nature of this discussion?  The two papers, being so 
clearly affiliated with political parties, found themselves embroiled 
in heated debate about local, state, and national politics.  Yet, 
whatever the particular political arena, the men of the 77th Pennsylvania 
and other state regiments were sure to divide the writers and politicians 
of Franklin County. <br><br>

<a href="../images/stumbaugh.jpg">Col. Frederick Stumbaugh</a>-- who led the 
77th at Shiloh, recieved the sword of Col. Battle in surrender there, and 
went on to lead the 5th Brigade in Gen. Alexander McCook's Division-- was 
the closest thing to a "living war legend" in Chambersburg.  He was nudged 
into local politics upon his retirement from the army, his accolades and 
service speaking for his natural abilities-- even to the <a 
href="./news/stumnews.html"><i>Franklin Repository</i></a>, which had always 
referred to him as the "former Democrat."  Did service in the war 
supersede political persuasions? At what point did a man stop being a 
"Democrat" or a "Republican" and begin being a soldier, member of the 
77th Regimental Volunteers?<br><br>

The vast bulk of political articles ran in either paper from 1861-1865, 
however, were not so much an examination of the political soldier, but of 
the <I>politics</i> of the soldier.
