The Civil War was a pivotal era in Pennsylvania Politics.  Consistently 
Democratic until 1860, it would emerge from the war and its aftermath a 
decidedly Republican state.  <a href="../images/curtin.jpg">Andrew Gregg 
Curtin</a> was placed in the governor's chair by the People's Party of 1860-- which was a loose agglomeration of old Whigs, new Republicans, 
antiforeign Nativists, and antislavery Democrats.<br>
<br>Curtin (1861-1867) was the first Northern governor to publicly advocate 
force to keep the South in the Union.  He clashed frequently with Simeron Cameron 
(Lincoln's Secretary of War), who repeatedly criticized Curtin for providing
troops with inferior supplies, weak support, and a general lack of effective 
management.<br><br>
Throughout the first half of 1863, Democrats exploited war weariness, and 
the Democratic house drew up resolutions condemning secession, 
unconstitutional acts by Congress, executive usurpation, arbitray arrests, the Emancipation Proclamation, the administration, and abolitionists; inviting the South back to allegiance; calling 
for a convention to amend the constitution; and praising the boys in 
blue.<br><br>  The election of 1863 would fall along these lines; Justice George W. Woodward of the state Supreme Court, 
a stalwart opponent of state conscription, assumed these resolutions as 
the Democratic platform in his quest for the governor's office.<br><br>
Curtin, who was ill and weary, wished to be removed from the race, and 
perhaps replaced with General William B. Franklin, an ardent Democrat and a vigorous supporter of the war.  However, county after county pledged their delegates to him, so he accpeted 
the nomination ten days before the convention began.  Curtin, renowned as 
the soldier's friend, urged that Pennsylvania soldiers  be furloughed for thirty days in time for the October election.  
The election proved to be a ringing endorsement for the present adminsitration, with Curtin being elected by a large margin and the Union Party gaining control of both legislative houses.
