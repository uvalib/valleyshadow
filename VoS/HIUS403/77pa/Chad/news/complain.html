June 5, 1861<br>
The Curtin Lifted<br><br></b></center>

A few interesting friends of Gov. Curtin are exceedingly anxious to 
screen his Excellency from the suspicion  of conniving at, or 
participating in, the frauds and swindles practiced upon our brave 
soldiers who came so promptly and gallantly forward to defend the honor 
of our State and the Flag of our Country. They seem to consider that to 
suspect the Governor is to suspect themselves and hence their desire to 
ward off any allusion, in the public prints, to these outrageous 
peculations.  If a Dem ocrat denounces or makes any reference to this 
shameful embezzlement of the public funds he is forthwith set down as 
a "traitor" by these very loyal money-grabbing patriots.  The Democracy 
are expected to wear the ragged garments but keep their mouths closed in 
regard to those who cheated them in furnishing the rags.  This, we fear, 
the public robbers of Penn'a will hardly succeed in accomplishing.  The
Decomcracy will "talk right out in meeting" in spite of all their threats 
and squirming.  But suppose they did succeed in silencing the Democracy, 
what are they going to do with the honest portion of their party? They 
want to be heard in reference to these matters and are becoming very bold 
and out-spoking concerning them.  It was but the other day that Capt. F. M.
Cooley, of the Fifth Pennsylvania Regiment, a sound, orthodox Republican, 
had the hardihood to give his friend Curtin a dih under the fifth rib 
that he may prove very unhealthy for our present State Administration.  
Capt. Cooley is not afraid to fix the blame, for the great wrong 
praciticed upon our soldiers, where it justly belongs.  He speaks right 
<I>at</I> the man and <I>to</I> the point, and  a few more such 
home-thrusts, from the honest portion of the Republican party, would go 
far to save our state from further plunder, though it cannot remove the 
deep disgrace brought upon the Commonwealth, and our gallant and 
salf-sacrificing Volunteers, by Curtin and his band of forty thieves.  
Hear what Capt. Cooley has to say of the head of the gang:<br>

<center>Washington, May 20</center>
<font size="-1"><font color="#ff0000">We are the jest of all other state 
troops, 
and were Andrew G. Curtin to visit the quarters of the 5th Regiment of 
Pennsylvania Volunteers he would have recieved groans and hisses.  Had 
this regiment recieved proper equipmens and uniforms, nine out of ten 
would have enlisted for three years.  As it is, I doubt very much whether 
fifty in the whole regiment would stay for three years.  The Volunteers 
say that they are expected fifty per cent of the money that was 
appropriated by the State for their benefit would be stolen, but not 100 
percent.</font>  <br>

I worked hard, as you know, for Gov. Curtin.  It is the only vote that I 
regret.  I have never asked a favor of him, and never expect to ask for 
one, but I did honestly think he had a <I>soul</I>.

which Pennsylvania troops were sent out into the field? Fingers were 
pointed his way from both the Valley Spirit and the local Democratic 
party.<br><br>
