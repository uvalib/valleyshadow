Valley Spirit, Dec. 12, 1864; p.5 c.1<br><br>
Town Morality</H3><br>
<br>
Since the return of a portion of the army to this place, our town has 
presented a warlike appearance and --we are sorry to say it--.  Drunken 
men are plentiful, and profane oaths appear to be the medium through 
which thought is coomunicated.  Eating houses and Ale Shops are doing a 
thriving business, and if the present state of affairs continues much 
longer some additional arrangement for the manufacture of Styrchnine 
Whiskey and Coeulus Indieus Ale, will have to be made.  If it is 
desirable it should cease, some stringent notification should be served 
on our keepers of Hotels and Ale houses and a series of free lectures, by 
sme of the reverened clergy, on sin and wickedness in general, and 
drunkeness, rioting and profanity in particular, should be announced 
forthwith. <BR><BR>

In all seriousness, an effort should be made by the officers in command, 
and our borough police to put and end to the outrageous violations of 
morality and common decency exhibited openly and shamelessly on our 
streets in open Day.  Night, is rendered hideous by the howling 
imprecations and rioting of drunken men.  Females can no longer adventure 
abroad after nightfall, without having their ears shocked with obscene 
language and foul oaths at each street corner, and in many instances of 
recent occurrence, some have been grossly insulted.  It be high time that 
an effort should be mad, by our citizens, to correct, in some measure t 
least, this intolerable evil.
