Coercion or the Olive Branch?<br><br></h2>

<font size="-1">
<center>Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased;<br>
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow.<br>
Raze out of the written troubles of the brain;<br>
And with some sweet oblivious antidote<br>
Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff<br>
That weighs upon the heart?</font><br>
<i>Macbeth, Act 1 Scene 4</i></center>
<br><br>
With pain we announce to our readers that the editor of the <i>Spirit</i> 
has had a confirmed attack of "Olive Branch" on the brain.  For some time 
we have noticed symptoms, which heralded the coming attack, gow thick and 
fast until last week's <I>Spirit</i> saw its culminationin the "Policy of 
Conciliation."<br>
<br>From a small sprig no bigger than a man's hand this <I>olive branch</I>
has spread, until like the boy whose diseased mind saw the plain covered 
with multitudes of ents, the whole country abounds in olive trees.  By 
day he talks <I>olive branch</I> and in the still hours of the night, 
while sleep's silken curtain hangs over him he babbles <I>olive branch.</i>
He stirs his tea with a sprig of the Olive, and goes forth to meditate 
upon the loveliness of peace supported and sustained by an "unfaltering 
trust" in an Olive wood cudgel.<br><br>
Since the hegira of McClellan and his pets of the Army of the Potomac we 
vainly believed that this school of warriors had well nigh become 
extinct.  But let us hasten to record our mistake.  The <I>Olive 
Branch</I> still finds a champion in the doughty Editor of the 
<I>Spirit></I>, who last week undertook to impose some ver miserable 
logic upon his readers, many of whom doubtless willingly accept that kind 
from the <I>Spirit</i> rather than the best from loyal papers.<br><br>
A column is employed to prove what every man will grant without an 
argument, that the coercive policy employed by England in the 
Revolutionary struggle of our fathers materially assisted them to achieve 
their independence.  Burke and Chatham, names never to be forgotten by 
Americans, are largely quoted in confirmation of that opinion.  And 
altogether, considering that the proposition is oen which none denies, we 
think the Editor has done himself great credit, both in his elaborate 
argument and careful research.  But when he undertakes to argue from this 
that the only practible way to suppress the Rebellion of the Slave States 
is to conciliate them we beg leave to dissent.<br><br>
Great Britain imposed grievous burdens on the colonies until they could 
no longer be borne.  When they petitioned for redress and remonstrated, 
the grievances were increased.  When they could endure no longer and 
determined to resist oppression, Great Britain undertook to subdue them; 
with what success we all know.  We believe conciliation might have healed 
the difficulty, but it was asked for in vain.  This, briefly stated, was 
the position of England towards the colonies at the commencement of the 
Revolution.  <br><br>
We should like to ask any reasonable minded man whether now or at any 
moment since the rebellion was inaugurated at Fort Sumter this has been 
the relative position of the North and the South towards each other?
On the contrary, do not the leaders of the rebellion say that <I>they</i> 
have made this fight, and made it in the interest of slavery, and that 
either Slavery or the Government must be annihilated? Is not then the 
position of the North towards the South immediately the converse of that 
of England towards the colonies?  From the nature of the case, and from 
the legitimate deduction of the <I>Spirit's</I> proposition of 
conciliation should have been the policy of England toward the Colonies, 
then <I>coercion</I> should be the policy of the United States toward 
those in a rebellion.  <br><br> 

Here is the <I>Spirit's</I> war policy: <br><br>
<font size="-1">
" Here is where we take issue with the party in power.  We assert that 
their policy has strengthened the cause of rebellion, that their means of 
securing success are inadequate, that unless we unite the olive branch 
with the sword, unless we hold out fair and honorable terms of 
conciliation to the people of the South, while we strike down with the 
sword him that comes against us with the sword, we never can bring this 
war to a successful conclusion.  The armed power of this rebellion must 
be met and crushed by armed power of the Union.  But peace hath her 
victories as well as war.  It is madness to discard everyhting but sheer 
brutal force; for after all, that generalship can do, compromise and 
conciliation alone can restore the Union in spirit and in truth.  Let us 
be wise, then, in time, and lay to heart the important lesson taught su 
in our own brief history, before the day of our national salvation may 
have passed forevor."</font><br><br>

It does seem to us that in this age of prodigious projectiles, "Swamp 
Angels" and Ironclads, and olive wand would have but a small show of 
comparison with them, and we are satisfied that the champion of this 
system would make the attack at an enormously long range.<br><br>
Has the experience bought by thrity-two months of the fiercest civil war 
been such to induce the belief that conciliation is the proper policy of 
the Administration?  At its commencement but a single Slave State, adn 
that Deleware, gave satisfactory evidence that she was with the Union in 
spirit anmd not the rebellion.  Maryland refused transit to Union 
soldiers through Baltimore, to save the capitol from traitors; and a 
committee of young christians (?)-- occupying a position in "transitu" 
somewhere in between olive branch patriots and traitors with arms in 
their heads--urged the President to refrain from it, lest it might 
endanger bloodshed.  Most of these christians have since joined the rebel 
army.  West Virginia was in the hands of the rebels.  Kentucky was 
preapring to secede under the guise of armed neutrality.  Tennessee was 
carried boldly, without an effort at resistance by her loyal citizens.  
Missouri, under the leadership of Price and others, was among the first 
to put a rebel army in the field.<br><br>
Since then the war has been prosecuted with different degrees of coercive 
severity.  The first year it was so weak that its strongest ingredient 
may possibly have been nothing more than Olive-branch gruel.  Since that 
time, however, we thankfully write that the coercive policy is looking 
up. Confiscation and emancipation have added their divisions to the Union 
armies, and the result is highly gratifying to loyal men.  Maryland has 
given a large emancipation majority; Delewar is ready to do the same; 
West Virginia has surely seen enough to entitle her to the name and 
distinction of a Free State; Missouri has already taken some steps toward 
gradual emancipation; Kentucky is moving in the same direction; and even 
Tennessee, so long ground between the upper and nether millstones, is 
raising her voice and crying to be delivered from the inhuman system of 
slavery.  A voice comes from the benighted wilds of Arkansas, proclaiming 
that slavery, the cause of the war, must perish, that peace may be 
invited back, and the old Union restored. <br><br>
We ask our readers which, the Coercive Policy or the Olive-Branch?
