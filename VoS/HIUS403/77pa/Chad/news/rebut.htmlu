<b>Democratic Testimony</b><br><br></center>

<font color="#ff0000">Scarcely an issue of the <I>Spirit</I> fails to revamp 
the falsehood 
that Gov. Curtin speculated off the soldiers by furnishing them shoddy 
clothing and unwholesome food.</font>  We have heretofore exposed this 
persistent defamation, but in order that every voter may justly 
appreciate the gross character of those misrepresentations, we give the 
the verdict of those, of adverse politics, who made a sworn report on the 
subject after a full examination.  When the charge was first made, Gov. 
Curtin at once called upon Wm. Heywood, Calob Cope and Jacob Fry, the 
last named the late Democratic Auditor General, and justly famed for his 
integrity to make a patient and fearful investigation.  They did so, and 
fully exonerated the Governor.  But the next legislature, hoping to find 
some cause of complaint against Gov. Curtin, raised a special committee 
headed by Mr. Rex, Democrat from Montgomery (and now a candidate for 
reelection), and Mr. Greenbank, of Philadelphia, also a radical Democrat, 
and they were sworn and made a most exhausting examination of all of the 
newspaper charges against Gov. Curtin.  The result was that they found him 
clear in his great office, and were compelled to pronounce him faithful 
to all of the duties imposed upon him. <font color="#ff0000"> In the 
Legislative Record for 
1862, page 909, the official report may be found, unanomously signed by 
the committee, and in it they testify to the zeal, patriotism, and 
integrity of Gov. Curtin and his subordinates:<br><br>
<font size="-1">
"There is no evidence, which in any way, involves an officer of the 
government in improper conduct in the disbursement of funds of the 
Commonwealth, or in providing for the soldiers.</I>  On the contrary, the 
evidence satisfied the committee, that, in every instance where any wrong 
was brought to the <i>knowledge of the Executive, prompt measures were 
taken for their correction.</I>  The committee feel it their duty , as 
well as in justice to the <I>Executive</I>, as in honor to our whole 
Commonwealth, to state that, notwithstanding she has placed more men in 
the field than any other state in the Union, she has put them more 
promptly, <I>and at a less expense per man</I>, than either the national 
government, or nay individual State, of whose expenditure they have any 
information; and the committee hesitate not to express their clear 
judgment that the thanks of the citizens of the Commonwealth are due to 
<I>her Executive officers</I> for their self-denying and perservering 
efforts to maintain her honor; and from the citizens of the United 
States, that by such efforts, the Capital of the Country was saved from 
capture by traitors, and the whole country from disgrace."</font>

</font>
The <I>Spirit</I> will not retract of course, nor will it allow its 
readers to see the truth.  In the face of overwhelming testimony of its 
own party men, who have some respect for the truth, it will persist in 
spreading its falsehoods before the people.<br><br>
<font size="+1"><i>
"Falsehoods" spread by the papers came to the forefront in the 
electoral campaigns of 1863.<br><br>
<a href="vote.html">In the end, politicians would seek the vote of those who 
had been "neglected" in the field for so long.... the soldiers.</a>
