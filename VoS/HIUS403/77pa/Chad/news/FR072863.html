The <I>Spirit</I> wastes a column to demonstrate how it might openly defy 
the conscription law; but upon the whole it concludes it won't.  The 
common sense of the article is embraced in the following paragraph, as 
follows:<br><br><font size="-1">
"The conscription is a law of the land, passed by Houses of Congress and 
approved by the President, and until it has been adjudged 
unconstitutional by the proper judicial tribunal, or legally repealed, it 
remains in full force, and every citizen is bound by it.  So long as it 
remains law, <I>it must be obeyed</I>, no matter how odious its 
provisions may be considered.  When we totally cease to be law-abiding 
people, the days of constitutional liberty are numbered.  We feel that we 
can not too strongly urge our people, by every consideration which the 
good of society can plead, their duty, under all circumstances, to 
respect and abide by the provision of law.  There is full redress for all 
real or imaginary grievances in the courts and the ballot-box.  And this 
is the only means of redress which the safety of the people will allow."
