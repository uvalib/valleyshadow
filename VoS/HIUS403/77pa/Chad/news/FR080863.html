<h2>Franklin Repository<br><br>
</h2>
The friends of soldiers in the service, cannot do a greater kindness to 
our gallant boys, than to send them a newspaper from home.  The 
REPOSITORY will be sent, mailed in strong wrappers, three months for 25 
cents, six months for 50 cents, or one year for $1.00.  This is little 
more than the cost of white paper.
