<b> April 23, 1862<br><br>
The Pennsylvanians at Pittsburg Landing<br><br></center></b>
 
Gov. Curtin is repsonsible for the announcement that no Pennsylvania 
soldiers participated in the glorious victory gained over the enemies of 
the Union at Pittsburg Landing.  The Governor must either have supposed 
that he was stating facts, or else was perfectly indifferent to awarding 
honors to the brave soldiers of his own State for their share in the 
terrible fight. Let the motive be what it may the neglect to make known, 
officially, the part taken by our Volunteers in the action in 
inexcusable.  It has leaked out, however, at last, nothwithstanding 
Governor Curtin's attempt to keep it from the public, that a Pennsylvania 
Regiment DID participate in that battle, and to other states-- Kentucky 
and Ohio-- are we indebted for the first account of the heroic conduct 
of the gallant Pennsylvanians on that bloody battlefield.  <font 
color="#ff0000">Two weeks ago 
the Governor should have made known this glorious news, through a General 
Order, congratulating the 77th Pennsylvania Volunteers for their 
gallantry at the battle of Pittsburg Landing-- nothing of this kind has 
been done, or will it likely take place unless our prompting should bring 
it out. These Republican Administrations have a queer way of dealing 
with the soldiers. It is not enough that they cover their backs with 
shoddy, issue them scanty and unwholesome rations, withold their pay for 
three or four months at a time while their families are in want-- all 
these wrongs it seems are not sufficient but the poor boon of an 
acknowledgement of their share in achieving a glorious victory must too 
be withheld.</font>  Byron once said that "glory consisted of being killed 
battle and having your name misspelt on the Bulletin."  These Republicans 
would go a little further-- they are very willing to have you killed in 
battle but would omit your name altogether. There was a time when Gov. 
Curtin could not visit a camp of Pennsylvania soldiers without being 
hissed or hooted at.  Are we getting back to those days?  Have the 
whitewashings of the Legislative Committees so emboldened him and his 
clique as to make them believe that they can renew outrages on the 
soldier with impunity? <font color="#ff0000"> To the Democratic press of the 
country must our 
gallant soldiers look to have their wrongs righted.  It has in every war 
proven itself the steadfast friend of the defenders of our Country's Flag 
and it will not be found wanting at this time.</font>  The many wrongs 
perpetrated on the soldiers have never been excused or winked at by the 
Democratic Press, or has a single member of the party it represents ever  
descended so low in the scale of patriotism as to express the wish that 
they may be "welcomed with bloody hands to hospital graves."  That is the 
sort of <i>loyalty</I> that the Democratic party will never understand in 
practice or theory.<br><br><br>

<font size="+1"><I>The Valley Spirit used Shiloh to lambast <a 
href="../../images/curtin.jpg">Gov. Curtin</a> and portray him as the
enemy of the soldier. Politics throughout the war would be couched
in these terms, and waged its battle through the papers by asking a simple
question: Who was the soldier's true friend?<br><br>

<a href="complain.html">The paper found the most powerful voice
in the soldiers themselves....</a>
