A Good Sign</h3>

All experienced writers upon arms for soldiers denounce the use of 
pistols for privates and ridicule the use of knives.  In close fighting 
the bayonet is the only weapon to be depended on, and no experienced 
soldier will put his trust in any other means for attack or defence.  
Whenever you observe a volunteer strutting around with the butt of a 
pistol, or the handle of a bowie-knife, displayed, you may rely upon it 
as a good sign that he has no real courage at heart.  He has nothing 
within himself that he can display, or depend on, and he wishes to 
impress the "rest of mankind" with the idea that he is something 
formidable by his outward show of deadly weapons!  It is a saying the 
Turks have, and generally found to hold good, that the "biggest coward 
carries the biggest knife."  It was the general remark while McMullen's 
Rangers were in this place, and always to their credit, that there was no 
display of pistols or knives among the men while none will doubt their 
bravery. We hope our volunteers will take pattern from the regulars, and 
lay aside these useless arms, and learn to rely on the bayonet altogether 
in a close fight.
