<h2>Valley Spirit, January 25, 1864<br><br>
Relief for the Prisoners</h2><br><br>

Many persons are under the impression that since the escape of the 
Federal officers from the Libby Prison that no packages can be sent to 
our prisoners.  Dr. Reid, however, informs us that he has recieved a 
letter from the Express agent at Fortress Monroe, stating that articles 
of food and clothing from private parties, for prisoners, are forwarded 
to and recieved as usua.  This will be good news to those whose friends 
are still in the hands of the rebels, which, we feel confident, they will 
profit by.
