<body><center>Col. Housum</center>
<p>Col. P.B. Housum, 77th regiment Penn. Volunteers, returned to his 
home, at this place, on Friday last.--Col. Housum's health has been bery 
much impaired by incessant labor, and exposure to the inclemency of the 
weather, while in the discharge of his duties. Few men have won a higher 
reputation since the war commenced than Col. Housum.  He was one of the 
very first to raise a company and offer his services to his country when 
the war broke out, and after serving with much credit to himsef, through 
the three months service, he immediately volunteered for three years and 
was commissioned Lieut. Col. of the Seventy-seventh regiment Penna. 
Volunteers and ordered to Kentucky.--To whatever duty he was assigned, 
while in the service, he executed it in a faithful and soldier-like 
manner.  In the bloody battle at Pittsburg Landing his bravery was a 
subject of general commendation, and is mentioned specially in the 
General's report of the Battle.  Though from sickness hardly able to 
march he kept his position in his regiment all day through the thickest 
of the fight, encouraging his brave soldiers to deeds of valor by his 
coolness and bravery. He was in command of the Regiment, Col. Stumbaugh 
having been promoted to the command of the brigade, at the time his 
impaired health required him to obtain a brief furlough to recruit his 
enervated system.  He hopes his health may be so far restored as to 
enable him to join his regiment in a few weeks.</p>
