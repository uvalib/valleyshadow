<h2>Franklin Repository, July 8, 1863, p.4 c.1</h2>
<br><br>
Politically, the FRANKLIN REPOSITORY will, during the war, have but one 
article of faith-- <I>the positive and unconditional re-union of the 
States under the regularly constituted authorities of the Government.</I> 
It will resist alike Disunion and cowardly Compromise with armed treason, 
as disaster to the living--as dihomor to our dead.  It will give a 
cordial and earnest support to the administrations of President Lincoln 
and Governor Curtin, and will demand that every possible means
within the reach or power of the government, be employed to secure the 
unity and lasting Peace of the Republic.
