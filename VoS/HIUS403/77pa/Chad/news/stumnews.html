The time is near at hand when the unconditional Union men of our county 
will meet in Convention to select a candidate to represent them in the 
State Legislature.  In the present crisis of the country it is necessary 
that men of the highest mental and moral qualifications should be 
chosen.  There are many citizens who believe that <font 
color="#ff00000">Col. F.S. Stumbaugh 
possesses in an eminent degree the character peculiarly requisite, in 
these times, in a legislator.</font>  The ability and honesty of the 
Colonel in civil life are well known throughout the county, and he has abundantly 
proved his devotion to his country in the present war.  All know how he 
behaved and how nobly he sustained the honor of our State and county at 
Pittsburg Landing, and how ably he conducted the command of his brigade 
during a large portion of his term of service.  It is well known, too, 
that <font color="#ff0000">should our enemies make an electioneering 
campaign necessary, the Colonel would be as brilliant a campaigner as he 
was on the field of death-dealing war.</font><br><br>

While the war brought Stumbaugh success, it brought many politicians 
frustration and political grief.  <br><br>

to be duly recognized...</a>
