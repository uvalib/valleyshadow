A Libel on Pennsylvania Soldiers
</h3>
On the 19th inst., a skirmish took place in front of Munfordsville, Ky., 
in which a portion of the Pennsylvania soldiers attached to the 77th and 
79th regiments, are represented by a writer in the Cincinnati 
<I>Gazette</I>, to have become panic stricken and retreated from the 
field without an enemy being in sight.  A correspondent of the Lousiville 
<I>Journal</I> pronounces the statement "from the first to the last an 
infamous falsehood," and sets its author down as "a fool or a knave."
No such occurrence as the <I>Gazette</I> writer describes ever took 
place. It is a gross misrepresentation manufactured out of the whole 
cloth by some sneaking traitor for the purpose of crying down the 
Pennsylvania soldiers who have so gallantly marched to defend the soil of 
Kentucky against its own disloyal people.  This is their thanks; but 
Pennsylvanians are able to defend themselves against traitors in front as 
well as traitors in the rear, who keep at a safe distance from danger and 
follow the mean business of underrating the gallantry of the "OLD 
KEYSTONE" who are better patriots and braver soldiers than they dare be.  
The writer in the Louisville <I>Journal</I> has word to say in behalf of 
the Pennsylvania soldiers that is sufficient in itself to brand the 
story, in the Cincinnati <I>Gazette</I>, a base calumny/  We extract from 
the <I>Journal</I> article the following:

<FONT SIZE= "-1">"Pennsylvanians have a profound contempt for unearned 
laurels; they do not covet plaudits undeserved, but their indignation at 
this wanton assault upon their courage and valor was not to be endured 
silently.  They claim (and challenge dispate) to have gone at this date 
severall miles further into the enmy's counry than any other troops in 
the central division-- never to have been caught in a trap-- never to 
have had their pckets driven in surprised-- never to have had buildings 
or wood fired within two hundred yards of their lines of pickets-- never 
to have permitted the destruction of property in full view of their posts."
