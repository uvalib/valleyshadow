Three Year Soldiers</h3>
The plan proposed for enlisting soldiers for three years out of the 
companies that have volunteered for three months does not meet with much 
favor.  The movement was commenced at the wrong time and will defeat the 
plan altogether.  Our brave volunteers who rushed so promptly and 
patriotically to their country's call, have been badly fed, badly clothed 
and badly treated generally; and right in the midst of their hardships 
and privations to ask them to "prolong the agony" is taxing their 
patriotism rather severely.  They have not as yet reaped one bit of 
glory, or shared a dollar of Uncle Sam's money, and it cannot be supposed 
that they are in the best possible humor for continuing in his service.  
Under other circumstances, we have no doubt, every man of them would have 
reenlisted to see the war out.  They will now serve out their three 
months faithfully and at the expiration of that time allow the two 
hundred and eighty three companies, which have offered their services 
from this State and been rejected, a chance to come in and gather all of 
the laurels left for them.
