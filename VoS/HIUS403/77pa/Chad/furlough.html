Volunteers</U>

<BR><BR><BR><I>Why did the Seventy-Seventh go on furlough in January of 
1864?  Unfortunately, Obreiter does not indicate when the furloughs were 
initially processed.  The Seventy-Seventh was engaged in manuevers and
skirmishes at Lookout Creek, Tenn.  Did this delay a furlough which was 
intended to have them home by election-day in October of 1863?
