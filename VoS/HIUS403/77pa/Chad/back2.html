Those who were left behind in Franklin County would read about the 
travels of the "Keystone Boys" in the newspapers. Many newspapers
peppered the home front, but two proved to be paramount sources of war
information: the <I>Valley Spirit</I> and the <I>Franklin Repository and 
Transcript</I>.  These two papers would serve as a link to the 
battlefield, allowing the soldier and home to remain in close connection.  
Enthusiastic readers in Chambersburg would become "armchair" experts on 
military tactics, camp life, and the rigors of battle, by reading articles that 
were run on these topics from week to week. Also, those at home enjoyed 
an influx of war letters which found their way onto the printed pages, 
as well as reports of skirmishes which were telegraphed home by local 
battlefield reporters.<br><br>
Of course, the papers fashioned news of the "Keystone Boys"  
with varying intentions, and presented their story through distinctly 
colored lenses. While both papers celebrated the 77th Pennsylavania and 
other local regiments each week, the story which they told had 
differing versions.  How were the soldiers being treated?  Who was 
responsible for that treatment? How were the soldiers viewed-- on the 
battlefield and upon arriving home?  How did the absence of sons and 
husbands color Chambersburg's overall picture of the war? And, if these 
two papers were the voice of the community, what was the community saying?
<br><br>
Typical of the 1860s, each had a clear political affiliation-- the 
<I>Valley Spirit</I> being the Democratic and the <I>Franklin 
Repository</I> being the Republican paper.  These papers had twin duties: 
to serve as a conduit for information coming <I>into</I> Chambersburg, as 
well one for information going <I>out</I> to the soldiers.  And, in effect, the 
newspapers would serve just as much as <i>intepreters</I> of the war as 
<i>tellers</I> of it.    </body> </html>
