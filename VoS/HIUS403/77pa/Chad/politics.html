With a war brewing, discourse on the conflict at hand soon became a 
crucible for the world of politics.  Political leaders were bound to 
the fate of the soldier-- as both were in turn bound to the the pulse of 
the community of Chambersburg.<img align=right src="../images/stumb.gif"> 
The soldier, hundreds of miles away, 
remained at the heart of political discussion in the <I>Valley Spirit</I> 
and the <I>Franklin Repository</I> throughout the course of the war.
<br><br>
So, what was the nature of this discussion?  The two papers, being so 
clearly affiliated with political parties, found themselves embroiled 
in heated debate about local, state, and national politics.  <br><br>
<a href="../images/stumbaugh.jpg">Col. Frederick Stumbaugh</a>-- who led the 
77th at Shiloh, recieved the sword of Col. Battle in surrender there, and 
went on to lead the 5th Brigade in Gen. Alexander McCook's Division-- was 
the closest thing to a "living war legend" in Chambersburg.  He was nudged 
into local politics upon his retirement from the army, his accolades and 
service speaking for his natural abilities-- even to the <i>Franklin 
Repository</i></a>, which had always referred to him as the "former 
Democrat."  <br><br>

<a href="./news/stumnews.html">The <I>Repository</I> supported Stumbaugh for 
office when he returned from the war.....</a>
