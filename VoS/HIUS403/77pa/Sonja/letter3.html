Dear Brother<BR><BR>
 
<p>I now take the oppertunity of writing these few lines to you to inform you that
I am well hoping that they may find you all Enjoying the same blessing. I Recieved
a letter from you some time ago, but I never got a Chance to answer it for we have
been marching ever since. we stoped at Pinch Him Slyly on the 25th of Oct. and our
Tents came up to us there. the first time we saw them since we left Battle Creek
which is 2 month and five days ago and we had just got them Pitched when it began
to snow. it snowed the whole night and in the morning the snow was about 6 inches 
deep. it was the luckyest thing Ever happened us that they did come, for it was
an awful cold night.  we had four days skirmishing in which we lost over 100 men.
Mike Huffnagle was among them, but we heard since that he was Paroled. Buell has
been superceded by Rosenbrans. Hambrights Regt is now about 2 or three miles behind
us. they form Part of the left wing. I see Nood often. he looks first Rate and is
doing well. Hambright's men are sattisfied that the Rebels Dont fear gun Powder 
and they say they Dont care wether they get in another fight or not. they say they
wanted to get into one fight and they had that, so they would just as soon not get
in any more. they fought well and its no telling how the Battle would have went if
it hadnt been for the 79th Penna and the 1st Wissconsin for the 24th Wisconsin 
were supporting Terrels Battery and they Ran the first fire and Hambright had to
make a flank  Movement, and thats where he got his men cut up so I dont know what
forces were fighting on the Rebels side, for there was a dutchman of the 24th Ala.
that Deserted from Bragg's Army and he told us that Bragg & Kirby Smith was looking
at us crossing the Mountain at Lawrence Burgh. they had us pend on the Mountain for 
about four hours. they attacted our rear and thought to draw us out. there was
only our Division, but Sills was too sharp for them. he hurried on the teames
but they made out to get 16 of our wagons and 551 prisoners out of the Division,
75 our of our Regt. the Dutchman said that Kirby smith had 35,000 under him and
that Bragg was laying there with a heavy force, he didnt know how many, but he
said that Bragg had 52,000 under him at one<P>
