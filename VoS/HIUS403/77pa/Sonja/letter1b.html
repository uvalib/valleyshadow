Camp Near Levern<BR>
Nov 18th, 1862<BR><BR>

<P>Dear Brother</P>

<P><font color="#ff0000">I take this opportunity droping these few pen 
lines to inform you that I Recieved your letter 
four days ago and I am glad to hear that you are all well I would have answered it Right away
but we got marching orders and we had to leave Right away</font 
color="#ff0000"> and we made a small march of about 
10 miles and when we got to Camp we had to go out on Picket and it was about Dusk when we got in
of Picket yesterday. we had a slight skirmish with Forests Rebel Cavalry the Evening we came
here and this morning another. yesterday they had a Purty heavy skirmish in to the Right of us
but I didnt hear how they made out.<font color="#ff0000"> you stated in your 
letter that you were offered 500 dollars
to take some fellows Place that was Drafted and say your Price is 1000 but I say you better stay
where you are if you have Plenty of work for you would curse yourself a thousand times for each
dollar if you except it for.</font color="#ff0000"> Reccollect it aint 
fighting but marching that'll fetch you and 
besides that you have you have to lay out in all kinds of weather and they have now adopted the
shelter tents and Each two men has to carry a tent and you have to get up all hours of night 
without any Regard to weather and your plagued with the Rheaumatism--just imagine yourself getting
out of a middling Comfortable bed, for its seldom we have a Comfortable one, and making a march of
5 or 6 miles in A Drenching Rain and then lay Right down on the wet ground with out anything to 
shelter you from the Rain and no dry Clothes to Put on and not Even a fire to warm yourself, for
if we had dare to build fire we couldnt for everything is wet and wont 
burn.<font color="#ff0000"> think of all this 
and besides the stiffness the March Creates--and you have some insight of a soldier's life, so god
avise you to not leave, Even two thousand dollars Entice you.</font 
color="#ff0000"> we are not in the centre anymore. 
we have been Placed on the Right wing. the Centre stays in Nashville. there was a battery and the
6th Brig'd went out Reconoitreing. they was firing Purty Rapid a while but it ceaced. they must have
drove the Rebels off. Tomorrow we go out. the Brigades take it turn about Reconnoitreing. I must Close
my letter. <font color="#ff0000">Give my Respect to all and take my advise 
and stay where you are.</font color="#ff0000"> </P><BR>

Direct to Henry M. Erisman, Co. K, 77th Regt P.V., 5th Brigade, 2nd 
Division, Louisville, KY<br>

support remains unknown. Most privates from Franklin County's Company A 
were younger, unmarried men in their late teens and early twenties 
without households to support. But some officers, such as <a

Stark</a>, did cite hometown obligations in order to obtain temporary or
permanent leave from the army...</font size="+1"></i>  <P>
