<P><center>Letter from the Army.</center></P>

<P>Nashville, Tenn., July 20, 1862<br>
We joined the Regiment at Corinth, Miss., on the 9th of June.  On the 
11th Buell's command at this place, took up their line of march, and on 
the 15th arrived at Camp Jackson nearly opposite to Florence, Ala.  At 
this place Gen Buell issued an order that all not able to march should 
return to Tuscumbia, Ala.  About the 20 of the 77th were taken back to 
hospital quarters.  At request of the boys I was detailed by Maj. 
Bradford's command to take charge of them and see them well cared for.  
On the 19th I left the Regt, went back to Tuscumbia, since which I have 
heard nothing direct even of its whereabouts.  Remained there up to July 
10th when a disposition was made of the sick in hospitals at that place.  
About 300 remained; about 400 had so far recruited as to be able to join 
the Regiments.  Sam Snively of the Battery is in our crowd and doing well, 
so also are Syark, Wade, D. Davis and Heniken of your county, of Co. A  
Sam Pittman is with his company again.  There has been the most intense 
excitement here on account of the Mufreesboro attack, and the raid in Ky. 
by Morgan.  An attack was anticipated on this place causing several 
thousand troops to be run in and quartered here.  You would ask the war 
news.  I can ony say we are as entirely ignorant of the movements of the 
army as outsiders are, but one thing is plain to every eye--"Red Tape" 
rules the day and thereby a tale will be unfolded, some day, more 
startling to the American people than even a Southern Rebellion.<br>
