<p>"And the war came."  So spoke Abraham Lincoln of the Civil 
War. But the actual fighting did not come onto the soil of the Union until 
the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. When the war did come to 
Pennsylvania, all but one Pennsylvania regiment met Lee's army that 
July--the 77th Pennsylvania Volunteers.  For most Union soldiers from 
Pennsylvania, their military experience climaxed with their defense of 
their home state late in the war; however, the men of the 77th Pa. had a 
fundamentally different experience.  They were the only Pennsylvania 
regiment to have fought in the western campaigns, and received much 
local attention for emerging victorious (and unscathed by loss of men) 
at Shiloh in April of 1862. </p>
  <p>While many Pennsylvania soldiers traveled many miles away from
their homes for longer periods of time than they had hitherto been away,
the men of the 77th Pa had an unusually arduous journey.  They went so far
from home as to be finally discharged in Victoria, Texas, after the
war--sent there because of the supposed threat of French troops in Mexican
villages.  Historians have found that much of the sense of honor and duty
which motivated men to enlist and stay in the army stemmed from a desire
to protect home ground.  The regiment's transfer to Texas would have
seemed an unglorious end to their service.  <a href="./Chad/chart.html">As 
reflected in the Franklin
County newspapers, the interest in and excitement attached to the regiment
also declined in the later war years.</a> Many members of the 
regiment were also captured and imprisoned after the battle of 
Chickamauga or died of disease in the second half of the war. Despite 
these and other hardships, most men in Company A saw fit to re-enlist 
as volunteer veterans in early 1864 for another round of duty.  Although 
in the memoirs of John Obreiter and Samuel Daihl the story of the
77th Pa. reaches its pinnacle at Shiloh, it clearly did not end 
there.
Looking at what happened <i>after</i> Shiloh may clarify the 
importance
of that narrative to the regiment's own historians.</p>
<p>
Traditional military history tends to focus on battles and fighting as 
the shaping experience of a soldier's life in the army.  But like most 
Union regiments, the 77th Pa. actually spent the majority of their time 
<i>not</i> fighting.  <br><a href="fchart.html">Figures compiled 
from even the standard regimental history demonstrate the discrepancy 
between days spent fighting and days spent otherwise. </a><br>
In addition to 
participating in some of the most important military campaigns in the 
West, men of the 77th Pa. also marched through 
usually difficult terrain, encountered "rebels" and slaves for the first 
time, got sick with dysentery, were detailed to supply 
trains, and missed home.  The
physical landscape of the war in the West which the 77th Pa. traversed 
had an affect 
on the way they saw themselves in relationship to their homes, their 
comrades, and the people they met along the way. In letters home and to 
the war department asking for sick leave, members of the regiment 
expressed their longing to return to their homes in Pennsylvania.
The different social landscape of the South brought unexpected encounters 
with un-hostile rebels and
ex-slaves aiding in their escape from Richmond's Libby prison. 
The war also played itself out in the public landscape of the newspapers 
when the soldiers of the 77th Pa. became pawns used by political parties 
during the gubonatorial race in Chambersburg.  </p> <p>
While many sources refer to the 77th as a whole, we have compiled the 
dossiers (stored at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.) of 
soldiers in companies A and H, because these were the companies to which 
the majority of men who enlisted from Franklin County belonged.
