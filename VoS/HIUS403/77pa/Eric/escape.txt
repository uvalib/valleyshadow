<font size=5><bold>T</bold></font><font size=4>he prisoners from the regiment were passed through the Confederate lines, taken to Atlanta, and from thence, by rail, to Richmond.  Here the commissioned officers were put into <a href="./Eric/libby.html">Libby (Prison)</a>, and the enlisted men into other prisons.  In November the men were taken to <a href="./Eric/danvilleprison.html">Danville, Virginia</a>, and subsequently Andersonville, GA.  Fifty-seven of these were died while in prisons principally at Andersonville, leaving only seven survivors out of the sixty-four.  That fact alone speaks volumes as to the treatment received by the Union prisoners of war, during the Rebellion.</font> 
<p>
<font size=5><bold>I</bold></font><font size=4>n the prisons too the Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania had a unique distinction.  Members of it were prominently engaged while confined in prisons in the three most successful tunnels that were dug out of military prisons, during the entire Rebellion.  
<a href="./images/rose.jpg">Colonel Thomas E. Rose</a> was the head of the Libby Prison tunnel.  Under very great difficulties it was dug from the building, under the street, ending under a shed which admirably screened the escaping prisoners.  This excavation was about fifty feet in length.  Through it escaped one hundred and nine officers, Colonel Rose among them.  He was re-captured, but was afterwards exchanged and reached his regiment in time to participate in the Atlanta campaign.</font>  
<p>
<font size=5><bold>T</bold></font><font size=4>he second tunnel referred to, was dug from  
<a href="./Eric/prison5.jpg">Prison No. 5</a>, Danville, Virginia, in December, 1863.  It was somewhat shorter than the Libby tunnel and ended in the open, outside of the guard line.  It opened in plain view of the guards.  The men depended entirely upon the darkness of the night to enable them to escape unobserved.  About seventy escaped through this burrow.  Corporal Jacob Eisenberger, of Company K, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, was one the leaders, and a prominent worker in this enterprise.</font>  
<p>
<font size=5><bold>T</bold></font><font size=4>he third tunnel was from the same No. 5 Prison at <a href="./Eric/danville.html">Danville</a>.  It was dug in January and February, 1864, requiring about six weeks work.  Having learned, by previous experience, that such enterprises if generally known among the prisoners, would almost infallibly come to the knowledge of the prison authorities, the men formed an oatbound league, numbering sixty members, to do this work.  In the organization of this league, <a href="fn1">Sergeant John Obreiter</a>, of Company K, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, was elected first assistant engineer, and John H. Shirk, of Company E, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, second assistant.  The chief engineer was a western man.  He did not see the work until it was finished, when he went down and through it to liberty.  The work therefore all fell to the assistants and their helpers without and assistance or advice from the chief engineer.  It was done under the most trying circumstances.  Owing to the former attempts to escape, guards were at this time, placed inside of the building in addition to the regular guard surrounding it on the outside.  Yet, inspite of all difficulties, the work was secretly and successfully accomplished.  The entire length of the excavation was one hundred and eighty feet.  It ended under a small detached outbuilding, which was then used, which was then used as kitchen of a dwelling, which stood on ground adjoining the prison property built upon piers or posts about two and one-half feet or three feet above the ground.  The prisoners expected that it would screen them from the view of the guards while they passed into the streets of the town.  Fully one hundred and sixty escaped through this tunnel.  This was the largest number that escaped from any prison during the entire war.  A lady, living nearby, saw the soldiers coming from under the kitchen and reported the fact to the guards.  They promptly stopped the exodus.  But for this, prisoners would have continued going out until dawn, by which time the prison would have been almost emptied.</font>

<font size=5><bold>N</bold></font><font size=4>umber five prison was a large three storied brick structure of very substantial construction, and was used, prior to the Rebellion, as a plug tobacco factory, but during the war, it was turned into a military prison, which, at the time when the tunnels  were dug out from it, contained about 1,000 prisoners who were captured at the battle of Chickamauga.</font>
