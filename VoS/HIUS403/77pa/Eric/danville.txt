<font size=6><bold>I</bold></font><font size=4>n addition to being the home to numerous Union prisoners, Danville served as the temporary home to Jefferson Davis.  Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America, was forced to leave Richmond (the original capital) as the Union Army took over the city.  Davis probably went to Danville because of its proximity to Richmond and its location on the railroad.  The Capital was re-established in the Danville's Sutherland Mansion and Davis remained there until the end of the war.</font>
