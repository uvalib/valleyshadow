Not only was Col. Obreiter an officer in the Civil War and a leader of 
the most successful prison break during the entire Rebellion, he was 
also the co-author of the <a href="./biblio1.html">regimental history</a>of 
the Seventy-seventh 
Pennsylvania.  This regimental history allows historians to have a 
perspective that no contemporary writer can offer.  This account of the 
famous prison break was written by Obreiter himself.  Readers should note 
that he wrote of himself in the third person. </font>
