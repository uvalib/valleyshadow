Not only was Col. Obreiter an officer in the Civil War and a leader of 
the most successful prison break during the entire Rebellion, but he was 
also the co-author of the Regimental History of the Seventy-seventh 
Pennsylvania.  This regimental history allows historians to have a 
perspective that no contemporary writer can offer.  This account of the 
famous prison break was written by Obreiter himself.  Notice that he 
wrote of himself in the third person.
