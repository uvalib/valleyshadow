gang, but rather are the guttural warnings and intonations heard once upon a
time for 15 months on the streets of downtown Danville. 
    <p>    Between December 1863 and February 1865, Danville was wartime home to more
than 7,000 Union prisoners.  But it was a home many would have just as soon
forgotten.  Or avoided, if such were possible.
       <p> Though conditions were intolerable from the outset, the Danville prisons
were a cut above the hellholes of Andersonville, Ga., and Salisbury, N.C.
But that's damning with faint praise, for most every prison camp in that day
and age was a study in utter deprivation and, in some cases, wanton depravity.
      <p>  The Danville prisoners, however, were fortunate to have as their commandant
Colonel Robert C. Smith, "a cool, brave man and though strict in his prison
regulations, ... a humane gentleman."  But, as overseer of a ghastly
enterprise in a crumbling nation, not even Smith could prevent the steady
deterioration of conditions at the six prison buildings.
      <p>  The prisons suffered from a lack of provisions.  Food and clothing were at
a premium in the dying Confederacy; thus, there was little to be had for the
imprisoned soldiers of the enemy.  Or was there?
      <p>  Lieutenant Alonzo Cooper of the 12th New York Cavalry, in his war journal,
maintained that Federal prisoners were "dying of starvation in the midst of
plenty."  Danville, a vital rail depot, boasted - or so Cooper said - whole
buildings filled with captured Union food, particularly, hard tack and
bacon.  Nonetheless, over one 26-day period, said Cooper, the prisoners
'lone daily ration was a single piece of corn bread, known to the
Northerners as a "Johnny cake."  As meager as these rations were, they were
often unedible as well.
     <p>   Fortunately, some of this ill-prepared fare was negated by the generosity
of individual Danvillians, men such as B. F. Ficklin and Dr. George Dame,
the rector of The Episcopal Church of the Epiphany.  Both visited the
prisons weekly, if not daily, often atop wagons laden with food. Of Dr.
Dame, a New Hampshire man by birth, it was said, "More than Rebel or
Federal, he was a Christian man."
     <p>   Man of God though he was, Dr. Dame could, however, do little about the
weather.  The two winters the prisoners weathered happened to be unbearably
- and usually - cold.  On New Year's Day 1864 and the night after, the
thermometer barely crept above zero.  The men in the old warehouses cum
prisons either tramped incessantly about on the cold wood floors in an
effort to keep warm or huddled around the stoves, bullying and bartering
their way to better positions.  And when they weren't fighting the cold,
these Yankees were waging "pitched battles" against the ubiquitous vermin
      <p>  Small wonder then that disease was rampant throughout the six buildings.
No sooner had the prisoners arrived in late 1863 when a smallpox epidemic
broke out.  Many died, and thousands of others carried the unsightly
evidence of vaccination - a huge elbow-to-shoulder scab, the product either
of impure blood or, as some alleged, deliberately impure vaccine.
       <p> For weeks, the hastily constructed prison hospital on Lee Street was full.
And the days for such dedicated humanitarians as Dr. Levi Holbrook and Nurse
Anne Eliza Johns (for whom the local chapter of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy is named) were long and strenuous.  For all the hard work of
these volunteers, the death wagon made daily trips to the small but growing
cemetery yard by the hospital.  The burial ground, the permanent resting
place of 1,323 Yankee soldiers, is now a national cemetery.
      <p>  As the war drew to a close, the sad situation worsened.  Writing to Col. R.
H. Chilton of the Inspector General's office on Jan. 27, 1865, Inspecting
Officer A. S. Cunningham said, "The prisons at this post are in very bad
condition, dirty, filled with vermin, little or no ventilation, and there is
an insufficiency of fireplaces for the proper warmth of the Federal
prisoners therein confined ... The prisoners have almost no clothing, no
blankets, and a very small supply of food."  By then, the mortality rate had
risen to five prisoners daily.
       <p> The prisoners, however, grew philosophical about their lot.  Alfred S. Roe
of the Ninth, New York Heavy Artillery, a prisoner in Danville for upwards
of eight months, wrote in his journal that Colonel Smith and his underlings
did "as well as they could, but their best was bad enough."
      <p>  Of the 105 men from the Ninth New York who came to Danville with Roe, 27
never left.
       <p> All told, about 7,500 Union soldiers landed in Danville as prisoners, 4,000
coming on the first string of cattle cars which left Richmond on Nov. 11,
1863..  Only 3,000 survived.  By war's end, an  d in wake of the massive
prisoner exchange of February 1865, only 763 prisoners remained in Danville
when Gen. Horatio Wright's VI Corps occupied the city.
       <p> The final question:  Why Danville as a prison center?  Well, the city was
easily accessible to Richmond by rail and yet farm removed from the
hostilities of war.  Furthermore, in its many tobacco warehouses, Danville
possessed ready-made prison buildings.
      <p>  Six such three-story edifices, three of which were owned by tobacco
manufacturers J. W. and C. G. Holland, were selected to house the prisoners.
Four of these buildings were clustered about the intersection of Spring and
Union streets; a fifth was located on the corner of High and Floyd streets,
and the sixth, the turreted home of the Dibrell tobacco concern, stood on
the corner of Loyal and Lynn streets.
