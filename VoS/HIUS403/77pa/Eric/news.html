<p>
<font size=6><bold> V</bold></font><font size=4>eterans of America's 
bloodiest war and partners in derring-do, John 
Shirk, late of the 79th Pennsylvania, and John Obreiter, late of the 77th
Pennsylvania, remained in touch - even after the former moved to South
Dakota - and lived to be old men.  Or better yet, old soldiers.
       <p> Writing to Obreiter on Oct. 30, 1906, Shirk turned his aging 
glance back to
a time when "comradeship was brotherhood: and when their comrades-in-arms
"were willing to undertake anything, no matter how great the risks or
hardships."
       <p> What Shirk was remembering was the "Great Escape of 1864," when 
more than
100 Union prisoners, confined in Danville's Prison No. 5, crawled through a
170-foot tunnel to freedom.  Theirs is a story of camaraderie, conviction,
determination, perseverance and sweat.  Mostly sweat, for the work was
tedious and back-breaking.
       It is also a story of raw, unbridled courage.
<p>
<center><bold>WORMS AND GREENBACKS</bold></center>
       <p><font size=6><bold> S</bold></font><fonts size=4>hirk and Obreiter 
had endured more than their share of privation before
ever reaching Danville.  Captured at Chickamauga in Tennessee, they came to
Prison No. 5, a three-story warehouse on the corner of Floyd and High
streets, by a circuitous path, one which carried them through Atlanta,
Columbia, S.C., Raleigh, N.C., and finally to Richmond.
       <p> It was in the Confederate capital that they subsisted on a "Diet 
of Worms,"
so called for those little wiggly white creatures that fled cowpeas during
the preparation of the soupy gruel, which was a prison delicacy.  When not
feasting on such delights, Skirk, Obreiter and their fellow prisoners passed
the time scheming against the confederate guards.  They crudely
counterfeited banknotes in pen-and-ink, transformed "one dollar" greenbacks
into $10 notes by dint of a primitive eraser and a deft hand, and sold
anything they could get their hands on.
       <p> On November 11, 1863, after "residing" in Richmond for about six 
weeks, the
two men and the rest of the Chickamauga prisoners were loaded into
foul-smelling cattle cars and sent to Danville, where six tobacco warehouses
had been turned into prisons.  No., 5, where the Pennsylvanians called home,
was an L-shaped brick structure with a two-story frame annex attached to the
rear wing.  This annex was divided into four rooms, two on each floor.  The
building was surrounded by a high fence and patrolled closely by sentries.
In charge of No. 5, which housed 1,000 men, was a certain Mr. Christ of
Baltimore, or "Little Christ," as he was known to the Yankee prisoners.
        <p>These toughened veterans of bivouac and battlefield quickly 
settled into
old routines.  "Greenbacks" were produced, a building-wide black market was
established, and schemes were hatched.  With either "exchange" or "escape"
on everyone's mind, plans were forever being made, revised and revised again
on how best to break out.  A few were actually implemented.
<p>
<center><bold>EARLY FAILURES</bold></center>
<p><font size=6><bold> A</bold></font><font size=4>s one must first learn 
to crawl before walking and then to walk before
running, so too must prisoners accept defeat, then halting progress, and
finally limited success before pulling off a "great escape."  The Danville
experience proved no different for Shirk and Obreiter.
       <p> The first attempted escape from No. 5 was betrayed by a prisoner 
anxious to
curry favor with the guards.  His perfidy was uncovered and he was nearly
hanged.  Saved by the propitious arrival of guards, the man was hustled out
of No. 5.
       <p> In early Dec. 1863, 10 prisoners, the most enterprising being 
Corporal
Jacob Isenberger of the 77th Pennsylvania, swore themselves to secrecy and
decided to dig a tunnel to just beyond the guardline, via which they could
escape one night under the cover of darkness.
       <p> Tight-lipped and guarded, the conspirators pried a board loose 
in the first-floor corner where Isenberger was quartered.  Without drawing
attention to themselves, the men would dispatch a small work squad through
the tiny opening and then restore Isenberger's small cache of belongings to
its rightful space.  Day after day, these men descended into the crawlspace
beneath the first floor and, armed with only an old knife, a few sticks and
inordinate amounts of patience and elbow grease, would work resolutely
toward their goal. <p>
       Isenberger did much of the digging, depositing 
the earth near the tunnel
opening.  Three weeks of "the hardest kind of work" passed before he reached
a point far enough beyond the guardline for the group's purpose.
     <p>   And so one night late in December, the men who dug the tunnel - 
save for
Isenberger, whose Herculean efforts brought on a severe case of rheumatism -
dropped into the passage to lead the first contingent out.  By this time,
however, news of the tunnel had spread throughout the building and soon men
were pouring into the opening.  The clamor alarmed the guards, who rushed
into the building and, by force of bayonet, drove all the prisoners to the
second floor.  About 70, however, managed to escape.  It has never been
determined just how many made the Union lines - and safety.
<p>
<center><bold>DAWN-TO-DUSK DIGGING</bold></center><p>
       <font size=6><bold> S</bold></font><font size=4>tringent precautions 
were employed by "Little Christ" in wake of this
breakout.  No longer could the prisoners congregate on the first floor at
night; no longer could they mill about in the prison yard where the privies
were located.  The old warehouse was checked three times daily at irregular
intervals - sometimes at night and sometimes by "Little Christ" himself.
And the tunnel was filled in - and supposedly forgotten.
       <p> Except by Shirk and Obreiter and a number of other prisoners, 
who began
making plans almost immediately after the first try proved abortive.
Calling themselves "The Prisoners Union Safety League," they pledged their
secrecy to a new escape attempt. 
       <p> The League's best-laid plans revolved about a small kitchen, 12 
to 15 feet
square, some 80 feet from Isenberger's corner.  If a tunnel could be
extended beneath the kitchen, perhaps this building could screen the
prisoners' escape.  But first they had to get to the kitchen, a task far
easier said than done.
      <p>  Hopes were buttressed by the fact that 22 of the Leaguers lived 
in the two
rooms on the second floor of the frame annex.  Day and night, men dropped
through a small opening to the machinery room on the annex's first floor.
It was in this room that a length of iron, 15 inches long, 1 1/2 inches
wide, and on-eighth of an inch thick, was secured.  With this crude tool,
fastened to a piece of pine which served as a handle, Shirk and Obreiter
endeavored to cut through stone and scrape away pounds and pounds of clay
 soil.
       <p> Early in January, work began.  Day after day, the board in the 
annex floor
was replaced and a bit of dirt was passed over it so as not to arouse
suspicion.  Meanwhile, on the level below, boards were removed from the
floor of the machinery room and meticulously replaced.  The entrance to the
old tunnel stood 90 feet away, diagonally across the building.  The diggers,
led by Shirt and Obreiter, worked in silence, so careful were they not to
alarm the guards who walked their beats just feet away on the outside of the
building and mere inches above them on the first floor.
       <p> No less than four walls, including the foundation, stood 
between the
diggers and the entrance to Isenberger's tunnel.  Boring through the
foundation from the annex took days, yet completion of this task did not
assure the workers of any relief, staring them in the face was a wall of
earth which reached nearly as high as the floorboards.  Undaunted, they
accepted this weighty chore and struggled on.
       <p> Their lone worry was where to put all the dirt; they could no 
longer work
the fill back to the machinery room without the guards detecting the large
quantities of earth.  Fortunately, Obreiter discovered what proved to be an
old cistern, a large opening to the left of the trench he was digging.  So
this concern was remedied, and the work dragged on into February.
       <p> As the tunnelers pierced each wall in their path, their work 
became
increasingly easier as the slope of the land downward grew more pronounced.
This meant less digging.  Finally, after the fourth wall was breached, the
mouth of the old tunnel appeared.
        <p>Shirk and Obreiter, working in alternate shifts, reopened this 
passage and
- slowly, painstakingly but surely - commenced burrowing toward the kitchen.
Light was provided by the dim flame of a lard lamp - an old piece of tin
shaped into a cup and filled with lard, with a piece of string for a wick -
as yards and yards of dirt were passed backward via a small wooden box.
Shifts beneath the ground became shorter and shorter as breathing grew more
and more labored. But still the work went on.
        <p>On Feb. 25, Obreiter, working tirelessly from dawn until dusk, 
jabbed his
digging tool into the ground above his head.  Air sifted through, and then
light, long slashes of light as if seeping through ... floorboards.  He
jabbed harder and felt wood.  The kitchen!
       <p> Three days later, on a night when the moon rose late in the 
winter sky, the
League assembled in the annex room and then, one by one, disappeared into
the darkness.  Then, in orderly fashion, came their fellow prisoners.  No
less than 160 had made their way unnoticed to the kitchen and beyond, to the
streets of Danville, when a city woman heard the hushed sounds of whispers
and the pounding of heels.  She correctly surmised a prison break and
reported it to the proper authorities.
<p>
<center><bold>BREAKOUT</bold></center><p>
       <font size=6><bold> O</bold></font><font size=4>breiter, Shirk and 
their traveling companion, Frank Sweeney of the 2nd
Michigan Cavalry, slipped quietly away from the kitchen - just as a lonely
sentinel was issuing his standard "Post No. 5 and all is well" - and lit out
of town in a southerly direction, hoping to confuse any and all pursuers.
The following night they turned east - for Suffolk and its Union garrison.
       <p> Three days into their journey, they met another trio of 
escapees, all of
whom hailed from Indiana.  Walking by night and hiding by day they inched
gradually eastward, nourished by whatever they could obtain from friendly
slaves, one of whom joined them to swell their ranks to seven. 
       <p> Danger swirled constantly around these sojourners.  One night 
near
Hicksford (now Emporia), they dodged an old Rebel scout riding a white
horse.  Shortly thereafter, en route to Weldon, N.C., from Hicksford, they
hid in a long row of bushes as a train full of Confederate infantry raced
past them.
        <p>But one day in Southampton County, their good luck finally ran 
out.  Shirk
was captured when he followed the runaway slave to - of all places - the
county sheriff's home in search of rations.  Obreiter and Sweeney were
nabbed to nights later by a detachment of cavalrymen from the 31st of North
Carolina.
        <p>And thus began another Marienbad-esque series of events which 
took the two
Pennsylvanians to the dungeon of Libby Prison in Richmond, to Belle Isle
Prison, and finally to dreaded Andersonville.
        <p>No need to be alarmed, though, Obreiter and Shirk busted out of 
that joint too.  And lived to write about it.
