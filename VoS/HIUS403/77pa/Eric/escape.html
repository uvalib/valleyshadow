<font size=6><bold>T</bold></font><font size=4>he prisoners from the 
regiment were passed through the Confederate lines, taken to Atlanta, and 
from thence, by rail, to Richmond.  Here the commissioned officers were 
put into Libby (Prison), and the 
enlisted men into other prisons.  In November the men were taken to 
Danville, Virginia, and 
subsequently Andersonville, Georgia.  Fifty-seven of these died while in 
prisons principally at Andersonville, leaving only seven survivors out of the sixty-four.  That 
fact alone speaks volumes as to the treatment received by the Union prisoners of war, during the Rebellion.</font> 
<p>
<font size=4>In the prisons too the 
Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania had a unique distinction.  Members of it were prominently engaged while confined in prisons in the three most successful tunnels that were dug out of military prisons, during the entire Rebellion.  
Colonel Thomas E. Rose was the head of 
the Libby Prison tunnel.  Under very great difficulties it was dug from the building, under the street, ending under a shed which admirably screened the escaping prisoners.  This excavation was about fifty feet in length.  Through it escaped one hundred a
nd nine officers, Colonel Rose among them.  He was re-captured, but was afterwards exchanged and reached his regiment in time to participate in the Atlanta campaign.</font>  
<p>
<font size=4>The second tunnel referred 
to, was dug from Prison No. 5, Danville, Virginia, in 
December, 1863.  It was somewhat shorter than the Libby tunnel and ended in the open, outside of the guard line.  It opened in plain view of the guards.  The men depended entirely upon the darkness of the night to enable them to escape unobserved.  About 









seventy escaped through this burrow.  Corporal Jacob Eisenberger, of Company K, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, was one the leaders, and a prominent worker in this enterprise.</font>  
<p>
<font size=4>The third tunnel was from 
the same No. 5 Prison at Danville.  It 
was dug in January and February, 1864, requiring about six weeks work.  
Having learned, by previous experience, that such enterprises if 
generally known among the prisoners, would almost infallibly come to the knowledge of the prison authorities, the men formed an oatbound league, numbering sixty members, to do this work.  In the organization of this league, Sergeant John Obreiter, of Comp








any K, Seventy-seventh 
Pennsylvania, was elected first assistant engineer, and John H. Shirk, of 
Company E, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, second assistant.  The chief 
engineer was a western man.  He did not see the work until it was finished, when he went down and through it to liberty.  The work therefore all fell to the assistants and their helpers without and assistance or advice from the chief engineer.  It was don
e 
under the most trying circumstances.  Owing to the former attempts to 
escape, guards were at this time, placed inside of the building in 
addition to the regular guard surrounding it on the outside.  Yet, 
inspite of all difficulties, the work was secretly and successfully 
accomplished.  The entire length of the excavation was one hundred and 
eighty feet.  It ended under a small detached outbuilding, which was then used, which was then used as kitchen of a dwelling, which stood on ground adjoining the prison property built upon piers or posts about
two and one-half feet or three feet above the ground.  The prisoners expected that it would screen them from the view of the guards while they passed into the streets of the town.  Fully one hundred and sixty escaped through this tunnel.  This was the 
largest number that escaped from any prison during the entire war.  A 
lady, living nearby, saw the soldiers coming from under the kitchen and reported the fact to the guards.  They promptly stopped the exodus.  But for this, prisoners would have continue
going out until dawn, by which time the prison would have been almost emptied.</font>
<p>
<font size=4>Number five prison was a 
large three storied brick structure of very substantial construction, and 
was used, prior to the Rebellion, as a plug tobacco factory, but during 
the war, it was turned into a military prison, which, at the time when the tunnels  were dug out from it, contained about 1,000 prisoners who were captured at the battle of Chickamauga.</font>
