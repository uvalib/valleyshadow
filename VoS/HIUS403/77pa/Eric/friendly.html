<font size=+1>"The camp was located at the foot of a huge mountain from the 
top of which 
the enemy's camps were in plain view from the south side of the Tennesse 
river.  While in camp here the 77th picketed the north side of the 
Tennesse, while the Confederate picket line extended along the south 
side of the river.  The lines being in plain view of each other, 
frequent conversations, across the river, were held by the boys in blue 
with those in gray."</font><br><p><br>--Sgt. John Obreiter
