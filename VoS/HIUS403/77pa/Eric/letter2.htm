Camp Near Battle Creek, Tenn<br>

Dear Brother<BR>
 
<p>I now take the Plesure of writing you to let you know that I am well hoping that
these few lines may find you and your family Enjoying the same Blessing. Abe, why
don't you write to me. this is the fifth letter I wrote to you and I aint got any 
answer to any. We are now lying at Battle Creek and we got Picketing about 2 miles
from Camp Every three days where we can have a Chat with the Rebels whenever we feel
like it. I had a talk with a fellow that was Born and Raised in Columbia. he was Raised
by a man by the name of Mullisson (Jim Mullisson's Father). he's a Tinker by trade--
learned his trade in Columbia and left there time of the Cholera and got to Texas 
some how. there he got married and when they Commenced to Enlist there for the Rebel 
Army, he joined the 2nd Texas Regt. I asked him why he didnt come on our side to 
fight he said he had too much Property in Texas for that. I asked him his name but
he wouldnt tell it. he was Purty well acquainted in Lancaster. Also he Asked me all
about John Hoover, Henry Hampshreville & Andy Hart. He said he Played many a game of
Ten Pins with them but he didnt recollect you nor Morney Rodgers. I guess you must
have been in Philadelphia at the time he was in with them fellows. we Talked for about
1 hour and a half when they was Relieved. after he was Relieved he told me to take
care of myself and hoped that we might have a drink together and he left. We are in
a Purty light Place here just now, but we are Throwing up entrenchments and I think 
we can stand them. there was a couple of Deserters came in last Evening and they said
Rebels had about 85,000 between here and Chattanooga, while we haint 10,000 at the 
out side but McCook's wide awakes and he's making Preparations to Recieve them. Bill
Diffenderfer Died on the 16th. I think he was struck with the Palsey. he is the 6th
one that Died out of our Co. & we have only 39 men in our Co. for Duty. Pyper is trying
to take orderly from me. he haint been half tending to his Buisness and I went into
him the other day and asked him about some fellows that to the hospital. and we had some
words and I hinted as much as he doesnt tend to his Buisness and since that he's down on
me the worst kind. why when he got word that Diffenderfer was dead we was just leaving 
Camp to go on Picket and he says to me, why says, hell didnt know Billy was sick atal,
and he was lying sick not more than 15 yards from his tent (the Capt's tent) afore he went
to the Hospital. but he is now begining to see his mistake and he is keeping his 
Eyes a little more about him. there aint a man in the Company but what is wishing 
that somthing would turn up that he would get out of the Company. Either that he 
would die, get shot or Resign, anything atal, only so's he'd get out of this. Shroat 
begining to put on airs too. let me know what kind of a muss that was that Mary and 
Sarah had. Give my Best Respects to Sarah, Aby, Edy, and all Enquiring Friends and
answer this as soon as you get it and let me know all particulars.
