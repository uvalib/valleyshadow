<br>Dear Brother<br><br>

<p>I now take this oppertunity to inform you that I am well at Present hoping
that these few lines may find you and all the Rest of the folks in the same
state of health. we are now laying about five miles south of Nashville. we 
got here on the 3rd. Nashville is a Purty Place and it has the appearance 
of being a buisness Place at one time but Buisness is suspended there now. 
all the stores and Buisness shops are Closed and the City is diserted of 
nearly all its inhabitants except the Ladys and they are all secesh and 
wear a secesh flag for Aprons and have a belt around their waists with 
an Ivory handled Colt Revolving Pistol of the best quality sticking in it.
Nashville and all the surround Country is secesh and they dont try to hide it
neither. we was out on Picket night afore last and towards morning about time
the moon went down, the left end of our  Picket Line was fired into by some 
Rebel Cavalry. there was about 300 of them in all but they stayed about 200 or
300 yards away from our Picket line with the exceptions of 15 that dismounted
and Came up to within hailing distance of our Pickets. they where 5 or 6 
abrest as we Could judge for it was dark and the minute our Pickets Challenged
them they fired one volly and Retreated. our men fired on them while they were
Retreating but with what effect we Couldnt hear if there was any of them hurt.
they was taking along by their Comrades on our side. there was no body hurt but
I must say they did some tall shooting for random shooting. the only guide they
had was the Direction the Pickets voice Came and he came near being Put out. 
two balls struck the fence, one each side of him, but Captain Philips made the 
Narrowest Escape of all. the uper band of his sword scabard was shot off, one
shot grazing the Back of his hand taking the skin of about an inch. another 
struck about the Centre of his scabard, bending the sword & scabard about 2
inches out of Plumb, whiles Passed through his Coat tail. the best part of 
them being Buckshot. the Rebels Cartridges have three Buckshot & one rond Ball
in them. they have attacked 3 times now. the first they attacked the 30th scnd 
out of our brigade--In stationing the Pickets 4 goes on a Post 20 yards apart
is the General Rule but the Indianna Boys where Placed about 50 yards apart 
and the Rebels took advantage of the Distance and took 4 of them off their 
Post in Broad day light and caried them off as Prisoners and they aint got
Back yet either. the way they managed to do it, there was about 25 of them
Cavelry road up with about 30 yards of the Pickets taking care to keep behind
a hill that the Pickets couldnt see them when one of them dismound and to hide 
suspicion he had on one of our uniforms on so he got to the Pickets without 
much trouble and got talking them awhile when he give a certain signal and as
quick as lightning the Rebels galloped up to them, draged them on their Horses 
and off with them. it was done so quick that the rest of the Pickets didnt get 
a shot at them. I tell you theyre as sharp as they make them these days. the 
next attack they made was on the First wisconsin, killing one and wounding five.
the wisconsin killed 3 of their men, wounded 3 and some of the 29th Indiana 
Boys took one of them Prisoner. he belonged to the First Louisianna Cavelry. 
he is a bold looking fellow and he says he dont give a damn wether school 
keeps or not and he says if they let him go he will fight against the Union 
Troops as hard as ever. he says he wont be a Prisoner 6 month, he would be 
shot first. the next attack they made on us the Parteculars of which I have 
stated on the other Page. this morning about 3 oclock there was firing our 
Picket line again and at the same Place we were fired on yesterday morning, 
but I didnt hear how they made out. the 49th Ohio Relieved us yesterday about
4 oclock in the afternoon and they will be relieved by some other Regt at the 
same time to day and I wont Close this till I hear how the Ohioians made out 
with the secesh. they'll be in about 4 oclock But I dont think there was anything
of any
