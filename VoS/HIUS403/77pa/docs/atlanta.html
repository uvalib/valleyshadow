  moved forward one; finding the enemy in force, we

  17, the regiment moved forward some distance and went into camp.
  There was heavy skirmishing along the line, but my regiment was
  not engaged. On Saturday, June 18, the skirmishing still continued,
  but the brigade to which my regiment belongs was in reserve,
  consequently we were not engaged. On Sunday, June 19, we again
  moved forward; were met by the rebels about a mile distant from
  our starting point, where our skirmishers engaged the enemy; fell
  slowly back to the foot of Kenesaw Mountain; the casualties in
  the regiment were 1 commissioned officer wounded, 2 enlisted men
  killed, and 7 enlisted men wounded. On Monday, June 20, the regiment
  lay in front of Kenesaw all day; no casualties. On Tuesday,
  June 21, the regiment moved forward and to the right. We were
  here opened upon by two batteries from the rebels. We threw up a
  new line of works, it being already the third before Kenesaw in
  about twenty-four hours; the casualties from the enemy's shells
  were 1 enlisted man killed and 2 enlisted men wounded. On
  Wednesday, June 22, the enemy opened upon us the same as before, 
  but our works being completed we were better protected, and no
  casualties occurred in the regiment. On Thursday, June 23, the
  regiment moved to the right and lay in reserve until dark, when
  we moved forward close to the enemy, and during the night completed
  a strong earth-work. On Friday, June 24, we had some
  skirmishing; lost 1 enlisted man wounded. On Saturday and Sunday,
  25th and 26th of June, the position of the regiment was

  by another regiment of our brigade, and we moved back to the second
  line and encamped. On Friday, July 1, we continued in camp
  on the second line. On Saturday, July 2, the regiment again moved
  forward to the front line; no casualties. On Sunday, July 3, about
  2 a. m., the rebels evacuated their works, and we moved forward at
  once and occupied them. Took several prisoners. We then moved
  forward to Marietta and five miles beyond to Smyrna, where we
  found the enemy strongly fortified. On Monday, July 4, at 11 a. m.
  we charged the enemy's works, capturing the rifle-pits, with a large
  number of prisoners, and killing and wounding several of the enemy;
  our loss was 1 commissioned officer wounded and 1 enlisted man
  killed, and 17 enlisted men wounded. During the night the enemy
  fell back to the Chattahoochee River and left us in full possession
  of their strong works at Smyrna, which we immediately occupied.
  On Tuesday, July 5, at daybreak we commenced pursuing the enemy.
  The regiment moved forward to Vining's Station, thence one
  mile to the left and encamped on the Chattahoochee River. On
  Wednesday, July 6, the regiment lay in camp, our skirmishers exchanging
  occasional shots across the river. We lay in this camp
  until the 10th. On Sunday, July 10, we marched up the river about
  five miles, where the regiment encamped within about one-half mile
  of the river, and continued in camp until the 12th. On Tuesday,
  July 12, we marched early, crossed the Chattahoochee on canvas
  pontoons, and moved down the river some distance, to a high bluff
  overlooking the river, where we encamped until the 18th. On
  Monday, July 18, the regiment moved forward toward Atlanta six
  miles, and encamped. On Tuesday, July 19, we marched at 11 a.m.
  about three miles, to Peach Tree Creek, on the opposite bank of
  which we threw up works; had Some skirmishing but no casualties.
  On Wednesday, July 20, we marched to within three miles of Decatur,
  and then took the road to Atlanta, in all about four miles.
  We went into position in line and the enemy made a fierce attack
  on our skirmishers, but were repulsed; the casualties of this regiment
  were only 2 enlisted men wounded. On Thursday, July 21, at
  sunrise this regiment moved forward to the line of skirmishers and
  threw up works under a pretty heavy fire; our casualties were 1
  commissioned officer and 4 enlisted men wounded. The enemy
  retreated during the night. On Friday, July 22, before daylight,  
  we commenced pursuing the enemy, this regiment taking the advance,
  and at sunrise, owing to the fog, we came up with the rebels
  quite abruptly. We were quickly in line, however, and after a
  pretty sharp skirmish we commenced throwing up works within
  two miles of the town of Atlanta and within 1,500 yards of one of
  the enemy's forts; the casualties of the regiment were 4 enlisted
  men wounded. On Tuesday, July 26, a demonstration was made in
  which our skirmish line was somewhat advanced. This regiment
  lost 3 men wounded. On the 5th of August a like demonstration
  was made, in which five companies of this regiment charged up to
  the enemy's works and were repulsed, with the loss of 1 commissioned
  officer and 5 enlisted men killed, and 14 enlisted men wounded,
  On the 17th of August this regiment changed camp from the extreme
  right to the extreme left of the brigade; the casualties were 3 enlisted
  men wounded on the picket-line. On Thursday, August 25.
  at dark, as the army commenced to move, the regiment withdrew
  from the works and moved to the right and bivouacked at Proctor's
  Creek, distance seven miles. On Friday, August 26, the regiment
  continued the march to the right, passing a portion of the Army of
  the Tennessee and the Fourteenth Army Corps, and encamped at 5
  p. m., after marching about eight miles. On Saturday, August 27,
  advanced rapidly to Gilead Church, a distance of six miles. On
  Sunday, August 28, we marched, at about 3 p. m., a distance of
  about three miles, and bivouacked near the West Point railroad in
  a fine agricultural country. On Monday, August 29, the regiment
  assisted in destroying a large portion of the railroad. On Tuesday,
  August 30, we marched southeast, a distance of about three miles,
  and encamped in a thick woods. On Wednesday, August 31, we
  moved early in the morning and marched about five miles to near
  the Macon railroad and encamped for the night. On Thursday,
  September 1, we marched to the railroad and commenced destroying
  it. We moved down the railroad destroying it as we went, until
  we came near Jonesborough, where we formed line of battle and advanced
  on the enemy, who was intrenched at that place. This regiment,
  on the extreme right of the brigade, advanced through a dense
  thicket for about one-half a mile, close to the enemy's main line,
  where we threw up slight works under a heavy fire of musketry and
  canister; the casualties were only 2 wounded. During the night
  the enemy retreated. On Friday, September 2, we moved down the
  railroad to Lovejoy's Station, where we again found the enemy.
  The division to which my brigade and regiment is attached moved
  to the left, and formed line of battle, when we moved forward and
  engaged the enemy. My regiment was held in reserve and did not
  become engaged, although we were part of the time under a brisk
  fire. No casualties. On Saturday, September 3, my regiment moved
  up to the front line early and relieved the Seventy-fifth Illinois, of
  our brigade. As my regiment was much larger than the Seventy-fifth,
  I was obliged to prolong the works in order to protect my
  men. As soon as the fog arose the enemy opened a concentrated
  fire of musketry with artillery upon my regiment, and kept it up
  until our works were completed. The casualties of the regiment at
  this place were 1 commissioned officer killed and 1 severely wounded,
  and 11 enlisted men wounded. We remained at this place until the
  night of the 5th, when we withdrew and marched to Jonesborough,
  where we remained until the 7th. On Wednesday, September 7, the  
  regiment marched to Rough and Ready, and encamped for the night
  On Thursday, September 8, marched through Atlanta and encamped
  two miles from the town in the direction of Decatur.<br><br>
<p>
  From the 3d of May until June 7 the regiment was commanded
  by Capt. J. J. Lawson, Company C. On the 7th of June I returned
  to the regiment, and have been personally in command during all of
  the time since.</P>
