Report of Brig. Gen. Alexander McD. McCook,<br>
U. S. Army, commanding Second Division.<br>

  <P>HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, ARMY OF THE OHIO, Field of Shiloh, April 9, 1862.
  SIR: I have the honor herewith to report that on the morning of the 6th
  instant, while on the march, at a point 12 miles from the town of
  Savannah, Tenn., I received an order to hasten forward with my
  division, with three days' rations in haversacks and all my supply of
  ammunition. On account of the condition of the roads and baggage trains
  it was impossible for me to get more than two days' rations and the 40
  rounds of cartridges in the cartridge boxes of the men. I hastened
  forward, arriving at Savannah at 7 p. m. on the 6th instant, with my
  entire division, except the Second Regt. of Kentucky Cavalry, which
  was left to guard the baggage. After resting my men two hours I
  marched to the river with Gen. Rousseaus'  brigade, ordering the
  other brigades and the artillery to follow immediately. Arriving at the
  steamboat landing, I found no preparation made whatever to convey my
  division to this battle-field. I ordered my staff aboard boats at the
  Landing, compelling the captains to get out of their beds and prepare
  their boats for my use. I succeeded in embarking Gen. Rousseau's
  brigade. As boats arrived I pressed them into service, and embarked
  the Thirty-fourth Regt. of Illinois Volunteers, belonging to Col.
  Kirk's brigade, and left with it for the field, leaving instructions at
  Savannah for the other portion of my division to follow as rapidly as
  means of transportation was afforded.</P>
  <P>
  Arriving at Pittsburg Landing at 5 o'clock a. m. on the 7th instant,
  finding Gen. Rousseau's brigade disembarking, I marched forward
  to a point where I believed it would be of the most service. I there met
  Gen. Buell, who directed me to form my line of battle with my left
  resting near Gen. Crittenden's right and my right resting toward the
  north. I immediately formed this line with Gen. Rousseau's brigade
  upon the ground designated, my right being without support. As soon
  as the remainder of Col. Kirk's brigade arrived I placed his brigade
  in position as a reserve. When these arrangements were completed I
  ordered the line of cross a ravine and to take advantage of the high
  ground in front, having previously thrown two companies from each
  regiment of Gen. Rousseau's brigade forward as skirmishers. The
  line became immediately engaged with a superior force of the enemy,
  the main attack being made on the right Knowing that my right had no
  support, I ordered Col. Kirk's brigade, with the exception of Col.
  Stumbaugh's Seventy-seventh Regt. of Pennsylvania Volunteers,
  forward to take a position on the right of Gen. Rousseau's brigade,
  with instructions to watch the enemy, and if they were attacked, to hold
  that ground at every hazard. In the mean time a portion of Col.
  Gibson's brigade arrived, and I, still believing that the heaviest attack
  was being made on my right, ordered Col. Willich's Thirty-second
  Regt. of Indiana Volunteers to from a line in the rear of the center,
  to be used as circumstances might require. The enemy's attack on the
  right and center was continuous and severe, but the steady valor of
  Gen. Rousseau's brigade repulsed him. He was vigorously pursued
  for the distance of a mile, when he received large re-enforcements and
  rallied among the tents of a portion of Gen. McClernand's division,
  from which it had been driven on the 6th instant. Here, supported by
  two pieces of artillery, which were lost the day before, the enemy made
  a desperate stand.</P>
  <P> 
  At this juncture Col. Buckley's Fifth Regt. Kentucky Volunteers
  charged and captured the two guns in position, with four more of the
  same battery, partially disabled, which the enemy could not carry off.
  Here Gen. Rousseau had the pleasure of retaking Gen.
  McClernand's headquarters, and at this time it is supposed Gen. A.
  S. Johnston fell, as his body was found on the outer edge of this
  encampment. The enemy fell back over an open field, and reformed in
  the skirt of the woods beyond. Gen. Rousseau's brigade then
  advanced into the open field to engage him. The advance of my division
  had created a space between it and Gen. Crittenden's, and the enemy
  began massing troops to take advantage of this gap in our line, made
  unavoidable by the attempt of the enemy to turn my right flank and his
  subsequent retreat. I immediately ordered Col. Willich to advance to
  the support of Gen. Rousseau's left and to give the enemy the
  bayonet as soon as possible. His regiment filed through the lines of
  Col. Kirk's brigade, which had been withdrawn from the right when
  the danger menacing that flank had passed, and advanced into a most
  withering fire of shell, canister, and musketry, which for a moment
  staggered it; but it was soon rallied, and for an account of the numerous
  conflicts and desperate charges this regiment made I refer you to
  Col. Willich's report, transmitted herewith.</P>
  <P> 
  Being now satisfied that the enemy had changed his point of attack
  from the right to my extreme left, I ordered Col. Stumbaugh's
  Seventy-seventh Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers to take up a position
  on my extreme left and repel the assault there being made. He
  immediately engaged them, and at this moment the contest along the
  whole line became terrible. Col. Kirk's brigade was now ordered to
  engage, and he arrived precisely at the right moment, as the cartridges
  of Gen. Rousseau's brigade were all expended. Gen. Rousseau's
  brigade fell back through openings made in Col. Kirk's ranks, and
  retired to the woods in the rear to be supplied with ammunition.
  Three hours before, being convinced from the stubbornness with which
  the enemy was contending and the rapid discharges of my regiments that
  their 40 rounds of cartridges would soon be exhausted, I dispatched
  Lieut. Campbell, my ordnance officer, for teams to bring up
  ammunition. He arrived at the opportune moment with three wagon
  loads. While Gen. Rousseau's brigade was being supplied with
  ammunition, I ordered Col. Gibson's brigade to engage on the left
  of Col. Kirk's, where the enemy was still endeavoring to force his
  way. At this moment every available man was under fire, and the enemy
  seemed to increase in the vigor and the rapidity of his attack. Now the
  contest for a few moments became terrific. The enemy, to retake the
  ground and battery lost, advanced with a force of at least 10,000 men
  against my two brigades, and when he deployed in line of battle the fires
  from the contending ranks were two continuous sheets of flame. Here
  Maj. Levanway, commanding the Thirty-fourth Regt. of Illinois
  Volunteers, was killed by a shell, and the regiment wavered for a
  moment, when Col. Kirk, colonel of the regiment, but commanding
  the Fifth Brigade, seized a flag, rushed forward, and steadied the line
  again. While doing this he was severely wounded in the shoulder.</P>
  <P> 
  The enemy now began to turn the left of Col. Gibson's brigade,
  when the Forty-ninth Ohio, by this disposition of the enemy, was
  compelled to change its front twice, which was done under a heavy fire.
  I am proud to say that this hazardous maneuver was performed with
  apparently as much steadiness as on parade.</p>
  <p>
  As soon as Gen. Rousseau's brigade received its ammunition it was
  again ordered into line, and I directed into action two regiments
  belonging to Gen. Hurlbut's division, which had been lying in reserve
  on my left since morning. When these dispositions were made I ordered
  an advance of my whole command, which was made in gallant style.
  The enemy did not withstand the charge, but fled, leaving all of their
  wounded, and were pursued by my division beyond Gen. Sherman's
  headquarters of the day before, where the pursuit was taken up by the
  cavalry and artillery. During the action I momentarily expected the
  arrival of Capt. Terrill and his battery. I sent an aide-de-camp to
  conduct him to me, so that I could put him in position. The
  aide-de-camp, through mistake, took the road which led to Gen.
  Nelson's right. Capt. Terrill was there ordered by Gen. Buell into
  position. This officer did not fight under my immediate supervision, but
  from his report, herewith appended, and the verbal acknowledgment to
  me of Gen. Nelson, he fought his battery gallantly and judiciously,
  and I commend him and his officers to my superiors. Capt. Terrill,
  on account of his strict attention to duty in the past and conspicuous
  gallantry in this terrible conflict, is worthy of any promotion that can be
  bestowed upon him. My other two batteries, Capt.'s Stone's and
  Goodspeed's, did not arrive in time to participate in the conflict.
  To the three brigade commanders-Gen. Rousseau, Col.'s Kirk  
  and Gibson-the country is indebted for much of the success in this part
  of the field. Gen. Rousseau led his brigade into action, and opened
  the conflict in this division in a most handsome and gallant style. He
  was ever to be seen watching the contest with a soldierly care and
  interest, which made him the admiration of the entire command. Col.
  Kirk, who during the action was severely wounded in the shoulder,
  coolly and judiciously led his men under fire. He has been in command
  of the Fifth Brigade for some months, and much of its efficiency is due
  to the care and labor he bestowed upon it. I respectfully call your
  attention to his meritorious services upon this day.</P>
  <p>
  Col. Gibson, although temporarily in command of the Sixth Brigade,
  displayed great steadiness and judgment during the action. The
  maneuvers of his troops in the face of the enemy attest his skill and
  ability.</P>
  <P>
  Col. Stumbaugh, with the Seventy-seventh Regt. of Pennsylvania
  Volunteers, early in the action being ordered to watch the enemy upon
  my left, was at a later period ordered to engage. His regiment, partially
  isolated from the rest of the division, steadily moved over an open field
  in its front under a heavy fire. While here the enemy's cavalry charged
  this regiment twice, but were each time repulsed with heavy loss.
  Col. Stumbaugh had the satisfaction of receiving the sword of
  Col. Battle, of the Twentieth Tennessee, who surrendered to him as
  a prisoner. Lieut.-Col. Housum and Maj. Bradford ably
  seconded the efforts of Col. Stumbaugh.</P>
  <P>
  Col. Bass, of the Thirtieth Regt. Indiana Volunteers, was
  wounded twice; which is the best evidence of his bearing and bravery.
  After Col. Bass' last wound Lieut.-Col. Dodge, ably assisted
  by Maj. Hurd, took the command of the regiment. All three of these
  officers deserve the thanks of their State and country.</P>
  <P>
  Lieut.-Col. Dunn, commanding the Twenty-ninth Regt. of
  Indiana Volunteers, was marked by all for his coolness and bravery.
  Capt. Bristol, of the Thirty-fourth Regt. of Illinois Volunteers,
  who took command of the regiment after the death of Maj. Levanway,
  greatly distinguished himself during the day. Capt. S. T. Davis, of the
  Seventy-seventh Regt. of Pennsylvania Volunteers, acting assistant
  adjutant-general of the Fifth Brigade; Capt. Beehler and Lieut.
  Dexter, of the Thirty-fourth Regt. of Illinois Volunteers (all upon
  Col. Kirk's staff), were of great assistance to him during the
  engagement. I mention the names of the officers in the Fifth Brigade
  because the debility incident to Col. Kirk's wound precludes the
  possibility of getting a report from him.</P>
  <p>
  For the instances of individual bravery and gallantry in the Fourth and
  Sixth Brigades, where all were gallant, I refer you to the reports of
  Gen. Rousseau and Col. Gibson, transmitted herewith.</P>
  <p>
  The bravery and steadiness of the officers and men under my command
  are worthy all praise, considering the circumstances surrounding them.
  The day before the battle they marched 22 miles; a portion of them
  stood all night in the streets of Savannah in a driving storm, without
  sleep; all the way from Savannah the river banks were lined with
  fugitives in Federal uniform. At Pittsburg Landing the head of my
  column had to force its way through thousands of panic-stricken and
  wounded men before it could engage the enemy. I take pleasure in
  calling your attention to the conduct of Col. Oliver and a portion of
  the Fifteenth Regt. of Michigan Volunteers. When my division was
  marching into the field Col. Oliver, before unknown to me,
  requested the privilege of serving with my command. His regiment was
  attached to Gen. Rousseau's brigade, and during the day was under
  the hottest fire, where he, his officers and men, behaved with
  conspicuous gallantry.</P>
  <p>
  To the members of my staff, Capt. Daniel McCook, assistant
  adjutant-general; Lieut. S. W. Davis, W. T. Hoblitzell, and W. F.
  Straub, aides-de-camp; Lieut. J. A. Campbell, ordnance officer;
  Capt. Orris Blake, provost-marshal; Lieut. Blake, assistant
  provost-marshal; Capt. J. D. Williams, assistant commissary of
  subsistence; Lieut.'s Galbraith and Johnson, Signal Corps, and
  Acting Aide-de-Camp J. P. Collier, of Ohio, I return my grateful
  thanks. I commend them to my superiors for their gallantry in action
  and for the intelligent manner in which they conveyed and
  communicated my orders on the field of battle. Capt. J. F. Boyd, my
  ever-efficient division quartermaster, was absent in Savannah,
  superintending the embarkation of the troops.</p>
  <P>
  I did not see Dr. Meylert, medical director, upon the field, but am
  informed he was assigned to a post of duty elsewhere.</p>
  <p>
  Lieut. Col. E. A. Parrott, First Ohio Volunteers, my acting
  inspector-general, did not attend me as a staff officer, but joined and
  fought with his regiment, and for mention of his services I refer you to
  Gen. Rousseau's report.</P>
  <p>
  I am sorry that I was deprived upon this day of the services of Brig.
  Gen. R. W. Johnson, commanding the Sixth Brigade. Severe illness
  caused his absence from his command at Columbia, Tenn. The
  efficiency of the Sixth Brigade is very much due to his talents and
  abilities, and it is to be regretted that he did not have an opportunity
  upon this day to add new laurels to his military name.</P>
  <p>
  My casualties during the conflict were 93 killed, 803 wounded, and 9
  missing. The small number of the latter indicates the manner in which
  the division was held in hand. I herewith inclose a tabular statement of
  the killed and wounded and missing in each brigade.*</p><BR>

  I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,<BR><BR>

  A. McD. McCOOK,<BR>
  Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Second Division.<BR><br>

  Capt. J. B. FRY,<br>
  Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Chief of Staff.<br>
