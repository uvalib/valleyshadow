<BR>
  HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION,<br>
  In Camp, July 2, 1862.<br>
<BR>
<BR><p>
  COL.: In compliance with section II of Special Field Orders,
  No. 99, June 9, 2862, from Department of the Mississippi, I have
  the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my division
  from the time of leaving Pittsburg Landing to the evacuation of Corinth:
  My division consists of the Fourth Brigade, Brig. Gen. L. H.
  Rouseau; Sixth Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Johnson, and the Fifth
  Brigade, Col. F. S. Stumbaugh.</p>
<p>
  On the morning of April 8, the day succeeding the battle of Shiloh, I
  marched my division from Pittsburg Landing, where it had bivouacked
  the night of the battle, some 2 miles to the front, where I bivouacked
  until April 15, awaiting the arrival of my transportation. As my
  division suffered severely in this camp from sickness, occasioned by bad
  water and the stench arising from the unburied carcasses of horses, on
  the 15th I moved about 1 mile to the front, where, my transportation
  having arrived, I established camp between the divisions of Gen. W.
  T. Sherman on my right and Gen. Crittenden, on my left.</P>
<p>

  On the 24th, in obedience to orders from Maj.-Gen. Halleck, I went
  forward with my division some 4 miles to support Brig.-Gen.
  Smith, of Gen. Halleck's staff, who was making a reconnaissance in
  force. My division was not called into action, and I returned to camp in
  the afternoon of the same day.</P>
<p>
  On the 29th I moved my division forward some 3 miles to within half  
  a mile of Lick Creek, where I encamped between the divisions of
  Gen. Davis on my right and Gen. Wood on my left. Here my
  division built a causeway across Lick Creek and the adjacent
  bottom-land some half a mile in length and about one mile to the left of
  the main Corinth road.</p>
<p>
  On May 3 I changed my camp by moving my division forward and to
  the left some 3 miles to the main Hamburg and Corinth road.</p>
<p>
  On the 4th I made a reconnaissance with Gen. Johnson's brigade to
  ascertain the position of the enemy. The brigade advanced along the
  main Hamburg and Corinth road, exchanged a few shots with the
  enemy's pickets, and after forcing them to fall back returned to camp,
  having accomplished the object of the reconnaissance.</p>
<p>
  On the 7th I moved forward some 3 miles and encamped about half a
  mile to the left of the main Hamburg and Corinth road south of Seven
  Mile Creek, and between the divisions of Gen. Wood on my right
  and Gen. Nelson on my left. While here my division built a double
  causeway across Seven Mile Creek and the adjacent bottomlands some
  three-quarters of a mile in length.</p>
<p>
  On the 8th 100 men of the Twenty-ninth Indiana, under Capt. Davis,
  and 100 of the Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania, under Capt. Rose, were
  on fatigue duty, building the road across Seven Mile Creek, when they
  were attacked about 9 a. m. by a superior force of the enemy, and after
  a spirited resistance compelled him to retire, and continued the work till
  4 p. m. The casualties on our side in this encounter were 1 killed, 3
  wounded, and 1 taken prisoner, all of the Twenty-ninth Indiana. The
  enemy lost at least 4 killed and 1 taken prisoner. Concerning the number
  of his wounded I could gain no information.</P>
<p>
  On the 9th I moved my division some 4 miles toward Farmington,
  where I bivouacked for the night.</p>
<p>
  On the 10th, in compliance with Special Field Orders, No. 35,
  April 30, 1862, from Hdqrs. Department of the Mississippi, my
  division was designated by Maj.-Gen. Buell as the reserve of the
  center of the army before Corinth, and I encamped my command in line
  of battle about 1 1/2 miles in the rear of the center of Gen. Buell's
  army.</p>
<p>
  On the 14th I was ordered with my division to make a reconnaissance
  and ascertain the position of the enemy. I advanced with Gen.
  Johnson's brigade, holding in reserve the brigade of Gen. Rousseau.
  My reserve rested on Chambers Creek, while I advanced with Gen.
  Johnson's brigade, holding in reserve the brigade of Gen. Rousseau.
  My reserve rested on Chambers Creek, while I advanced with Gen.
  Johnson's command on the main Hamburg and Corinth road, when my
  skirmishers engaged the enemy's pickets and exchanged a few shots,
  forcing them to fall back. Having thus accomplished my object and
  ascertained the position of the enemy, I returned to camp.</p>
<p>
  On the 26th, in obedience to orders, I moved my division in front of our
  whole line, Gen. Johnson's brigade being in front of the
  intrenchments thrown up by Brig.-Gen. Wood on the right of
  Gen. Buell's army and Gen. Rousseau's brigade in front of the
  line of intrenchments made by Gen. T. W. Sherman on the left of
  Gen. Thomas' army; Col. Stumbaugh's brigade was held in
  reserve in the strip of woods in front of and to the right of Driver's
  house. In this position my command bivouacked during the night of the
  26th.</p>
<p>
  Early on the morning of the 27th I ordered an advance of my whole
  line, when Gen. Johnson, who was in command on my left, moved
  forward and soon engaged the enemy's pickets stationed on the hill
  south of Bridge Creek. After a brisk skirmish, lasting some thirty
  minutes, the enemy was forced to retreat. In this affair 2 men of the
  Thirty-second Indiana Volunteers were wounded.</p>
  <p>
  While Gen. Johnson was thus engaged on the left Gen. Rousseau
  had thrown forward skirmishers in the woods on the right of my line,
  and here, although meeting a determined resistance, my skirmishers
  pressed the enemy so vigorously, that he was forced to fall back. The
  firing at this point was so continuous and severe that I ordered Col.
  Stumbaugh's reserve brigade to the support of my right. While the
  Thirty-fourth Regt. Illinois Volunteers, of Col. Stumbaugh's
  brigade, was relieving the First Ohio Regt., which had up to this
  time held my center, my skirmishers, continuing to push forward on the
  right, drove the enemy across Bridge Creek over Serratt's Hill and kept
  up the pursuit until 4 p. m., when the officer in charge of the
  skirmishers came to me and reported that the advance was in sight of
  the enemy's intrenchments and not more than 200 yards from them. I
  now ordered the skirmishers to halt, but to hold the position they then
  occupied. The loss of the Fourth Brigade in this skirmish was 13
  wounded.</P>
<p>
  Believing that Serratt's Hill commanded the enemy's works at Corinth,
  during the night of the 28th I brought forward the Seventy-seventh
  Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, of Col. Stumbaugh's brigade,
  which regiment, between 11 p. m. on the 27th and 5 a. m. on the 28th,
  threw up a continuous line of intrenchments on the top of Serratt's Hill
  over 400 yards in length. Behind these intrenchments I ordered Capt.
  Terrill to put his battery in position, and every preparation was made to
  give the enemy a warm reception, should he show a disposition to attack
  us in the morning. My division bivouacked during the night on the
  ground from which they had driven the enemy on the previous day.
  Early on the morning of the 28th, while holding the position taken from
  the enemy, my left, under Gen. Johnson, was attacked by a brigade
  of rebels. I at once ordered Capt. Cotter to put a section of his
  artillery in position on the hill near by, from which position, his gunners
  being protected by skirmishers, he opened a heavy fire of grape and
  canister upon the enemy. This firing continued with terrible effect for
  more than an hour, when the enemy was forced to fall back and the
  firing ceased.</P>
<p>
  In this engagement the Thirty-second Indiana had 5 and the Thirty-ninth
  Indiana 2 men wounded, all slightly. The rebel loss, as ascertained from
  various prisoners, was 41 killed and 73 wounded. The rebels retreated
  in great confusion, leaving many of their dead and wounded upon the
  ground.</P>
<p>
  While my left was thus engaged the enemy made a spirited attack upon
  my center, under Col. Stumbaugh, with the evident intention of
  retaking the position from which our forces had dislodged them the
  previous day. Col. Stumbaugh promptly re-enforced his line, and
  despite the persistence and repeated attempts of the enemy to drive him
  away he held his ground and eventually forced the rebels to retreat.</p>
<p>
  During this day my right was not disturbed by he enemy, although my
  skirmishers still held the position taken from him on the 26th.</P>
<p>
  I continued to hold this position until 5 o'clock on the morning of the
  30th, when I ordered a simultaneous advance of my whole line. Soon
  after the advance commenced I proceeded to the front, and in a short
  time had the pleasure of entering with my division the deserted
  earthworks and encampments of the rebels.</P>
<p>
  Being put into command of Corinth by order of Maj.-Gen. Buell,
  I garrisoned the town with my division during the remainder of
  the day and the following night, and on the 31st returned to my camp
  in the reserve, my men having been absent from their tents for five days
  and nights.</P>
<p>
  I have the satisfaction of reporting that Capt. Terrill's light battery (H,
  Fifth U. S. Artillery) was the nearest battery to the enemy's
  intrenchments placed in position before Corinth, and that my skirmishers
  were nearer to the enemy's works than any Union troops up to the date
  of the occupation of the town.</p>
<p>
  I desire to return my thanks to Brig.-Gen. Rousseau,
  commanding Fourth Brigade; Brig. Gen. R. W. Johnson,
  commanding Sixth Brigade, and to Col. F. S. Stumbaugh,
  commanding Fifth Brigade, for the prompt and intelligent manner in
  which they obeyed my orders and seconded all my efforts to insure
  success.</p>
<p>
  All officers and men throughout the almost continuous skirmish of two
  days which preceded the evacuation of Corinth remained constantly at
  their posts, promptly and cheerfully performing all duties assigned them,
  and proving themselves worthy the laurels they won at Shiloh.</p>
<p>
  I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

  A. McD. McCOOK,<br>
  Brig.-Gen. of Vols., Comdg. Second Division.<br><br>
