<title>Official Records, The Battle of La Vergne</title>

  Report of Capt. Thomas E. Rose, Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania Infantry.
<hr><br>
  CAMP NEAR INSANE ASYLUM, November 29, 1862.<br>
  SIR: In compliance with the request of Lieut.-Col. Housum, commanding
  Seventy-seventh Regiment, I have the honor to make the following report
  of the part that I took in the skirmish near La Vergne, Tenn:
<p>
  When the Seventy-seventh had formed on the left of the Twenty-ninth
  Indiana, I was ordered to take one company and deploy it forward as
  skirmishers, and join on the left of the skirmishers of the Twenty-ninth,
  which I did, and which post I had the honor to hold throughout the
  skirmish. After I had got my company into position, we were ordered
  to advance across the woods, and over a ditch, which was the bed of a
  small creek; thence across an open space to the edge of the grove on the
  left of the town. From the time I first deployed the company, the enemy
  had firing on us, and in a short time after we entered the latter grove the
  firing became quite heavy upon my position of the line. At this time the
  whole line of skirmishers was ordered to halt, and my little band
  sustained the concentrated fire of the rebels for a considerable length of
  time, when the rebels advanced us with a loud cheering, which cheering
  we as lustily returned. My portion of the command being at this time
  re-enforced, we charged upon them, and drove them back through the
  woods and across an open space to the next grove beyond, their officers
  using their utmost endeavors to rally them, which they partially
  succeeded in doing behind a fence on the opposite edge of the grove.
  They did not stay our progress, however, and one portion of the rebels
  returned pell-mell down the road toward the Lebanon pike, and the other
  in tolerable order toward the railroad. We were here ordered to move
  by the right flank, which we did for about 150 or 200 yards, and then
  advanced directly across the railroad at an angle first, and when the left
  of my line had passed over the railroad about 100 yards, I discovered
  a section of artillery belonging to the enemy a little to the front, but
  almost upon my right flank. I immediately signaled my skirmishers to change direction to the right, to gain
  the rear of the battery, which they did until we had wheeled about 30
  degrees, when we encountered about 300 dismounted cavalry, which at
  first I took to be a regiment of infantry. We attacked them a loud cheer,
  and they immediately began to give way, but disputed the ground for
  probably 100 yards, when they fled precipitately to their horses, which
  were posted in the rear of the battery. We pushed at doublequick toward
  the battery, but, as soon as the cavalry reached their horses, both
  cavalry and artillery commenced a thundering retreat, and we continued
  in full pursuit, although we were a quarter of a mile in advance of our
  main reserve, until an orderly came up, stating that he was the bearer
  of an order from the brigade commander directing us to fall back, which
  we did until we neared the town, where I assembled my skirmishers and
  returned to the regiment.</P>

  Your obedient servant,</p>

  Capt., Comdg. Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers.<br><br>
