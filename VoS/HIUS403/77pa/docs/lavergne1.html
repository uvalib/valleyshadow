  HDQRS. SEVENTY-SEVENTH REGT. PENNSYLVANIA<br>
  VOLS., In Camp, November 27, 1862.<br>
  CAPT.: In reply to Special Orders, No.--, of this date, asking why
  the detachments sent out on the left of La Vergne did not move up
  rapidly and charge the rebel battery, as ordered, I give you a statement
  of the operations of the Twenty-ninth Indiana Regiment, Maj. Collins,
  and Seventy-seventh Regiment, both under my command, until the
  detachment under Col. Dodge, Thirtieth Indiana, joined me.
<p>
  After receiving orders to join the Seventy-seventh to the Twenty-ninth
  and assume command, I proceeded, as ordered, to take and hold the
  grove on the left of the Murfreesborough road, and keep the right a
  specified distance from the road. When in the grove, and in line of
  battle, the skirmishers thrown in advance from the Twenty-ninth Indiana
  Regt. became engaged in front and on the left. I at once ordered
  Company B, of Seventy-seventh, Capt. Rose, forward on the left of
  the line already deployed, with orders to advance as rapidly as
  circumstances would permit. As soon as deployed, he became engaged
  with the enemy, when I ordered the whole line forward to the bed of the
  stream, and immediately crossed, when it became necessary to march
  the line by the left flank to get under cover of the woods, and also to
  cross a ravine which was in front. As soon as a sufficient distance had
  been taken to the left to cover the troops, I ordered an advance, with the
  injunction from Capt. Wagner not to advance too rapidly on the
  woods, or too close on the line of skirmishers. After advancing some
  distance, I was ordered to again move by the left flank to what I thought
  would be a point opposite the battery, and advance on it. After marching
  by the flank what I supposed a sufficient distance, I again resumed the
  march by the front, advanced steadily, under a severe fire, when I
  observed the enemy moving to our left, and supposing the object might
  be to outflank us on our left, their line in front already exceeding our
  in length or front, I ordered a halt, and sent Lieut. Walker, Of the
  staff, to the left, to notify the cavalry to keep a strict watch to prevent
  any attempt to flank us on the left, at the same time notifying Col.
  Kirk that probably an attempt would be made to outflank us. Lieut.
  Walker returning, I immediately ordered the men forward, when, from
  the maneuvering of the enemy in front, I ordered two additional
  companies forward on the line of skirmishers. At this moment Col.
  Dodge joined me on the right, when he also threw one company forward
  on the line of skirmishers; thus re-enforced, and the skirmish line
  strengthened, I ordered a rapid advance, clearing the woods of the
  enemy. Col. Dodge now came to me, and, as my superior officer,
  he assumed command and ordered me to change front forward on the
  left company. When the whole line was thrown forward in the new
  direction, he ordered an advance to the edge of the woods. At this point
  he ordered the Twenty-ninth Regt. forward, supported by the
  Seventy-seventh and Thirtieth, to charge the battery, while moving
  forward as rapidly as the ground would admit of, and obstructed, as it
  was, by a number of fences, which had to be torn down as they
  advanced, and also under a severe fire from the rebel battery on the hill
  in front. About the time the advance was tearing
  down a heavy fence, the firing of the battery ceased.* We advanced to
  the top of a hill in the rear of La Vergne, when Col. Dodge received
  orders to return to town.</P>
<p>
  I thought at the time, and think so still, that our advance through the
  woods was as rapid as circumstances would admit of. The only time lost
  was when I directed the cavalry to reconnoiter on our left. Halting at that
  time was thought to be a necessity.</P>
<p>
  Hoping the above will fully explain the matter to in Orders, No.--, I
  remain, respectfully, yours,</P>
<br>
  P. B. HOUSUM.<br><br>

  Assistant Adjutant-Gen.<br>
