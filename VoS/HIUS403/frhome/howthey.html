<b>HOW THEY TALK</b>

No party ever attempted to insult the intelligence of the people as 
persistingly and as barefacedly as the party which goes for the present, 
by the name of the Republican party.  Before every election the leaders 
of this party indulge in the most extensive promises as to the vast 
amount of good they will heap upon the country if the dear people will 
only bestow upon them their vote and help them into power.  By this sort 
of bamboozling they manage to make dupes of a certain class of brainless 
boobies, who never think for themselves, but gulph down as gospel all the 
twaddle the unprincipled placebusters of this unprincipled party blurt out 
on every stump they mount.  To hear them talk you would think the 
millenium must surely dawn when they get into office!  They promise 
anything and everything with an ease and grace that is quite fascinating 
to behold and which shows them to be adepts in the business, but, 
unfortunately for their dupes, these promises of the "good time coming" 
are somehow or other never realized.  This, however, seems to make very 
little difference with the blind and bigoted class intented to be 
gulled.  They are just as ready and willing to receive a new batch of 
promises, knowing that they will be again deceived, as if they really 
found a pleasure in undergoing the operation of having the "wool pulled 
over their eyes" on all convenient occasions.  Their party leaders well 
understand the amount of gullibility in the party and shape their course 
accordingly--that is their style--it has served them in the past and why 
will it not answer for the present and the future?  A lie is a cheap 
thing and who ever heard a Republican orator or editor choking on a 
lie--their maws are too capacious for that.  Here is a sample of their 
lying promises made just after the re-nomination of CURTIN for Governor.  
Their dupes read it with entire confidence, when first published they can 
read it again, reflect over it and contrast it with the same sort of 
promises now being made by their orators and editors, with the view of 
again deluding the people.  The italics were the original:--
<p>
"With CURTIN as Governor, the rebellion can effectually quelled <i>in six 
months</i>.  If WOODWARD should slip into the Gubernatorial chair, the 
civil war may be prolonged for six years.  Let CURTIN triumph and there 
<i>need be no there draft</i>.  If WOODWARD succeeds, <i>in each and every 
year</i> a fresh draft will be needed.
<p>
Nay more than this.  With WOODWARD as Governor, there will be imminent 
danger that the seat of war will be transferred to Pennsylvania, and our 
towns, villages and other cities would be ransacked."
<p>
This served its day and gulled many into voting for CURTIN.  He was 
re-elected and how, let us inquire, have these promises been kept?  Twice 
"<i>six months</i>" have rolled around and the rebellion is not yet 
EFFECTUALLY QUELLED!  In place of "<i>no there draft</i>" been 
"<i>needed</i>" TWO have actually been made since his re-election, and 
how many others will take place, before his term of office expires, time 
can only tell.  The "<i>seat of war</i>" was to be kept out of 
Pennsylvania--our farms, villages and towns "<i>ransacked</i>" and 
CHAMBERSBURG IN ASHES!  Nothing of this kind was to happen if CURTIN was 
re-elected.  The people know it has all happened and it will happen again 
if the Abolition party are continued in power.  The same sort of promises 
are now being made in behalf of the re-nomination of Old Abe, will the 
people allow themselves to be again deceived?  Has he not been tried four 
years and has ever a country suffered as much from the misrule of a 
tyrant as this country has in that time from the wicked and stupid policy 
of Abraham Lincoln?  The wicked men in power under him will do 
everything, no matter how vile, to deceive the people and retain their 
places.  The most extensive promises will be made--the most incredible 
stories told--the most shameful reports circulated and the most wonderful 
victories achieved just on the eve of the election.  Let the people be on 
their guard and not again be deceived by Abolition promises and Abolition 
falsehoods.
