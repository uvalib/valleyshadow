<p>--Our Band accompanied the Chambers Artillery and remained with them during the continuance of the Encampment at
Waynesboro.' The Military were highly delighted with the deportment of the Band. They were ready and willing to play at any
times desired--either to serenade the citizens or furnish music for the military. Their delightful music contributed greatly to the
gratification of the immense crowds assembled to witness this grand military display.
