<hr width=240>

<p> In May 1864, Major General David Hunter was promoted to take command 
of the Shenadoah Valley after Major General Franz Sigel failed to secure 
the breadbasket of Virginia for General Ulysses S. Grant.  Hunter was 
perhaps a poor choice to quell the guerrilla activity in the region as he 
had already gained an infamous reputation for his hatred of Southerners.  In 
1862, he boldly freed slaves in Mississippi and Louisiana, which 
enraged the unconsulted Union leadership.  A member of an old Virginian 
family, Hunter appeared to have a vendetta against his traitorous state 
and hell-bent on punishing the Valley for supporting the Confederacy.
<p> Hunter quickly began a destructive campaign in the Shenandoah Valley 
to hold people personally responsible for guerrilla attacks on his 
troops.  In late May, Hunter issued a letter <a 
href=hoke/hoke_burn.html#hunter>warning</a> southern sympathizers that 
they would be held personally responsible for any guerrilla attacks.  In 
June, Hunter ordered the burning of the Virginia Military 
Institute in Lexington, Virginia as punishment for student involvement in a 
previous battle.  He followed through on his earlier threat by burning  six 
homes of prominent Southerner 
sympathizers: Edmond Jennings Lee, Alexander R. Botelar, and Andrew 
Hunter, a relative.  It was time for the wheat harvest in the region, and 
his army was striking at the core of the old commonwealth.  
<p>In response to Hunter's action, Lieutenant General Jubal Early of the 
Army of Northern Virginia was ordered to lead a Confederate response.  
Hunter was rapidly approaching Lynchburg, a vital supply depot, after 
quickly taking Staunton, an almost mythical Southern town that was 
thought to be invulnerable to Union forces.  Lee and Davis were worried 
that Hunter would take Lynchburg and then turn west and attack Richmond.  
Only a daring raid into the North would relieve pressure on Richmond and the 
gamble might prove very successful.
<p> In early July, rumors and reports flooded into Pennsylvania of an imminent Rebel 
invasion into Maryland and Pennsylvania as troop movement along the 
border increased.  Rachel Cormany recorded in her diary, on July 19, 1864,  
the great immense panic Chambersburg 
residents were in.   Many were sent farther north to avoid the rebel 
invasion.  Others celebrated Independence Day along the road on their way 
out of danger.  <i>The Valley Spirit</i> described it as a mass exodus of 
farmers 
with their stock, <a href=articles/reb_inv070664.html>"one continuous 
stream of horses, mules, cattle, and 
negroes moving in the direction of the Susquehanna."</a> Store keepers 
shipped their goods by train to Philadelphia for safe keeping. 
<p>On July 8, the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a proclamation for 
twelve thousand volunteers to
serve for 100-day Home Defense units.  As these units were formed, they 
were transferred by the War Department to serve near Washington, D.C. and 
Maryland.  The Military Department of Susquehanna was headquartered in 
Chambersburg.  In charge was Maj. Gen. Couch, a distinguished and 
respected officer.  He bitterly complained and protested the transfers of 
the Home Defense troops as well as the siphoning of his own small force.  
With the movement of military forces from Pennsylvania southward to 
Washington and Maryland, Chambersburg was left virtually defenseless and 
extremely vulnerable to Confederate invasion.
<p>In mid July, Gen. Early began his famous counter-offense and quickly 
reached the outskirts of the Federal Capital.  Early did not press on 
into the capital because he feared being overpowered by the defending units. 
Instead Early's force penetrated into Maryland, beginning a series of 
ransoms.
<p>On July 6, McCausland was ordered to ransom Hagerstown for $200,000, 
but misread the amount and instead collected $20,000.  Early then levied 
ransom on Middletown ($5,000) and Frederick ($200,000).  Each time the 
towns paid the burdensome amounts.  However, none of these ransoms 
were accompanied with a provision to burn the town if it did not pay.  One 
likely reason was that Maryland had many southern sympathizers and was a 
resource for the Confederacy.
<p>On July 28, a messenger arrived in McCausland's camp, carrying orders 
from Early to take his brigade up to Chambersburg.  McCausland recalled 
that he was to <a href=mccausland.html>"capture the city and deliver to 
the proper authorities a proclamation which General Early had issued, 
calling upon them to furnish me with $100,000 in gold or $500,000 in 
greenbacks, and in case the money was not forthcoming I was instructed to 
burn the city and return to Virginia."</a>  According to J. Moore, the next 
day McCausland took 
the <a href=moore_account.html>"8th, 14th, 16th and 17th Virginia Cavalry, 
and Colonel Witcher's 
Battalion, to which had been added for this occasion the Marylanders of 
General Bradley T. Johnson up towards the Potomac River."</a>  They 
captured 
the Union troops guarding the fords at McCoy's Ferry and by 2 pm, the 
whole detachment had crossed over into Maryland territory.  A few hours 
latter the invaders were resting in Mercersburg, Pa on their way to 
Chambersburg, twenty miles away.
<p> By this time many Chambersburg residents had returned to their 
homes.  The earlier excitement and anxiety now turned into apathy as many 
were confident that the rebels would not dare invade Pennsylvania.  Many 
were also assured that the Union had adequate defenses set up to block 
any intrusion.  However on the same day that McCausland was ordered to 
ransom Chambersburg, the Federal Army order <a href=or.html>the six 
regiments</a> under Gen. Couch to be transfered from Chambersburg to 
Hagerstown, Md.  This crucial move left Gen Averell's army as the only 
significant fighting force in the area.  The confidence Chambersburg 
residents had in their safety proved to be false, and the door was left open for McCausland and his troops.<br>
