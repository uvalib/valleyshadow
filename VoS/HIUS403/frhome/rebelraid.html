On Friday evening last, our citizens were much surprised and considerably 
excited by reports of the advanvce of a large force of Rebel Calvary by 
way of Mercersburg.  Men arrived on horseback who had been hotly pursued 
by them within three or four miles of Town.<p>
About 7 o'clock a company of them appeared in the Public Square carrying 
a flag of truce and demanding a surrender of the place.  No military 
force being here, able to resist, the town was surrendered on the terms 
that private property would be respected and citizens unharmed.  They 
then took full possession of the place, and on the next morning took 
their departure to the direction of Gettysburg leaving a guard to fire 
the Depot building.  The Depot House, the Machine Shops and the 
Warehouses of Messrs Wunderlich and Nead were entirely consumed with a 
considerable amount of Government stores and other property.  The Rebel 
force numbered about 1500 Calvary and Artillery under Generals Stuart and 
Hampton.  They have stolen about 1000 Horses in this County, but from 
last reports and thepreparations made for their capture, we feel 
confident that the whole force will be captured and the stolen property 
recovered.<p>
We are hurried in getting to Press and can give no extended notice of 
this humiliating Rebel invasion of Pennsylvania soil.<p><hr
