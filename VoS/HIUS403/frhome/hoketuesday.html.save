il the road leading to Harrisburg. A line of battle was formed along the brow 
of this hill by a part of the Confederate force, while detachments were 
sent out iii all directions for the purpose of plundering. General Jenkims and staff, after spending the 


night under the hospitable roof of Colonel McClure, came early in the day into Chambersburg and established his head - quarters at the Montgomery House. One of his first acts was to summon the burgess and town - council to his head - quarters, when he mad


e a demand for the return of the two horses and equipments taken, and in case of their not being returned, payment for them, and in default of either, he threatened the destruction of the town ' . As the captured property was beyond the reach of the counc


il, the matter was adjusted by the payment of $900, and the banding over to him of the same number of pistols taken. For these be would not receive compensation in money, as he said pistols were of more value to them than money. After a little search the 


council secured by purchase from some of our citizens the number of pistols wanted, and the $900 were paid over to him in Confederate scrip. Doubtless he expected to receive United States currency; but as his soldiers had flooded the town with their worth


less currency, pronouncing it better than greenbacks, the city fathers took him at his word and paid him in his own money. This was bought up of our business ,men at about five cents on the dollar. Seiders afterward sold the horse for $175, and the saddle


 for $35. Out of this amount he refunded what the transaction cost the council ($75), and he bad $135 left.General Jenkins also issued an order requiring all arms in possession of our citizens, whether public or private, to be brought to the front of the


 court-house within two hours; and in case of disobedience all houses were to be searched, and those in which arms were found should be lawful objects of plunder. The pretext for this humiliating order was that his troops bad been fired on by a citizen th


e night before. Many complied with this requisition, and a considerable number of guns, good, bad, and indifferent, were carried to the appointed place, where a committee of our people were ordered to take down the name of each person who brought a gun. T


his was to secure the houses of all who complied with the order from, the threatened search. Some, of course, did not comply, but enough did to satisfy the enemy, and a general search was avoided. Captain Fitzhugh, Jenkins' chief of staff, an ill-natured 


man-the same person who figured so largely in the burning of the town a year afterward-assorted the guns as they were brought in, retaining those that could be used by their men, and twisting out of shape, or breaking over the stone steps of the court -ho


use, such as were unfit for service.During the whole of this day foraging parties were sent out to all parts of the surrounding country, gathering, horses and cattle, of which large numbers were taken and sent south to Williamsport and banded over to Rod


es' infantry. One of these plundering parties on this day visited the Caledonia Iron Works, situated about ten miles cast of Chambersburg, at the foot of the South Mountain, and belonging to Hon. Thaddeus Stevens. Under the promise that if all the horses


 and mules belonging to the establishment were delivered to them the iron works would not be burned, about forty valuable animals with harness, etc., were carried away. Mr. Stevens came near being captured by this party. He was on a visit to that place, a


nd upon the rumored approach of the Confederates, was hurried away to Shippensburg by a byroad, much against his will and earnest protest. A week later, as will be shown in its appropriate place, these iron works were fired by the enemy and wholly consume


d.One of the revolting features of this day was the scouring of the fields about the town and searching of houses in portions of the place for negroes. These poor creatures -those of them who had not fled upon the approach of the foe -sought concealment 


in the growing wheat fields about the town. Into these the cavalrymen rode in search of their prey, and many were caught - some after a desperate chase and being fired at. In two cases, through the intercession of a friend who had influence with Jenkins, 


I succeeded in effecting the release of the captured persons. That this practice of the raid was not confined to the vicinity of Chambersburg alone, but was practiced elsewhere, is proven by the quotation from Rev. Dr. Schaff's diary previously given in w


hich he said that colored persons were taken and sent into southern slavery, even 11 such as I [he] knew to have been born and raised on free soil.." In some cases these negroes were rescued from the guards who were conducting them South, by the indignant


 people. A case of this kind occurred in Greencastle, in which a few determined men, armed with revolvers, captured a squad w1iich had in charge a number of these poor frightened creatures, and released them from the unhappy fate which threatened them. Th


is feature of the war indicated the object for which it was waged, to establish a government founded upon human slavery. Thank God, the effort, as well as the iniquitous cause which inspired it, not only failed, but went down never again to be attempted i


n this age or country. That slavery was the corner-stone on which the government, sought to be established by the South, was to rest, is proved by the admission of one of the principal persons in the effort.*Hon. A. H. Stephens, in what is called his "C


orner Stone" address, delivered at Savannah, Georgia, March 21, 1861. That part of this address which relates to slavery will be found in Appendix A.But that all who participated in the war against the Federal government, either did not entertain the sa


me view as that held by the leaders in the movement, or else changed their minds during the progress of the war, is evident in the following thrilling sentiment, uttered by Mr. Maurice Thompson, a Southern man.*"I am a Southerner;I love the South; I dar


ed for her To fight from Lookout to the sea, With her proud banner over me: But from my lips thanksgiving broke, As God in battle thunder spoke,And that Black Idol, breeding drouth And dearth of human sympathyThroughout the sweet and sensuous South Was,


 with its chains and human yoke,Blown hellward from the cannon's mouth,While Freedom cheered behind the smoke."
