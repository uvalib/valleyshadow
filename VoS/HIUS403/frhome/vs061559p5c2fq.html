<p>--The concert given in Franklin Hall, on Friday night, was not only a rich vocal and musical treat, but a most gorgeous and gratifying spectacle.  The audience in attendance was the largest, and most highly respectable, we have ever seen assembled in the Hall.  The stage was decorated with wreaths and festoons of evergreens and flowers arranged in the most beautiful forms and exquisite designs, indicating the best judgement and the most refined taste.  The rural picturesqueness of the stage presented a scene of great beauty and grandeur, for surpassing anything ever witnessed in this place, and attracted much admiration and praise.  It is but justice to say that this delightful feature in the entertainments was the handiwork of the estimable lady of our fellow townsman Col. A. K. McClure.
<p>The accompaniments on the Piano, which are of a very difficult character, were executed by Miss Minns Andre, and were the embodiment of everything that is delightful in Music.  This young and much esteemed lady has had the imprimatur of excellence affixed to her performance on the Piano by the best judges, and on this occasion she more than realized the fondest expectations of her numerous friends.
<p>The Fifteen young ladies representing the Flowers evinced a perfect knowledge of the highest order of vocal attainment, and acquitted themselves in a manner highly satisfactory to the audience and creditable to themselves.  It is seldom we find persons so young in years attain to such a degree of perfection in vocalization requiring so much time for study and practice.  We must recollect that these young ladies are not <i>professional</i> performers, and whatever deficiency we may have discovered in their singing, may be attributed to that loveliest trait in female character--modesty.  The suppressed note of modesty is always more to be admired than the brazen sound of brassfacedness however <i>artistic</i> it may be.
<p>The part of the Recluse by Mr. J. Mac. Thompson, who is well known as a talented and experienced teacher of vocal music, was enacted in admirable style, and his singing much admired for its clearness and melody. 
<p>The Band on this as on every other occasion it performs, discoursed the most melodious and inspiring sounds, and contributed much to the pleasures of the evenings entertainment.
<p>Mr. J. K. Shryock, the gentleman under whose auspices this brilliant entertainment was gotten up deserves the gratitude of our citizens for his disinterested efforts to afford them an evenings enjoyment, and at the same time contribute to the advancement of that praiseworthy object--a Public Library.  To Mr. Shryock, more than any other man, is our community indebted for the introduction of a higher and purer musical <i>taste</i>, and a greater degree of musical <i>spirit</i> than we ever thought would be our good fortune of our town to possess.
<p>The entire community is eager for a repetition of "The Flower Queen" and whatever imperfections occurred, (unavoidable in a first representation,) we are 
well persuaded will be handsomely remidied in a second performance.</td></tr></table></body></html>
