the town
had just begun its rebuilding effort.  Over the course of the next several
years Chambersburg would erect new buildings, open new businesses, and
grow into a new town.  August of 1864 juxtaposes Chambersburg's
determination to move into the future beyond the Civil War with the scars
of the war still visible.  Even as the physical scars of the war 
disappeared, replaced with a newer
Chambersburg, the legacy of the war remained.  Its specific physical and
historical experience with the war was distinct, but the struggle to
recreate a home out of the battlefield of the Civil War extended across the
entire newly re-United States.  The homefront had become a sort of
battlefront, and with the war done, the battle became one to make
Chambersburg a home once again.
