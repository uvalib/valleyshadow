<td width=480 valign=top><center><h2>Lee and Jenkins Invade</h2></center>
<p><p><p>	Less than a year later after Stuart's raid, with the Civil war 
wearing 
on, the orders of the generals remained the same in their wording, but 
Confederate soldiers took them less literally.  Lee repeated 
the instructions of his 1862 order in his <a href=lee.html>order</a> 
for the second invasion, that "No private property shall be injured or  
destroyed by any person belonging to or connected with the 
army."  Along with this order, several aspects about this 
second raid were similar to the earlier one.  Confederate 
troops destroyed the Scotland Railroad Bridge and took horses 
and guns.  Again, Jenkins followed Stuart's lead in 
ordering his men to pay for goods that they bought from 
stores. <a href=hokewednesday.html> Jacob Hoke</a> recounts an instance 
in 
which General Jenkins says he ought "to cut your head off" to a soldier 
who tried to steal from a Chambersburg store.  Hoke talks 
about the amount of property taken, which he assessed at 
"not less than one hundred thousand dollars", but asserts 
in the spirit of the earlier raid, that, "True, many 
horses, cattle, and other things were taken, but all 
within the rules of the war, except the carrying away of 
free Negroes."<p>  
	The capture of African American citizens of Franklin County marks 
the 
one instance of Confederate departure from the 
code of conduct that bound them in the first raid.  The 
second invasion, in other ways, proved more invasive to the 
people on the homefront in Chambersburg.  Rachel 
Cormany lived through the 1863 raid, and speaks throughout her <a 
href=cormany.html>diary</a> about Confederate soldiers with much less respect than Heyser 
and McClure had in 1862.  "All forenoon they were 
carrying away men's clothing and darkeys."  Cormany 
continues to lament the treatment of the "darkeys" as 
Confederate soldiers searched for and rounded up the 
town's free blacks, "O! How it grated our hearts to 
have to sit quietly and look at such brutal deeds."  Black citizens had 
been taken before, in the raid of 1862, but not in such large numbers.  
In 1863, citizens like Hoke and Cormany began to notice the brutality of 
this capture, and it represented an invasion of the soldiers into the 
lives of civilians, taking battle tactics of capture and using them on 
the home front.  
<p>	The fact that citizens responded more strongly this time speaks 
to the 
increase in other "brutal deeds" during this invasion of 1863.  Later, on 
Sunday, June 28, groups of soldiers ransacked local stores.  Hoke's tone 
about the plunder inflicted by Confederate soldiers is decidedly 
different, "It is out of my power to give any estimate of the value of 
the property taken that day.  But it must be recollected that the losses 
of that day, as well as the losses by the Stuart and Jenkin's raids, were 
afterward supplemented by other depredations during the continuance of 
the invasion- on the Sunday following, especially- and by the destruction 
of the town a year later.  This much, however, can be said, that many 
persons who had toiled and economized for years to gain an honorable 
support, as well as lay up something for old age, were reduced to 
poverty."  Heyser's tone also changes.  He no longer praises the good 
behavior of the soldiers; rather, he notes the "dreadful accounts that 
the Rebels are still active about Chambersburg, and are robbing and 
stealing as before.  How much of this is true, I cannot say. . ."  What 
Heyser cannot say is not as important as what he does say.  His shift in 
focus, from being an observer of an occupying force in 1862, to one of 
an enemy, as his 1863 entry implies, marks the converging definitions of 
homefront and battle front.  These boundaries intersect in 1864 with the 
Burning of the town, destroying not only the respect of the soldiers for 
the private property of the town, but also, for the first time including 
the 
Generals in that destruction.  As Home Front and Battle Front merge, 
the Civil War moves along the same line that the invasions of 
Chambersburg in 1862 and 1863 followed towards becoming instances of a 
"total war".
