<p>--This association has been revived and fully organized. For more than a year, many of our Farmers and Mechanics were anxious to see this take place. At length there appeared a notice for a meeting to elect officers and managers; the meeting was held, and officers and managers elected for the ensuing year; or until others should be elected to fill their places. On Friday last a meeting of the officers and managers was held in the Office of Wm. S. Everett, Esq., the Secretary, and such steps taken as will
give permanency to the organization. They start under the most favorable auspices. They have the old Fair Grounds free of debt, and several hundred dollars in the treasury to commence with. These grounds they purpose leveling and extending, so that they will afford much satisfaction to those who have stock and articles of different kinds for exhibition, and those who come for mere enjoyment and improvement. They have agreed to hold a Fair, which will commence on the third Tuesday of October next, and continue four days. From the interest manifested by our Farmers and Mechanics we may expect a Fair unprecedented among those ever held in our County. They have a so made arrangements to secure the services of one of the most eminent men in our County to address the association on the occasion. This association has now become one of the institutions of our
County, and merits the attention of every Farmer and Mechanics who values his occupation.--The benefits that will result from its successful operation cannot easily be foretold, but that all those taking a deep interest in its welfare will be benefitted, is as evident, as every effort put forth by them, to advance and develope their peculiar trade, will tend to their improvement. We shall inform our readers of whatever preparations or steps are taken by its managers in the future.</td></tr></table>
