<tr><td>The wanton destruction of the private property of 
citizens of 
Virginia by orders of General Hunter, a Federal army officer, may be 
considered as one of the strongest reasons for the retaliation by Early's 
orders upon the city of Chambersburg.  Andrew Hunter lived in the county 
of Jefferson, near Harper's Ferry, and was a relative of General Hunter.  
A. R. Boteler and E. J. Lee also lived in the same vicinity.  No reasons 
that I have ever been given for the burning of their houses.  Governor 
Letcher's property was in Lexington, Va., and that was 
also near Lexington.  I do not think any better reasons could have been 
given if General Hunter had destroyed every house, barn or other building 
that was standing and in good order upon his line of march from Staunton 
to Lynchburg.
<p>  The Property of J. T. Anderson was in the county of Botetourt, and 
located near the banks of the James river, at Buchanan.  Mrs. Anderson 
and a lady relative were the only occupants at the time.  I destroyed the 
bridge across the James to retard Hunter in his march, and it did detain 
him for two days, during which time he occupied this house as his 
headquarters.  He promised the ladies protection, and after his 
departure an officer and some soldiers returned with a written order from 
him to destroy everything about the premises.  A few days later, as 
General Hunter was passing another Virginia mansion, a lady asked him why 
he had destroyed the magnificent home of Colonel Anderson.  He replied that 
"Virginia women were worse traitors than their husbands, and he would 
burn the houses over their heads in order to make them personally and 
immediately experience some punishment for their treason;" and, on 
another occasion, he said to a Virginia lady that he "would humble the 
Virginia women before he left the State."  I could enumerate many other 
acts of actual description, threats and wanton violence on the part of 
Hunter, all of which make up the public sentiment that prevailed at that 
time in Virginia, and which required steps on the part of the military 
authorities to prevent their recurrence in the future, as well as to stop 
the useless destruction then going on; but what I have given is 
considered sufficient to explain the reason why the city of Chambersburg, 
in Pennsylvania, was burned.
<p><center>Location of Forces</center>
<p>  It may be considered indispensable to give the location of the 
force composing the Federal and Confederate armies during the latter part of 
the month of July, 1964, in order to properly understand the raid that 
was made into State of Pennsylvania which resulted in the destruction of 
Chambersburg.
<p>Hunter's army was scattered along the northern bank of the Potomac 
river, in Maryland, from near Hancock to Harper's Ferry, the main body 
being near the latter place.  Early was located on the opposite side of 
the same river.  My command was on the left of Early's army, and I think 
that Averill's cavaly [viz] was located opposite to me-at least a portion 
of it was there.
<p>When I speak of cavalry in the course of this sketch, I am aware that 
the term is not properly applied, for so far as the Confederate troops 
which I commanded were concerned, they were badly armed, badly mounted 
and worse equipped-in fact, they were mostly mounted militia.  The men 
would have made good soldiers if there had been time to discipline them, 
and arms and equipment to furnish them.  The horses were nearly worn 
out, and there was no supply to draw from.  We tried to get horses in 
Pennsylvania, but found them removed from the line of march, and we had 
no time to look for them elsewhere.
<p>In July, 1864, a calvary brigade which I commanded was encamped near 
the Potomac river, in the county of Berkeley, West Virginia.  It made the 
advance post of the army under General Early that was guarding the 
approaches into Virginia through the Shenandoah Valley.  On July 28 I 
received an order from General Early to cross the Potomac with my brigade 
and one under General Bradley T. Johnson, and proceed to the City of 
Chambersburg.  My orders were to capture the city and deliver to the 
proper authorities a proclamation which General Early had issued, calling 
upon them to furnish me with $100,000 in gold or $500,000 in greenbacks, 
and in case the money was not forthcoming I was instructed to burn the 
city and return to Virginia.  The proclamation also stated that this 
course had been adopted in retaliation for the destruction of property in 
Virginia by orders of General Hunter, and specified that the homes of 
Andrew Hunter, A. R. Boteler, E. J. Lee, Governor Letcher, J. T. 
Anderson, the Virginia Military Institute and others in Virginia had been 
burned by Orders of David Hunter, a Federal commander, and that his money 
demanded from Chmabersburg was to be paid to the parties specified as 
compensation for their loss of property.  It appears that General Early 
adopted this policy after  proper reflection; that his orders were 
distinct and final, and that what was done on this occasion by my command 
was not the result of inconsiderate action or want of proper authority, 
as was alleged by many parties at he North, both at the time and since 
the close of the war.
<p><center>SITUATION ON JULY 29.</center>
<p>On the 29th of July the two cavalry brigades that were to make the 
dash into Pennsylvania, by turning the right of Hunter's army, were 
assembled at Hammand's Hill, in Berkeley county, W. Va.  During the night 
the Federal pickets on the opposite side of the river captured, and our 
troops crossed just as daylight appeared on the morning on the 30th, and 
moved out and formed the line of march on the National road.  Major Harry 
Gilmore drove the Federal calvary from the small village of Clear Spring, 
and pushed on toward Hagerstown to create the impression that the rest of 
the troops were following.  At Clear Spring we left the National road and 
turned into the Mercersburg road to the north.  We reached Mercersburg 
about dark, and stopped to feed our horses and give the stragglers time 
to catch up.  After this stop the march was continued all night, 
notwithstanding the opposition made at every available point by a 
regiment of Federal cavalry.  Major Sweetney, with his cavalry battalion, 
kept the roads clear, and we reached Chambersburg at daylight on the 
31st.  The approach to the town was defended only by one piece of 
artillery and some irregular troops, who were soon driven off, and the 
advance of our force took possession of the town.  The main part of our 
two brigades was formed into line on the high ground overlooking the town.
<p> I at once went into the city with my staff and requested some of the 
citizens to inform the city authorities that I wanted to see them.  I also 
sent my staff through the town to locate the proper officials and inform 
them that I had a proclamtion for their consideration.  Not one could be 
found.  I then directed proclamation to be read to as many citizens as 
were near me, and asked them to hunt up their town officers, informing 
them I would wait until they could either find the proper authorities, or 
by consultation among themselves, determine what they wold do.  Finally, 
I informed them that I would wait six hours, and if they would then 
comply with the requirements, their town would be safe, but if not, it 
would be destroyed, in accordance with my orders from General Early.
<p><center>EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED</center>
<p>After a few hours of delay many citizens came to see me-some were 
willing to pay the money, others were not.  I urged them to comply, 
giving them such reasons as occurred to me at the time, and told them 
plainly what they might expect in the event of their failure to pay the 
money demanded.  I showed to my officers and to the citizens who came to 
see me, my written authority and ordes of General Early, and before a 
single house was burned both the citizens and the Confederate officers 
fully understood why it was done and by whose orders.
<p>After waiting until the expiration of the six hours, and finding that 
the proclamation would not be complied with, the destruction was begun by 
firing the most central blocks first, and after the inhabitants had been 
removed from them.  Thus the town was destroyed, and the citizens driven 
to the hills and fields adjacent thereto.  No lives were lost among the 
citizens, and only one soldier was killed, he being killed after the 
troops had left the place.  About noon the troops were reformed on the 
high ground overlooking the town, where most of them had been posted in 
the early morning, and the return to the Potomac was begun.  We encamped 
at McConnelsburg that night, and reached the river the next day at or 
near Hancock, Md.
  In confirmation of what I have here written, Major Gilmore says in his 
book, <i>Four Years In the Saddle,</i> page 210:<br>
"He showed me General Early's order."<br>
General Early, in his <i>Memoir,</i> page 57, says:<br>
"A written demand was sent to the municipal authorities, and they informed 
what would be the result of a failure or refusal to comply with it."<br>
On page 59, General Early, says:<br>
"On the 30th of July McCausland reached Chambersburg and made the demand 
as directed, reading to such authorities as presented themselves the 
paper sent by me."
<p>Colonel W. E. Peters, who commanded one of the regiments in Johnson's 
Brigade, when the burning commenced, came and asked me if it was being 
done by me orders.  I showed him the order of General early, which he 
refused to obey, declaring that he would break his sword and throw it 
away before he would obey i, as there were only defenseless women and 
children Chambersburg.  He was put under arrest for his defiance, but was 
releived the same day and returned to his command when it was pressed by 
two brigades of Federal cavalry, and his valorous presence needed.
<p>In this expedition our troops passed through more than 100 miles of 
hostile territory, executed all orders that were issued with promptness 
regularity, and never have I heard on any complaint of acts unauthorized, 
by their superior oficers, of competent authority to order it, and, 
moreover, that it was an act of retaliation perfectly justified by the 
circumstances, and was at all times in keeping with the rules governing 
civilized warfare.
