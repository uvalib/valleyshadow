The election of 1864 was a major issue of discussion during the months 
after the burning and offered the citizens of Chambersburg an opportunity 
to begin refocusing on the national picture after having beed occupied 
with the burning of their home town for so long.  The presidential 
race between Abraham Lincoln and General George McClellan was an 
especially heated topic of debate.  Some Chambersburg residents 
complained that the war had continued for too long and that it was 
becoming too violent.  General McClellan, who advocated ending the war as 
soon as possible, was a favorite among such individuals.  To them, a 
victory by General McClellan meant a quick means of achieving peace.  
A reelection of President Lincoln would lead to more unnecessary 
battles and violence.  <i>The Valley 
Spirit</i>, a local Democratic newspaper, contended that <a 
href=rescue.html>"four years 
more of such rule will completely bankrupt and destroy the Country".</a> <p>

On the other hand, most of the citizens of Chambersburg were insistent on 
a northern victory, regardless of how long the war or how 
vicious the battles.  They felt that their town would have been lost for 
nothing if the North conceded victory to the South.  <a 
href=bios.html#mcclure>Alexander K. McClure</a>, a prominent politician, 
an acquaintance of Abraham Lincoln, and the owner of <i>The Franklin 
Repository</i>, insisted that the war must continue at all costs until 
the North had one and the nation was reunited.  <i>The Repository</i>, in 
an article printed the week before the election on November 2, 1864, 
states that <a href=unionmen.html>"if the national verdict is for Lincoln, 
as it surely must be, 
it is a declaration that the war, now to all human appearances on the threshold of 
final and complete success, shall be prosecuted until the despairing 
traitors yield to the majesty of the laws and the unity of the States."</a>
<p>

The fact that a large majority of the Chambersburg population supported 
Lincoln and a northern victory at the cost of a longer war demonstrates 
that the Chambersburg citizens were able to maintain a perspective on the 
war.  It further illustrates the the citizens had begun to move forward 
with their lives since the burning.  The economy was beginning to revive 
itself and Chambersburg was quickly recovering from its losses.  Though 
the ashes of burned homes and buildings were constant reminders of 
the burning, the citizens of Chambersburg were unyielding in their 
attempts to rebuild their town and defeat the South.
