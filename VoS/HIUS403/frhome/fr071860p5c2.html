quality, gathered in the very best condition. We are sorry that the produce of this year will not be embraced in the returns of the
Census takers, we are confident it would place Franklin nearer the top of the pile as a wheat-producing county, than she now
occupies, although her present position is a proud one. According to the Census of 1850, there was but six Counties in the
United States that produced more Wheat than our own county of Franklin. The following are the Counties that surpassed ours,
and the number of bushels each produced: 
<p>Monroe county, N.Y. 1,1441,653 bush.
<br>Livingston co., N.Y. 1,111,986 bush. 
<br>Ontario co., N.Y. 929,342 bush. 
<br>Niagara co., N.Y. 917,739 bush. 
<br>Orleans co., N.Y. 854,676 bush. 
<br>Lancaster co., Pa. 1,365,111 bush. 
<br>Franklin co., Pa. 937,062 bush. 
<p>Washington county, Md., comes next to Franklin, she having produced, according to the same returns, 809,093 bushes. This
we presume is owing to her position--her contiguity to free soil and good company.
<p>If it could be ascertained, it would be found that the Wheat crop of Franklin, the present harvest, would fall very little, if any,
short of 875,000 bushels. 
<p>Our Hay crop was also excellent and secured in good condition.
<p>A better crop of Oats was never gathered in the county than that which is now clearly ready for harvesting.
<p>The Corn, so far, bids fair. It is too early, however, to say anything about it. If a drought does not prevail--if the season should
prove propitious--according to present appearance, and judging from the breadth planted, the Corn crop will be large. 
<p>The Potatoes, so far, are also turning out well in every locality. The early Potatoes that are brought to market are of good
quality, and the yield, we understand, is abundant. The trust the later varieties will turn out equally good.</td></tr></table></body></html>
