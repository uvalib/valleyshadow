<p>Having played host to <a href=occnorthmain.html>two previous Confederate 
excursions</a> in 1862 and 1863, Chambersburg was very familiar with the 
Army of Northern Virginia.  While the first two encounters drained the 
town of valuable commodities (livestock, food, and supplies), it was left 
untouched.  However the last visit of Confederate forces would 
permanently alter the physical and mental landscape of Chambersburg, 
leaving it in ashes and searching for explanations.  Chambersburg remains 
a rare example of  Confederate aggression in the North, the only town to 
be destroyed, in contrast to the multitudes of occupied and besieged 
cities in the South.  
<p>The first reactions of Chambersburg residents to the rumors of a rebel 
invasion demonstrate the mentality and viewpoint of Northerners.  Early's 
raid caused many to flee northward, more to move their possessions than 
to seek safety.  These people were temporarily moving out for a week, not 
fleeing refugees.  Their earlier experiences with the Confederates had 
been benign, Lee's Invasion was very restrained and caused relatively 
minimal damage.  The biggest concern Franklin County residents had was 
not to be "robbed" again.


<p><a href=lead.html>Leading to the Invasion</a>  The immediate causes of
destruction of Chambersburg lay in the Shenandoah Valley.  The destruction
of Lexington by Union forces forced the Confederacy to respond in a daring
northern raid, both to relieve pressure from Richmond and Lynchburg, but also
to respond and retaliate to Union aggression.  

<p><a href=incidents.html>The Acts and Incidents of the Burning</a> In a few
short hours, Chambersburg was burned amidst a frenzy of alcohol, terror, and thievery. 

<p><a href=burn_img.html>Image Archive</a>  This collection of images truly
describes the waste and devastation Chambersburg was left in after the raid.  The stark
black and white images paint a sad picture of a ruined city, to be relived uncountable times
in the modern age of war.
