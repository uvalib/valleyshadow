Harrisburg, from three ladies of the German Reformed congregation of this place. The ladies of this town generally have been
actively engaged all summer in preparing and sending off articles to Washington, Harrisburg, and other points, for the use of
our soldiers. Franklin County we feel safe in saying has donated as much as any other county in the State for our brave
soldiers. The Chambersburg Times with all its malignity dare not attempt to disparage the patriotism of our ladies although it
has falsely and shamefully denounced the "young men of Franklin County" as recreant to their duty. This attack of the Times on
the patriotism of the people of Franklin County is a most wanton and malicious libel. Franklin County was one of the very first
to respond to the call for three months volunteers, and three as fine companies as the three months service could boast of
marched promptly from this country. We have at this day, too, more men in the field than any other border county in the State,
and yet we must be underrated by a paper published in our midst that is eternally begging support from the very people it is
traducing. <p>If this is the means the Times adopt to revenge the detestation with which it is everywhere greeted throughout the county, its
stock of malice, though known to be extensive, will hardly hold out to cover the ground before it. </td></tr></table></body></html>
