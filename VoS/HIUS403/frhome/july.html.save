In middle of the summer, a citizen of Chambersburg could not ignore the 
war any longer.

<p>A Confederate raid led by General John McCausland 
left Chambersburg in ruins.  The destruction was estimated in the millions. The town was 
destroyed after the Confederates levied a ransom of $100,000 in gold or 
$500,000 in greenbacks.</td>

<p>With the Sherman's march to the Sea and Grant "grinding" at Lee's 
forces, the destructive toll of the Civil War reached a new heights 
during the Summer of 1864.  As both sides burned private homes, 
emptied stores, and arrested citizens, the rules of civilized warefare 
had either changed or been ignored.  Much of this destruction stayed in 
the south, but Chambersburg stands as the only example of a northern town 
being destroyed.  Was it retaliation by the Confederate for similar 
attacks in the Virginian valleys, or a strategic raid against a 
communication and transportation center?</td>
