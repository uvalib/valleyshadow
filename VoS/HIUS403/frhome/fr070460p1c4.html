Editors:--It was my privilege to attend the examination of the pupils of Rosedale Seminary, in this place, under the care
of the Rev. Henry Reeves, on the 28th inst. The examination was highly creditable to the young ladies and teachers. <p>The teachers manifested considerable tact in the examination of the various classes. They were perfectly at home in the different
branches upon which their examinations were based. Rosedale Seminary is in a flourishing state. The Principal and teachers
have the reputation of being well qualified for their trust, and must necessarily command public attention.
<p>Its location is a lovely one, sufficiently retired for a Young Ladies Seminary, and it would seem only necessary that its position
should be known, in order to secure a large amount of public patronage.
<p>On the evening of the same day the graduating class, composed of five interesting young ladies, each of whom read an original
essay in Franklin Hall to a large and intelligent audience. Their subjects were well chosen, and the compositions chaste and
elegant, and would have done credit to much older heads. 
<p>Before the Valedictory Essay was read, Diplomas were severally presented to the graduates by Rev. Dr. B. S. Schneck, with
the accompanying degrees. It might be deemed invidious to draw comparisons between the several Essays. I feel that I am not
exaggerating, when I say they were of the first order. I hope Rosedale Seminary may enjoy the patronage it so justly deserves.
