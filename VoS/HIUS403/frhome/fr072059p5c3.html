<p>--There is nothing to be compared to being aroused from sleep by the sweet strains of music. We enjoyed this very pleasant
treat on last Thursday night, the 14th inst., about midnight. The Chambersburg Mechanics Brass Band, took it into their heads
to lull to sleep the representatives of the Press of this place and, called around in front of the residence of some four Ed-it-ors,
and one Ed-et-ter, and discoursed some of their sweetest music. No town in the State can boast of half as good a Band as
ours.--The young men composing this excellent musical corps are gentlemen, every one of them. They have no bad habits, and
are a credit to the town--long may they wave.
