Sherman and Hunter, in their raids of the South, brought the 
battlefront into the homes of Southern civilians.  McCausland began a new 
phase in the war against the North when he burned Chambersburg to the 
ground.  By 1864, generals on both sides of the Mason Dixon Line were 
more willing to disregard the "rules of war" than they had been before.  
Total war, which merged homefront and battlefront, became more of the 
order of the day. </td></tr></table> </body> </html>
