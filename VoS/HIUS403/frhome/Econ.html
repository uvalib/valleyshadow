<p>Franklin County in the late 1850's and early 1860's was almost exclusively 
agricultural, with a population of just over 40,000.  Most of the population 
was spread over farm land and raised a wide assortment of livestock 
and crops, primarily including swine, <a href="vs071359p5c9.html">wheat, and 
indian corn</a>.  As such, much emphasis within 
the community was placed on the betterment of techniques for harvesting, 
planting, and raising livestock.  To this end, various <a 
href="vs062259p5c2.html">agricultural and 
mechanical societies</a> were established in and around Chambersburg.
<p>The county was fed in part by the Cumberland Valley Railroad which passed 
through Chambersburg, the capital city with a population of just over 5,000 
people.  This railroad carried both people and goods to parts north and south.  
<a href="vs031659p5c2.html">The Franklin Railroad</a> was completed in 1860 
running to Hagerstown.  Both these railroads served as supply lines for the 
Union army throughout the war, helping to propel Chambersburg into a position 
of increased wealth.
<p>Although Chabersburg in general enjoyed a relative boom, many 
Chambersburg residents felt the negative economic effects of the war.  
Rachel Cormany, for instance, was a Canadian brought to Chambersburg by her 
husband who then enlisted in the army.  During his time in the army, 
Rachel was left alone with their daughter, staying in a small room in the 
house of Jonathan Plough on Front Street.  With no income except Samuel's 
county bounty, Rachel was forced to rely on the benefices of others, as 
she mentions in her diary of <a href=rec122662.html>December 26, 1862</a>.
<p>Despite the boom provided by the two railroads in Chambersburg, the 
county was crippled by the <a href="occnorth.html">raid</a> by 
Generals Robert E. Lee and <a href="bios.html#jenkins">Albert G. 
Jenkins</a> during the summer of 1863.  Although Jenkins sought to 
reimburse town merchants for goods "procured," no such efforts were made 
for those goods taken from the surrounding farms.  This policy led to a 
great loss in livestock, as well as the <a 
href=fr072263p5c2.html>ravishing of the 
countryside</a>.  Such losses caused some Franklin farmers to leave their 
homes and search for a livelihood elsewhere. The less fortunate simply 
found their way  into poor houses.

Comparison of current agricultural production to 1850 census figures. 
"These facts go to show what an excellent county, for agricultural 
purposes, Franklin is, and there is no one at all well acquainted with 
its quality of good lands that does not believe but that by improvement 
in cultivation, the agricultural products can be increased 50 per

Line between Chambersburg and Greencastle is complete; "a train of Cars, 
for carrying passengers and freight, commenced running, regularly on 
Monday last." Complaints that railroad is charging passengers more than 
law allows; taxpayer subsidy noted.<br><br>

Points out that only six counties in the entire country produced more 
wheat than Franklin--most were in New York except for Lancaster, 
Pennsylvania. Franklin county produced 837,062 bushels. Also provides a 
summary of the corn, potato, oat, and hay crops, all of which are 
bountiful.

Lists the goods imported to and exported from Franklin County on the 
Cumberland Valley Railroad and argues that these figures prove that 
"Chambersburg is not a 'one-horse town.'"

<p>Due to rebel thievery and occupation, the Franklin County crop was 
much reduced in the harvest of 1863.  Although the wheat harvest came out 
average, the harvest of clover hay, corn, and potatoes were all greatly 
hinderd, due to incufficient ploughing, as well as loss of stock and horses.
