The news of the burning of Chambersburg by <a 
href=bios.html#mccausland>General John McCausland</a> spread throughout the 
North within several hours of the burning.  The New York newspapers 
published detailed articles about the invasion on July 31, 1864, the day 
after the burning.  Editors and writers from these newspapers continued 
their analysis of the burning as additional information became 
available.  At first, nothing but sympathetic feelings for the devastated 
citizens of Chambersburg were expressed.  However, in time, the northern
newspapers scolded the citizens of Chambersburg for not reacting in time 
or taking the threats of General McCausland seriously.  
<p>
<img src="goodones/mainst.JPG" width=275 align=right>The citizens of 
Chambersburg showed little appreciation for this northern 
commentary on the burning.  They argue that the northern troops rarely 
raided southern towns while marching to the battlefront and that the only 
exceptions were minor and due to threatening circumstances.  According to 
<i>The Franklin Repository</i>, <a href="reposart.html">"[i]t is 
untrue--wholly, maliciously and treasonably 
false, as broadly stated or insidiously intimated by several journals..., 
that the Union troops have furnished any precedent for the burning 
and plundering of Chambersburg."</a>     The Chambersburg citizens 
insisted that there were no measures they could have taken to prevent the 
destruction and that they were victims of a cruel and malicious act.  The 
money being demanded from General McCausland was a preposterous amount 
and could not possibly have been available with such short notice.


<p>
<i>The Franklin Repository</i> was especially infuriated by hypocritical 
strategies that had been suggested by the editor of the <i>New York 
Tribune</i>, Horace Greely.  Mr. Greely openly supported a more violent, 
destructive treatment of the South by northern soldiers.  He felt that 
such tactics would bring a sooner end to the war.  However, <i>The 
Repository</i> argues that Mr. Greely and the <i>New York Tribune</i> are 
not angered by the southern troops, as they should be, but at the 
citizens of Chambersburg for not properly avoiding the destruction: 
<a href=nypapers.html>"And now when their pernicious policy is bearing 
bitter fruit to the people along the border--when our citizens have despoiled of their 
property and their late comfortable and happy homes transformed into 
heaps of smouldering ruins, they mock at our calamities and ridicule our 
distresses!"</a>  It is clear that the citizens of Chambersburg were 
quick to defend their decision not to retreat.  Furthermore, they blamed
individuals ranging from Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania to the editors 
of New York newspapers for the burning of they town.  

<p>
Of course, many families were also severely affected by the burning of 
Chambersburg. Using close friends and relatives for support was 
imperative in providing support for those who lossed real estate and 
personal property. In many cases, however, the fathers and husbands were 
fighting the war in the South while the wives and children were struggling to recover 
from the burning of Chambersburg.  This proved to be extremely 
frustrating, especially for the men who were anxious to return home to 
help their loved ones.  One such individual, <a href=charlessmith.html>Asst. 
Sgn. Charles Smith</a>, 
was not even able to request leave in order to go home until April 15, 
1865, some ten months after the burning.  </center> <p> <HR> <center><img
