<p>     After Jenkins withdrew his force to the vicinity of Greencastle, 
he sent
out foraging parties in all directions in search of additional plunder.
One detachment consisting of about two
hundred and fifty men under the command of Colonel Ferguson crossed the Cove
Mountain by
way of Mercersburg, reaching McConnellsburg, the county
seat of Fulton County, shortly after daylight on Thursday. This was the first
appearance of the Confederates in
that place and the inhabitants were terribly alarmed as
they arose from their beds to find the town in possession
of the dreaded enemy. A vigorous search was at once
instituted for horses, of which a large number was taken.
The stores and shops were also visited, and although the
alarm had extended there and stocks were nearly all removed or concealed, a
considerable arnount of valuable
Articles was taken. In some cases these were paid for in
Confederate scrip. The streets, after their departure, were
thrown aside for better ones. About one mile north of the
town a drove of fat cattle, valued at about six thousand
dollars, belonging to Ex -Sheriff J. W. Taylor of this
place, was grazing.  These were taken, and together with
the horses which had been captured, were driven with
them and handed over to Rodes' infantry at Williamsport.
On the following Sunday this same body of the enemy
plundered the stores and shops of Greencastle. Had it
not been that the business inen there as elsewhere had
removed their stocks, the losses would have been much
greater. Another detachment was sent east, and after
plundering the rich country about Waynesborough, crossed the south-eastern
flank of the South Mountain, where, at the Monterey Pass, on Sunday, the 
21st,
the Philadelphia City troop and Bell's cavalry of Gettysburg,
encountered their pickets. In the evening of the same day about one hundred
and twenty of them entered Fairfield, and returned again by the Furnace 
road,
taking with them all the good horses they could find.<p>
From the time that these calvarymen fell back from this place to below 
Greencastle-Wednesday, the 17th-until Monday morning, the 22nd, the whole 
southern portion of Franklin county was plundered by these men, and the 
captures made were transferred to Rode's division at Williamsport.  It 
would be difficult to estimate the value of the property taken by this 
raid, but it certainly amounted to not less than one hundred thousand 
dollars.  Then its coming in the season of the year when the farming 
interests required the use of horses, and followed a few days afterwards 
by Lee's vast army, which added vastly to the amount taken, increased 
immediately its inconvenience and loss.  Many croppers who had little 
else than their stock, were bankrupted.  The effect of this raid, 
however, was to arouse the people of Pennsylvania and the whole North, 
and volunteers for the defense of the border hurried to Harrisburg.<p>
	By Monday morning, the 22nd,. the various detachments of Jenkins' 
command had all rejoined the main body between Greencastle and 
Hagerstown, where, on that day, they were joined by Rodes' division of 
infantry, when the real invasion of the State began.
