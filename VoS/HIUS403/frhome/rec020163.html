<p>Sunday.  I have recieved several letters 
from My sml. the orders for march were 
countermanded on account of the storm & the 
impasable roads  Still he will not be allowed to come home, but wishes me 
to come to see him.  Capt. S. wants his wife 
to come too--so we are going together.  My 
Sml tells me not to start until he writes 
again. I have been very busy preparing to go 
to see him. I have been trying hard to get to 
Mothers befor I go to Dixie but it seems imposible--The meeting is still 
protracted in our church--The interest seems to be increasing again.  
Cora is beginning to creep & gets up at chairs &c  She is in a measure 
forgetting that ugly habit 
& plays very nicley on the floor, but whenever she gets sleepy & wet & (it 
seems so) when I have work to do--she is at it.
