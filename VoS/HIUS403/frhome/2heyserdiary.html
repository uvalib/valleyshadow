<h3>JUNE 8</h3>
<p>Cold the past few days. Made fire and it felt comfortable. To the
bank a few hours, spent the rest of the day at home reading and
writing.
<name><pf>Col.</pf> <ln>McClure</ln></name> received a dispatch that 
we might be subject to a
raid soon. The bank has sent its most valuable papers off to
Philadelphia for safe keeping. Nothing has been confirmed to the
Rebels positions south of us, but speculation is rife and
everyone uneasy.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 11</h3>
<p>Cloudy. <name><fn>B.</fn> <ln>Wolff</ln></name> and myself spent a 
couple hours in the Lutheran
graveyard where an interment was being made. This churchyard is
in much disarray and scattered about. Many of the graves are lost
thru negligence of friends and the church. Part of <name><fn>John</fn>
<ln>Maderia</ln></name>'s
family is in one place, and part in another. A <name><pf>Mr.</pf>
<ln>Humphrie</ln></name>'s lay
beside <name><fn>Mary</fn> <ln>Maderia</ln></name>, then
<name><fn>John</fn> <ln>Maderia</ln></name>. Then a stone with the
inscription, "Our Sister". This was <name><fn>Catherine</fn>
<ln>Maderia</ln></name>, one of
their daughters who was a little backward, and received little
attention from the family. She was kept out of society and led a
life with the servants. I knew her well in my boyhood days by the
name of <name><fn>Kit</fn></name>. I believe the sin of this injustice 
was visited upon
the rest of the family, for none of them prospered in life.
Reading her epitaph finds only the word Sister, someone who knew
her history wrote beneath in pencil, "When my Father and Mother
forsake me, the Lord will take me up" May she have that rest
beyond this life, which was denied in this.
<p>This evening attended a meeting of the lodge where some degrees
were confirmed by strangers from New York. Remained until about
ten, then home.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 13</h3>
<p>To my mountain land. Found my man has done little work. The
ride is beautiful and enjoyed my walk up thru the glade,a most
delightful spot, full of nature's beauty. It is an hour and a
half ride home. Feel greatly relieved from my anxieties, taking
this little excursion. Rain all evening. More talk of an
impending invasion of our valley.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 14</h3>
<p>Clear and unpleasant. Reports of an engagement near Winchester.
Our town in an uproar. Government property being loaded up and
taken away. The drum calls for volunteers.
<p>All the army stores have been packed up and sent to Philadelphia.
Little attendance at church and Sabbath School. Much of the news
is false we hear, but it serves to upset the people. We all feel
Pennsylvania will be invaded. Many families are hiding their
valuables, and preparing for the worst. Some preparing to leave
town. Tonight we have many sleepless eyes, the houses all shut up
tightly, but the inmates astir.
<p>The stores are packing up their goods and sending them off,
people are running to and fro. <name><pf>Cashier</pf>
<ln>Messersmith</ln></name> is sent off
with the books of the bank and its valuables. The cars are
crowded to utmost capacity. The colored people are flying in all
directions. There is a complete state of confusion.
<p>After twelve we got word the Rebels have entered Hagerstown. The
stores are all closed, and the streets crowded with those that
can't leave. I am urged to leave. As President of the bank, might
be held responsible for its assets, which I doubt, anyhow I shall
stay to defend my property best I can.
<p>At 8 o'clock a number of contrabands entered our town, fleeing
from Martinsburg with the Rebels not far behind. These were
followed by a wagon train, many on three wheels, and less being
dragged and pushed as fast as possible. The street is crowded
with horses and wagons, all in the wildest state of confusion.
Upon asking one of them as to their plight, said the Rebels are
not far behind.
<p>Suddenly about two hundred more wagons, horses, mules, and
contrabands all came pouring down the street in full flight. Some
of them holloring the Rebels are behind us. Such a sight I have
never seen, or will never see again. The whole town is on the
sidewalks screaming, crying, and running about. They know not
where.
<p>The road into town is almost impassable by the teamsters cutting
loose their wagons and fleeing with their horses. This further
jammed up our town, some of the horses fall in the streets from
shere exhaustion. One soldier was killed by the fall. After the
panic subdues, the teamsters that had cut loose their wagons went
back for them. At twelve the excitement is beyond conception. I
am again urged to leave. <name><pf>Mr.</pf> <fn>T.B.</fn>
<ln>Kennedy</ln></name> sent me a message,
feeling it was a good idea. I have consented against my
will-packing up my valuable papers and at two, left with
<name><pf>Mrs.</pf>
<ln>Heyser</ln></name> in my buggy, for Carlisle, committing the house to
<name><fn>William</fn></name>, <name><fn>Proctor</fn></name> my colored 
man, and girl. After I left they did
not stay,but put off for the mountains. Had difficulty passing
the wagon jam on the road and answering questions, arriving at
Stoughs town about 6 in the evening, where I shall wait for news.
About midnight, awakened by the news that the Rebels were at
Shippensburg. Dressing, we immediately left for Carlisle at
midnight, being so dark and the roads jammed with wagons, made
dangerous situation that I regretted leaving home in the first
place. However, thanks to Almighty Providence, we arrived safely
in Carlisle about 4 o'clock in the morning. Tried to get more
sleep, but impossible, excitement here is mounting.
<p>We got a bite to eat, the horse fed, and left for Harrisburg. All
along the way the news had preceded us, people out securing and
leaving with their goods. Driving away their horses, and all
shops shut up.
<p>Stopped in Mechanicsburg, a prosperous, but now excited town, to
learn of fortifications being made for Harrisburg. We were
advised to stay here, but decided to press on. On approaching
Harrisburg, I could see the fortifications with a large number of
men working on them. The railroad cars were filled with troops on
their way to Chambersburg with artillary.
We crossed the river without difficulty and found Harrisburg, in
wildest confusion. Merchants shipping away their goods, families
their furniture, and people fleeing in all directions. Almost
laughable scenes some created.
<p>Stopped at Harris's Hotel. See few females, mostly men moving
furniture and stores, the streets are almost impassable. The
excitement is greater than Chambersburg. All the records of the
state have been removed under the expectation that Harrisburg
will be burned. Our state is doing nothing to defend itself
against invasion. Gov. Curtain seems to be paralized and unable
to act. We need decisions badly, and can't expect them from
Washington.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 17</h3>
<p>Very warm. The city is filling with volunteers and delegates to
the Democratic Convention. Rumors from Chambersburg that our
ships and stores have all been plundered and that the public
building may be burned that houses army stores. Appeals made to
the Gov. for troops to protect the state, but unheeded.
My son-in-law, <name><fn>J.A.</fn> <ln>Eyster</ln></name>, came this 
afternoon from
Philadelphia. Reports my daughter, Elizabeth and the children
well. News that the Rebels have left for Hagerstown, after having
done a minimum of damage to the town.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 18</h3>
<p>Warm. The Rebels have left Chambersburg taking with
them about 250 colored people again into bondage. Gov.
Curtain is presently very unpopular. Left Harrisburg for home
about two o'clock, in the afternoon, by way of the turnpike.
Traveling thru very beautiful and fertile countryside. Had tea in
Carlisle, pressed on for Stoughs town to spend the night. Here we
encountered many colored people fleeing the Rebels, as not all
have left the area. These poor people are completely worn out,
carrying their families on their backs. Saw some twenty from
Chambersburg that I recognized. Some men from Shippensburg urged
us to turn back, that danger was not past, but we decided to
press on, even though the night was black, stormy, and the road
dangerous. We were glad to see the lamps of Carlisle. Little did
we know of the perils that had been in our way, Almighty
Providence led us thru safely. It will be a journey my wife and I
will never forget. I suggested she write a book about our
adventurous journey. Weary and tired, we went to bed.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 19</h3>
<p>Pleasant, heavy rain thru the night. Much rumor-one knows not
what to believe. All is still alarm. The stores are still all
closed and business at a standstill. Unexpectedly met my man,
<name><fn>Proctor</fn></name>, who had made for the mountains, worked his 
way to
Newville from where he got to Carlisle. Of <name><fn>Fanny</fn></name>, 
our colored
girl, he knew nothing.
<p>The papers are now calling for McClelland's recall. Without him
we cannot succeed.
<p>Troops are coming in from neighboring states to support our few
that we can bring some order to our situation. It is ridiculous
that 800 Rebel troops can paralize the Southern portion of our
state without opposition. This invasion had been expected for
months, and totally ignored by our government.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 20</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Left for Shippensburg where we found things much in panic
as before. Large stampedes of men and horses from all parts of
the country. Dreadful accounts that the Rebels are still active
about Chambersburg, and are robbing and stealing as before. How
much of this is true, I cannot say as in times as these,
exaggeration is rife. Each small episode is magnified a thousand
times.
<p>Decided to stay overnite in Shippensburg. Rained very hard. The
town is packed with people. I luckily found a bed for my wife and
I. A New York regiment stopped here very disgusted as they had
yet to see a Pennsylvania Company on the job. One I talked with
said, "Dam your State, we came here to protect it, where are
your Pennsylvania soldiers!" If they don't soon appear, we shall
go home.
<hr>
<h3>SABBATH, JUNE 21</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Rose early, about four, to get an early start. Road
almost deserted. The New York Regiment encamped a short
distance from Shippensburg, along the road. Arrived at home
little after six, found my house still, silent, and musty. I
never felt so lonely, sitting in my own house without anything to
eat and no one about. <name><pf>Mrs.</pf> <ln>Fisher</ln></name> invited 
us over to have
breakfast, a kindness we shall not forget. Never again, under any
circumstances, shall I leave my home again. Just about Sabbath
School time, the town thrown into another state of confusion,
that a column of Rebels were advancing. This proved to be just a
poor man leading a few horses in town from his farm. So it goes,
what is fact and fancey, we continued with our worship, the
excitement subsided.
<p>In the evening, troops came in from New York for our protection.
Reports that the Rebels are in Greencastle. I feel certain that
Lee will bring his army into Pennsylvania.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 22</h3>
<p>Clear. Troops arriving from Harrisburg. Four Dalgreen pieces of
ordinance arrive and taken out to the end of town to be set up.
The citizens have formed a few companies for defense, but how
effective could they be?
<p>More troops have arrived, perhaps a thousand here now. We breathe
a little easier.
<p>Our hopes are short lived. The troops have all been recalled to
Shippensburg, the small battery is run out of town. Excitement is
again intense in town.
<p>A meeting is held of prominent men, to face the enemy, if they
should come and surrender the town on the best terms we can get.
Again these is a general stampede to leave town with valuables.
The road to Shippensburg is again packed with fleeing citizens.
There is not a Negro to be seen in town. At 11 o'clock, the
streets are deserted. I did not go to bed till about one. All is
quiet, but it is a sleepless town.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 23</h3>
<p>Clear. Rose early. A small local cavalry force rode out, but soon
returned. Wagons were sent out to secure the tents and baggage
the New York volunteers left behind in their flight to
Shippensburg.
<p>Our squads of cavalry are leaving, a bad sign. We soon find out
as we make our observations behind drawn shutters. A large
squad was seen advancing at the German Reformed Church, coming
down the street, filling the whole space, moving at a slow pace,
their guns in position, ready for instant firing in case of
attack. About 300 entered the town as cavalry, the others took up
positions in fields in sight of town. Those entering proceded to
the public square where they immediately cut down the telegraph
wires at all points. After this they placed pickets at all points
to prevent surprise.
<p>Our Committee met them and given to understand private property
would be respected, but they were to furnish provisions for
1,500 men. The Rebels behave very well. Not a citizen molested or
a house visited. We complied very well with their demands. This
afternoon they opened the warehouse of <name><fn>J. Allison</fn>
<ln>Eyster</ln></name>, and
made off with $4,000.00 worth of bacon, salt, beans, coffee,
crackers, etc. They also opened the warehouse of Oaks & Linn, and
took almost 300 barrels of flour belonging to <name><fn>Jacob</fn>
<ln>Stouffer</ln>.</name>
They broke in the heads of 20 barrels of whiskey, which they
poured out. At Miller's Drug Store, they poured a barrel of
brandy into the gutter. Captain Fitzhugh gave orders that if any
of his men were caught molesting a citizen, they would be
severely punished. I must admit they were a thoroughly
disciplined lot of men.
<p>About 4 o'clock they moved towards Shippensburg, leaving a guard
on the wagons behind. At 9 they returned with their artillery to
their camp at the South end of town. We don't understand their
plans. Neither do we understand why the State hoards all those
soldiers about Harrisburg, leaving the Southern portion to the
invaders.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 24</h3>
<p>Clear. The Rebels are active. They have closely kept plans,
something is afoot. I was notified that a meeting with the
principal citizens was requested to hear their demands.

<p>We stated that they already had nearly all these things, there
being nothing left to do but strip us all of everything. About 9
o'clock Ewell's corps passed through, probably some 10,000 men
with an immense train of artillary and army wagons. Among them
many farm wagons and teams they acquired along the way.
The men looked well, but lacked uniforms, being an array of all shades
and colors. No two hats alike, and their shoes could hardly be
called that. It was hard to distinguish the officers from the
men, except those of high rank. They sang and cheered lustily
as they marched along. About two, the pillage of our stores
began. Not a place escaped, never in the history of our boro was
there such a scene. The merchants were compelled to pack up the
wagons with their goods, which is being sent to Richmond.
The streets are crowded with Rebels who try to interrogate our
lessor citizens as to where things are hidden or sent to, and
also as to the movements of the Federal troops that had left. By
now, all of our stores have been ransacked.
<p>My neighbor, <name><pf>Widow</pf> <ln>Murphy</ln>, who kept a small 
store, dispensing
Queens Ware and shoes, nothing of value to the Rebels, did
succeed in having her place exempt from being robbed. Some of
the Rebel officers were very considerate.
<p>My son's mill and warehouse has suffered much from confiscation
for which they gave him $800.00 in Confederate script.
I hear my tenant farmer, <name><fn>Thos.</fn> <ln>Miller</ln></name>, was 
shot at while plowing
his corn. I have felt much concern for him, but cannot get thru
the line.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 25</h3>
<p>Clear and warm. All quiet until about 9 o'clock when the locusts
begin to swarm again. On each side of the street, they stop and
make further requisitions. There isn't much left to take. All
businessmen suffer--<name><ln>Eyster</ln></name> brothers,
<name><ln>Myers</ln> and <name><ln>Brand</ln></name>,
<name><ln>Huber</ln></name>
and <name><ln>Tolbert</ln></name>, <name><fn>Sol.</fn>

<ln>Heyser</ln></name>, <name><ln>Miller</ln></name> and
<name><ln>Hemsley</ln></name>, <name><ln>Nixon</ln></name>, these were the
principal losers.
<p>This afternoon brings much activity among the Rebels. Evidently
new orders have been directed as they are packing up and securing
their stolen goods as fast as possible. Officers are riding off
in all directions.
<p>At seven, we have reports of a skirmish near Carlisle driving
back the Rebels. Jenkins, Ewell, and Rhodes have returned to
Chambersburg with the intention of crossing over to Gettysburg
The drums beat-calling their men to camp and hunting the
stragglers. All indications point to readiness for a march.
Tonight there is not a Rebel to be seen. We are not sure what
caused the move, we do know large forces were now built up in
Harrisburg, ready to march South. McClelland is supposed to be
there, but so far Washington refuses to use him, politics being
behind this. With his skill and knowledge, the war could have
been ended but the power in Washington will not admit him.
The streets tonight are deserted and still. Not a soldier to be
seen except the posted sentinels. I remained up until one.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 26</h3>
<p>Cloudy and raining. All is quiet. Few soldiers seen on the
streets until after breakfast, when the advancing corps of Gen.
Johnston appears with waving flags and stirring music, as they
approach the public square. Three cheers went up for the Southern
Confederacy. They passed on column after column, for hours. Next
their batteries, army wagons, and ambulances, presenting a
fearful sight. I have mixed feelings of indignation and humility.
The passage of the army created a consternation among the people.
Many feel all is lost, after seeing this show of power in the
face of our inadequate defense.
<p>At about three o'clock, the rear of Johnston's corps is passed,
making about 15,000 men, rank and file, 72 pieces of ordinance,
350 wagons, about a regiment is left to guard the town. The large
school building has been taken by them for a hospital.
Requisitions have been made on all the innkeepers for mattresses,
blankets, quilts, sheets, etc. for the Rebel sick and wounded. It
is expected the like orders will be given the citizens.
This evening a part of their army has advanced near the town on
the Baltimore Pike, and on the Western Pike, occupying the
fairground.
<p>They say they have entered upon a desperate enterprise,and will
make Pennsylvania the battleground, instead of Virginia, that
they will conquer or die! All say the heaviest battle of the war
will be fought in this Valley. We all tremble as we have no news
from the outside, being completely cut off.
<p>Portions of the Cumberland Valley and Franklin Railroads have
been torn up. The bridge at Scotland, just rebuilt, has again
been demolished.
<hr>
<h3>SATURDAY, JUNE 27</h3>
<p>The Rebel troops commence their forward movement and continue
without interruption until dark. We estimate by actual count
nearly 35,000 men, officers and all, 165 pieces ordinance. I
notice many of the gun carriages had the U.S. mark upon them,
having been captured from our army.
<p>About 11 o'clock Gen. Lee passed with his staff. He is fine
looking man, medium size, stoutly built, has the face of a good
liver, grey beard, and mustache, poorly dressed for an officer
of his grade. He wore a felt hat, black, and a heavy overcoat
with large cape. His horse appeared to be rather an indifferent
one, for a man who reputedly is fond of fine stock.
Hill is a tall red-headed man, not over thirty-five. Longstreet
and Ewell I did not see, nor Johnston. Many of the officers
were fine looking men, and rode fine horses. During their
passage, I noticed their ever watchfulness on every side. The
citizens were crowded along the sidewalks and doors, observing
their passage; the rest, inside, behind drawn blinds, watched
unobtrusively. There were many remarks and exclamations, but all
in a subdued tone of voice or whisper. All had one thought in
mind, "Were these soldiers to be our conquerors, and if so, what
will be our fate?"
<p>Occasionally a German would stop me and complain in his native
tongue, as if I could help this situation, or was responsible for
it. (NOTE: Heyser was of German parents that kept and lived
by the old ways.)
<p>Lee offered to place a guard for the protection of the town, but
the sheriff could not be found. Later in the day, Gen. Hill and
Longstreet passed through with part of their army. They were far
less respectable lot, and constantly shouting, singing, and
hooting at females that showed themselves at doors or windows.
They were loud in their denunciation of the Union, and insulting
to citizens on the sidewalks. Shouting, "Boys, this is
Pennsylvania. We should destroy her as they did in Virginia, dam
the Union. Harrisburg will be ours, Hurrah for the Southern
Confederacy, and Jeff Davis."
<p>Every brigade as it passed sent a file of soldiers around to
examine the stores and places of business, requiring them to open
up. This continued all day. These men were called the Louisianna
Tigers, a forbidding-looking set of men that would take your hat
or remove your boots for their own use.
<p><name><pf>Rev.</pf> <ln>Schneck</ln></name> was relieved of his gold 
watch and $50.00. He
complained to get it back, but to no use. Robberies are now
common on the street, particularly where they are unguarded.
<name><ln>Dechart</ln></name>s hat store was cleaned out today, not a 
single item left
in stock. They opened up my son, <name><fn>William</fn></name>'s store 
today, and
started to help themselves. We are powerless to stop them, and
can do nothing but watch and complain to the commanding officers.
They refer to the same treatment our soldiers gave the
Confederacy in Virginia.
<p>I finally found a Col. Greene that listened to some reason and
had the men removed and the door shut.
<p>While the troops were passing today, I was sitting by my door,
the victim of many insulting remarks. One even attempted to take
my hat. He withdrew when I offered to resist, as I would have
struck him. Were it not for the rigid discipline they were under,
I shudder to think what our lot would have been. There are
exceptions, many of the Rebels are gentlemen, and act as such.
Mostly, those from Florida, Texas, and Louisianna, generally
speaking, are a band of cutthroats.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 28</h3>
<p>Cloudy. The troops are moving through town again, a continual
procession until evening. The drug store of <name><fn>J.</fn>
<ln>Spangler</ln></name> was
visited today by Lieut. Todd, President Lincoln's wife's brother.
He finally had to be ejected by the provost marshal as having no
business being there. Reports come in our neighboring farmers are
being robbed, one being shot. Many of these robberies are
committed by vagabonds or camp followers in search of booty.
The Rebels try to check them, but can't catch them all. One
farmer was shot and the body hid in the manure pile. These
robbers are mostly after money. The poor farmers are defenseless.
All of business places are pretty well stripped, all that is left
now are the private houses to be broken into.
<p>Up to this evening, the whole number of troops passing thru
Chambersburg is about 43,000; 180 pieces artillary, 3,000 wagons
and ambulances. Indications seem to be they are about to leave
Chambersburg. It is now 11 o'clock, my mind is weary, sad, and
gloomy. So much I cannot even form an opinion.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 29</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Streets are clear until about eight. My son,
<name><fn>Jacob</fn></name>, meets
Robert Reynolds of Georgia. I knew his father well. Robert had
his own horse and servant along. He is a conscript, wish I could
have talked with him.
<p>Fearful outrages in the country about us. I hear the Rebels mail
has been cut off from Richmond. They are apprehensive of trouble.
<name><ln>Stouffer</ln></name>'s mill has been taken over by the Rebels 
and is running
for their use. There isn't much food left in town now. If the
Rebels remain much longer, I do not know what we shall do. The
country side is rapidly losing all its livestock. Much had
already been driven off and hidden in the mountains.
<p>About 4 o'clock, about 5,000 men took up their line of march for
Greencastle with 18 pieces of ordinance. I think they are
clearing their lines to get their wagon trains back into
Virginia. They are now riding about our alleys looking for
harness and gear. I removed the wheel from my wagon and hid it,
making it unfit for use.
<p>About the close of the evening, they are busy tearing up the
sills of the railroad and burning them to bend the rails over,
making them unfit to use.
<hr>
<h3>JUNE 30</h3>
<p>Variable weather. Sunshine and rain. A large wagon train today
takes its course towards Gettysburg. Lee's headquarters are still
here. He keeps his troops in constant movement that it is hard to
say what he is planning for his principal move.
<p>About 9 o'clock a large train of wagons are withdrawn from the
direction of Harrisburg, and put on the line of march for
Gettysburg. It took 4 hours for the line to pass here. The troops
are busy destroying the Franklin Railroad at both North and South
ends of the County. Along with sills of the road, they pile on
all the fence they can find to heat and twist the rails.
Another force of about 500 men have been sent to destroy the
railroad depot and buildings, starting with the large turntable.
It is so soundly built of iron castings, their fires had little
effect on it. The engine house was pulled down after an immense
amount of work. So they went from building to building, a
senseless thing to do, as the structures were of no importance to
us as we could not use them. I tried to reason with a nearby
officer about the wanton destruction. Their answers are always
the same, "This is in retaliation for your troops' work on the
South, particularly Fredericksburg."
<p>Leaving this scene of destruction, which appears to be their last
act. I went up to the belfry of the German Reformed Church to see
if I could trace any damage to my farm, but could not, so much
timberland intervening. You could mark the line of the railroad
by the smoke of the burning ties. From what I can see, there is
little damage to crops and grassland.
<p>This evening, there is much activity. Troops are withdrawn from
all parts to march to Gettysburg. Reports that all ready there
has been an engagement at Cashtown. Their cooks are busy
preparing rations for the next few days.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 2, 1863</h3>
<p>Cloudy and very hot. The Rebels are leaving Chambersburg for
Gettysburg. About 3 this morning, I was awakened by the rumbling
of heavy wagons. There were about 60 of them, followed by a large
body of troops, requiring about two hours to pass. They were
quite jubilant in their passage thru town, pulling my bell at
the door and hooting at me.
<p>After their passage, all was quiet again, except squads of
calvary passing to unite with their companies, all in the
direction of Gettysburg. Somewhere near there is a heavy
engagement. About ten, the town is vacant. The Rebels leaving
their sick behind for us to nurse and care for. A few stragglers
are to be seen, but the worst is over. We congratulate ourselves
that we still have a roof over our heads. About 12, in the
company of two other men, I walked out to my farm to assess the
damage. Everywhere were holes cut in fences and grain trampled
down by the exercises of the cavalry. I sustained a great amount
of damage, nearly 4,000 men have encamped here. All of my fence
gone, about 40 acres of oats and much damage to all other crops.
My houses were all robbed of clothing and any kind of gear with
which to work. The report was circulated that I was a Colonel in
the Union Army and now made to pay greater than my neighbors. How
unjust even your supposed friends can be. In passing over the
fields and woods where they encamped, there is already a great
stench.
<p>I found two Rebels hiding on my farm and would have taken them
back to town. They would have been willing prisoners to obtain
their parole, but a large body of Stewarts' cavalry was passing
near and I advised them to hide. One gave me his bayonet, which I
brought back to town. Back home, more reports come in of a battle
near Gettysburg. All night long, more troops pass thru town,
their yelling is terrific. I keep indoors.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 3</h3>
<p>Very hot. Our streets are deserted. An occasional Rebel is seen
just a few stragglers. A Rebel soldier riding up Market Street
was fired upon by <name><fn>Wm.</fn> <ln>Etter</ln></name>, one of our 
citizens. We feared a
reprisal for this sort of thing and put a stop to it. We see more
and more deserters. The town being clear of Rebels, the doors are
opening again to promenading females. Nothing can stop them, many
of them show little respect for their character and standing.
They expose themselves, as if intentional, to be out late at
night unprotected.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 4</h3>
<p>Showers of rain. Reports of terrible fighting at Gettysburg.
Captures are being made all around here of Rebel cavalry and
infantry which are sent to Harrisburg, their horses and guns
being confiscated. The country people are coming in now with
their marketing with terrible accounts of outrages that were
committed upon them. We were fortunate that the Rebel officers
were mostly gentlemen, and tried to hold their savage troops in
check, but many could not. I suppose we are fortunate to be
alive.
<p>Ewell is at Carlisle and demands its surrender, throwing some 40
shells into town, which did little damage. They burned the gas
works where the Carlisle Deposit Bank had hidden its records,now
gone.
<p>Gen Smith appeared and Ewell fell back towards Gettysburg. We
hear of a great battle at Gettysburg, but as yet no particulars,
except the Union forces were victorious. Some public spirited
citizens seized the mail (Rebel mail) going thru Fayetteville.
Soon a detachment of cavalry was back looking for it, and took
18 prisoners locally for some hours before releasing them; on
pain of death if it happens again.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 5</h3>
Much rain. About three, 12 wagons of wounded from Gettysburg were
routed by mistake thru our town, leaving them here at our
hospital, a wonder they were alive, thrown in heaps in rough
wagons. The wagons were captured by John W. Taylor and sent to
Carlisle. This is the Sabbath, all is calm and still. Few persons
on the streets.
<p>I notice that most of our birds have gone since the appearance of
the Rebels, and that flies and insects are more numerous. Only 5
persons attended prayer meeting. About 6, part of Gen. Milroy's
cavalry of about 300 passed thru town at full speed brandishing
their swords and responding to the cheers of many spectators.
They rode South in the direction of Greencastle. No word yet from
Gettysburg.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 6</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Gen. Milroy was dispatched to Greencastle to protect a
large wagon train. We hear a decisive battle was fought at
Gettysburg. That Lee is withdrawn towards the Potomac and that
enormous amounts of supplies and prisoners have been captured.
The news gave rise to the ringing of bells and general convivial
in the streets. It appears the contest raged for 3 days and was
the most desperate of the war. As Lee withdraws towards the
Potomac, we hear of skirmishes along the way. One over near
Waynesboro and Smithburg. Reports that the Pine Stump Road is
filled with broken Rebel wagons and caissons, filled with
ammunition much of which is thrown in the mud with a view of
destroying it. Also many dead and wounded lying by the roadside,
indicating a hasty retreat.
<p>There is a report the Rebels are forming at Marion to meet
Pleasanter's calvary which is expected to attack them. Also it is
said a cannon was found buried by the Rebels near the place
on the roadside.
<p>I met Doctor Gamble today. The Surgeon Rebel in charge of the
hospital here. He tells me most of the best men of the South were
in this battle, now most of them gone.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 7</h3>
<p>Much rain. The grain is in danger of spoiling. About 200 Rebel
prisoners were brought in today. Many are deserting, Lee is
making a desperate attempt to escape Mead's army. Our stores
are reopening and cleaning up.
<p>Gen. Couch's division is following the end of Lee's army thru
Greenwood on what is called the Pine Stump Road. We are hoping
Lee's army will be captured. If Mead allows him to escape, it
will indeed be folly.
<p>We hear the Rebel lose at Gettysburg 30,000 men, the Union
20,000. My sons, <name><fn>Jacob</fn></name> and
<name><fn>William</fn></name>, just returned from the
battlefield. It is a fearful sight. The fields full of dead, by
all the roadsides dead are hardly covered by a thin layer of mud.
Wreckage everywhere, the implements of war fast disappearing by
souvenir seekers. Soon the cultivators plow will cover it all and
put an end to military glory.
<p>If Lee is allowed to escape this struggle will be prolonged. We
hear of only skirmishes all along his route to the Potomac.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 8</h3>
<p>Much rain. Gen. Couch is raising more men at Harrisburg with a
view to following Lee. We hear Lee's army is crossing at
Williamsport. Our town is quiet now, a few straggling soldiers to
be seen They now attract little attention. I feel very unwell
this evening.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 9</h3>
<p>Awoke with all the bells ringing, report confirmed that Vicksburg
has been taken. I have kept to my room most of the day. Some
companies of New York cavalry and infantry creating a disturbance
by their drunkenness. We saw none of this among the Rebels.
Reports that Lee is using the canal boats at Williamsport to ford
his sick and wounded. Our town is now stirring with activity
again. Many who left are returning and the stores re-opening
with what they have left. The night closes in quiet, and being
unwell, go to my bed.
<hr>
<h3>JULY 10</h3>
<p>Clear and warm. Still unwell today. The Rebel army busy crossing
at various points on the Potomac. Lee's headquarters still in
Hagerstown, but the troops going to Williamsport and
Shepherdstown. We hear much of Lee's equipment has crossed over
together with much livestock.
<p>Some troops come in this morning and moved towards Greencastle.
About 3,000 passed thru Mercersburg. The town in confusion. Many
of our females show little self-respect. You see them bareheaded,
mingling with the crowd, and a number of them hanging on the arms
of strange soldiers. It is amazing that the parents allow this to
take place. Perhaps it is condoned under the guise of patriotism,
but this usually ends in the ruin of these daughters. Tonight,
Gen Couch arrived amid much cheering. The speeches they give are
politically slanted and do nothing toward ending the war and
healing our wounds.
