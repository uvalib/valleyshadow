By June of 1864, Chambersburg had already lived through two 
occupations by Confederate troops, which distinguished it from most other 
Northern towns.   
Each invasion onto the home front, culminating in the burning of the town 
in 1864, was more invasive, more intrusive,and 
brought the battlefront closer to the homes of Chambersburg residents.  
The way that citizens viewed the invading armies, as well as the actual 
damage inflicted by the raiders, reflected this progression towards a more 
total war.  These early invasions were not total war, but they did 
bring enemy soldiers into the town square, into the homes of 
Chambersburg townspeople, and into their businesses.<p>
