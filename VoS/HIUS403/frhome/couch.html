GENERAL:  I have the honor to report that on the 27th ultimo, 
Brigadier-General Averell, of the Department of West Virginia, with his 
force lay at Hagerstown, Md., covering the several fords of the Potomac 
in that vicinity.  At his request I sent him my mounted men, consisting 
of two companies of 100-days' men, retaining under of forty cavalry from 
Carlisle Barracks, that covered the roads leading toward Mercersburg, and 
Caprt. R. M. Evans' company of Independent Philadelphia Scouts, an unpaid 
force that watched in the vicinity of Emmitsburg.  At Chambersburg, there 
was part of an infantry company, under Capt. T.S. McGowan, and a piece of 
field artillery.
<p>On the 28th six companies of the 100-day's infantry that were called to 
Chambersburg were directed by orders to be sent to Hagerstown where they 
arrived on the morning of the 29th.  After midday of this date general 
Averell fell back to Greencastle, where I had previously detached fifteen 
men and an officer from Lieut. H. T. McLean's party.  This latter officer 
had pickets near McCoy's Ferry, which were driven, about 3 p. m., back to 
Mercersburg.  The enemy's advance, 200 men, charged through the town, 
forced the small party to fall back after a severe skirmish.  Dark coming 
on, a picket was left at Bridgeport, while Lieut. H.T. McLean fell aback 
to Saint Thomas, seven miles from Chambersburg, on the Pittsburg pike.  
In course of the day and evening all of the horses in the Valley, 
amounting to several thousand, were moved north by my order, and the 
trains of General Averell, with those at Hagerstown, refugees, &c., came 
through and encamped near Chambersburg.  I notified General Averell that 
I had no force to protect them.  That officer was duly notified of Lieut. 
H. T. McLean's movements as well as that I had no force to protect his 
trains.
<p> The following dispatch was sent:

General W.W. Averell,
   <p>          Greencastle :
<p>
  Lieutenant McLean was driven out of Mercersburg by about 200 of the 
enemy.  A force of about 400 and two pieces of artillery afterward came up.

<p>
  At 12.30 a. m. July 30 a dispatch from Lieut. H. t. McLean was received 
that his pickets at Bridgeport had been driven in.  I immediately 
notified General Averell as follows:
 <p>  <div align=right>                               CHAMBERSBURG, 
July 30, 1864 </div>
<p>Brig.Gen. W. W. Averell,
   <p>           Greencastle :<p> Lieutenant McLean's pickets have been driven in at Bridgeport, on the 
road leading from Mercersburg to Saint Thomas.  The force via Mercersburg 
has at least two pieces of artillery.

<p>
  At 2 a. m. a verbal message from Lieut. H. T. McLean informed that he 
was being passed in from Saint Thomas.
  <p> The following dispatch by telegraph was sent:
					
<p><div align=right>				       Chambersburg, July 30, 1864-2 a. m.</div>
<p>
General W. W. Averell,
<p>              Greencastle :
  <p>My force, Lieutenant McLean, is being driven back in from Saint Thomas, 
and falling back upon Chambersburg.

<p>
  At 1 a. m. Maj. John S. Schultze, assistant adjutant-general, gave 
orders to Captain Brow, quartermaster in charge of the train above 
mentioned, to move via Shippensburg north.  At 3 a. m. the enemy was near 
the town and I directed Maj. John S. Schultze to so notify General 
Averell and ask him what he intended to do.  No replies has been received 
from that officer, and he subsequently informed me that he did not 
receive my dispatches of the enemy's advancing until 3.45 a. m.  Upon 
finding the enemy so near, in order to save the trains, including those 
of the railroad, as well as to give warning to General Averell, one piece 
of artillery was directed to take position on the Pittsburg pike, a mile 
from town, covered by the infantry, about thirty-five men, and the 
calvary, twenty-four men, which was my whole strength, excepting one gun, 
ordered to cover the rear of the trains, then not all on the road.  The 
gun that was on the pike opened on the enemy about 3.30 a. m.  Maj. C. H. 
Mcneely, commissary of musters, was present to carry out my 
instructions.  I respectfully call attention to the report of the Lieut. 
H.T. McLeans, commanding officer inclosed.
 <p> The enemy was held in check about two hours, my people slowly reitring 
through the town, being careful not to fire a shot within its limits, in 
order that there should be no excuse for firing the buildings or 
committing any barbarities upon the people.  The enemy, consisting of 
Brigadier-General McCausland's brigade of five regiments, and four pieces 
of artillery, and Brig. Gen. b. T. Johnson's brigade of two regiments, 
four battalions, with two pieces of artillery, numbering 2,600 in all, 
formed line of battle on the fair grounds, men dismounted, and after 
firing two or three cannon shots into the town, and dismounted men.  It 
is certain that both McCausland and Johnson were present.
 <p>
 The chief burgess being absent, some of the principled citizens were 
arrested by Major Gilmore and notified that by order of Major-General 
Early $100,00 in gold or $500,000 in currency was required to ransom the 
town.  He was told by these gentlemen that there was not probably $50,000 
in currency at hand ; to which he replied that "The town must be burnt."  
Details were made and placed under charge of officers and fires kindled, 
it is said, almost simultaneously in fifty different places.  In some 
instances the first warning to occupants of buildings came from the fire 
and smoke beneath them, thus barely escaping with their lives.  Some of 
the officers and men refused, or were persuaded not to carry out their 
barbarous orders, and assisted people in fleeing from the flames, but 
generally an inhuman and savage ferocity characterized their actions.  
The sufferers, with few exceptions, only saved the clothing on their 
persons.  Thus was consummated this premeditated deed of barbarity.  At 
about 11 a. m. the enemy drew in their pickets, and a little later 
their pillaging and burning parties retired towards McConnellsburg; 
General Averell entered three hours after from the direction of Fayetteville.
<p>  A lieutenant from Georgia, attached to a Virginia regiment, who 
deserted 
to our lines, states that it was understood by their troops that all 
buildings were to be burned from the moment Pennsylvania soil was touched.
 <p> Accompanying I invite attention to a telegram to General Averell with 
his reply, also a statement made by an intelligent sergeant on duty at 
these headquarters who was in Chambersburg during the rebel occupation, 
and part of the time a prisoner.
  <p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant.
