<p>Everything has changed since the burning.  Business is all conducted 
in little shops and shanties on the back streets, and in out of the way 
places.  But a small assortment of goods are kept on hand and those for 
these the highest prices are asked.  Many of our citizens have removed to 
other places never ti return.  Others of our business men who remain have 
opened up in a small way in some unthough of place, or started some new 
branch of traffic that the necessities of the people seem to demand.  One 
would scarcely suppose that so great a change could take place in a 
community in so short a time.-Men seem in a degree reckless, they have 
lost all they possessed in the world, in an hours time, through no fault 
of theirs, and they appear determined to make it up by hook or by crook 
in the shortest possible time.  Money seems plenty and "trust is played 
out" as may be noticed posted up in stores and shops.  It is cash down 
for everything you get and everything you sell.  People understand each 
others necessities and do not think of asking credit.  As to the 
prospects of re-building the town they look exceedingly dark just now.  
But few have the means to rebuild and they are dubious about investing 
their money in property along the border while the war lasts.  Those 
without means can do nothing but pile up their brick and let their lots 
take care of themselves until some appropriation is made for their 
relief.  A few are already re-building-they are, perhaps, the wisest 
after all.  The Legislature granted $100,000 to keep people from starving 
and freezing this winter.  Very charitable indeed!  "Charity convereth a 
multitude of sins."  The contributions from other places will not amount 
to much in the way of relieving the many wants of the people.  The supply 
of provisions forwarded for a few weeks was liberal and relieved 
immediate wants.  This aid has in a great measure stopped off and must 
soon cease altogether,  The sufferers would return their grateful thanks 
to the good people of many towns in Pennsylvania for their substantial 
sympathy.  A few things in the way of clothing and bedding have been sent 
in, but not enough to fit out twenty families when over three hundred are 
entirely destitute.  How the people are to live this winter God only 
knows.  Without stoves, coal, wood, bedding, furniture, clothing, flour, 
maet, in a word, all the necessaries of life; and ,most of all without a 
roof to shelter them from the pelting of the storms.  Our people will 
only realize what they have lost, and what hard times are, when cruel 
winter comes.
