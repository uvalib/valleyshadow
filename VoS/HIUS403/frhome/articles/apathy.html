<b>APATHY OF THE PEOPLE</b>

<table width=480>

<p>The universal failure of the people to respond to the late call for 
troops is the strongest proof yet developed to show how heartily sick and 
tired they are of war.  The most urgest appeals and entreaties of a 
whining Governor proved ineffectual to arouse their dormant enthusiasm.
<p>The border was invaded and capital of the nation was threatened, yet 
the people manifested the most stolid indifference.  And this indifference 
was not confined to any particular class or party, but was seen among all 
classes and all parties.  The blatant "Loyal Leaguer" seemed as loth to 
shoulder a muskets his "copperhead" neighbor.  Indeed, when Col. 
Thomas, of Philadelphia, issued a card making a personal appeal to the 
"Leaguers" to enlist, they regarded it as an insult to their dignity, and 
the <i>Press and North American</i>, the organ of the League, refused to 
publish the card in their columns.  What right had Col. Thomas to ask 
"Leaguers" to enlist?  He should have known better.  It is true, they 
howl themselves hoarse in favor of war in the League Houses, but 
they <i>others</i> to do the fighting.  Patriotic Leaguers!
<p>But to return. Why is it that this apathy and indifference exists?  
The people have lost all confidence in a <i>successful termination of the 
war</i>.  They regard the country as hopelessly ruined through the 
mismanagement, imbecility and fanaticism of this administration.  They 
have seen the resources of the country wasted and hundreds of thousands 
of the precious lives of their countrymen sacrificed in, what must now 
appear plain to all, a vain attempt to subjugate the Southern people.  
They have seen the object of the war subverted from a high and holy 
purpose to a mere crusade against African slavery.  They are beginning to 
realize the fact that under the present relentless and vindictive policy 
the war must be interminable; or at least that it can never end except 
through sheer exhaustion of both sections, when nothing but poverty, 
desolation, ruin and anarchy will be lest as the inheritance of a once 
proud, prosperous and happy people.
<p>In view of those facts is it any wonder that the people are growing 
weary, very weary, of this bloody, ghastly, inhuman war!  Is it any 
wonder that a feeling of despondency routs upon this country when the 
word of promise has so frequently been kept to the [illegible]  to be 
broken to the hope?
