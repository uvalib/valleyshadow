<p>No sooner had the rebels possession of the town than commensed the 
work of pillage.  the men went bowling through the streets for "whiskey" 
and "greenbacks," while their officers were industriously at work 
breaking open stores and dwellings and robbing citizens, wherever they 
met them, of their watches and pocket-books.  In the meantime McCausland 
had an eye to business and determined to drive a sharp bargain.  He made 
a peremptory demand upon the town authorities for $500,00 in greenbacks 
or, if more convenient and agreeable, would take $100,00 in golf, or burn 
the town in ten minutes.  It was very evident from the conduct of the 
men, from the moment they entered town, that it was a doomed place and 
would be destroyed under any circumstances.  No attention was, therefore, 
paid to the demand and McCausland immediatelu fired the town as he would 
have done had every dollar of the ransom been paid down.  Our citizens 
have the proud satisfation of knowing, however ruinous their hopes, that 
they did not demean themselves by any offer to compromise, or conciliate 
in any way the freebooters by an attempt to nefotiate with them. From the 
moment the entered the place they gave fave out that they were hell-bent 
to burn the [illegibe] -d town" and they were suffered tocarry out their 
hellish inclinations without making dupes of our citizens by extorting 
ransom from them when rasnom would not have saved the town. Though we 
lost about everything else we saved at least our self-respect by having 
no voluntary intercourse with McCausland and his "hell hounds"
