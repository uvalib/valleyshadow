<b>THE BURNING OF CHAMBERSBURG</b>
<hr width=40>
Where the Blame Belongs

<table width=480><tr><td>
<p>It was well known over the country, and we presume the authorities at 
Washington were aware of the fact, if they can be presumed to know 
anything, that Chambersburg was the "Headquarters of the Military 
Department of the Susquehanna," with a Major General and his staff 
quartered there to watch over it operations.  If it was worth 
establishing and dignifying with the title of a "Military Department" it 
was worth defending, but that obvious sequene seems never to have entered 
into the military combinations of the brainless blunderers at 
Washington.  To the stupidity of the War Department must we lay the 
destruction of Chambersburg.  Ther is no use mincing terms about it.  Let 
the blame be placed fairly and squarely where it belngs.  The earnest 
appeals made, time and again, buy GEN. COUCH, to the "powers that be" at 
Washington, to obtain and organize troops for the protection of 
Chambersburg against rebel raids cannot at this time be told.  GEN. COUCH 
is too correct a military man to publish them himself, even in his own 
defence, and the War Department DARE NOT DO IT.  We know they were made 
and we know too that they were denied.  The most ill-natured caviler at 
GEN. COUCH will hardly urge that he should have creaed men and armed and 
equiped them at his own expense, nor would they expect him individually 
to attack and drive back the whole rebel force.  The War Department seems 
to have counted on something of this sort but the people have better 
sense.  This being a Military Department, <i>in name</i> at least, the 
people had no right, suppose the men and arms on hand, which they were 
not, to underake the control of its affairs by organizing troops even for 
their own protection.  He would have ben a bold man, indeed, to have 
snubbed the despots at Washington by establishing an independent Military 
organization in one of their pet Departments! In that case the unsurper 
of military authority, and all citizens associated with him, would have 
been promptly arrested if it took a whole corps from the Armu of the 
Potomac to effect it.  Unders such a "military necessity," like riots in 
New York, they could, no doubt, have been conveniently spred but not a 
man for the protection of Chambersburg!
<p>The Editor of the <i>Repository</i> with a degree of candor and 
fairness, 
unusual in Republican journals in these times, when everything is made 
to bend to cover up the blunderings of this Administration, holds the 
authorities at Washington responsible for the Burning of Chambersburg, 
and clearly exonerates GEN. COUCH from all the blame.  The following is 
taken from the <i>Repository:-
<p>Gen. Couch had o troops-not even an organized battalion on the 
border.  He had organized six or seven regiments of one hundred-days 
men; but as fast as they were officered and armed they were forwarded to 
Washington, in obediance to orders from the authorities.  He was left, 
therefore with no force whatever to defend the border.  The national 
authroities had persistently refused to uniform the citizens if the 
border, and thus enable them to orfanize for their own defense without 
exposing themselves to certain butchery in case of capture, and the 
border was thus left entirely defenseless."</i>
<p>In another part of the same article in the Repository we find the 
charge against Washinton authorites still more strongly stated, it adds:-
