<p>On Sunday afternoon intelligence reached General Couch's headquarters, 
at this place, that a considerable force of Confederates were moving down 
the Shenandoah Valley.  This was about the sum and substance of the 
dispatch but as soon as it was made known it assumed every shape that the 
active imaginations of our people could possibly give it, and erected a 
terrible state of excitement in the community.  Our merchants at once 
commenced packing their goods.  The Railroad shops were stripped of their 
machinery and everything valuable about the premices put aboard the 
cars.  Our streets soon began to fill up with wagons, drays, carriages 
and wheelbarrows moving in all direction while the side-walks were 
blocked up with dry goods, groceries and merchandise of every description 
in readiness for transportation.  The exodus of the farmers with their 
stock soon set in and through Sunday night until noon on Monday it was 
one continuous stream of horses, mules, cattle, and negroes moving in the 
direction of the Susquehanna.  An army wagon trail with a large lot of 
horses from the camp about Hagerstown passed through early on Monday 
morning.  The rebels would have found but little material for plunder 
between the Potomac and the Susquehanna had they concluded to come over.  
They, however, would have found one thing that they have not met with on 
their previous marauding excursions.  Every step of their advance down 
this valley would have been resisted and met with a force they little 
expected to find here.  Gen. Couch on being apprised of their advance 
made ample preparations to meet and check it effectually.  A battery of 
artillery with a force of infantry and cavalry were brought here so 
quickly and so quietly that our citizens were so much astonished to find 
it here as the rebels would have been had they run against it.  It was 
also, we are informed, the deterination of Gen. Couch to put the town 
under martial law and compel every man to take up arms and defend his 
home.  This course would have been approved by every loyal citizen, or 
man of spirit, in the place,  Those skulking cowards who fly on the first 
sound of approaching danger, but whose "voice is still for war" and who 
preach up "extermination," would have thus been afforded a fine 
opportunity to put their doctrines into practice.  It also afforded as 
much gratification to see the efforts of Gen. Couch promptly seconded by 
a number of citizens who had formerly been in the military service.  They 
issued a call, with their names attached, for the formation of companies 
for "Home Defense," and were very active in their exertions to make all 
needed prepartions to meet the expected invasion.  We hope to see this 
spirit kept up for although the excitement is over the danger may not be 
passed.  We must do something to put an end to the disgrace of skedaddling 
for which our people are becoming so noted on every idle rumor of rebel raid.
<p>All is quiet here at the present writing.-The excitement and alarm has 
passed from the minds of the people and business has been resumed and 
going on as formerly.-Many of the farmers have already returned with 
their stock and commenced harvesting again as if nothing had happened so 
to interrupt it.  We have so conflicting rumors in  circulation as to the 
whereabouts of the rebels but the general belief is that we are in no 
great danger of either a raid or an invasion in force at this time.
