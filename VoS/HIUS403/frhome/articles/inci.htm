<center><h1>The Events and Incidents of the Burning</h1></center>
<p>What exactly transpired on the streets of Chambersburg on July 30th may never truly be known.  Each participant and observer of the burning recounted the episode slightly differently.  Surely some of the accounts simply vary due confusion, but in each an agenda can be seen.  From the victims to the victors, each person recasts the busy morning in the most convenient and comfortable manner: to make the enemy look bad while defending one's actions.  A careful <a href=webstat.html>comparison and analysis of various accounts</a> will yield the most balanced and comprehensive version of the burning. 
<p>McCausland and his Confederate troops pushed on through Maryland and Pennsylvania territory through the clear night of July 29th.  The men were exhausted from the continuos marching and riding, they had not slept for two days.  They made a rest stop in Mercersburg to feed their horses and regroup the cavalry shortly after sunset. Their advance had been slowed down by a small regiment of Federal cavalry under Gen. McLean.  The regiment had succesfully slowed down the Confederate long enough for the last trains, filled with supplies and equipment, to leave Chambersburg.
<p>At 3 AM, the first Confederate invaders reached the outskirts of Chambersburg.  The small force under Gen. Couch quickly withdrew from the city, not willing to provide the Confederates with an excuse to destroy the city.  A battery of artillery, consisting of four cannons, was positioned on the hilltops above the town.  The cannons announced the arrival of the Confederates to the sleeping residents at 5 AM with a round of shots over the town.  As the sun rose over the Pennsylvania hills, the 8th regiment dismounted and lead the march into town.  Soon over eight hundred rebels occupied the streets.
<p>Citizens were rounded up by the troops, and the Courthouse bell was rung to call people in the center of town, the Diamond.  Adjunct-General Fitzhugh presented the few citizens in the Courthouse square with a written oder from Gen. Early demanding $500,000 in US currency, or $100,000 in gold.  The ransom also stated this was in retaliation for six homes burned in Virginia by Gen. Hunter.
