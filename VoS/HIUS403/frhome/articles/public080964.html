<p>So long as the Yankees were engaged in burning the dwelling houses of 
Southern people, it was a very interesting business, that seemed to be 
highly approved by the Christian people of all the Yankeedom.  The 
burning of the towns of Washington in North Carolina, Alexandria in 
Louisiana, Darien in Georgia, and others that might by mentioned, by the 
Yankee troops, provoked no word of comdemnation of censure.  So long as we 
were the sufferers, such vandalism was justified, or at least excused.  
So long as our wives and children, were rendered homeless, they sat 
quietly and uttered no complaint.
<p>In the course of time however it came to pas, that General McCausland 
entered the great State of Pennsylvania and by way of retaliation burned 
a large part of Chambersburg.  Then for the first time all of Yankeedom 
finds out that burning houses is a shocking crime, that turning people 
into the streets without shelter is a scandalous outrage, and they desire 
it shall be stopped.
<p>The North has conducted this war in a most brutal manner, and all we 
have done is to retaliate.  It is in the power of the North to strip the 
war of this feature, by requiring their officers and soldiers to respect 
private property.
<p>We commend the following article from the National Intelligencer to a 
careful perusal.  It shows that retaliation produces food fruits.

<a name=nat_intel><center>BURNING OF CHAMBERSBURG</center>
The following are the "National Intelligencer's" comments on the burning 
of Chambersburg by our troops:<br></a>
<p>The outburst of indignation with which the barning [sic] of 
Chambersburg, by Gen. McCausland, has been received in the loyal States, 
serves to show the appreciation in which all such acts on vandalism are 
justly held, however reserved may have been its expressions when the 
outrage was committed by our troops in the South.  When Bluffton, in 
South Carolina, and Darien, in Georgia, and Alexandria, La., and 
Washington, N.C., were burned by our forces, there were not wanting those 
in the loyal States who deplored these several acts of wantonness or 
callousness as unworthy of honorable and christian warfare: but, partly 
from the remoteness of the scene of such wrong doing and partly from a 
languid sense of indignation in all that concerns the misfortunes if the 
enemy, there was no very vivid or universal feeling on the subject.  And 
we do not doubt that in the Confederate States there will be found 
multitudes who will unthinkingly applaud the burning of Chambersburg as an 
act of righteous retaliation, if not commendable in itself.
<p>We do not need to say to our readers that all such deeds of 
barbarians, whether committed by one side or the other, fix a stigma of 
disgrace upon our national character; and if any have been unable to 
realize the atrocity of these excesses so long as they were exclusively 
committed by our troops, it is to be hoped that their native heinousness 
will be clearly perceived in the light of the burning homes of 
Chambersburg, and that for the credit of the national name, we shall not 
be called to chronicle such horrors in the future progress of the war.
