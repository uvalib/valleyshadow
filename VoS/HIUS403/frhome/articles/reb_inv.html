<center>A Visit to the Front lines of Battlefield.</center>

<p><i>[From the Washington Chronicle, July 14]</i>
<p>  I proceeded north of Fort Stevens on the seventh street road 
half-a-mile, when I came to the ruins of the residence of Mr. Lay of the 
city post office, which was destroyed day before yesterday by shell from 
Fort Stevens to prevent the sharp shooters from occupying it.  A little 
north of this depleted stop are the ruins of the residence of Mr. 
Carberry, which was also destroyed by our cannonball.  Near this place I 
came upon the new made grave of an unknown cavalry man.  Still further 
north and a mile from Fort Stevens, I came to a fence thrown across the 
road, and occupied as a breastwork by the rebels the day previous.  Here 
were marks of hard fighting; Union and rebel muskets, broken and 
unbroken, and thrown aside by their owners, hay piled in a heap by the 
way; while hats, caps, haversacks, pouches, and thousands of 
cartridge sand bullets were scattered here and there on both sides of the 
rebel  breastworks and among the rifle pits dug by the Union soldiers in 
a field near by.  Every rail on the fence and the tree show well the work 
which has been dine the east few hours in that vicinity.  While I was 
looking on the scene a squad of Union Calvary passed on the way from the 
front, escorting [?] rebel captures, covered with dust and apparently 
worn out with constant traveling and hard service.  I proceeded on my 
way, and visited the residences of Dr. S. Heath and Captain 
Richardson-Here was a scary picture.  Hearing of the approach of the 
rebels on Monday morning, they removed the female members of their 
families to the fort, and before they could return the rebels had 
possession of the premises.  Everything about the place is scattered in 
great confusion.  What clothing could be made use if the rebels exchanged 
for their less attractive suits.  The building is badly shattered by our 
artillery fire.  Eight common balls or shells had passed through one side 
to the other and the doors, windows, and side boards are filled with 
bullet marks.  In the field south of this house are the graves of eleven 
rebel dead, and in a corn field on the opposite side if the way fifteen 
other rebel soldiers rest from their destructive work.  In a grove on the 
opposite from Mr. Blair's residence, was found a book (the eighth volume  
Byron's works) tacked by a rebels, which I have brought with me, and 
transcribes the following inscription, while which is written on a fly-leaf:

Now, Uncle Abe, you had better be quiet the balance of your 
administration.  We only come near your town this time just to show what 
we could do-but if you go on in your mad career we will come again soon, 
and then you had better stand from under.<br>
<align=right>Yours, respectfully,<br>
The Worst Reb you ever saw.<br>
FIFTY-EIGHT VIRGINIA INFANTRY.<br>
<p>Late in the afternoon, tired and foot sore, I turned my steps 
homeward.  Part of the way to the fort, I was in company with two members 
of the One Hundred and Fiftieth Ohio volunteer militia, one hundred days 
men, who seemed quite indignant at the idea of other companies and 
batteries receiving all the honor of the firing from Fort Stevens, when, 
in truth, Company K, of their regiment, was the most active in the work 
performed at the fort, and did the most damage to the rebels.  Let them 
brave the credit, for the work was well done.  At Fort Stevens I met a 
citizen of Maryland, who resides sixteen miles northeast of the city, 
near Colesville, and from whom I gleaned much reliable information.  The 
rebels made their appearance at Colesville about four or five o'clock in 
the afternoon of Monday last, and my informant understood from what he 
could learn that the rebel force on the northside
