<p>They appeared to have adopted a systematcally arranged plan for 
burning the town by firing in regular otder from the center to the 
suburbs.  The first house fired was alarge unfinished building, belongin 
to Mr. Peter Brough, situated a few doors fown from the Diamond.  It was 
full of combustible material, over which they poured coal-on and applied 
the torch.  It soon had the surrounding houses and the Arcade Buildings 
opposite in flames.  The next place fired was the Grocery Store of Mr. 
Wm. Gelwicks on the Diamond and about the same time the Court House, and 
in ten minutes after after flames were seen to insue from almost everu 
house along Main and Market streets.  No person can describe the scene of 
terror and confuscion that ensue among the inhabitants.  No warning was 
given the people to leave their houses and the first intimaton they had 
that private dwellings would be burned was the smashing of their doors 
and hearing their houses filled with infuriated rebels, still more has
