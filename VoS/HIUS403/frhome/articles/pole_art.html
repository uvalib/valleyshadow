<p>An ineffectual attempt was made several weeks since to erect a pole in 
the Diamond from which to float the old flag, and which failed on account 
of the breaking of the derrick.-The committee, having the matter in 
charge, immediately went to work to procure another which was successfully 
raised on  Tuesday a week, and the starts and stripes now float 
gracefully from an elevation of 180 feet.  The pole is 150 feet in height, octagon 
shaped at the butt, painted white, and is to stayed and braced as to defy 
the power of the storm.
<p>The pole is quite an ornament to the town and reflects much credit on 
Capt. Sollenberger and the committee of superintendence.
