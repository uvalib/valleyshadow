<b>THE BURNING OF CHAMBERSBURG</b>
<hr width=40>
Preliminary Remarks
<hr width=40>
<table width=480><tr><td>
<p>It is not our purpose to go into any minute details of the 
circumstances of our once beautiful and happy town.  So thick and fast do 
extraordinary events transpire that the Burning of Chambersburg is 
already an old story-save to those who passed through the ordeal of that 
dreadful day.  From their minds its horrors can never be effaced.-There 
are, however, some circumstances connected with this unparalled act of 
vandalism that we deem most important to notice in order to correct 
injurious impressions abroad in regard to the position of our citizens in 
the affair; and also to show up the military "situation" at the 
Headquarters of the Department of the Susquehanna at the date of occurrence.
