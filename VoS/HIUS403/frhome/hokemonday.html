As the events of stirring interest are now to be narrated, I will resume 
the daily summary style, and will commence with -
<p><i>Monday, June 15</i>
<p>On this day we witnessed the greatest excitement which had occurred up 
to that point in all the history of the war.  Early in the morning 
farmers residing in the southern portion of our county, began to pass 
through the town and on down the Harrisburg pike with their stock and 
valuables.  The road was crowded with wagons, horses, and cattle.  Then 
came large numbers of colored persons, men, women, and children, bearing 
with them large bundles of clothing, bedding, and articles of 
house-keeping.  Many of these had come from the valley of Virginia, while 
a few were residents of our own county and the neighboring county of 
Washington, in Maryland.  About ten o'clock forty or fifty wagons, drawn 
by horses and mules, came dashing down Main Street.  They were attended 
by a few calvary, and the affrighted drivers were lashing the poor jaded 
brutes attached to the wagons.  They declared that the enemy were in 
close pursuit; that a large part of the train had been captured, and that 
the dreaded foe were about to enter Chambersburg.  These wagons were a 
part of Colonel McReynold's train, which Jenkins'calvary had pursued from 
Berryville, and across the Potomac at Williamsport the afternoon before.  
As they came dashing down our street, drivers alternately lashing the 
poor animals and looking back to see if the enemy were in sight, the 
scenes of terror and confusion were perfectly terrific.  Near the corner 
of Main and Queen Streets one of the horses dropped dead from 
exhaustion.  It is said that all along the road from the Potomac to this 
place wrecked wagons and broken down horses and mules were left by the 
way.  When passing through the public square of this place at head-long 
speed, Lieutenant Palmer, on provost duty here, observing the needless 
panic, drew his revolver and ordered the teamsters to halt.  His order 
was obeyed, and from Chambersburg to Carlisle the teams were driven at a 
moderate pace.  At that place they were taken in hand by the military 
authorities, and subsequently removed beyond the Susquehanna.
<p>	The arrival of this train and the information it brought of the 
approach of the foe, naturally gave a fresh impetus to the citizens of 
Chambersburg, and the rush from the town in the direction of Harrisburg 
assumed larger proportions, while those who remained in their homes-by 
much the larger number-waited in much suspense for the arrival of the 
enemy.  
<p>	At an early hour in the evening of this day, information was 
received of the approach of Jenkins' troops, and about eleven o'clock at 
night they reached the southern end of the town.  Some six or eight were 
sent forward into the town to reconnoiter, and about two hundred more 
were detailed to make a rapid change after this small force, and these 
were soon followed by the balance of the command - about two thousand in 
all. 
<p>	Seated at an open window in the second story of my residence, 
overlooking the public square, and listening for the approaching enemy, I 
at length heard the clatter of horses' feet coming rapidly down main 
street.  When opposite the residnce of Mr. H.M. White,-but a short 
distance from the public square- the report of a gun was heard.  Almost 
simultaneously with the report of this gun, some four or five calvarymen 
rode into the square.  In the
darkness-the gas in front of the bank building only having been left 
burning-
they became separated, and one of them, evidently the officer in command of
the squad, who had ridden over near the bank, called out in a peculiarly
southern tone, "Hawkins! Hawkins I say, Hawkins, whar in the --- are 
you?" If
Lieutenant Smith -for such was his name, as will appear shortly -had
called upon two of our gallant young men, John A. Seiders and T. M. Mahon,
instead of his Satanic majesty, he might have received tile information 
he so
earnestly desired, for they were having a little matter of business with 
his
friend "Hawkins " across the square and near the court -house at that
time. But Lieutenant Smith's anxiety for his friend was soon relieved, 
for on
his going across the square to ascertain what had become of him, he fell 
into
the hands of Seiders, and soon thereafter joined the object of his 
solicitude, both of them, however, dismounted and disarmed.  Following 
this call for his  
absent comrade, the officer again called out, "Whar's the<i> mayaw</I> of
this
town? I say, whar's the <i>mayaw</i> of this town? If the<i> mayaw</i> does
not come here in five minutes
we will burn the town!" The "Mayaw" not responding to this urgent call, the
officer rode across the square to the front of the court-house, where he was
captured by Seiders. In a short time after the capture of Lieutenant Smith,
the two hundred detailed to follow the reconnoitering party, came
thundering down the street, followed after a short interval by the remainder
of the command. Some few remained in the town, but the larger part passed on
down and out by the Harrisburg pike, and after picketing the various roads,
encamped about one mile out. General Jenkins, with his staff, went to the
residence of Colonel A. K. McClure, which stood upon the place where Wilson
Female College now stands, -the fine building which stood there at that
time having been burned in the destruction of our town by McCausland a year
afterward. After partaking of a bountiful supper prepared for them, the 
honors
of the table being royally done by the colonel's accomplished wife-the
colonel himself being prudently absent -lay down to rest for the night.
Leaving Jenkins and his staff so comfortably quartered for the night in 
Mr. McClure's mansion, and their horses picketed in his clover fields, we 
will   
return to town and detail what occurred there during the entrance of the
reconnoitering party.<p>
        As the scouts came galloping down Main street, with their carbines
cocked and leveled, the darkness prevented them from seeing a mortar-bed
and some piles of stone and sand in front of Mr. H. M. White's residence then
in process of building, and one of the horses stumbled and fell throwing its
rider headlong into the mortar -bed. The fall caused his carbine to go off,
and he, as well as his comrades, supposed that a citizen had fired upon them.
Simultaneously with the report of tile carbine, Mr. J. S.Brand, then residing
in a house near by, threw open the shutters of a second story window in his
house to see what was transpiring in the street. A cavalryman, then
opposite this house, hearing the report of the gun and the opening of the
shutters, cried out that the shot came. from that window. In a short time,
after the arrival of the other cavalrymen, a number of them, piloted by the
one who averred that the shot came from Mr. Brand's house, went to the
place and knocked at the door demanding admittance, and declaring the purpose
of hanging the. man that fired the shot. Mrs. Brand, becoming greatly alarmed
for her husband's safety, urged him to go up into the attic and hide himself.
At length, to gratify his wife, Mr. Brand complied, but finding his 
hiding-place under the roof to be very warm, and concluding that if the 
house 
was searched and he was found secreted, their suspicions. would be confirmed,
he came forth determined to face the issue. But as the cavalrymen were
yet at the door clamoring for entrance and threatening to break it in, he at
length at the urgent solicitude of his wife, went into hisback yard and crept
into a bake-oven and drew to its iron door. But if the attic was warm,
the oven was hot, for it. had been used that same day to bake bread. After
shifting himself from one hand and knee to the other until he could 
endure it
no longer, he once more came forth to brave the foe. Before it was quite
daylight a member of Mr. John Jeffries' family, who lived adjoining, came 
over
to Mr. Brand's and said that the rebels were all about the house waiting for
daylight, and declaring their purpose to search it and hang the person
found in it. These ladies,, Mrs. Brand and Miss Jeffries, then hit upon the
expedient of disguising Mr. Brand and having him leave the house.
Accordingly, they arrayed him in one of Mrs. Brand's dresses, and a large
flowing sun-bonnet was put on his head to hide his beard. In this disguise
Mr. Brand went out of his back door, passed up his lot in the presence of the
enemy, and crossed over to the residence of Mr. Jeffries where he was 
disrobed
and where he had no further trouble with the enemy. The situation of Mr. 
Brand
was an alarming one, and he availed himself of the only means of escape 
which presented itself; and for this he was indebted to the ingenuity of 
women.<p>
	Shortly after the entrance of the advance guard into the public square
one of the cavalry-men rode up to John A. Seiders and T. M. Mahon, as they
stood upon the courthouse pavement, and inquired of them in what 
direction the
remainder of the squad had gone? These two men had just returned home from
service in the army, and they determined to try their hands on that fellow.
Neither of them were armed, but Mahon, using a piece of a plastering lath
which he held in his hand as a sword, seized hold of one of the reins of the
bridle, and Seiders the other, and quietly demanded his surrender. He at once
dismounted, and his sabre and pistol -the other being taken by Seiders -were
at once taken by Mahon, who quickly mounted the horse and rode rapidly out
Market Street to Third, up Third to Queen, and down Queen to the markethouse,
into which he entered. While there a party of cavalry -men rode down Second
Street toward Market, and Mahon, as soon as they had passed, started out east
Queen at a rapid gait. Near the eastern point, at the junction of Queen and
Washington streets he encountered a squad who called upon him to halt,
but he fled on out the Gettysburg pike towards Fayetteville. At Downey's,
some four miles distant, he turned from the pike and proceeded to
Scotland,  where, on the next day, he gave the horse into the care of a 
friend, and after witnessing the destruction of the railroad-bridge at 
that place 
place, he eluded the pickets and returned on foot to Chambersburg and
reported the destruction of the bridge to the railroad officials.
Finding, however, that the Confederates had secured his name, and were on the
built of him, he, after having been for some time hid in the house of his law
preceptor, William McClellan, Esq., left and sought refuge in safer quarters.
Mr. Mahon, to whom I am indebted for this account, desires to present his
compliments to Mr. George Hawkins, should lie be yet living and see this
statement, and to assure him that tile saddle, carbine, and case of 
medicines,
borrowed of him under such pressing circumstances, have been safely kept, and
he will be happy to return them to him now that  "this cruel war is over."
Immediately after the departure of Mahon with his prize -the Confederate
having been handed over to several other persons who came upon the scene, and
who started to conduct him to the jail, but released him when they found that
they were likely to be caught, - another cavalry-man rode up to where
Seiders was standing, and inquired what had become of bis couirade, Hawkins.
Seiders now being armed with one of the captured pistols, presented it and
demanded his surrender. To this demand be at once complied and
dismounted. Seiders quickly disarmed him, and taking his sabre, pistols, and
spurs, mounted his horse and rode rapidly out east Market street. 
At Market and Second streets he encountered the head of the column 
which       
had passed the market - house while Mahon was in it. To their command to halt
he paid no attention, but put his captured animal upon its speed and
galloped out to Fayetteville. Arriving at that place he took an inventory of
his capture, and it was found to be as follows: A valuable horse, saddle,
bridle, four blankets rolled up and fastened behind the saddle, two fine
pistols, sabre and belt, and a pair of saddle-bags, containing a dress coat,
two shirts, a Testament, a pack of cards, a package of love letters, some
smoking tobacco and other articles. Mr. Seiders also desires to present his
compliments to Lieutenant Smith, and to assure him that he would be
delighted once more to meet him, and return to him whatever of these articles
he has preserved. From Fayetteville Mr. Seiders proceeded down through
Cumberland county to Harrisburg, and dressed inthe captured Confederate
uniform, and mounted upon his captured horse, he did excellent scouting
service during the invasion.  I return now from this extended but
interesting digression to our main narrative, and will detail the events
