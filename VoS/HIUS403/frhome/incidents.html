<center><h1>The Events and Incidents of the Burning</h1></center>
<hr width=240>
<p>What exactly transpired on the streets of Chambersburg on July 30th 
may never truly be known.  Each participant and observer of the burning 
recounted the episode slightly differently.  Surely some of the accounts 
simply vary due to confusion, but in each, an agenda can be seen.  From 
the victims to the victors, each person recasts the busy morning in the 
most convenient and comfortable manner: to make the enemy look worse while 
defending one's actions.  A careful comparison and analysis of various accounts
 will yield the most balanced and comprehensive version of the burning. 
<p>McCausland and his Confederate troops pushed through Maryland and Pennsylvania 
territory through the clear night of July 29th.  The men were exhausted from 
the continuos marching and riding and having not slept for two days.  They 
made a rest stop in Mercersburg to feed their horses and regroup the cavalry shortly after 
sunset. Their advance had been slowed down by a small regiment of Federal 
cavalry under Gen. McLean.  The regiment had successfully slowed down the 
Confederates long enough for the last trains, filled with supplies and 
equipment, to leave Chambersburg.  All of the town's bankers also 
evacuated the town, taking with them the Chambersburg cash reserves.  
While many local residents resigned themselves to the belief that the 
Rebels wouldn't actually make it to Pennsylvania, the bankers 
demonstrated this fiscal mindedness by not taking any chances. 
<p>At 3 am, the first Confederate invaders reached the outskirts of 
Chambersburg.  The small force under Gen. Couch quickly withdrew from the city,
 not willing to provide the Confederates with an excuse to destroy the city.  
A battery of artillery consisting of four cannons was positioned on the hilltops 
above the town.
 The cannons announced the arrival of the Confederates to the sleeping 
residents at 5 am with a round of shots over the town.  As the sun rose 
over the Pennsylvania hills, the 8th regiment dismounted and lead the march 
into town.  Soon, over eight hundred rebels occupied the streets.
<p>Citizens were rounded up by the troops and the Courthouse bell was rung 
to call people to the center of town, the "Diamond".  Adjunct-General 
Fitzhugh presented the few citizens in the Courthouse square with a 
written order from Gen. Early demanding $500,000 in US currency, 
or $100,000 in gold.  The stunned residents responded by saying that 
<a href=rc080664.html> "it was impossible to raise that amount."</a>  
By this time McCausland had ridden down into the town and was 
personally handling the operation.  According 
to Rev. Schenck, after no money was raised, he ordered <a 
href=http://nmc.itc.virginia.edu/hist403/claims_search.cfm>Thomas B.Kennedy, 
William McLellan, J. McDowell Sharpe, and others</a> to be arrested in 
attempt to force payment.  
<p>Clearly an impasse had been reached.  The residents could pay but 
appeared to not even take the ransom seriously.  <a 
href="moore_account.html">J. Moore, a Virginia Cavalry, thought the 
residents "seemed to think we were jesting and bluffing</a>."  At this 
point McCausland gave them a deadline to pay the money.  The duration of 
this break varies greatly.  Rev. Schenck states it was only 20 minutes, 
McCausland states it was "six hours."  Since the first troops didn't 
arrive into town until 7 am and all of the troops had left by 
noon, it was likely around 2 hours.
<p>At the expiration of the deadline, McCausland ordered brigades to fire 
the town.  For one hour, the squad set buildings, homes, and businesses on 
fire.  
Franklin county accounts tend to exaggerate the exact method in which this 
was done.  Schenck describes the firing as a violent operation: breaking 
down 
doors, taking personal possessions, and threatening residents with guns.  
Confederate accounts concede that there was some atrocious behavior and 
that some troops may have gotten out of control; however, on the whole, it 
seemed to them a 
controlled affair.  These Confederates also disclaim accounts of mass 
drinking and intoxication by the soldiers.  This was still a military 
operation in enemy territory, and it seems unlikely that the whole rebel 
force would be allowed by their commanders to drink themselves into a 
drunken stupor.  
<p>Not all of the Confederate troops followed their orders to burn the 
consciencious objector was<a href=mccausland.html> Colonel W. E. 
Peters </a>,who was a 
regiment commander under General Johnson.  He refused to obey the order and 
threatened to break his sword before burning the town.  Many of the 
Northern accounts include this noble southern gentleman to demonstrate 
the inhumanity of the burning.  Peters was arrested, but the next day 
returned to his command.
<p><img src=images/court_thm.jpg align=left>The burning was concentrated in 
the middle of the town, around 
the Diamond.  All of the large buildings were destroyed, including the 
court house.  Many of the destroyed buildings were along Main Street.  One 
burned home was notably removed from the center.  A mile away, local 
recognized  <a href=bios.html#mcclure>A. K. McClure</a> resided in Norland.
McClure had apparently angered Confederate General Jenkin for comments in 
<i>The Franklin Repository</i>.  A detachment was sent to burn it down.  
This 
was pure retaliation on a very personal level.  The firing squad actually 
was confused and went to the Eysters, who lived down the street from 
McClure.  Mr. Eyster politely noted that his was not Norland and the 
squad moved on.  
<p>If some were singled out for retaliation, others were singled out for 
protection.  The night before the burning, an order was sent from Early to 
McCausland not to burn down <a href=images/kennedy1.jpg>Rev. Kennedy's 
</a> home.  Other ministers in town were not so fortunate to have a 
benefactor such as Early. Father McCullom was robbed of his watch while 
sitting on his porch.  The watch was a replacement for another one that 
was taken in the previous raid.
<p>Massive petty theft most likely occurred, based on the sheer number and 
strength of details.  There are numerous accounts in Rev. Schenck's book 
about Confederate soldiers going into houses or robbing people on the 
street at gunpoint.  People were robbed of their clothes, shoes, watches, 
and money.  Mrs. McClure had here fine silver plates and pitchers taken 
while her home was being burned.  A few widows were able to save their 
homes and possessions by paying soldiers $25 for protection.   
<p>As the huge columns of smoke and fire enveloped the town, the 
Confederates finally pulled back.  While there were horrific stories of 
disabled 
people being locked in burning homes, or women forced to bring back 
possessions into their burning homes, no Chambersburg resident was killed 
during the incident.  The only person to be killed was a straggling 
Confederate who was caught by a group of angry of residents with stolen 
property after the rest of the troops had left.  
<p>The Confederates left the town at midday and a few hours later 
Averell's army made it into to town.  By that time, McCausland had led 
his troops in Hancock, Maryland, and had levied yet another ransom.
