JUNE 8

Cold the past few days. Made fire and it felt comfortable. To the bank a 
few hours, spent the rest of the day at home reading
and writing. Col. McClure received a dispatch that we might be subject to 
a raid soon. The bank has sent its most valuable
papers off to Philadelphia for safe keeping. Nothing has been confirmed 
to the Rebels positions south of us, but speculation is
rife and everyone uneasy. 


JUNE 11

Cloudy. B. Wolff and myself spent a couple hours in the Lutheran 
graveyard where an interment was being made. This
churchyard is in much disarray and scattered about. Many of the graves 
are lost thru negligence of friends and the church. Part
of John Maderia's family is in one place, and part in another. A Mr. 
Humphrie's lay beside Mary Maderia, then John Maderia.
Then a stone with the inscription, "Our Sister". This was Catherine 
Maderia, one of their daughters who was a little backward,
and received little attention from the family. She was kept out of 
society and led a life with the servants. I knew her well in my
boyhood days by the name of Kit. I believe the sin of this injustice was 
visited upon the rest of the family, for none of them
prospered in life. Reading her epitaph finds only the word Sister, 
someone who knew her history wrote beneath in pencil,
"When my Father and Mother forsake me, the Lord will take me up" May she 
have that rest beyond this life, which was
denied in this. 

This evening attended a meeting of the lodge where some degrees were 
confirmed by strangers from New York. Remained
until about ten, then home. 


JUNE 13

To my mountain land. Found my man has done little work. The ride is 
beautiful and enjoyed my walk up thru the glade,a most
delightful spot, full of nature's beauty. It is an hour and a half ride 
home. Feel greatly relieved from my anxieties, taking this little
excursion. Rain all evening. More talk of an impending invasion of our 
valley. 


JUNE 14

Clear and unpleasant. Reports of an engagement near Winchester. Our town 
in an uproar. Government property being loaded
up and taken away. The drum calls for volunteers. 

All the army stores have been packed up and sent to Philadelphia. Little 
attendance at church and Sabbath School. Much of
the news is false we hear, but it serves to upset the people. We all feel 
Pennsylvania will be invaded. Many families are hiding
their valuables, and preparing for the worst. Some preparing to leave 
town. Tonight we have many sleepless eyes, the houses
all shut up tightly, but the inmates astir. 

The stores are packing up their goods and sending them off, people are 
running to and fro. Cashier Messersmith is sent off
with the books of the bank and its valuables. The cars are crowded to 
utmost capacity. The colored people are flying in all
directions. There is a complete state of confusion. 

After twelve we got word the Rebels have entered Hagerstown. The stores 
are all closed, and the streets crowded with those
that can't leave. I am urged to leave. As President of the bank, might be 
held responsible for its assets, which I doubt, anyhow
I shall stay to defend my property best I can. 

At 8 o'clock a number of contrabands entered our town, fleeing from 
Martinsburg with the Rebels not far behind. These were
followed by a wagon train, many on three wheels, and less being dragged 
and pushed as fast as possible. The street is
crowded with horses and wagons, all in the wildest state of confusion. 
Upon asking one of them as to their plight, said the
Rebels are not far behind. 

Suddenly about two hundred more wagons, horses, mules, and contrabands 
all came pouring down the street in full flight.
Some of them holloring the Rebels are behind us. Such a sight I have 
never seen, or will never see again. The whole town is on
the sidewalks screaming, crying, and running about. They know not where. 

The road into town is almost impassable by the teamsters cutting loose 
their wagons and fleeing with their horses. This further
jammed up our town, some of the horses fall in the streets from shere 
exhaustion. One soldier was killed by the fall. After the
panic subdues, the teamsters that had cut loose their wagons went back 
for them. At twelve the excitement is beyond
conception. I am again urged to leave. Mr. T.B. Kennedy sent me a 
message, feeling it was a good idea. I have consented
against my will-packing up my valuable papers and at two, left with Mrs. 
Heyser in my buggy, for Carlisle, committing the
house to William, Proctor my colored man, and girl. After I left they did 
not stay,but put off for the mountains. Had difficulty
passing the wagon jam on the road and answering questions, arriving at 
Stoughs town about 6 in the evening, where I shall
wait for news. About midnight, awakened by the news that the Rebels were 
at Shippensburg. Dressing, we immediately left for
Carlisle at midnight, being so dark and the roads jammed with wagons, 
made dangerous situation that I regretted leaving home
in the first place. However, thanks to Almighty Providence, we arrived 
safely in Carlisle about 4 o'clock in the morning. Tried
to get more sleep, but impossible, excitement here is mounting. 

We got a bite to eat, the horse fed, and left for Harrisburg. All along 
the way the news had preceded us, people out securing
and leaving with their goods. Driving away their horses, and all shops 
shut up. 

Stopped in Mechanicsburg, a prosperous, but now excited town, to learn of 
fortifications being made for Harrisburg. We were
advised to stay here, but decided to press on. On approaching Harrisburg, 
I could see the fortifications with a large number of
men working on them. The railroad cars were filled with troops on their 
way to Chambersburg with artillary. We crossed the
river without difficulty and found Harrisburg, in wildest confusion. 
Merchants shipping away their goods, families their furniture,
and people fleeing in all directions. Almost laughable scenes some 
created. 

Stopped at Harris's Hotel. See few females, mostly men moving furniture 
and stores, the streets are almost impassable. The
excitement is greater than Chambersburg. All the records of the state 
have been removed under the expectation that
Harrisburg will be burned. Our state is doing nothing to defend itself 
against invasion. Gov. Curtain seems to be paralized and
unable to act. We need decisions badly, and can't expect them from 
Washington. 


JUNE 17

Very warm. The city is filling with volunteers and delegates to the 
Democratic Convention. Rumors from Chambersburg that
our ships and stores have all been plundered and that the public building 
may be burned that houses army stores. Appeals
made to the Gov. for troops to protect the state, but unheeded. My 
son-in-law, J.A. Eyster, came this afternoon from
Philadelphia. Reports my daughter, Elizabeth and the children well. News 
that the Rebels have left for Hagerstown, after
having done a minimum of damage to the town. 


JUNE 18

Warm. The Rebels have left Chambersburg taking with them about 250 
colored people again into bondage. Gov. Curtain is
presently very unpopular. Left Harrisburg for home about two o'clock, in 
the afternoon, by way of the turnpike. Traveling thru
very beautiful and fertile countryside. Had tea in Carlisle, pressed on 
for Stoughs town to spend the night. Here we
encountered many colored people fleeing the Rebels, as not all have left 
the area. These poor people are completely worn out,
carrying their families on their backs. Saw some twenty from Chambersburg 
that I recognized. Some men from Shippensburg
urged us to turn back, that danger was not past, but we decided to press 
on, even though the night was black, stormy, and the
road dangerous. We were glad to see the lamps of Carlisle. Little did we 
know of the perils that had been in our way,
Almighty Providence led us thru safely. It will be a journey my wife and 
I will never forget. I suggested she write a book about
our adventurous journey. Weary and tired, we went to bed. 


JUNE 19

Pleasant, heavy rain thru the night. Much rumor-one knows not what to 
believe. All is still alarm. The stores are still all closed
and business at a standstill. Unexpectedly met my man, Proctor, who had 
made for the mountains, worked his way to
Newville from where he got to Carlisle. Of Fanny, our colored girl, he 
knew nothing. 

The papers are now calling for McClelland's recall. Without him we cannot 
succeed. 

Troops are coming in from neighboring states to support our few that we 
can bring some order to our situation. It is ridiculous
that 800 Rebel troops can paralize the Southern portion of our state 
without opposition. This invasion had been expected for
months, and totally ignored by our government. 


JUNE 20

Cloudy. Left for Shippensburg where we found things much in panic as 
before. Large stampedes of men and horses from all
parts of the country. Dreadful accounts that the Rebels are still active 
about Chambersburg, and are robbing and stealing as
before. How much of this is true, I cannot say as in times as these, 
exaggeration is rife. Each small episode is magnified a
thousand times. 

Decided to stay overnite in Shippensburg. Rained very hard. The town is 
packed with people. I luckily found a bed for my
wife and I. A New York regiment stopped here very disgusted as they had 
yet to see a Pennsylvania Company on the job.
One I talked with said, "Dam your State, we came here to protect it, 
where are your Pennsylvania soldiers!" If they don't soon
appear, we shall go home. 


SABBATH, JUNE 21

Cloudy. Rose early, about four, to get an early start. Road almost 
deserted. The New York Regiment encamped a short
distance from Shippensburg, along the road. Arrived at home little after 
six, found my house still, silent, and musty. I never felt
so lonely, sitting in my own house without anything to eat and no one 
about. Mrs. Fisher invited us over to have breakfast, a
kindness we shall not forget. Never again, under any circumstances, shall 
I leave my home again. Just about Sabbath School
time, the town thrown into another state of confusion, that a column of 
Rebels were advancing. This proved to be just a poor
man leading a few horses in town from his farm. So it goes, what is fact 
and fancey, we continued with our worship, the
excitement subsided. 

In the evening, troops came in from New York for our protection. Reports 
that the Rebels are in Greencastle. I feel certain
that Lee will bring his army into Pennsylvania. 


JUNE 22

Clear. Troops arriving from Harrisburg. Four Dalgreen pieces of ordinance 
arrive and taken out to the end of town to be set
up. The citizens have formed a few companies for defense, but how 
effective could they be? 

More troops have arrived, perhaps a thousand here now. We breathe a 
little easier. 

Our hopes are short lived. The troops have all been recalled to 
Shippensburg, the small battery is run out of town. Excitement
is again intense in town. 

A meeting is held of prominent men, to face the enemy, if they should 
come and surrender the town on the best terms we can
get. Again these is a general stampede to leave town with valuables. The 
road to Shippensburg is again packed with fleeing
citizens. There is not a Negro to be seen in town. At 11 o'clock, the 
streets are deserted. I did not go to bed till about one. All
is quiet, but it is a sleepless town. 


JUNE 23

Clear. Rose early. A small local cavalry force rode out, but soon 
returned. Wagons were sent out to secure the tents and
baggage the New York volunteers left behind in their flight to 
Shippensburg. 

Our squads of cavalry are leaving, a bad sign. We soon find out as we 
make our observations behind drawn shutters. A large
squad was seen advancing at the German Reformed Church, coming down the 
street, filling the whole space, moving at a slow
pace, their guns in position, ready for instant firing in case of attack. 
About 300 entered the town as cavalry, the others took
up positions in fields in sight of town. Those entering proceded to the 
public square where they immediately cut down the
telegraph wires at all points. After this they placed pickets at all 
points to prevent surprise. 

Our Committee met them and given to understand private property would be 
respected, but they were to furnish provisions for
1,500 men. The Rebels behave very well. Not a citizen molested or a house 
visited. We complied very well with their
demands. This afternoon they opened the warehouse of J. Allison Eyster, 
and made off with $4,000.00 worth of bacon, salt,
beans, coffee, crackers, etc. They also opened the warehouse of Oaks & 
Linn, and took almost 300 barrels of flour belonging
to Jacob Stouffer. They broke in the heads of 20 barrels of whiskey, 
which they poured out. At Miller's Drug Store, they
poured a barrel of brandy into the gutter. Captain Fitzhugh gave orders 
that if any of his men were caught molesting a citizen,
they would be severely punished. I must admit they were a thoroughly 
disciplined lot of men. 

About 4 o'clock they moved towards Shippensburg, leaving a guard on the 
wagons behind. At 9 they returned with their
artillery to their camp at the South end of town. We don't understand 
their plans. Neither do we understand why the State
hoards all those soldiers about Harrisburg, leaving the Southern portion 
to the invaders. 


JUNE 24

Clear. The Rebels are active. They have closely kept plans, something is 
afoot. I was notified that a meeting with the principal
citizens was requested to hear their demands. 

     5,000 Suits of clothing, boots, hats 
     100 Good saddles

          W.L. Hauks 
          Major Com 

We stated that they already had nearly all these things, there being 
nothing left to do but strip us all of everything. About 9
o'clock Ewell's corps passed through, probably some 10,000 men with an 
immense train of artillary and army wagons. Among
them many farm wagons and teams they acquired along the way. The men 
looked well, but lacked uniforms, being an array of
all shades and colors. No two hats alike, and their shoes could hardly be 
called that. It was hard to distinguish the officers from
the men, except those of high rank. They sang and cheered lustily as they 
marched along. About two, the pillage of our stores
began. Not a place escaped, never in the history of our boro was there 
such a scene. The merchants were compelled to pack
up the wagons with their goods, which is being sent to Richmond. The 
streets are crowded with Rebels who try to interrogate
our lessor citizens as to where things are hidden or sent to, and also as 
to the movements of the Federal troops that had left.
By now, all of our stores have been ransacked. 

My neighbor, Widow Murphy, who kept a small store, dispensing Queens Ware 
and shoes, nothing of value to the Rebels,
did succeed in having her place exempt from being robbed. Some of the 
Rebel officers were very considerate. 

My son's mill and warehouse has suffered much from confiscation for which 
they gave him $800.00 in Confederate script. I
hear my tenant farmer, Thos. Miller, was shot at while plowing his corn. 
I have felt much concern for him, but cannot get thru
the line. 


JUNE 25

Clear and warm. All quiet until about 9 o'clock when the locusts begin to 
swarm again. On each side of the street, they stop
and make further requisitions. There isn't much left to take. All 
businessmen suffer--Eyster brothers, Myers and Brand, Huber
and Tolbert, Sol. Huber, Gelwix, James Shaffer, D.S. Fahnestock Dittmann, 
Metcalf, I. Hutton, James Hutton, Feltman, Croft
and Miller, W. Heyser, Miller and Hemsley, Nixon, these were the 
principal losers. 

This afternoon brings much activity among the Rebels. Evidently new 
orders have been directed as they are packing up and
securing their stolen goods as fast as possible. Officers are riding off 
in all directions. 

At seven, we have reports of a skirmish near Carlisle driving back the 
Rebels. Jenkins, Ewell, and Rhodes have returned to
Chambersburg with the intention of crossing over to Gettysburg The drums 
beat-calling their men to camp and hunting the
stragglers. All indications point to readiness for a march. Tonight there 
is not a Rebel to be seen. We are not sure what caused
the move, we do know large forces were now built up in Harrisburg, ready 
to march South. McClelland is supposed to be
there, but so far Washington refuses to use him, politics being behind 
this. With his skill and knowledge, the war could have
been ended but the power in Washington will not admit him. The streets 
tonight are deserted and still. Not a soldier to be seen
except the posted sentinels. I remained up until one. 


JUNE 26

Cloudy and raining. All is quiet. Few soldiers seen on the streets until 
after breakfast, when the advancing corps of Gen.
Johnston appears with waving flags and stirring music, as they approach 
the public square. Three cheers went up for the
Southern Confederacy. They passed on column after column, for hours. Next 
their batteries, army wagons, and ambulances,
presenting a fearful sight. I have mixed feelings of indignation and 
humility. The passage of the army created a consternation
among the people. Many feel all is lost, after seeing this show of power 
in the face of our inadequate defense. 

At about three o'clock, the rear of Johnston's corps is passed, making 
about 15,000 men, rank and file, 72 pieces of
ordinance, 350 wagons, about a regiment is left to guard the town. The 
large school building has been taken by them for a
hospital. Requisitions have been made on all the innkeepers for 
mattresses, blankets, quilts, sheets, etc. for the Rebel sick and
wounded. It is expected the like orders will be given the citizens. This 
evening a part of their army has advanced near the town
on the Baltimore Pike, and on the Western Pike, occupying the fairground. 

They say they have entered upon a desperate enterprise,and will make 
Pennsylvania the battleground, instead of Virginia, that
they will conquer or die! All say the heaviest battle of the war will be 
fought in this Valley. We all tremble as we have no news
from the outside, being completely cut off. 

Portions of the Cumberland Valley and Franklin Railroads have been torn 
up. The bridge at Scotland, just rebuilt, has again
been demolished. 


SATURDAY, JUNE 27

The Rebel troops commence their forward movement and continue without 
interruption until dark. We estimate by actual
count nearly 35,000 men, officers and all, 165 pieces ordinance. I notice 
many of the gun carriages had the U.S. mark upon
them, having been captured from our army. 

About 11 o'clock Gen. Lee passed with his staff. He is fine looking man, 
medium size, stoutly built, has the face of a good
liver, grey beard, and mustache, poorly dressed for an officer of his 
grade. He wore a felt hat, black, and a heavy overcoat
with large cape. His horse appeared to be rather an indifferent one, for 
a man who reputedly is fond of fine stock. Hill is a tall
red-headed man, not over thirty-five. Longstreet and Ewell I did not see, 
nor Johnston. Many of the officers were fine looking
men, and rode fine horses. During their passage, I noticed their ever 
watchfulness on every side. The citizens were crowded
along the sidewalks and doors, observing their passage; the rest, inside, 
behind drawn blinds, watched unobtrusively. There
were many remarks and exclamations, but all in a subdued tone of voice or 
whisper. All had one thought in mind, "Were these
soldiers to be our conquerors, and if so, what will be our fate?" 

Occasionally a German would stop me and complain in his native tongue, as 
if I could help this situation, or was responsible
for it. (NOTE: Heyser was of German parents that kept and lived by the 
old ways.) 

Lee offered to place a guard for the protection of the town, but the 
sheriff could not be found. Later in the day, Gen. Hill and
Longstreet passed through with part of their army. They were far less 
respectable lot, and constantly shouting, singing, and
hooting at females that showed themselves at doors or windows. They were 
loud in their denunciation of the Union, and
insulting to citizens on the sidewalks. Shouting, "Boys, this is 
Pennsylvania. We should destroy her as they did in Virginia, dam
the Union. Harrisburg will be ours, Hurrah for the Southern Confederacy, 
and Jeff Davis." 

Every brigade as it passed sent a file of soldiers around to examine the 
stores and places of business, requiring them to open
up. This continued all day. These men were called the Louisianna Tigers, 
a forbidding-looking set of men that would take your
hat or remove your boots for their own use. 

Rev. Schneck was relieved of his gold watch and $50.00. He complained to 
get it back, but to no use. Robberies are now
common on the street, particularly where they are unguarded. Decharts hat 
store was cleaned out today, not a single item left
in stock. They opened up my son, William's store today, and started to 
help themselves. We are powerless to stop them, and
can do nothing but watch and complain to the commanding officers. They 
refer to the same treatment our soldiers gave the
Confederacy in Virginia. 

I finally found a Col. Greene that listened to some reason and had the 
men removed and the door shut. 

While the troops were passing today, I was sitting by my door, the victim 
of many insulting remarks. One even attempted to
take my hat. He withdrew when I offered to resist, as I would have struck 
him. Were it not for the rigid discipline they were
under, I shudder to think what our lot would have been. There are 
exceptions, many of the Rebels are gentlemen, and act as
such. Mostly, those from Florida, Texas, and Louisianna, generally 
speaking, are a band of cutthroats. 


JUNE 28

Cloudy. The troops are moving through town again, a continual procession 
until evening. The drug store of J. Spangler was
visited today by Lieut. Todd, President Lincoln's wife's brother. He 
finally had to be ejected by the provost marshal as having
no business being there. Reports come in our neighboring farmers are 
being robbed, one being shot. Many of these robberies
are committed by vagabonds or camp followers in search of booty. The 
Rebels try to check them, but can't catch them all.
One farmer was shot and the body hid in the manure pile. These robbers 
are mostly after money. The poor farmers are
defenseless. All of business places are pretty well stripped, all that is 
left now are the private houses to be broken into. 

Up to this evening, the whole number of troops passing thru Chambersburg 
is about 43,000; 180 pieces artillary, 3,000
wagons and ambulances. Indications seem to be they are about to leave 
Chambersburg. It is now 11 o'clock, my mind is
weary, sad, and gloomy. So much I cannot even form an opinion. 


JUNE 29

Cloudy. Streets are clear until about eight. My son, Jacob, meets Robert 
Reynolds of Georgia. I knew his father well. Robert
had his own horse and servant along. He is a conscript, wish I could have 
talked with him. 

Fearful outrages in the country about us. I hear the Rebels mail has been 
cut off from Richmond. They are apprehensive of
trouble. Stouffer's mill has been taken over by the Rebels and is running 
for their use. There isn't much food left in town now. If
the Rebels remain much longer, I do not know what we shall do. The 
country side is rapidly losing all its livestock. Much had
already been driven off and hidden in the mountains. 

About 4 o'clock, about 5,000 men took up their line of march for 
Greencastle with 18 pieces of ordinance. I think they are
clearing their lines to get their wagon trains back into Virginia. They 
are now riding about our alleys looking for harness and
gear. I removed the wheel from my wagon and hid it, making it unfit for 
use. 

About the close of the evening, they are busy tearing up the sills of the 
railroad and burning them to bend the rails over, making
them unfit to use. 


JUNE 30

Variable weather. Sunshine and rain. A large wagon train today takes its 
course towards Gettysburg. Lee's headquarters are
still here. He keeps his troops in constant movement that it is hard to 
say what he is planning for his principal move. 

About 9 o'clock a large train of wagons are withdrawn from the direction 
of Harrisburg, and put on the line of march for
Gettysburg. It took 4 hours for the line to pass here. The troops are 
busy destroying the Franklin Railroad at both North and
South ends of the County. Along with sills of the road, they pile on all 
the fence they can find to heat and twist the rails.
Another force of about 500 men have been sent to destroy the railroad 
depot and buildings, starting with the large turntable. It
is so soundly built of iron castings, their fires had little effect on 
it. The engine house was pulled down after an immense amount
of work. So they went from building to building, a senseless thing to do, 
as the structures were of no importance to us as we
could not use them. I tried to reason with a nearby officer about the 
wanton destruction. Their answers are always the same,
"This is in retaliation for your troops' work on the South, particularly 
Fredericksburg." 

Leaving this scene of destruction, which appears to be their last act. I 
went up to the belfry of the German Reformed Church
to see if I could trace any damage to my farm, but could not, so much 
timberland intervening. You could mark the line of the
railroad by the smoke of the burning ties. From what I can see, there is 
little damage to crops and grassland. 

This evening, there is much activity. Troops are withdrawn from all parts 
to march to Gettysburg. Reports that all ready there
has been an engagement at Cashtown. Their cooks are busy preparing 
rations for the next few days. 


JULY 2, 1863

Cloudy and very hot. The Rebels are leaving Chambersburg for Gettysburg. 
About 3 this morning, I was awakened by the
rumbling of heavy wagons. There were about 60 of them, followed by a 
large body of troops, requiring about two hours to
pass. They were quite jubilant in their passage thru town, pulling my 
bell at the door and hooting at me. 

After their passage, all was quiet again, except squads of calvary 
passing to unite with their companies, all in the direction of
Gettysburg. Somewhere near there is a heavy engagement. About ten, the 
town is vacant. The Rebels leaving their sick behind
for us to nurse and care for. A few stragglers are to be seen, but the 
worst is over. We congratulate ourselves that we still have
a roof over our heads. About 12, in the company of two other men, I 
walked out to my farm to assess the damage.
Everywhere were holes cut in fences and grain trampled down by the 
exercises of the cavalry. I sustained a great amount of
damage, nearly 4,000 men have encamped here. All of my fence gone, about 
40 acres of oats and much damage to all other
crops. My houses were all robbed of clothing and any kind of gear with 
which to work. The report was circulated that I was a
Colonel in the Union Army and now made to pay greater than my neighbors. 
How unjust even your supposed friends can be.
In passing over the fields and woods where they encamped, there is 
already a great stench. 

I found two Rebels hiding on my farm and would have taken them back to 
town. They would have been willing prisoners to
obtain their parole, but a large body of Stewarts' cavalry was passing 
near and I advised them to hide. One gave me his
bayonet, which I brought back to town. Back home, more reports come in of 
a battle near Gettysburg. All night long, more
troops pass thru town, their yelling is terrific. I keep indoors. 


JULY 3

Very hot. Our streets are deserted. An occasional Rebel is seen just a 
few stragglers. A Rebel soldier riding up Market Street
was fired upon by Wm. Etter, one of our citizens. We feared a reprisal 
for this sort of thing and put a stop to it. We see more
and more deserters. The town being clear of Rebels, the doors are opening 
again to promenading females. Nothing can stop
them, many of them show little respect for their character and standing. 
They expose themselves, as if intentional, to be out late
at night unprotected. 


JULY 4

Showers of rain. Reports of terrible fighting at Gettysburg. Captures are 
being made all around here of Rebel cavalry and
infantry which are sent to Harrisburg, their horses and guns being 
confiscated. The country people are coming in now with their
marketing with terrible accounts of outrages that were committed upon 
them. We were fortunate that the Rebel officers were
mostly gentlemen, and tried to hold their savage troops in check, but 
many could not. I suppose we are fortunate to be alive. 

Ewell is at Carlisle and demands its surrender, throwing some 40 shells 
into town, which did little damage. They burned the gas
works where the Carlisle Deposit Bank had hidden its records,now gone. 

Gen Smith appeared and Ewell fell back towards Gettysburg. We hear of a 
great battle at Gettysburg, but as yet no
particulars, except the Union forces were victorious. Some public 
spirited citizens seized the mail (Rebel mail) going thru
Fayetteville. Soon a detachment of cavalry was back looking for it, and 
took 18 prisoners locally for some hours before
releasing them; on pain of death if it happens again. 


JULY 5

Much rain. About three, 12 wagons of wounded from Gettysburg were routed 
by mistake thru our town, leaving them here at
our hospital, a wonder they were alive, thrown in heaps in rough wagons. 
The wagons were captured by John W. Taylor and
