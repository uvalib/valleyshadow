Everything has changed since the burning.  Business is all conducted in 
little shops and shanties on the back streets, and in out of the way 
places.  But a small assortment of goods are kept on hand and for these 
the highest prices are asked.  Many of our citizens have removed to other 
places never to return.  Others of our business men who remain have 
opened up in a small way in some unthought of place, or started some new 
branch of traffic that the necessities of the people seem to demand.  One 
would scarcely suppose that so great a change could take place in a 
community in so short a time.
<p>
Men seem in a degree reckless, they have lost all they possessed in the 
world, in an hours time, through no fault of theirs, and they appear 
determined to make it up by hook or by crook in the shortest possible 
time.  Money seems plenty and "trust is played out" as may be noticed 
posted up in stores and shops.  It is cash down for everything you get 
and everything you sell.
<p>
People undersand each others neccessities and do not think of asking 
credit.  As to the prospects of re-building the town they look 
exceedingly dark just now.  But few have the means to rebuild and they 
are dubious and investing their money in property along the border while 
the war lasts.  Those without means can do nothing but pile up their 
brick and let their lots take care of themselves until some 
appropriation is made for their relief.  A few are already 
re-building--they are, perhaps, the wisest after all.  The Legislature 
granted $100,000 to keep the people from starving and freezing this 
winter.  Very charitable indeed!  "Charity covereth a multitude of 
sins."  The contributions from other places will not amount to much in the 
way of relieving the many wants of the people.  The supply of provisions 
forwarded for a few weeks was liberal and relieved immediate wants.  This 
aid has in a great measure stopped off and must soon stop altogether.  
The sufferers would return their grateful thanks to the good people of 
many towns in Pennsylvania for their substantial sympathy.  A few things 
in the way of clothing and bedding have been sent in, but not enought to 
fit out twenty families when over three hundred are entirely destitute.  
How the people are to live this winter God only knows.  Without stoves, 
coal, wood, bedding, furniture, clothing, flour, maet, in a word, all the 
neccessities of life; and most of all without a roof to shelter them 
from the pelting of the storms.  Our people will only realize what they 
have lost, and what hard times are, when cruel winter comes.
