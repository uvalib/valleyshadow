<img src=images/t.gif>he summer of 1864 changed Chambersburg forever.  The 
residents
had adapted to life on the border between the Union and the Confederacy.  
The small agricultural community had experienced its fair share of the 
war, as had many other northern border towns in Pennsylvania and Maryland. 
While many of its men were off in battle, the rest of the town tried to 
continue as normally as it could. Farmers went on working in the fields and
merchants continued to keep their stores, all the 
while keeping on top of the war through personal letters and local 
newspapers.    
<p>But the war was not completely out of sight. Chambersburg was the military headquarters 
for the Department of the Susquehanna, under Brig. Gen. Darius Couch.  Just 
outside of town were stationed thousands of Union soldiers.  The 
railroad station was constantly filled with trains transporting  
ammunition, food, supplies, and equipment for army units.  The 
memories of the rebel occupations were still fresh in 
many people's minds.  They could not forget all of the cattle, food, dry 
goods, and clothes taken by the Confederates.
<p>For three years this co-existence of a military sphere and a public 
sphere set the backdrop of daily life in Chambersburg. In July 1864, this would 
quickly change as the residents learned first hand the terrors of war 
when they became the targets of the Confederacy. The burning of 
Chambersburg finally initiated the North into the realities of war without 
any limitations.
