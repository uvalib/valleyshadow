Jacob Hoke, a Chambersburg store owner, published in 1887 a detailed 
record of 
the events of the Chambersburg raid of 1863 entitled <i>The Great 
Invasion</i>.  He also included an appendix 
that describes the Burning of Chambersburg one year later.  He notes in 
his introduction, speaking about "the author,"<p>
"His qualifications for the task he has undertaken may be stated thus: he 
resided in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania during the entire period of the War 
of the Rebellion, and for a score of years previous and ever since; he 
not only witnessed all the armed hosts, Federal and Confederate, which 
passed through that place, but had access to their camps and hospitals; 
he preserved important papers, and kept an account of events with the 
dates of their occurrence; he visited the field of battle and noted facts 
and incidents; he has corresponded with others, both Federals and 
Confederates, competent to impart important information; and he has made 
it a point to read everything related to the subject, which has come 
under his notice."<p><i>Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, J. Hoke</i> <p><hr

<p><center><h3>Appendix, The Burning of Chambersburg</h3></center>
<p><a href=hoke/hoke_burn.html>The Burning of Chambersburg</a><br>
In this supplement to his book, Jacob Hoke presents a personal 
narrative of the burning.  He not only describes the burning and 
its aftermath, but Hoke writes an analysis of the causes of the burning.  
He includes three Confederate accounts from Gen. Early, Gen. Imboden, and 
F. C. Slingluff.  He concludes with a defense of Gen. Hunter's tactics in 
the Valley as legitimate and appropriate warfare.
