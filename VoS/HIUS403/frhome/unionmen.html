UNION MEN!  the time for argument is past.  ACTION, earnest, systematic, 
tireless action alone remains to fulfil() the measure of loyal duty.  In 
less than one week the people of the North must determine by their 
suffrages whether the war for the life of the Republic shall be arrested 
in the midst of our victories by a humiliating "cessation of 
hostilities"--whether our sacrifices of brave men fallen in our country's 
cause, and of millions of treasure, shall be pronounced vain and fruitless.
<p>
The issue cannot, must not be evaded.  It stares every loyal man in the 
face; is plain as if written in letters of living light, so that he who 
runs may read, and the subtlest sophistry is defied to conceal the 
momentous issue from the candid, intelligent and faithful citizen.  If 
Gen. M<sup>c</sup>Clellan shall be chosen President it must be accepted 
by friend and foe at home and abroad, as a verdict in favor or Peace upon 
any terms, even at the cost of dismemberment; while if the national 
verdict is for Lincoln, as it surely must be, it is a declaration that 
the war, now to all human appearances on the threshold of final and 
complete success, shall be prosecuted until the despairing traitors yield 
to the majesty of the laws and the unity of the States.  
<p>
We appeal to faithful men to appreciate the issue and give it that effort 
its crowning importance merits.  It is fraught with the peace, the order, 
the safety of every citizen, for the maintenance of government is the 
first duty--the last refuge of all.  If we would accept a degrading peace 
our government would be without honor and power, and its millions of 
suicides would be without shame; and anarchy would be the sad fate of the 
fairest continent of the word.  We should be without credit, without 
security, without law, and oppressed in every hand; the direst despotism 
would be at last welcomed as the fruits of our perfidy to our own and a 
sacred country's cause.
<p>
The loyal hearts beat strong with confidence of final triumph.  Indiana 
has spoken by 22,000 majority; Ohio by over 50,000 and Pennsylvania by 
over 12,000--with one accord declaring for the preservation of the 
government and the vindication of the honor of brave armies.  Thus 
foreshadowed by the October verdict, the Nation cannot turn upon itself 
in November.  But it must be decisive, as it can be.  The faithful people 
would stand appalled should the result of the great struggle of Tuesday 
next exhibit the Union ticket but barely successful.  And that is 
possible if there be remissness or over confidence.  Already the most 
glaring frauds are shows to be in course of consummation by our desperate 
and unscrupulous foes, and every loyal heart must be quickened and every 
loyal arm strengthened to give overwhelming victory to the Right.  
Forward loyal men!  The day is at hand--the crowning triumph is within 
your grasp, and enduring Peace, through victory, must soon be restored to 
our Union, in honor, might and Freedom!
