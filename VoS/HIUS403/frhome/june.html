<img src=images/letterb.gif>y June of 1864, Chambersburg was used to 
living the Civil War.  Since the beginning of the war, the town had 
grown into a distinct home front society.  Chambersburg residents, like 
those in every town, had watched as their sons, husbands, brothers, and 
fathers left to serve in the military.  In the absence of so many men, 
women had assumed new roles in the town's society.  The organizations 
they joined and the activities in which they participated changed 
after the onset of war.  Churches, as well, shifted their focus 
to address war and home front issues, instructing people how to 
maintain their strength and determination in the face of the war's
uncertainty.  Agriculture and business reflected the impact of the 
war as well, surging, as Chambersburg became a center for wartime production 
and transportation.  All of these changes signaled the establishment 
of a home front society, one which supported and acknowledged the 
war's presence, but also allowed people in Chambersburg to live 
relatively normal day to day lives.  Like those one the homefront all 
over the country, they were at home, not on the battlefield.<p>
Twice, though, those lines became less clear when Confederates invaded 
Chambersburg.  In 1862, Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart, 
and  in 1863 Generals Albert Jenkins and 
Robert E. Lee took over the town, making Chambersburg one of the few 
Northern towns ever 
occupied by Confederate troops.  Their presence in town brought the war 
more directly into the lives of Chambersburg citizens.  For the most 
part, though, residents were left unharmed in these first two raids, and  
they recovered fairly quickly.<p>   
In June of 1864 this home front society was well-established.  With the 
memory of two invasions, the absence of so many men, and the changed face 
of daily life, Chambersburg was certainly affected by the Civil War, but 
there was no real panic.  Life on the home front proceeded as usual.  
June represents this home front, how it developed, and how looked just 
before it was changed completely by the burning the next month.  </td></tr>
