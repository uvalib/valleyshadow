<table width=480><tr><td>
Had quite a visiter last night.  She came and asde whether I was Mrs 
Cormany. I told her I was.  she then told me she was preacher Millers 
daughter, & that they had fled from the Reb's & she had no place to 
stay.  So of course I told her I would keep her. I afterwards learned 
that she was a thief &c but I had promised to keep her so I put all 
little things out of reach, & frightened her by telling her I always had 
a loaded pistol near so I could shoot if anyone molested me.  She acted 
quite strangely--before going to bed--wanted me to blow the light & get 
in bed & she after having shaken off her fleas would lock the door & come 
too--but I let her know that I lock my own door & that she is to get into 
bed--she slept all night & left early this morning...
