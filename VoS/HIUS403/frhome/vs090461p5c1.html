for a few months, gave birth to a child and deposited the body in the vault of a Privy at the residence where she was hired.
Information of the occurrence was laid before the District Attorney who ordered the body to be taken up and an inquest held
over it. The medical examination determined that the child though fully matured had never breathed. A warrant was issued for
the arrest of the girl on the charge of fornication and bastardy and concealing the birth of a child. </td></tr></table></body></html>
