<b>BURNING OF CHAMBERSBURG</b>

We give in today's paper a detailed account of the burning and sacking of 
Chambersburg, on the 30th alt. by the rebels under the command of Gen. 
McCausland.  Appalling as is the account given by our reporters, so far 
from dealing in exaggerations, it falls far, very far short of a complete 
picture of wanton atrocities practiced by the barbarous foe.  Save the 
few humane exceptions who openly and manfully resisted the brutal fury of 
their military superiors and associates, the entire command engaged in 
the work of destruction seeming like insatiate fiends from hell itself, 
who reveled in indiscriminate robbery and arson, regardless of the 
appeals of the widowed and fatherless, or the claims to the stricken in 
years, the infirm or even the sanctity due to the dead.

<p>

	The allegation that Chambersburg was burned in retaliation for the 
destruction of rebel property by our armies, merely adds unblushing 
falsehood to shameless barbarity.  True, the rebels who in their fiendish 
intoxication thrust their torches into our homes, cried "retaliation" as 
they robbed defenceless women, and ritled drawers, jewelry boxes, and 
purses; but that they should love falsehood, and prefer it to truth, as 
they prefer robbery  to honesty, and brutality to the ordinary humanities 
which characterize all but brutalized men, is most natural.  We can 
understand why the thief, with a remnant of shame, should resort to 
falsehood to paliate his crimes; but for the men in the North who 
cowardly skulk and whine over rebel falsehoods to extenuate rebel 
atrocities, there can be no excuse save the common law that binds men of 
like sympathis to justify the acts, and rush with the mantle of charity 
to hide the deformities of those who cause they would openly espouse, had 
they common honesty and manhood.

<p>

	It is untrue--wholly, maliciously and treasonably false, as 
broadly stated or insidiously intimated by several journals in this 
State, that the Union troops have furnished any precedent for the burning 
and plundering of Chambersburg.  Rebel journals have so stated, it is 
true; but the falsity of their statements has been clearly disproved, and 
a decent respect for truth, if it not for the claims of patriotism, 
should have saved Pennsylvania the blistering shame of journals supported 
by her own people justifying, by every conceivable excuse, the fiendish 
malignify that has left Chambersburg a mass of blackened walls, and our 
people robbed and homeless.--

Gen. Hunter destroyed just six houses in his late march to 
Lynchburg and Parkersburg, and by well recognized rules of 
war; he was fully justified in so doing.  He burned the residence of Gov. 
Letcher, after having at first guarded it, because he found an appeal 
written by Gov. Letcher, a few days before, urging the people there to 
arm and ambush and murder the Union troops.  The destruction of Lexington 
Military Institute we regretted, and still regret that it was done; but 
when Gen. Rhodes burned a similar institution in Carlisle one year ago, 
no one thought of raising the cry of vandalism.  Even the journals which 
have given columns of indignant denunciation to Hunter for destroying a 
revel military school, have yet to denounce the vandalism that applied 
the torch at Carlisle.  Every other building destroyed by Gen. Hunter was 
for special reasons which the rebels themselves deem humane when they are 
invading our soil.  That his defeated, retreating and half starved 
command committed many wanton outrages, we do not doubt; but in that they 
were no exception to other commands similarly situated on either side.  
Even Earley could find but six buildings destroyed by Hunter to give him 
a pretext for his atrocious order, as his order clearly demonstrated, for 
he recited the names of the owners as a warrant for his infamy.

<p>

	Equally false are the statements that Union troops wantonly 
burned Jacksonville, Alexandria.  Jackson and other towns carefully given 
by Pennsylvania journals to break the crushing blow treason has dealt 
itself by the destruction of Chambersburg.  Jacksonville was fired at a 
single point when our troops were retreating from it, because citizens 
fired on our troops from the house, and unfortunately most of the 
town--composed of wooden structures--was destroyed.  The firing was in 
accordance with a well recognized rule that civilians who shelter 
themselves in their houses to fire upon troops, shall not only lose their 
property but suffer death.  <i>Our</i> troops sometimes--and only 
sometimes enforce the first and milder part of the rule.  The rebels 
invariably enforce the entire rule relentlessly, and we have yet to hear 
of complaint from northern journals because they do so.  In Alexandria an 
accidental fire, resulting from a party of intoxicated soldiers, 
threatened the destruction of the entire town, owing to its inflamable 
buildings and unfavorable winds; but it was arrested before one-third of 
the village--the poorest portion of it, was burned.  At the head of the 
force detailed to put out the fire was Maj. Gen. Banks in person, and by 
his own orders and efforts the town was saved.  Jackson was partially 
destroyed by our guns when it was defended by the rebels; but it was not 
fired and burned by our troops after possession was gained.-- 

<p>

Wrongs, even atrocities may have been committed by individual soldiers or 
isolated commands; but no such thing as deliberately and wantonly burning 
and robbing houses was practiced by the Union army.  Col. Montgomery 
committed gross outrages on private citizens in two raids in South 
Carolina, which we have never seen reason to justify, but he was deprived 
of his command, or at least subordinated, and it may be dismissed, as it 
should have been.  Kilpatrick burned mills unwarrantably as we have ever 
believed, and other Union commanders may have done the same; but it was 
some excuse that they were filled with rebel supplies.  While McCausland 
was on his way to Chambersburg to lay it waste, Gen Rosseau was 
penetrating the richest part of Georgia and not a single private house or 
building of any kind was destroyed, nor were his soldiers permitted to 
enter a residence on the route.  When private property was near to 
government stores; which he had to fire, he detailed men to save all but 
the buildings belonging to or used by the rebel government.  Gen. 
Stoneman enforced the same rules rigidly in all his raids, and so did 
Grierson.  The Union troops have captured and occupied hundreds of towns 
since the war has commenced, and they have yet the first time to demand 
the free-booters tribute or destroy a town by order of a commanding 
officer.  Repeatedly have our troops been fired upon and murdered by 
skulking rebels who protected themselves in their dwellings; but in no 
case has a town been destroyed therefor.  

<p>

	The robbers' tribute demanded from defenceless towns like 
Hagerstown, Frederick, Boonsboro and Chambersburg, and the brutal robbery 
and fiendish burning of our town, stand out in appalling solitude in this 
war, and are without precedent in history of warfare in the present 
century.  A Napoleon, fifty years ago, might have demanded tribute from 
Chambersburg if defended and captured and destrained to raise the 
ransom.  A Sepoy might have sacked it and appropriated its wealth to glut 
his semi-savage instincts.  A McCausland first robbed it by unrestrained 
command, then relentlessly burned our alike the opulent and humble, widow 
and warrior, and spared neither age, sex, persuasion or condition.  Such 
is the truth, and such must be the history of our doomed village, 
regardless of the slimy shadow of charity with which the brutality of 
traitors and the ready falsehoods of cowardly sympathizers, would seek to 
extenuate the crowning atrocity of modern warfare.
