<i>Gen. S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:-- </I><p>

General--In forwarding the report of Major General Stuart of his 
expedition into Pennsylvania. I take occasion to
express to the department my sense of the boldness, judgment and prudence 
he displayed in its execution, and cordially
join with him in his commendations of the conduct and endurance of the 
brave men be commanded. To his skill and their
fortitude, under the guidance of an overruling Providence, is their 
success due. I have the honor to be, most respectfully,
your obedient servant. <p>

Gen. Lee's Instructions.
HEADQUARTERS, ARMY of NORTHERN VA.,<p>
Maj. Gen. J. E. B. 
Stuart, Commanding Cavalry:</i></center><p> 

General--An expedition into Maryland with a detachment of cavalry, if it 
can be successfully executed, is at this time
desirable. You will, therefore, for a detachment of from twelve to 
fifteen hundred well mounted men, suitable for such an
expedition, and should the information from your scouts lead you to 
suppose that your movement can be concealed
from bodies of the enemy that would be able to resist it, you are desired 
to cross the Potomac above Williamsport,
leave Hagerstown and Greencastle on your right, and proceed to the rear 
of Chambersburg, and endeavor to destroy
the railroad bridge over the branch of the Conococheagne. 

Any other damage that you can inflict upon the enemy or his means of 
transportation you will also execute. You are
desired to gain all information of the position, force and probable 
intent of the enemy which you can, and in your
progress into Pennsylvania you will take measures to inform yourself of 
the various routes that you may take on your
return to Virginia. 

To keep your movement secret it will be necessary for you to arrest all 
citizens that may give information to the enemy;
and should you meet with citizens of Pennsylvania holding State or 
government offices, it will be desirable, if convenient,
to bring them with you, that they may be used as hostages, or the means 
of exchange for our own citizens that have been
carried off by the enemy. Such persons will, of course, be treated with 
all the respect and consideration that
circumstances will admit. 

Should it be in your power to supply yourself with horses, or other 
necessary articles on the list of legal capture, you are
authorised to do so. 

Having accomplished your errand you will rejoin this army as soon as 
practicable. Reliance is placed upon your skill and
judgment in the successful execution of this plan, and it is not intended 
or desired that you should jeopardize the safety of
your command, or go farther than your good judgment and prudence may 
dictate. 

Colonel Imboden has been desired to attract the attention of the enemy 
towards Cumberland, so that the river between
that point and where you may recross may be less guarded. You will, of 
course, keep out your scouts to give you
information, and take every other precaution to secure the success and 
safety of the expedition. 

Should you be led so far east as to make it better in your opinion, to 
continue around to the Potomac, you will have to
cross the river in the vicinity of Leesburg. <p>
I am, with great respect, your ob't serv't.<p>

<i>Headquarters. Cavalry Division, October 9th, 1862.</i> <p>

Soldiers--You are about to engage in an enterprise which, to insure 
success, imperatively [sic] demands at your hands
coolness, decision and bravery--implicit obedience to orders, without 
question or cavil, and the strictest order and
sobriety on the march and in bivouac. 

The destination and extent of this expedition had better be kept to 
myself than known to you. Suffice it to say that, with
the hearty co-operation of officers and men, I have not a doubt of its 
success which will reflect credit in the highest
degree upon your arms. 

The orders which are hereby published for your government are absolutely 
necessary and must be rigidly enforced.<p>

<i>Headquarters, Cavalry Division, 
October 9th, 1862.</i> 
<p>
During the expedition into the enemy's country, on which this command 
about to engage brigade commanders will make
arrangements for seizing horses, the property of citizens of the United 
States, and all other property subject to legal
capture, provided that in no case will any species of property be taken 
except by authority given in person or in writing
of the commander of brigade, regiment, or captain of a company, in the 
absence of his superior officers. In all cases a
simple receipt will be given, to the effect that the article is seized 
for the use of the Confederate States, giving place, date
and name of owners, in order to enable the individual to have recourse 
upon his government for damage. 

Individual plunder for private use is positively forbidden, and every 
instance must be punished in the severest manner, for
an army of plunderers consummates its own destruction. The capture of 
anything will not give the captor any individual
claim, and all horses and equipments will be kept to be apportioned upon 
the return of the expedition through the entire
division. Brigade commanders will arrange to to [sic] have one-third of 
their respective commands engaged in leading
horses, provided enough can be procured, each man linking so as to led 
three horses: the led horses being habitually in
the centre of the brigade, and the remaining two-thirds will keep, at all 
times, prepared for action. 

The attack, when made, must be vigorous and overwhelming, giving the 
enemy no time to reconnoiter or consider
anything, except his best means of flight. All persons found in transit 
must be detained, subject to the orders of the
Division Provost Marshal, to prevent information reaching the enemy. As a 
measure of justice to our many good citizens
who, without crime, have been taken from their homes and kept by the 
enemy in prison, all public functionaries--such as
magistrates, postmasters sheriffs, &c.--will be seized as prisoners. They 
will be kindly treated and kept as hostages for
our own. No straggling from the route of march or bivouac for the purpose 
of obtaining provisions, &c., will be
permitted in any case, the commissaries and quartermasters being required 
to obtain and furnish all such supplies in bulk
as may be necessary. 

So much of this order as authorizes the seizures of persons and property 
will not take effect until the command crosses
the Pennsylvania line. 

The utmost activity is enjoined upon the detachments procuring horses, 
and unceasing vigilance upon the entire
command. 

Major J. P. W. Hairston is hereby appointed Division Provost Marshal. By 
command of <p>

A. Gen. Army North'n Va: </i><p>

Colonel--I have the honor to report that on the 9th inst., in compliance 
with instructions from the Commanding General
Army Northern Virginia, I proceeded on an expedition into Pennsylvania 
with a cavalry force of 1,800 and four pieces
of horse artillery, under command of Brigadier General Hampton and 
Colonels W. H. F. Lee and Jones. This force
rendezvoused at Darksville at twelve M. and marched thence to the 
vicinity of Hedgesville, where it encamped for the
night. At daylight next morning (October 10) I crossed the Potomac at 
McCoy's, between Williamsport and Hancock,
with some little opposition, capturing two or three horses of the enemy's 
pickets. We were told here by the citizens that
a large force had camped the night before at Clear Spring, and were 
supposed to be en route to Cumberland. We
proceeded northward until we reached the turnpike leading from Hagerstown 
to Hancock, known as the National road.
Here was a signal station on the mountain, and most of the party, with 
their flags and apparatus, were supprised [sic]
and captured, and also eight or ten prisoners of war from whom, as well 
as from the citizens, I found that a large force
alluded to had crossed but an hour ahead of me, towards Cumberland and 
consisted of six regiments of Ohio troops
and two batteries, under Gen. Cox, and were en route, via Cumberland, for 
the Kanawha. I sent back this intelligence
at once to the Commanding General. Striking directly across the Nation 
road, I proceeded in the direction of
Mercersburg, Pa., which point was reached about noon. I was extremely 
anxious to reach Hagerstown, where large
supplies were stored, but was satisfied, from reliable information, that 
the notice the enemy had of my approach, and the
proximity of his forces, would enable him to prevent my capturing it. I 
therefore turned towards Chambersburg. I did not
reach this point till after dark, in a rain. I did not deem it safe to 
defer the attack till morning, nor was it proper to attack
a place full of women and children without summoning it first to 
surrender. I accordingly sent in a flag of truce, and found
no military or civil authority in the place; but some prominent citizens 
who met the officer were notified that the place
would be occupied, and if any resistance were made the place would be 
shelled in three minutes. Brigadier Wade
Hampton's command being in the advance, took possession of the place, and 
I appointed him Military Governor of the
city. No incidents occurred during the night, during which it rained 
continuously.--The officials all fled the town on our
approach, and no one could be found who would admit that he held office 
in the place. About 275 sick and wounded in
the hospitals were paroled. During the day a large number of horses of 
citizens were seized and brought along. The
wires were cut, and railroads obstructed. Next morning it was ascertained 
that a large number of small arms and
munitions of war were stored about the railroad buildings, of which that 
could not be easily brought away were
destroyed, consisting of about five thousand new muskets, pistols, 
sabres, amunition [sic]; also, a large assortment of
army clothing. The extensive machine shops and depot buildings of the 
railroad, and several trains of loaded cars, were
entirely destroyed. From Chambersburg I decided, after mature 
consideration, to strike for the vicinity of Leesburg, as
the best route of return, particularly as Cox's command would have 
rendered the direction of Cumberland, full of
mountain gorges, particularly hazardous. The route selected was through 
an open country. Of course I left nothing
undone to prevent the inhabitants from detecting my real route and 
object. I started directly towards Gettysburg, but
having passed the Blue Ridge, turned back towards Hagerstown for six or 
eight miles, and then crossed to Maryland by
Emmettsburg, where, as we passed, we were hailed by the inhabitants with 
the most enthusiastic demonstrations of joy.
A scouting party of 150 lancers had just passed towards Gettysburg, and I 
regret exceeding that my march did not
admit of the delay necessary to catch them. Taking the road towards 
Frederick, we intercepted dispatches from Colonel
Rush (lancers) to the commander of the scout which satisfied me that our 
whereabouts was still a problem to the enemy.

Before reaching Frederick, I crossed the Monocacy, continued the march 
through the night, via Liberty, New Market,
Monrovia on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, where we cut the telegraph 
wires and obstructed the railroad. We
reached, at daylight Hayattstown on McClellan's line of wagon 
communication with Washington, but we found only a
few wagons to capture, and pushed on to Barnesville, which we found just 
vacated by a company of the enemy's
cavalry. We had here corroborated what we had heard before, that Stoneman 
had between 4,000 and 5,000 troops
about Poolesville and guarding the river fords. I started directly for 
Poolesville, but instead of marching through the
woods, leaving it two or three miles to my left, and getting into the 
road from Poolesville to the month of the Monocacy.
Guarding well my flanks and rear, I pushed boldly forward, meeting the 
head of the enemy's column going towards
Poolesville. I ordered the charge, which was responded to in handsome 
style by the advance squadron (Irving's) of
Lee's brigade, which drove back the enemy's cavalry upon the column of 
infantry advancing to occupy the crest from
which the cavalry were driven. Quick as thought Lee's sharpshooters 
sprang to the ground, and, engaging the infantry
skirmishers, held them in check till the artillery advance came up, 
which, under the gallant Pelham, drove back the
enemy's cavalry upon the column of infantry advancing to occupy the crest 
from which the cavalry were driven. Quick
as thought Lee's sharpshooters sprang to the ground, and, engaging the 
infantry skirmishers, held them in check till the
artillery advance came up, which, under the gallant Pelham, drove back 
the enemy's force to his batteries beyond the
Monocacy, between which and our solitary gun quite a spirited fire 
continued for some time. This answered, in
connection with the high crest occupied by our piece, to screen entirely 
my real movement quickly to the left making a
bold and rapid stride for White's Ford, to make my way across before the 
enemy at Poolesville and Monocacy could
be aware of my design. Although delayed somewhat by about two hundred 
infantry, strongly posted in the cliffs over the
ford, yet they yielded to the moral effect of a few shells before 
engaging our sharp shooters, and the crossing of the
canal (now dry) and river was affected with all the precision of passing 
a defile on drill. A section of artillery being sent
with the advance and placed in position on the Loudon side, another piece 
on the Maryland height, while Pelham
continued to occupy the attention of the enemy with the other, 
withdrawing from position to position until he was
ordered to cross. The enemy was marching from Poolesville in the 
meantime, but came up in line of battle on the
Maryland height, while Pelman continued to occupy the attention of the 
enemy with the other, withdrawing from position
to position until he was ordered to cross. The enemy was marching from 
Poolesville in the meantime, but came up in line
of battle on the Maryland bank only to receive a thundering salutation 
with evident effect, from our guns on this side. I
lost not a man killed on the expedition, and only a few slight wounds. 
The enemy's loss is not know; but Pelham's one
gun compelled the enemy's battery to change its position three times. The 
remainder of the march was destitute of
interest. The conduct of the command and their behavior towards the 
inhabitants is worthy the highest praise; a few
individual cases only were exceptions in this particular. 

Brigadier General Hampton and Colonels Lee, Jones, Wickham and Butler, 
and the officers under their command, are
entitled to my lasting gratitude for their coolness in danger and 
cheerful obedience to orders. Unoffending persons were
treated with civility, and the inhabitants were generous in profers [sic] 
of provision on the march. We seized and brought
over a large number of horses, the property of citizens of the United 
States. 

The valuable information obtained in this reconnoissance [sic] as to the 
distribution of the enemy's force was
communicated orally to the Commanding General, and need not be here 
repeated. A number of public functionaries and
prominent citizens whom the enemy has torn from their homes and confined 
in dungeons in the North. One or two of my
men lost their way and are probably in the hands of the enemy. 

The results of this expedition, in a moral and political point of view, 
can hardly be estimated, and consternation among
property holders in Pennsylvania beggars description. 

I enclose a map of the expedition, drawn by Capt. W. W. Blackford, to 
accompany this report. Also, a copy of orders
enforced during the march. 

Believing that the hand of God was clearly manifested in the signal 
deliverance of my command from danger, and the
crowning successes attending it, I ascribe to Him the praise, the honor 
and the glory. 

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient 
servant-<p>
