Pastor, Rev. Mr. Eyster, by taking possession of his house on pleasant afternoon, and when they left he and his family were
some two hundred dollars better off than when the fair donors took charge of the domicil [sic]. Cannot other churches imitate
this praise-worthy example? We will see who comes next.</td></tr></table></body></html>
