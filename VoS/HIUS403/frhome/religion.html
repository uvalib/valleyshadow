<p>The residents of Franklin County led lives that were intrinsically 
bound to their religion.  Regardless of the denomination of 
Christianity to which a person belonged, religion served as a tool through 
which morality was taught, as a place to find solac
e, and most often as a major source of social interaction.
<p>The people of the country could, every week, find short stories or 
just sayings in either the <i>Valley Spirit</i> or <i>The Franklin 
Repository</i> 
with clearly religious themes.  Such articles spoke out on the proper way 
to teach virtues to the young, or the dangers of typical vices.  No matter the exact message, multiple religious sayings throughout the papers of the day were common.
<p>In a time when every week brought new reports on the increasing death 
toll of the war or on some new injured or captured soldier, religion 
served as a base by which Franklin County residents could ground 
themselves and protect themselves from the pains of life.  Rachel 
Cormany, a Chambersburg resident, speaks to this look to religion in her 
<a href=rec021863.html>diary</a>.  Again, religious support was often 
accomplished extensively through the newspapers.  Such teachings could also be 
found in the <a href="fr021560p4c5.html">sermons</a> of the local 
preachers, many of whom were <a href="vs010862p5c1.html">thanked heartily 
yearly for their efforts.</a>
<p>With little providing either a place around which to rally or even 
everyday social interaction, the churches of Franklin County served to 
fill these roles.  Social events, such as <a href="vs010162p5c1.html">pageants and sings</a> were often 
organized by a church.  At the same time, clothes and
 food drives for the soldiers and the poor were organized almost exclusively by the religious women of the county.
