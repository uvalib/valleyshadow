GOSSIP WITH OUR FRIENDS.--Chambersburg, dear old Chambersburg, our birth 
place, our father's birthplace, the original refuge for our ancestors 
who had left the old country for a home in the new.  Chambersburg, every 
tendril of whose old ivy had a hold upon our heard, <i>has been</i>  A 
new Chambersburg may spring up, with higher houses, handsomer stores and 
wider streets, but the <i>homes</i> NEVERMORE.  Farewell to all we held 
most dear, family heir looms, letters, locks of hair, portraits, 
mementoes of the loved and honored dead, farewell all!

<p>
THE FUTURE OF CHAMBERSBURG.--The fairest town of the Cumberland Valley is 
in ruins.  Half its people are homeless and very many of them penniless 
and helpless.  The stoutest heart must quail as the blackened walls, and 
withered shades of our beautiful village are witnessed, where were once 
cheerful and hospitable homes, heartsome trees, the busy hum of industry 
and the enterprise of our merchants.
<p>
But let us horrow no sorrow over our desolation.  There are enough hearts 
which must bleed--enough who must embrace relentless want, when all is done 
that can be done.  Let stout hearts, therefore, review the future of 
Chambersburg.  They are wanted for their own sakes, for the sake of many 
doomed to suffering, and they are wanted to give new life to the charred 
homes and dismal ruins around us.  <i>Chambersburg must be rebuilt</i>.  
It was not the unhealthy fruit of speculation.  No fictitious 
business--no surge of wild adventure created it.  It was the natural, 
healthy offspring of the great and growing wealth of the beautiful valley 
in which it was centered.  In its business it had no rival, and can live 
none hereafter.  It must supply the same inevitable wants hereafter as 
heretofore.  Its stores must be replaced--its shops must resound again 
with the sound of the anvil and chisel; its artizans must find the same 
demand for their handi-work and its professions have the same duties 
to-day they had a month ago.  Its vast water-power still courses through 
the heart of our ruins, and new structures must soon turn it to 
enterprise and profit.  In short, the business of Chambersburg, in all 
its various branches, was imperatively demanded by the wants of the 
community, and it must be restored.
<p>
<i>How shall it be done?</i>  We hope that the great Commonwealth of 
which we are integral part--to which we yield obedience and tribute as 
the price of common safety--will not be unmindful of the just claim of 
our people.  If not now,  we think hereafter this just principle must be 
recognized; but the future of Chambersburg, however aided, depends upon 
the energy and determination of her own people.  Many escaped the ravages 
of the fiendish entirely and many others were but crippled in various 
degrees--not broken in capital or means of livelihood.  To such men--one 
and all--the ruins of Chambersburg appeal for the prompt restoration of 
our homes and places of business.  Ours is a common sorrow.  Neither age, 
sex, condition or persuasion were spared in the brutality of the enemy, 
and the cause of one is the cause of all; and to all who have escaped, 
whether wholly or partially, they have a right to appeal for substantial 
aid in making new homes and stores, and shops, and offices.  If we thus 
go hand in hand and stand shoulder to shoulder, we shall soon see our 
people employed and thus supplied, and the town will revive as if by 
magic.  If we stand selfishly aside, and make our own our only cause, we 
shall drive the broken and despairing from us, and thus lose a very large 
class of our best population.
<p>
<i>Who shall profit by our misfortunes?</i>  There will be more money 
made in Chambersburg during the next two years, in legitimate business 
than has been made in the last five.  Shall our own sufferers gather 
these profits or shall adventurers and strangers?  One or the other is 
must be.  If our own people do not rebuild substantially, and show no 
determination to retain their places and their business as far as it may 
be at all possible, then will adventurers and sharpers take their 
places.  They will squat on our best vacant corners, gather the profits 
which should be received by our own people; and as substantial 
improvement overtakes them, they will pocket their gain and strike off 
for some new field in which to reap and carry off a harvest.  Our own 
people <i>can</i> in most instances preserve their business to themselves 
if they will manfully and resolutely stand together and help each other 
until the cloud of adversity passes away.  True, some must sink beneath 
the load of misfortune, and for these let the generous contributions of 
the people of the State perform their kindest officers. 
<p>
<i>Chambersburg is just about to enter upon a prosperous future.</i>  
After years of fruitless effort we are about to be connected with the 
great West by a railroad, which must add immensely to the wealth and 
prosperity of our people.  The bill incorporating the Southern 
Pennsylvania Railroad Company became a law a few days ago, and we are 
assured that it will be promptly made.  It will open new fields of wealth 
in the Southern counties--must build new villages, and enhance the price 
of every acre of land in our valley.  It comes as the silver lining to 
the dark cloud just cast over us, and bids us take heart and hope in 
retrieving the sad calamity that has befallen us.  This great enterprise 
must give a new impulse to the business of Chambersburg and those who are 
first and boldest in appreciating the fact, will most profit by it.  
<p>
Dark as is the hour, let us not forget that it has the promise of future 
prosperity to our town.  Let us therefore make common cause to restore 
Chambersburg; to help the needy; to encourage the desponding, and to give 
prompt and permanent aid to make the town better if possible than 
before.  The man who erects the first good house on the ruins of the old 
one, will be the best benefactor of our people, and every man who 
imitates his examples will do a good deed alike for himself and for the 
most dependent around us.  One and all let us resolve that Chambersburg 
shall be rebuilt, that her population shall again sit down in prosperity 
where rebel brutality made withering desolation, and when once resolved 
upon, the good work will be more than half done.
