<p>The entrance of J.E.B. Stuart's calvary force of 1800 men into 
Chambersburg on October 10, 1862, marked the beginning of a series of
Rebel Invasions into the bustling Civil War border town.  Each of the three 
subsequent 
invasions brought more Confederate soldiers into the lives of 
Chambersburg citizens, caused more destruction, and made the home front 
less distinct from the battlefront.  This escalation of the idea of <a 
href=totalwar.htl>total war</a> culminated in the burning of Chambersburg 
by <a href=bios.html#mccausland> McCausland </a> in July of 1864, but had 
its roots 
in the earlier invasions of General <a href=bios.html#stuart>J.E.B. 
Stuart</a> in 1862, 
and Generals <a href=bios.html#lee> Robert E. Lee</a> and <a 
href=bios.html#jenkins>Albert G. Jenkins</a> in June of 1863.
Marked differences in the way that the Generals treated these earlier 
invasions separate them from the wanton destruction of McCausland's <a 
href=burning.html> burning of Chambersburg </a>. Stuart, Lee, and Jenkins 
all adhered to the "rules of war" in their invasion and occupation of 
Chambersburg in ways that McCausland did not.  Soldiers, however, were 
not quite so respectful of these rules.  The aggressive, "total war" 
behavior of the 
soldiers escalated in scale with each raid in a way that the orders of 
the Generals did not completely reflect.  Chambersburg 
sustained considerable damage at the hands of these invading forces, and 
this damage increased with each successive invasion.  The 
details and events of the earlier invasions reveal both the striking 
contrasts and the threads of similarity 
between the behavior of the Confederate Army toward the Northern Home 
Front before the summer of 1864.  The armies of Stuart, Jenkins, and Lee 
sought to occupy the North; McCausland sought to destroy it.<p>
<p>
	Stuart entered Chambersburg with explicit orders from commanding 
General Robert E. Lee to treat all citizens, including those who would be 
taken hostage, "with all the respect and consideration that circumstances 
will admit."  He goes on in this order to define for the invading forces 
what they are allowed to take:, "Should it be in your power to supply 
yourself with horses, or other necessary articles on the list of legal 
capture, you are authorized to do so.  Lee's instructions clearly 
delineate the boundaries between "legal capture" and that which would 
violate the respect and consideration of the people of Chambersburg.  
Stuart follows these orders in the orders that he gives to the troops 
himself, stating explicitly, "Individual plunder for private use is 
positively forbidden, and in every instance must be punished in the 
severest manner, for an army of plunderers consummates its own 
destruction."  The highest authorities in charge of the first raid of 
Chambersburg in 1862 made it clear to their troops that the town of 
Chambersburg was not to be made into a battlefield, and that its citizens 
were not to be treated as if they were enemy soldiers.  Their property 
and dignity was to be respected under all circumstances.<p> 
	For the most part, as this first raid played out, soldiers 
observed these "rules of war". They destroyed $250,000 in railroad 
property, stole 500 guns, and hundreds of horses, but all of these items 
fell into the category of legal capture.  Beyond that, though, 
Confederate forces were respectful of the citizens of Chambersburg.   The 
Valley Spirit noted on October 15, 1862 that "The town was surrendered on 
the terms 
that private property would be respected and citizens unmolested."  This 
article goes on to cast a vote of confidence for the integrity of the 
Confederate soldiers, "We feel confident that the whole force will be 
captured and stolen property returned."  Though Confederates took 
property from the citizens, it was understood that it was "legal 
capture", and some people even believed that the Confederates would 
return what they took.  William Heyser, a prominent town business man, 
spoke in his <a 
href=http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/vshadow2/personal/wheyser.html> 
diary</a>, on October 11, 1862, of the behavior of 
the troops, which likely inspired such confidence, "The troops were well 
disciplined and polite.  Not a single horse or person injured." <a 
href=bios.html>Alexander McClure </a>, a town leader, echoed Heyser's 
sentiment, "His (General Stuart's) demeanor to our people was that of a 
humane soldier.  In several instances his men commenced to take private 
property from stores, but they were arrested by General Stuart's provost 
guard.  In a single instance only, that I heard of, did they enter a 
store by intimidating the proprietor."  
Newspapers passed over the invasion without giving it much notice and 
residents remarked on the good behavior of the troops because in 
general Stuart and his men were respectful of the boundaries of the home 
front.<p>  
	Less than a year later, with the Civil war wearing on, 
the orders of the generals remained the same in their wording, but 
Confederate soldiers took them less literally.  Lee repeated 
the instructions of his 1862 order in his<a href=leeorder.html> order</a> 
for the second invasion, that "No private property shall be injured or  
destroyed by any person belonging to or connected with the 
army."  Along with this order, several aspects about this 
second raid were similar to the earlier one.  Confederate 
troops destroyed the Scotland Railroad Bridge, took horses 
and guns.  Again, Jenkins followed Stuart's lead in 
ordering his men to pay for goods that they bought from 
stores. <a href=hokewednesday.html> Jacob Hoke</a> recounts an instance in 
which General Jenkins says he ought "to cut your head off" to a soldier 
who tried to steal from a Chambersburg store.  Hoke talks 
about the amount of property taken, which he assessed at 
"not less than one hundred thousand dollars", but asserts 
in the spirit of the earlier raid, that, "True, many 
horses, cattle, and other things were taken, but all 
within the rules of the war, except the carrying away of 
free Negroes."<p>  
	The capture of African American citizens of Franklin County marks the 
one instance of Confederate departure from the 
code of conduct that bound them in the first raid.  The 
second invasion, in other ways, proved more invasive to the 
people on the homefront in Chambersburg.  Rachel 
Cormany lived through the 1863 raid, and speaks throughout her<a 
href=http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/vshadow2/personal/rcormany.html> 
 diary</a> about Confederate soldiers with much less respect than Heyser 
and McClure had in 1862.  "All forenoon they were 
carrying away men's clothing and darkeys."  Cormany 
continues to lament the treatment of the "darkeys" as 
Confederate soldiers searched for and rounded up the 
town's free blacks, "O! How it grated our hearts to 
have to sit quietly and look at such brutal deeds."  Black citizens had 
been taken before, in the raid of 1862, but not in such large numbers.  
In 1863, citizens ,lile Hoke and Cormany began to notice the brutality of 
this capture, and it represented an invasion of the soldiers into the 
lives of civilians, taking battle tactics of capture and using them on 
the home front.  
	The fact that citizens responded more strongly this time speaks to the 
increase in other "brutal deeds" during this invasion of 1863.  Later, on 
Sunday, June 28, groups of soldiers ransacked local stores.  Hoke's tone 
about the plunder inflicted by Confederate soldiers is decidedly 
different, "It is out of my power to give any estimate of the value of 
the property taken that day.  But it must be recollected that the losses 
of that day, as well as the losses by the Stuart and Jenkin's raids, were 
afterward supplemented by other depredations during the continuance of 
the invasion- on the Sunday following, especially- and by the destruction 
of the town a year later.  This much, however, can be said, that many 
persons who had toiled and economized for years to gain an honorable 
support, as well as lay up something for old age, were reduced to 
poverty."  Heyser's tone also changes.  He no longer praises the good 
behavior of the soldiers; rather, he notes the "dreadful accounts that 
the Rebels are still active about Chambersburg, and are robbing and 
stealing as before.  How much of this is true, I cannot say. . ."  What 
Heyser cannot say is not as important as what he does say.  His shift in 
focus, from being an observer of an occupying force in 1862, to one of 
an enemy, as his 1863 entry implies, marks the converging definitions of 
homefront and battle front.  These boundaries intersect in 1864 with the 
Burning of the town, destroying not only the respect of the soldiers for 
the private property of the town, but also, for the first time including the 
Generals in that destruction.  As Home Front and Battle Front merge, 
the Civil War moves along that line of the invasions of Chambersburg 
in 1862 and 1863 towards becoming a "total war".
