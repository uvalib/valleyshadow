By June of 1864, the people of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania were used to 
living the Civil War.  They had watched as their sons, fathers, and 
brothers left home to serve in the army.  Women had stepped in to fill 
the roles these men left behind.  Residents of Chambersburg had weathered 
two occupations by Confederate troops.  They had seen men from both sides 
trudge through their town square, wounded from battle.  From the time 
that the Civil War began up until the summer of 1864, Chambersburg, like 
many other border towns, witnessed the events of the Civil War from the 
vantage point of the Home Front.  It supported the war effort and it felt 
the impact of the struggle, but for the most part it was a home, not a 
battlefield.
<p>
History has typically delineated clearly the boundaries between this Home 
Front and the battlefront.  In July 1864 these lines melted away as 
Chambersburg burned to the ground.  Confederate General John McCausland's 
torch, 
whether lit in retaliation, anger, or duty, followed the pattern of the 
larger Civil War.  All over the country in the summer of 1864 the lines 
between home front and 
battlefront were disappearing, at the hands of Sherman, Hunter, Grant, 
and others.  Chambersburg was unique; it was the only Northern town 
reduced to ashes.  However, like many other towns, North and South, it felt 
the power of the war's progression towards "total war."  Like other Civil War 
home fronts, Chambersburg's Home Front became a battlefield as well.<p>
August of 1864 saw the people of Chambersburg attempt to rebuild their 
lives out of McCausland's ashes, and out of the entire war.  What they 
lost in the burning illuminates who they were in the past, and points 
towards an understanding about how they constructed their future.  The 
Summer of 1864 represents the larger time frame of the Civil War and the 
way it shaped one town.  Chambersburg's story stands out as an exception in 
the course of the history of the Civil War.  At the same time, its 
distinctiveness allows it to step into the story of the entire Civil War, 
of home front, battlefield, and the lives in between the two.
