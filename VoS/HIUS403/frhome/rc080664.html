<p><b>August 8, 1864</b>  Just a week this morning the rebels turned up in 
our devoted town again.  before they entered they roused us out of our 
slumbers by throwing to shells in.  this was between 3 & 4 A.M. by 5-they 
grey back hordes came pouring in.  They demanded 500,000 dollars in 
default of which the town would be burned-They were told that it was 
impossible to raise that amount-The reb's then came down to 100,000 in 
gold which was just as impossible.  when they were informed of the 
impossibility they deliberately went from house to house & fired it.  The 
whole heart of the town is burned.  they gave no time for people to get 
any thing out.  each had to escape for life & took only what they could 
first grab.  some save considerable.  other only the clothes on their 
backs-& even some of those were taken off as they escaped from their 
burning dwellings.  O! the 30th of July 1864 was a sad day to the people 
of Chambersburg.  In most of cases where the buildings were left money 
was paid.  They were here too but we talked them out of it.  We told them 
we were widdows & that saved us here.  About 3000 were made homeless in 
less than three hours.  This whole week has been one of great 
excitement.  We live in constant dread.  I never spent such days as these 
few last I never spent-I feel as if I could not stay in this country 
longer.  I feel quite sick of the dread & excitement.
