<p><center><b>WHY GENERAL EARLY BURNED CHAMBERSBURG</b>
<hr width=40>
<p><b>By B. L. Wynn, Charleston, Miss.</b>

<p>Touching the authenticity of the dispatch from General early in regard 
to the burning og Chambersburg, Pa., I will state that I was passing his 
tent when he asked me if we (signal) corps) had the line open to 
Stauton.  I replied that we had.  He then with pencil wrote and handed to 
me the message in question.  I sent it to Staunton, had it repeated back, 
and informed the General that it had been received and would be sent from 
there by wire to General Lee.  This among several other I preserved and 
brought home with me; but this one, the most important, I have been 
unable to find.  On Wednesday, August 3, I copied this dispatch from the 
originial into my diary, and from it I made the copy sent you.  There is 
no question as to its genuinenes or authenticity.  I would make affidavit 
to this statement.
<p>On August 2, 1864, General Lee sent the following:
<br><a name=order1>"General Early: 
<br>"The  6th and part of the 19th Corps still in Washington.  I think 
you can do good service in the Valley.  Break the railroads, collect 
supplies, and threaten Pennsylvania."
<br div align=right>"R. E. Lee"</div></a>

<p>Not having seen the autobiography of General Early, I can't say 
whether this dispatch is in it or not.  [It is in the book.] 

<p><a name=order2><div align=right>"Bunker Hill, August 3, 1864.</div><br>
"General Lee, Petersburg:<br>
"On the 30th of July McCausland entered Chambersburg and, by my orders, 
demanded $100,000 in gold or $500,000 in Northern money as compensation 
for several houses of citizens of Jefferson County burned by order of 
Hunter, with directions, in default of payment, to burn the town.  The 
money was not paid, and the town was burned.  I alone am responsible for 
this act.  Northern papers of the 2d acknowledge the defeat of Grant at 
Petersburg on the 30th with heavy loss.  The 6th and 19th Corps, after 
moving to Harper's Ferry, have retired down the river-in all probability 
to Frederick.<div align=right>J. A. Early, <i>Lieut. Gen."</i></div><br></a>

<p>Saturday, July 28, 1864, General Early telegraphed to General Lee: "The 
2d and 19th Corps have gone to Washington, and I will resume offensive 
operations to-morrow morning."

<p>General Lee telegraphed to General Early: "Transportation has been 
furnished for the 2d Corps to come back to Washington from Petersburg."  
He also saud that he (Early) must keep reenforcements from Grant.
<p><div align=right>"Saturday, June 4, I P.M.</div>
"Gen R. E. Lee:<br>
"I am at Turner's.  Heth had gone before your note was received directing 
his detention.  All quiet here.  Enemy's skirmishers came up toward 
Hunley's corner-to see what had become of us, I suppose.  No indication 
of an advance on their flank as yet.  My skirmishers are well out in 
front on the left.  I think I am secure, and will watch every opportunity.

<p><div align=right>"Headquarters A. N. V., April 21, 1864.</div>
"Generals Ewell and Hill:
"General Hoke reports that he assaulted enemy's works at Plymouth 
yesterday and captured them with one brigadier general, sixteen hundred 
officers and men, and twenty-five pieces of artillery.
<div align=right>R. E. Lee."</div>
<br>
"General Early:<div align=right>"September 12."</div>
"Enemy's cavalry within two and half miles of Winchester are now falling 
back.<div align=right>Fitz Lee <br> "September 14.</div><br>
"We are now in line of battle.  General Anderson is moving to intercept 
them.  Enemy has disappeared.
<div align=right>"B. L. Wynn, <i>Signal Corps."</i><br>
"Headquarters A. N. V., July 29, 1864.<br></div>
"General Early:
"Dispatch received.  Rosser won't be fit for duty for a month, I fear.  I 
recommended Ransom's application to be relieved soon.  Will McCausland do 
for a cavalry commander?<br>
"(Signed) R. E. Lee, <i>General.</i>
<p><div align=right>"Winchester, Va., August 18, 1864.</div>
"General Lee, Petersburg:<br>
"Yesterday morning Sheridan's forces were discovered falling back.  I 
immediately pursued and cam eup with a division of the 6th Corps and a 
large force of cavalry at this place, which I attacked and drove through 
the town, capturing over two hundred prisoners.  Wilson's division from 
Grant's Army has arrived and was in the field.  I hear of no new force of 
infantry.  The enemy has fallen back towards Harper's Ferry.  Anderson 
has effected a junction with me here.<br>
