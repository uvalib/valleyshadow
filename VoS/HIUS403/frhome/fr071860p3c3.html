neither strength or elasticity in her frame, "I used to be so feeble that I could not even lift a broom, and the least physical
exertion would make me ill for a week. One sweeping day I went bravely to work, cleaning thoroughly the parlors, three
chambers, the front stairs and hall, after which I lay down and rested until noon, when I arose and eat a heartier meal than for
many a day. Since that time I have occupied some portion of every day in active domestic labor, and not only are all my friends
congratulating me upon my improved appearance, but in my whole being--mind, body, and spirit--do I experience a wonderful
vigor, to which I have hitherto been a stranger. Young ladies try my Catholicon." </td></tr></table></body></html>
