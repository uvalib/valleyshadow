About eight o'clock this morning General Jenkins ordered the stores and 
shops to be opened for two hours, and that his men should be permitted to 
purchase such articles as they personally needed, but in all cases must 
pay for what they got. Business accordingly went on very briskly for awhile 
with those who had not removed or secreted their entire stock. Fortunately for
us and many others, but little was found in our stores; but what little we had
which the soldiers could buy under the order was quickly bought up and paid 
for in all imaginable kinds of scrip. Not only Confederate notes were paid us,
but shin - plasters issued by the city of Richmond and other southern 
corporations. While this 
traffic was in operation a Confederate soldier seized a number of remnants of 
ladies' dress goods, which we had left lie on the counter, not thinking them 
worth hiding, and putting them under his arm walked out and down past Jenkins'
 head - quarters. The General came quickly out and caught the fellow by the 
back of the neck and ran him back into the store on the double-quick, saying 
to us as he rushed him up to the counter, "Did this man get these here? 
and did he pay for them?" Upon being told that he had taken them and had not 
paid , for them, the General drew his sword, and flourishing it above the 
man's head and swearing terribly, said, "I've a mind to cut your head off." 
Then turning o us he said, “Sell my men all the goods they want; but if any on
attempts to take anything without paying for it, report to me at my head - 
quarters. We are not thieves.” Some of the officers visited the dru
stores of the town and made liberal purchases, telling the proprietors to 
make out their bills, or if they had not time to do so to guess at the 
amount and it would be paid.<p>
About nine o'clock, while we were doing a lively business, a soldier came 
riding at great speed from where the 
main body were stationed out oil the Harrisburg pike, and reported to Jenkins 
that the Yankees were coming. The general came out in great haste, and 
mounting his horse, and in a voice of great power, ordered the men to the 
front. A rush was made out the Harrisburg pike, and soon the town was free 
from the enemy, when we at once closed our places of business. In the course 
of an hour a number of men returned leading the horses, and went on down the 
road leading to Greencastle to the outskirts of the town a
nd there waited. Jenkins had dismounted his men and was prepared to fight the 
expected Yankees as infantry. They were armed with Enfield rifles as well as 
sabres. In the course of about an hour afterward, these dismounted men fell 
back and marched through
the town and out to where their horses were, and, after remounting, continued 
to fall back to the vicinity of Greencastle. The news of the occupation of 
our town by the Confederates was known all over the country, and great numbers
of people, as well as 
some Federal scouts, moved by curiosity, or a desire to ascertain precisely 
where the enemy were, had come within sight of the men in line of battle on 
Shirk's Hill. Seeing these, and bearing of the gathering of troops at 
Harrisburg, and that a large body was advancing, they were alarmed, and, 
supposing themselves to be in danger of being attacked in overwhelming 
numbers, or flanked and cut off, they fell back within supporting distance of 
the Confederate infantry at Williamsport.  As Jenkins and his staff rode up 
street after the dismounted men had all passed nearly out of sight, a 
number of our citizens were standing upon the pavement in front of the 
court-house. Supposing that they might be armed and intended to fire upon 
them, the general and his staff drew their pistols and rode toward the 
citizens. A stampede, of course, ensued. As the last of the soldiers was 
leaving the northern end of the town, they set fire to a large frame warehouse
then belonging to Messrs. Oaks & Linn, but it was speedily ,extinguished by 
the citizens in that vicinity. The firing of that warehouse, and the 
destruction of the Scotland railroad bridge, were the only acts of real 
destruction attempted. True, many horses, cattle, and other things were taken,
but all was within the rules of war, except the carrying away of free 
negroes.<p>
