A "contraband" relieved
another Merchant of a couple of hams in a sharp way. An attempt at "shoplifting" a piece of calico, by a woman, was made in
one of our stores the other day.--An overcoat was stolen from one of our Hotels last week. A young man was robbed on our
public streets a few nights ago, and several other thefts have been committed in and about town within a short time past. We
seem to be "advancing backwards" in honesty and morality, and as no arrests have been made, and nobody converted from the
"error of their ways," it is likely we'll keep advancing so far as law and gospel are concerned.</td></tr></table></body></html>
