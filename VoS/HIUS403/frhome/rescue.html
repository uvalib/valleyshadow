Only one week more remains for work before the most important election 
ever held in this Country.  You know its importance.  You recognize the 
fact that upon the result depends on the question whether we hall have 
the Union made by our fathers under the old Constitution or a "Strong 
Government" of Abolitionism, a centralization of power, and a Military 
Despotism--whether we shall have Constitutional freedom, or whether all 
the sacred rights guaranteed by the Constitution shall be forever taken 
away from the people.  You know that four years more of such rule will 
completely bankrupt and destroy the Country.
<p>
With these facts staring you in the face what are you doing?  Are you 
ready--are you organized?  Have you done all in you power to get out 
every Democratic and Conservative voter on the election day?  If you are 
not sensible of the importance of stirring every nerve for <i>McClellan, 
the Constitution: Union, Liberty, and Peace</i>, IN GOD'S NAME AWAKE.  
Defeat is dishonor, destruction, ruin.  VICTORY is our only hope of 
saving all that is worth living for.
<p>
Then forget all else for the next week.  Your own interest--the interests 
of posterity, the welfare of the Country--all call you to ACTION.  Rest 
not until the election is over.  Do you part; act like MEN--FREE MEN!  
Let not the ruin of your Country, once so great, so free, so happy, and 
prosperous, be laid at your doors.  Let us faithfully do our part, hoping 
that a beneficient Providence will smile upon our righteous cause, and 
for the sake of our suffering people, our bleeding country, and the cause 
of freedom throughout the world, give us the victory.
