the year. What, for instance, is cooler or more harmonious than a white robe.<p>A fashionable costume consists of three distinct parts--dress, fichu, and mantle-- all of which can be worn together or
separately. The skirt is of white muslin, and there are two flounces and two large bouillons, and two flounces and two bouillons
again. In the hem of the flounces is a blue, pink, or green rib and and a much wider one is run underneath the bouillons. The
corsage is low, lined with silk the color of the riband, and a petticoat of the same silk is worn with the skirt. The sleeves,
reaching to the middle of the arm, have two flounces and four bouillons, carried nearly up to the shoulder. At the waist is also a
riband, fastening either in front or behind, and, if the dress is preferred high, the shoulders can be covered with a fichu
composed of flounces and bouillons, and drawn at the throat with riband. For outdoors this toilet is completed by a mantle
trimmed to match the skirt and . . . [text missing] . . . length and voluminousness of this mantle that distinguishes it from all that
have been worn hitherto, and it is patronised by those ladies who are always on the watch for new and striking changes.
<p>For morning wear there is nothing equal to clear muslin, colored or figured, made with loose jacket or full bodice; either the
body or jacket is fastened in front by bows of muslin, the edges of which are rounded and edged with a guipure.
<p>Fashion in bonnets is nearly at a stand still, and our artists, for the time being, have ceased racking their brains for novelties. The
newest thing we can mention is a bonnet made of fine black hair, embroidered with buttercups in silken straw. The riband used
in trimming has a black ground, and the flowers at the side entirely black with jet centres. The effect of the combination is very
original, and it has the advantage of defying dust.
<p>The heat is too great for caps to be worn in the house, and their place is prettily supplied by resilles of silk lace. A wide riband
goes all round and terminates in a bow on one side; but, in order to render this coiffure perfectly graceful it should have
something like a light hood at the back. If the resille is made of gold or silver thread, it can be worn in the ball room by young
girls, and Spanish acorns, finely worked, serve to complete it. Fair women can wear the hood of the black lace, which keeps its
freshness and is not oppressively hot. Elderly ladies can line them with thin silk, and those who have plenty of hair have only to
put a flower on one side, and they are at once in possession of a charming coiffure. </td></tr></table></body></html>
