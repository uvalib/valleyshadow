We
found the room pretty well filled with ladies, engaged in the noble, patriotic and christian duty of providing clothing, and other
comforts, for our sick and wounded soldiers. We might say much in praise of our ladies, but this is an age in which noble
deeds bring their own reward. We will say this much, however, the ladies of Chambersburg will compare with any in existence,
in their efforts to provide for the wants, and relieve the suffering of our sick and wounded in the army. They have enlisted in the
good cause their nimble fingers and their noble, warm and patriotic hearts with a will. All honor then to our ladies who have
thus nobly evinced their patriotism and vindicated that judgment which the poet has pronounced upon their sex, and which the
world has applauded. <p>"When pain and anguish wring the brow,<br>
A ministering angel thou."</td></tr></table></body></html>
