Adjutant,
<p>
I would hereby make application to you for a leave of absence for the 
space of twenty days in order to visit my family at Chambersburg, Pa. 
and make provision for their comfort and happiness.  
<p>

I would state that four years ago I was a citizen of the State of 
Virginia, and was obliged on account of my Union sentiments to leave 
my home which was in Augusta County.  I took with me my family and 
settled in Chambersburg, Penn<sup>a</sup> of which place I was a 
resident until it was burned by M<sup>c</sup>Causlin.  I was then 
compelled to find a home for my family and through the kindness of one of 
the citizens, I received permission to occupy a portion of his house for 
my family, until I should have been able to make other arrangements.  The 
period allowed me for such occupancy enfired upon the 1<sup>st</sup> inst 
and I am exceedingly anxious to visit Chambersburg and provide suitable 
accomodations and a home for my wife and family.  I have no one capable 
of acting for me in my absence from home, hence my urgency in the matter. 

<p>

In October 1864 I entered the service as Ast. Sgn. of this regiment, and 
although there were many matters requiring my personal attention at home, 
I felt a delicacy in making application for a leave of absence from the 
fact that I had been in the service for so short a period of time.  I 
have thought however that the present was an opportune moment, when my 
services might be spared for the period asked for and my application meet 
with approval.

<p>

Requesting that this application be forwarded to the proper authority.  I am
