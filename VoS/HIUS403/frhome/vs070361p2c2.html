employed about Fisher's Hotel, for five or six months past, was discovered to have given birth to a child. Search was made and
the dead body of an infant found on the premises concealed in a bucket. An inquest was held on the body and a medical
examination proved the child to have been born alive. The girl admitted having given birth to the child but says it was still-born.
The jury considered that there was sufficient evidence that the child was born alive and that the unnatural mother was the cause
of its death. The girl was arrested and will be taken to prison as soon as her condition will admit of her being removed. </td></tr></table></body></html>
