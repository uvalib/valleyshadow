  Report of Brig. Gen. Bradley T. Johnson, C. S. Army:

  HDQRS. JOHNSON'S CAVALRY BRIGADE,
  Near Mount Jackson, August 10, 1864.
  COL.:*

  On the 4th [August] at daylight we moved on New Creek, this command
  in rear. On arriving there I was ordered by Brig.-Gen.
  McCausland to occupy a hill on the left with my whole command, post
  my artillery, and open on an inclosed work which was in our front. I
  attempted the movement as directed, and found the hills so precipitous
  that my men could hardly walk up, much less get the artillery there,
  and after advancing my skirmishers close to the hill designated found a
  block-house, a palisade work and abatis occupied by a few hundred of
  the enemy. I could have carried the place with a loss very heavy for
  my force, but finding that it would be impossible to get artillery there,
  and when occupied it would be fully 1,200 yards from the inclosed
  work, and that that work was open in rear and swept by a battery of six
  guns within short range, making it utterly untenable after being carried
  by assault, and it being too late for more extended operations, I
  determined, on consultation with Col. Peters, who was nearest me,
  not to attack, I accordingly drew off, reported the facts, and was
  ordered by Brig.-Gen. McCausland to cover his withdrawal,
  which I did. When his advance reached New Creek I was two miles
  and one-half in his rear. The reason of this was that I marched from
  beyond Romney, he from the mouth of Mill Creek, making my march
  fully seven miles longer than his. When I reached the foot of the
  mountain I found his column, or at least his ambulances, halted, and he
  having taken a road twenty-five miles from Romney to New Creek,
  instead of one eighteen miles, as he had led me to believe he would
  take, having changed the route without informing me, other than the
  bare order to follow him. I, in the absence of orders, inferred that he
  intended to break this long march by a halt to graze. He had halted long
  enough for me to close an interval of seven miles. I, therefore, also
  stopped, for precisely an hour from the time my rear got into the field
  until my advance again started. If, as I understand he reports, there
  were no men in the works at New Creek when he got there he ought to
  have taken them at once without waiting for me. But he ordered me to
  place artillery in a place utterly inaccessible for it, with only eleven
  rounds for two guns, which fact I reported to him when he gave me the
  order, and without having reconnoitered the position, he directed me to
  take it. If he had done so he never could have given the order. It is now
  my deliberate judgment that the post at New Creek can only be taken by
  assault of superior numbers, and that had I occupied the position
  designated by Gen. McCausland it would have been unavailing,
  inasmuch as the square work, the object of his attack, was perfectly
  commanded by another work in rear, and also by a work on the
  Maryland side mounted with heavy guns. It was, in fact, only the
  outpost of the position. The capture of it would have cost many men,
  only to be driven out instantly with the loss of more. Gen.
  McCausland, however, errs in thinking there were few men there. It has
  since appeared by a report that Gen. Kelley was there with the forces
  he had at Cumberland. I was an

  hour behind Gen. McCausland, and the delay could not have affected
  the result. The enemy were there and disposed of their men to meet
  attacks at each point so soon as threatened.

  Thence we moved to Moorefield, reaching there Friday, August 5, and
  went into camp, Gen. McCausland on the Moorefield side of the
  South Branch and this command along the Romney road, the only place
  I could get grass, my outside regiment four miles and a half from
  Moorefield, my nearest three-fourths of a mile from Gen.
  McCausland, who was three miles from that town. The camp was
  indicated by him, and I received orders, as I did during the expedition,
  every-where and in every place, where to place my pickets. He
  designated three roads--the Romney, Patterson's Creek, and Williamsport
  roads. They were accordingly picketed as he ordered. He directed no
  scouts along my front and I send none out. He being my commanding
  officer, having access to all means of information, choosing his own
  camps, routes, and times of march, I consider it was not my place to
  send scouts without his order.

  At 2 a. m. Sunday, August 7, I received a verbal order by a courier
  from him, informing me that Averell had passed through Romney the
  preceding evening with three brigades of cavalry, and directing me to
  saddle up my command and send out a scout on the Romney road. I
  instantly sent a courier to each regiment, transmitting the order; it was
  promptly obeyed by each officer. I, at the same time, sent a scout on
  the Romney road from the Eighth Virginia Cavalry. This was the first,
  last, and only intimation I ever received from Gen. McCausland of
  the proximity of the enemy, and the only order I ever received from him
  on the subject. The order itself was calculated to assure me that there
  was no danger of immediate attack. Had he thought it was imminent, he
  would doubtless have at least ordered me to form and mount my
  command, if not to take a position to resist attack. My camp was no
  place to fight in, being a level, with all positions for artillery in favor
  of an approaching enemy, and had a fight been anticipated I should
  doubtless have been withdrawn to the fine range of hills on his (Gen.
  McCausland's) side of the river. About daylight a squadron in
  Confederate uniform moved by the camp of the First Maryland straight
  to my headquarters. This who were up and saw them supposed them to
  be a returning scout or picket, and took no notice of them. They never
  fired a shot until they reached McNeill's house, where my camp was.
  Soon after them came a body of Federal cavalry, who rode at once
  through the camp of the First Maryland to that of the Second Maryland
  and dispersed both, they being very small, reduced by losses in battle
  and hard marching to an aggregate for both of not 130 men in camp, the
  First having twenty-eight men on picket. Maj. Seeney, Thirty-sixth
  Virginia Battalion, was rapidly pressed back to my headquarters, when
  Lieut. McNulty, with two pieces of artillery, doubly charged with
  canister, sought to stop the enemy, but his cannoneers were swept from
  their pieces by a charge in flank. From the back door of my
  headquarters, they being around me, I galloped to the Eighth Virginia
  Cavalry to get them to charge, passing around the front of their column
  to get there. It was then too late; the Eighth were moving off in good
  order, but neither their colonel nor myself could wheel them in time.
  Col. Peters then had the Twenty-first Regt. well in hand, but was
  unable to check the charge until he had passed beyond the river into
  Gen. McCausland's camp, where he formed and stopped their
  crossing for some time, with a loss to them, since ascertained, of 2
  majors and 38 men. My object heretofore

  PAGE 6-90   OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. LV.
  [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.]

  
  had been to check them until I could pass the river, where I expected to
  find Brig.-Gen. McCausland with his command well in hand,
  who would hold them while I got in position by him, when I had no
  doubt of the result. Brig.-Gen. McCausland was not there. He
  had slept in the town of Moorefield, three miles distant from his camp,
  and did not leave there until between daylight and sunrise, and when he
  did get on the ground his own command was scattered, some up the
  Winchester road and some down the Moorefield road. I ordered up the
  Twenty-seventh [Virginia Battalion], Capt. Gibson, and with Col.
  Peters formed a line to stop their farther advance, which he did for a
  short time, while I went to get him a support. He was, however, forced
  back, and both himself and Capt. Gibson wounded and taken
  prisoners. They were left at Moorefield. After this the enemy only
  followed me, but made no other attack. Beyond Moorefield I got the
  command in tolerable order, and Gen. McCausland directed me to
  hold a position while he hurried on the Matthews' with the fragments of
  two regiments to join the rest of his command, which had gone up the
  Winchester road, and which he had directed to join him there. They did
  not do so, and the parts of regiments whose withdrawal this command
  covered were the only organized parts of his brigade that I have heard
  of getting off.

  The way in which the enemy got in was this, as told by Private Callan,
  Company F, First Maryland Cavalry, to his brother, my orderly, when
  both were prisoners--the latter escaped: The scout from the Eighth
  having passed beyond the picket on the Romney road, about 3 a. m. or
  very early that morning, every man of it was captured by the enemy.
  Two men in gray uniform rode up to the two sentinels on outpost, and
  being challenged replied "They were scouts from the Eighth Virginia."
  After exchanging a word or two one rode back to pick up something lost
  from his saddle, and immediately returned with twenty more who
  captured the whole post. At the reserve they came up and said they were
  a relief from the Eighth virginia, and some of the men saying to those
  on picket, "Get your horses, you are relieved." Thus scout, picket, and
  reserve were captured by the enemy uniformed as Confederates, who
  then rode in my camp without giving any alarm. A Yankee sergeant,
  captured by Capt. Emack, of my staff, told him that a man who had
  been in camp to have a stolen horse restored had guided them to the
  picket and my headquarters.

  This great disaster would have at once been retrieved but for the
  insufficient armament of the command. Besides the First and Second
  Maryland and a squadron of the Eighth Virginia there was not a saber
  in the command. In that open country, perfectly level, the only mode to
  fight charging cavalry was by charging, and this the men were unable
  to do. The long Enfield musket once discharged could not be reloaded,
  and lay helpless before the charging saber. With any equal chaced the
  enemy would at once have been driven back. The largest porion of the
  command remained steady, and after passing Moorefield were held in
  hand with ease. I reached the Valley with about 300 men missing (150 have
  come in), leaving that number as my net loss killed, wounded, and missing.

  I should have here stopped this narrative, but circumstances which
  have come to my knowledge render it necessary for me, in justice to
  myself and this command, to speak more plainly than I had intended to.
  Brig.-Gen. McCausland was in command of the expedition. He
  selected is own camps, routes, and lines of pickets. He always gave me
  orders when to camp, to march, and to picket, and I always obeyed.

  CHAP. LV.]   ACTION AT NEW CREEK AND MOOREFIELD, W. VA.   PAGE 7-90
  [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.]

  
  He had command of McNeill's company, a numerous and well-mounted
  body of scouts, well acquainted with the country, and through them he
  ought to have had full knowledge of the proximity of the enemy. If they
  were not accessible to him it was his duty to order scouts to ascertain
  his whereabouts and not mine. If he did know Averell was near and
  expected an attack, he gave me no notice of it whatever, the mere order
  to saddle up being preparatory to a move, or a march, and not a
  commanding officer's order to his subordinates to prepare for battle.
  The only intimation or order of any kind whatever that I ever received
  from Gen. McCausland on the subject was the verbal one by a
  courier. But he did not expect an attack. In proof of this I refer to the
  fact that when the attack was made Brig.-Gen. McCausland was
  asleep in the house of Mr. McMechen, three miles from his camps or
  any of his command, and further, that some portion of his own brigade
  was unsaddled and utterly unprepared. He never reached the scene of
  action until after a portion of my command had passed the river. I
  suppose he was not there when his own brigade became separated, one
  part taking the Moorefield road and the other the winchester grade. If
  he had been on the ground anticipating an attack he would doubtless
  have had his command formed and made fight, neither of which he did,
  for besides one charge by a light squadron near the ford and a line of
  dismounted men above it I saw no fighting done by him near the river.
  From these facts I infer that Brig.-Gen. McCausland, first, was
  unprepared for an attack himself, and therefore could not expect me, his
  subordinate, to be prepared; or, second, that anticipating attack he
  neglected to give me due and timely notice, and neglected to put his
  troops in position to repel it. It is due to myself and the cause I serve to remark on the outrageous
  conduct of the troops on this expedition. This duty I informed Gen.
  McCausland I should perform during the expedition itself. Every crime
  in the catalogue of infamy has been committed, I believe, except murder
  and rape. Highway robbery of watches and pocket-books was of
  ordinary occurrence; the taking of breast-pins, finger-rings, and earrings
  frequently happened. Pillage and sack of private dwellings took place
  hourly. A soldier of an advance guard robbed of his gold watch the
  Catholic clergyman of Hancock on his way from church on Sunday, July
  31, in the publish steeds. Another of a rear guard nearly brained a
  private of Company B, First Maryland Cavalry, for trying to prevent his
  sacking a woman's trunk and stealing her clothes and jewels. A
  lieutenant at Hancock exacted and received $1,000 in greenbacks of a
  citizen; a soldier packed up a woman's and a child's clothing, which he
  had stolen in the presence of the highest official, unrebuked. At
  Chambersburg, while the town was in flames, a quartermaster, aided
  and directed by a field officer, exacted ransom of individuals for their
  houses, holding the torch in terror over the house until it was paid.
  These ransoms varied from $750 to $150, according to the size of the
  habitation. Thus the grand spectacle of a national retaliation was reduced
  to a miserable huckstering for greenbacks. After the order was given to
  burn the town of Chambersburg and before, drunken soldiers paraded
  the streets in every possible disguise and paraphernalia, pillaging and
  plundering and drunk. as the natural consequence, lawlessness in
  Pennsylvania and Maryland reproduced itself in Virginia, and in Hardy
  County, near Moorefield, a lieutenant knocked down and kicked an aged
  woman who has two sons in the Confederate army, and after choking
  the sister locked her in a stable and set fire to it. This was because the
  two women would not give up horses he and his fellow

  PAGE 8-90   OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. LV.
  [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.]

  
  thieves wished to steal. Pressing rapidly along, marching day and night,
  in most instances criminals guilty of these acts cannot be identified, but
  I believe a higher tone of morals and discipline may be infused in any
  Confederate soldier which will restrain him form disgracing himself and
  his countrymen by such deeds. Had there been less plunder there would
  have been more fighting at Moorefield on Sunday, August 7. I tried,
  and was seconded by almost every officer of my command, but in vain,
  to preserve the discipline of this brigade, but it was impossible; not
  only the license afforded was too great, but actual example gave them
  excuse and justification.

  In view of the necessity that the public service demands of the
  investigation of this whole matter, and that the responsibility for the
  Moorefield disaster be placed where it belongs, I respectfully ask that
  a court of inquiry be convened at once.

  I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

  orders to march to Winchester at 2 a. m. 7th. No information of
  re-enforcements to Early has been gained. The order for the burning of
  Chambersburg was given by Early. McCausland's expedition was
  considered of great importance; parts of other cavalry divisions were
  dismounted to fit him out.

  -----------
EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,
  Harrisburg, August 9, 1864.
  TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE
  COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA:

  GENTLEMEN: I have called you together in advance of your adjourned
  session for the purpose of taking some action for the defense of the
  State. From the commencement of the present rebellion Pennsylvania
  has done her whole duty to the Government. Lying, as her southern
  counties do, in the immediate vicinity of the border, and thus exposed
  to sudden invasion, a selfish policy would have led her to retain a
  sufficient part of her military force for her own defense. In so doing she

  PAGE 752-90   OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. LV.
  [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.]

  
  would have failed in her duty to the whole country. Not only would her
  men have been withheld from the field of general operations, but the
  loans and taxation which would have become necessary would have, to
  a large extent, diminished the ability of her people to comply with the
  pecuniary demands of the United States. She would also have
  necessarily interfered with and hampered all the military action of the
  Government and made herself, to some extent, responsible for any
  failures and shortcomings that may have occurred. In pursuance of the
  policy thus deliberately adopted this State has steadily devoted her men
  to the general service. From the beginning she has always been among
  the first to respond to the call of the United States, as is shown by her
  history, from the three-months' men and the Reserve Corps to the present moment.

  Thus faithfully fulfilling all her own obligations, she has a right to be
  defended dy the national force, as part of a common country; any other
  view would be absurd and unjust. She, of course, cannot complain when
  she suffers by the necessary contingencies of war. The reflection that
  have, in too many quarters, been made upon the people of her southern
  counties, are most unfounded. They were invaded in 1862, when a Union
  army much superior to any force of the rebels (and on which they had
  of course a right to rely) was lying in their immediate vicinity and north
  of the Potomac. They were again invaded in 1863, after the defeat of
  the Union forces under Milory at Winchester, and they have again
  suffered in 1864, after the defeat of the Union forces under Crook and
  Averell. How could an agricultural people, in an open country, be
  expected to rise suddenly and beat back hostile forces which had
  defeated organized veteran armies of the Government? It is of course
  expected that the inhabitants of an invaded country will do what is in
  their power to resist the invaders, and the facts hereinafter stated will
  show, I think, that the people of these counties have not failed in this duty.

  If Pennsylvania, by reason of her geographical position, has required to
  be defended by the national force, it has only been against the common
  enemy. It has never been necessary to weaken the army in the field, by
  sending heavy detachments of veterans to save her cities from being
  devastated by small bands of ruffians composed of their own inhabitants.
  Nor have her people been disposed to sneer at the great masses of law
  abiding citizens, in any other State, who have required such protection.
  Yet, when a brutal enemy, pursuing a defeated body of Union forces,
  crosses our border and burns a defenseless town, this horrid barbarity,
  instead of firing the hearts of all the people of our common country, is
  actually, in some quarters, made the occasion of mocks and gibes at the
  unfortunate sufferers, thousands of whom have been rendered houseless,
  and these heartless scoffs proceed from the very men who, when the
  State authorities, foreseeing the danger, were taking precautionary
  measures ridiculed the idea of there being any danger, sneered at the
  exertions to prepare for meeting it, and succeeded to some extent in
  thwarting their efforts to raise forces. These men are themselves morally
  responsible for the calamity over which they now chuckle and rub their
  hands. It might have been hoped--nay, we had a right to expect--that the
  people of the loyal States, engaged in a command effort to preserve their
  Government and all that is dear to freemen, would have forgotten, at
  least for the time their wretched local jealousies and sympathized with
  all their loyal fellow-citizens wherever resident within the borders of our
  common country. It should be remembered that the original source of
  the present rebellion was in

  CHAP. LV.]   CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.--UNION.   PAGE 753-90
  [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.]

  
  such jealousies, encouraged for wicked purposes by unscrupulous
  politicians. The men who, or any purpose, now continue to encourage
  them, ought to be held as public enemies--enemies of our Union and our
  peace--and should be treated as such. Common feelings, common
  sympathies, are the necessary foundations of a common free
  government. I am proud to say that the people of Pennsylvania feel
  every blow at any of her sister States as an assault upon themselves, and
  give to them all that hearty good will, the expression of which is
  sometimes more important, under the infliction of calamity, than mere
  material aid.

  It is unnecessary to refer to the approach of the rebel army up the
  Shenandoah Valley on the 3d day of July last; to the defeat of Gen.
  Wallace on the Monocacy; their approach to and threatening of the
  capital; or the their destruction of property and pillage of the counties
  of Maryland, lying on our border.

  These events have passed into history, and the responsibilities will be
  settled by the judgment of the people. At that time a call was made upon
  Pennsylvania for volunteers, to be mustered the service of the United
  States, and "to serve for 100 days in the States of Pennsylvania and
  Maryland, and at Washington and its vicinity."

  Notwithstanding the embarrassments which complicated the orders for
  their organizations and muster, six regiments were enlisted and
  organized, and a battalion of six companies. The regiments were
  withdrawn from the State, the last leaving the 29th day of July. I desired
  that at least part of this force should be confined in their service to the
  States of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and made such an application to
  the War Department. As the proposition did not meet their approbation
  it was rejected and the general order changed to include the States
  named and Washington and its vicinity.

  No part of the rebel army at that time had come within the State. The
  people of the border counties were warned, and removed their stock,
  and at Chambersburg and York were organized and armed for their own
  protection.

  I was not officially informed of the movements of the Federal armies,
  and, of course, not of the strategy of their commanders; but it was
  stated in the newspapers that the rebel army was closely pursued after
  it had crossed the Potomac, and was retiring up the Valley of the
  Shenandoah. Repeated successes of our troops were also announced, and
  the people of this State had just cause to believe that quite a sufficient
  Federal force had been thrown forward for its protection upon the line
  of the Potomac.

  On Friday, the 29th day of July, the rebel brigades of Johnson and
  mcCausland, consisting of 2,500 to 3,000 mounted men, with six guns,
  crossed the Potomac at Clear Spring ford. They commenced crossing at
  10 a. m. and marched directly on Mercersburg. There were but
  forty-five men picketed in that direction, under the command of
  Lieut. McLean, U. S. Army, and as the enemy succeeded in cutting
  the telegraph communication, which from that point had to pass west by
  way of Bedford, no information could be sent to Gen. Couch, by
  telegraph, who was then at Chambersburg. The head of this column
  reached Chambersburg at 3 a. m. on Saturday, the 30th.

  The rebel brigades of Vaughn and Jackson, numbering about 3,000
  mounted men, crossed the Potomac at about the same time at or near
  Williamsport--part of the command advanced on Hagerstown; the main
  body moved on the road leading from Williamsport to Greencastle.

  
  48 R R--VOL XLIII, PT I

  PAGE 754-90   OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. LV.
  [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.]

  
  Another rebel column of infantry and artillery crossed the Potomac
  simultaneously at Shepherdstown and moved toward Leitersburg.
  Gen. Averell, who commanded a force reduced to about 2,600 men,
  was at Hagerstown, and being threatened in front by Vaughn and
  Jackson, on his right by McCausland and Johnson, who also threatened
  his rear, and on his left by the column which crossed at Shepherdtown,
  he therefore fell back upon Grencastle.

  Gen. Averell it is understood was under the orders of Gen.
  Hunter, but was kept as fully advised by Gen. Couch as was possible
  of the enemy's movement on his right and to his rear. Gen. Couch
  was in Chambersburg, where his entire force consisted of sixty infantry
  and forty-five cavalry and a section of a battery of artillery, in all less
  than 150 men. The six companies of men enlisted for 100 days
  remaining in the State and two companies of cavalry had, under orders
  from Washington (as I am officially advised), joined Gen. Averell.
  The town of Chambersburg was held until daylight by the small force
  under Gen. Couch, during which time the Government stores and
  train were saved. Two batteries were then planted by the enemy,
  commanding the town, and it was invested by the whole command of
  Johnson and McCausland. At 7 a. m. six companies of dismounted men,
  commanded by Sweeney, entered the town, followed by mounted men,
  under Gillmore. The main force was in line for battle. A demand was
  made for $100,000 in gold or $500,000 in Government funds, as
  ransom, and a number of citizens were arrested and held as hostages for
  its payment. No offer of money was made by the citizens of the town,
  and even if they had any intentions of paying a ransom, no time was
  allowed, as the rebels commenced immediately to burn and pillage the
  town, disregarding the appeals of women and children, the aged and
  infirm, and even the bodies of the dead were not protected from their
  brutality. It would have been vain for all the citizens of the town, if
  armed, to have attempted, in connection with Gen. Couch's small
  force, to defend it. Gen. Couch withdrew his command, and did not
  himself leave until the enemy were actually in the town. Gen.
  Averell's command being within nine miles of Chambersburg, it was
  hoped would arrive in time to save the town, and efforts were made
  during the night to communicate with him. In the meantime the small
  force of Gen. Couch held the enemy at bay. Gen. Averell marched
  on Chambersburg, but did not arrive until after the town was burned,
  and the enemy had retired. He pursued and overtook them at
  McConnellsburg, in Fulton County, in time to save that place from
  pillage and destruction. He promptly engaged and defeated them, driving
  them to Hancock and across the Potomac.

  I commend the houseless and ruined people of Chambersburg to the
  liberal benevolence of the Legislature, and suggest that a suitable
  appropriation be made for their relief. Similar charity has been
  heretofore exercised in the case of an occidental and destructive fire at
  Pittsburg, and I cannot doubt the disposition of the Legislature on the
  present occasion.

  On the 5th day of this month a large rebel army was in Maryland, and
  at various points on the Potomac as far west as New Creek, and as there
  was no adequate force within the State I deemed it my duty on that day
  to call for 30,000 volunteer militia for domestic protection. They will
  be armed, transported, and supplied by the United States; but as no
  provision is made for their payment it will be necessary, should you
  approve my action, to make an appropriation for that purpose.

  Feeling it to be the duty of the Gen. Government to afford full
  protection to the people of Pennsylvania and Maryland by the defense
  of the line of the Potomac, I united with Governor Bradford in the
  following letter to the President, dated July 21, 1864:

  STATE  OF MARYLAND, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
  Annapolis, July 21, 1864.
  His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
  President of the United States:
  SIR: The repeated raids across the Potomac River made by portions of
  the rebel army, and the extent of the damage they have succeeded so
  frequently in inflicting, have most injuriously affected the people of
  Maryland and Pennsylvania in the neighborhood of that river, and many
  of them, it is believed, as the only security against such losses in the
  future, are seriously considering the propriety of abandoning their
  present homes and seeking safety at the north.

  It seems to us that nor merely in this sectional aspect of the case, but in
  its rebellious States is an object justifying and requiring a disposition of
  a portion of the national force with an especial view to its defense. The
  Potomac River can only be crossed, in its ordinary state of water, at
  some five or six fords, and we propose to enlist from our respective
  States a volunteer force that shall be sufficient, with the aid of the
  fortifications which the force itself can speedily construct, to effectually
  guard them all. We ask of the Government that the recruits so raised
  shall be credited to the quotas of our several States, on the call last
  made, and be armed, equipped, and supplied as other volunteers in the service.

  We are aware that, as a general rule, well-founded objections exist to
  the enlistment of a force to be exclusively used for home or local
  defense; but we regard such a service as we now suggest as an
  exceptional case, and the complete protection of this part of our frontier
  as of admitted national importance.

  Soon after the outbreak of this rebellion the importance of a special
  defense of the region bordering on the upper Potomac was recognized
  by the Government, and the Hon. Francis Thomas, of Maryland,
  was authorized by it to raise three regiments with a view to the
  protection of the counties on either side of that river. These regiments
  were raised, but the subsequent exigencies of the service required their
  employment elsewhere, and they therefore afford at present no particular
  security to that region beyond other troops in the service.

  The necessity, as we think, for some peculiar provision has now become
  so obvious that we would with great respect, but most earnestly, urge
  upon Your Excellency the expediency of acceding to the suggestions we
  have made, and we will immediately set about raising the forces
  required, and we have no doubt they will be promptly procured.

  We have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servants,
  A. W. BRADFORD.
  A. G. CURTIN.
