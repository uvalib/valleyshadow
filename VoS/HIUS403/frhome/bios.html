invasion in 
Maryland and Pennsylvania in 1864. For a time Early was a practicing

to destory the town decades later.  In 1864 Jubal was ordered to invade 
the North to draw Union forces away from Richmond and Lynchburg.  His 
raid was very success and he almost captured Washington, D.C. In his career he ransomed several cities including Hagerstown and 
Frederick.  Until his death, Gen. Early always stood by his decision to 
burn Chambersburg as appropriate retaliation for Union destruction in the

turned on his home state and became one its most hated enemies.

orders to lay waste to the region.  Hunter took this to heart and 
embarked on a campaign destroying family farms, warehouses, 
railroad, and stores.  He entered Lexington on June 11 and set fire to 
the Virginia Military Institute and Governor Letcher's home.  This 
unlimited warfare campaign devastated the countryside and forced the 
Confederate army to respond with an invasion into the North, both for 
retaliation and to relieve pressure on the Valley.
