<img src=images/t.gif>he month of August 1864 represents the reaction and 
recovery from the 
<a href=burn.html>burning of Chambersburg</a>.  The Civil War had 
transcended the battlefront 
and made a lasting impact on the Franklin County homefront.  Citizens of 
this once booming town were suddenly left without homes, businesses, or personal
belongings.  At first, residents of Chambersburg were infuriated, 
expressing their anger not only toward the southern soldiers, but also to 
northern writers who expressed little sympathy for the victims of the 
burning.  The election of 1864 provides evidence of bitter memories of 
the burning, but also demonstrates a willingness to view the war in a 
larger, national picture, not a smaller, more local one.   Feeling the 
pressure of economic failure, Chambersburg quickly recovered from its losses and local businesses began to reopen. 
Although several years passed before the town was fully reconstructed, 
by filing real estate and personal property claims from the burning 
during the spring of 1866, Chambersburg citizens were soon rebuilding 
their lives.
