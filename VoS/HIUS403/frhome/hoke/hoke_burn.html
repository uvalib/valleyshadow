    <p>In the campaign of the spring of 1864, General Hunter succeeded General Sigel in the
    Shenandoah Valley, and by the orders of General Grant, advanced upon Lynchburg,
    Virginia, with the view of destroying the enemy's resources at that place. On the 5th of
    June he met the enemy at Piedmont and defeated him. Forming a junction on the 8th,
    with Crook and Averell at Staunton, he moved directly on Lynchburg by way of
    Lexington, reaching the latter place on June 10th. Up to this time Hunter had been very
    successful, and the destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories had
    been very great. To meet this movement General Lee sent General Early with
    his corps, a part of which reached Lynchburg in advance of Hunter. After
    some skirmishing on the 17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of
    ammunition, declined to give battle, and found himself under the necessity of
    retiring from the place, and abandoning the chief object of his expedition.
    This want of ammunition, and consequent inability to meet the force sent
    against him, compelled him to choose as the route of his return the way of
    the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up the Ohio River, and returning to
    Harper's Ferry by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This movement uncovered the valley, 
    and Early, after some show of pursuit upon the route
    Hunter had taken, fell back to the valley and rapidly advanced toward the
    Potomac. Crossing this river on Thursday, July 7th, he turned hastily to-
    ward the National Capital, defeating the Federal force under General Lewis
    Wallace at the Monocacy River, on Saturday, July 9th. On Tuesday, the 12th,
    the advance of his army came up in front of the defenses of Washington,
    but finding them too strong to be carried, and fearing that the gathering
    forces might cut his communications, Early, in the morning of the 13th, fell
    back, recrossing the river at Edward's Ferry, and passing through Snicker's
    Gap with an immense train of plunder, which he had gathered by the way,
    encamped about Martinsburg. The Federal force under General Hunter,
    having arrived from the west, crossed the river and engaged Early, and
    were finally compelled to recross and take position from Hancock, Maryland,
    to Harper's Ferry, the main body being at the latter place. Each army had
    cavalry stationed upon its flanks. The brigade of General John A. McCausland was place upon Early's left; the command of General Averell was
    upon the Federal right and confronting McCausland. This was substantially the situation up to Thursday,     July 28th. It is needless to say that the proximity of the
    Confederates, and their bold and aggressive movements, caused intense excitement
    and alarm all along the Southern border of the tier of counties immediately threatened.
    
    <p>On Thursday, July 28th, General Early directed General McCausland to take his own
    brigade of mounted infantry and the cavalry brigade of General Bradley T. Johnson, the
    two numbering about two thousand nine hundred Allen, and proceed to
    Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and after capturing it, levy a tribute upon it of one
    hundred thousand dollars in gold, or five hundred thousand dollars in United States
    currency, and in default of the payment of either to burn the town. On this same day
    these two brigades were assembled at or near Hammond's Mill, in Berkeley County,
    West Virginia. During the ensuing night the Federal pickets on the north side of the
    Potomac were captured, and in the early morning of Friday, 29th, the command crossed
    at Cherry Run and McCoy's fords, and with but little opposition advanced by way of
    Clearspring and Mercersburg upon Chambersburg. The first knowledge the citizens of
    the latter place had of the approach of the enemy was at about half past twelve o'clock
    of this day, when a scene of indescribable confusion at once took place. The contents
    of the bank, stores, shops, and many private houses were hurriedly removed and
    secreted, - an experience which the people of that place, and other towns along the
    southern border, had often undergone.
    
     <p>About ten o'clock at night the Confederate force came up to the high hills two miles
    west of town.  At this place they remained during the night, kept back probably by the
    firing of a single gun, which, with a few men -all the soldiers then at this place-had been
    sent to retard the approach of the enemy.
    
     <p>Chambersburg at this time was the head -quarters of the military district of the
    Susquehanna, arid although General Couch, its commander, had organized regiment
    after regiment specially to guard the southern border, they were, as soon as organized,
    ordered to Washington to meet the danger threatening that place. His inability, then, to
    meet this emergency may be seen in the fad that during the time Early was raiding
    Maryland and threatening the Capital, his whole available force in the department did
    not exceed three hundred men, and at this time he had but one hundred and thirty -five
    under his command, of whom but about forty, including himself and staff, were in the
    town. It will thus be seen that while the people of the southern border had a military
    department, well and ably officered, they were without troops, and that too at one of
    the most threatening periods of the war.
     
 <a name=scenes></a>   
<p>At an early hour in the morning- Saturday, July 30th - General McCausland</a>
    placed about two thousand of his command in line upon a hill near the western
    suburb of the town, and about one mile from its center. Six pieces of artillery were
    also placed in position, and three shells were fired into the place without any notice
    to the citizens. The remaining nine hundred of the force were sent into the town, and
    the Court House bell was rung as a sign for the citizens to assemble to hear his
    requisition. No response being made, a guard under Major Harry Gilmore, of
    Baltimore, was sent around, who captured some six or eight of our leading men and
    conducted them to front of the Court House.  Captain Fitzhugh, McCausland's chief
    of staff then read to them General Early's requisition, demanding the immediate
    payment of one hundred thousand dollars in gold, or five hundred thousand dollars
    in United States currency, and in default of payment ordering the destruction of the
    town. This order stated that this requisition and threat, burning were in retaliation for
    acts of destruction committed by Gen. Hunter in the Valley of Virginia, and specially
    naming some half dozen dwellings which he had burned. The money demanded was
    not, and could not be paid, for the reason that there was nothing like the amount
    demanded remaining in the town. Besides the citizens did not feel like contributing
    aid in the overthrow of their government. While these negotiations going on the
    work of plunder had already been commenced. Stores, and other places of business
    were broken into and robbed of what their contents yet remained unremoved or
    unsecreted. In some cases were opened and liquor obtained and some of the soldiers
    became intoxicated. Citizens, too, along the streets were relieved of hats, caps, shoes,
    watches, etc.
<a name=burning></a>
    <p>As soon as General McCausland saw that the money demanded would not  be
    furnished he gave the order to commence the work of destruction.  Detachments
    were sent to different parts of the town. Houses were opened, furniture was broken
    and piled upon heaps in rooms and fired. In some cases fire was kindled in closets,
    bureaus, and other depositories of, clothing.  Many of the Confederate soldiers
    entered into this work with evident delight, and to the entreaties and tears of the
    aged, the infirm, of women and children, they turned a deaf ear. Others, to their credit
    be it said, entirely disapproved of the work, and only entered upon it because
    compelled to do so. In some instances, in response to the cries and entreaties of the
    inmates of houses entered, the unwilling soldiers would say: "I must obey my orders
    and fire your house; you can do what you please when I leave."  In some cases, after
    fire had been kindled, others would come in extinguishing it. Some sections of the
    town were entirely saved because  the officers sent there refused to execute their barbarous orders, and in a few cases officers and soldiers worked with citizens at the fire engine to extinguish the flames.
    Cases were numerous in which valuable articles were taken from those who were
    dragging them from their burning homes, or through streets and alleys, up upon the
    horses by their riders and safely deposited upon the outskirts of the town. Others
    again were robbed of valuable articles which they were trying to carry away. The writer,
    while running with his family through flame and smoke, was pursued and stopped by a
    Confederate cavalryman and ordered to hand over a satchel, When assured that it
    contained neither money nor valuables, but a few pieces of clothing, the man desisted
    and rode away. No sooner did this one leave us than another rode up and entreated
    one of the ladies of our company to mount his horse and ride away, declaring that he
    would never use him again in the Confederate service.
    
     <p>The scenes enacted in the streets during the earlier part of the burning were
    distressing indeed. People were running wildly about in search of children and friends.
    The occupants of houses were dragging from their threatened or burning homes
    valuable articles, such as sewing machines, articles of furniture, etc. Others with their
    arms full of clothing, bedding, carpets, books, pictures, etc., were running hither and
    thither seeking places of safety. In some cases these persons were compelled to sit
    down and pull off their boots and hand them over to some cavalryman,
    
     <p>In a town the size of Chambersburg there were necessarily many aged, infirm,
    and sick persons, as well as some dead bodies of friends awaiting burial. The infirm had
    to be assisted to places of safety; the sick removed; and corpses temporarily buried in
    gardens.  In several instances Confederate soldiers assisted in these humane acts. In a
    few cases houses isolated from others were spared and guards placed about them,
    because one or more of the inmates were too ill to be removed; and others still were
    spared by paying a ransom. Had the destruction occurred in winter, or at night, or
    during a storm, the destruction of life, with other imaginable horrors, would have been
    fearful. But it was in the morning and during a perfect calm. And yet at one time a
    fearful cyclone, or funnel -shaped column, which originated in the public square, where
    the converging flames seemed to have suddenly given birth and shape to this terrible
    apparition, moved with a hissing and roaring noise eastward along the line of Market
    Street, carrying far up into the heavens innumerable flakes of fire, ignited shingles and
    bits of boards. In its course it passed over the ground surrounding a residence which
    was not burned, and in which clothing, bedding, furniture, etc., had been deposited. As
    this whirling, hissing, and sucking cone touched these articles, it instantly drew
    some of the lighter ones up into the air. Pillows, feather -beds, bed quilts, and other articles
    were carried up and fell at considerable distances. A little girl of probably four years of age
    was caught by the monster and lifted six or eight feet from the ground.
    
    <p>The conflagration at its height was a scene of surpassing grandeur and terror. As building
    after building was fired, or caught from others, column after column of smoke rose black,
    straight, and single; first one, then another, and another. Each of these then, like huge serpents,
    writhed and twisted into a thousand fantastic shapes, until all finally blended and commingled,
    and formed one vast and livid column of smoke and flame which rose perpendicularly to the sky,
    and then spread out into a huge crown of sackcloth. It was heaven's shield mercifully drawn over
    the scene to shelter from the blazing sun the homeless and unsheltered ones that had fled to the
    fields and cemeteries around the town, where they in silence and sadness sat and looked upon
    the destruction of their homes and the accumulations of a lifetime.  Add to all this the roaring
    and crackling of the flames, the sound of falling walls, the distressing cries of burning animals, as
    horses, cattle, and swine, and a picture of the terrible is seen which no one who witnessed it
    would ever desire to have repeated.
    
    <p>General McCausland crossed the Potomac at Cherry Run and McCoy's Fords, thus turning
    the right flank of General Averell, who had been placed nearly opposite him to watch him. As a
    demonstration in his favor, and to prevent Averell from intercepting him, the divisions of Rodes
    and Ramsuer and the cavalry brigade of Vaughan also crossed the river at Williamsport -Vaughan
    pressing on as far as Hagerstown, Maryland. Averell, thus threatened upon both flanks, was
    under the necessity of looking after his own safety, and accordingly fell back into Pennsylvania,
    reaching Greencastle, eleven miles South of Chambersburg, about sundown, where lie went into
    bivouac. Learning of his presence there, General Couch, who yet remained at Chambersburg,
    sent him three successive dispatches peremptorily ordering him on to the latter plcae [viz].
    These dispatches were taken by couriers to the camp, but Averell could not be found. For some
    reason which has never been satisfactorily explained, he had changed the place of his own rest
    without the knowledge of his staff, and
 when Couch's orders were taken to the camp no one
    knew where the General was.  * At length about four o'clock in the morning he was found and the dispatches placed in his hands, but it was then too late. General Couch, unable to
    communicate with him, and having no other force to rely upon, had left the town. Averell
    at once put his command in motion, but still fearing an attack by Vaughan's command,
    which had pressed him the day before and to avoid being caught between it and the force under McCausland, he proceeded in an
    easterly direction until he reached Greenwood, eight miles from Chambersburg, when he
    turned westward and proceeded to the latter place. The Confederates, apprised by their
    scouts of his approach, left the
 burning town about eleven o'clock and passed rapidly westward and crossed the North
    Mountain into Fulton County and thence down the valley and recrossed the Potomac at
    Hancock, pursued by Averell. Had General Averell informed his staff of his removal, Couch's
    dispatches would have reached him in time, and the terrible disaster of Chambersburg would
    have been averted. It certainly seems strange that a commander of Averell's sagacity should,
    under the threatening circumstances, have committed so grave an oversight.
    <p>The work of destruction was commenced about eight o'clock in the morning, and by eleven 
    o'clock the enemy had all gone, but so thorough had been their work that the major part of 
    Chambersburg-its chief wealth and business, its capital and elegance-were laid in ruins. Ten squares 
    of buildings were burned and two thousand human beings were made homeless, and many of them 
    penniless.  From this disaster the majority never recovered, but lived the remainder of their days in 
    poverty. Reduced from affluence to poverty, many were dependent upon the charily of the few 
    whose homes escaped the invader's torch, as well as upon the provision made by the military 
    authorities to meet their immediate wants.
    <p>When the fire had subsided and the enemy had gone, the people who had
    taken refuge in the cemeteries and fields around the town, returned to view
    the remains of their ruined homes. Sad indeed were their feelings when
    they stood by the scene of desolation, recognizing here and there among the
    ruins sonic articles which reminded them of the past, as broken and warped
    stoves, cooking utensils, etc.   But when night came on, and a place of shelter
    had to be sought, then only did they realize their sad condition. Such buildings as had escaped the 
    common destruction were opened and were crowded to their utmost capacity.  Some made their 
    way on foot to the country, or to neighboring towns, and some removed to distant places, never 
    again to reside in Chambersburg.  Chambersburg was founded A. D. 1764, and was burned A. D. 
    1864.
   <a name=statistics></a>
<p>The following is the aggregate of all buildings burned: Residences and places of business, 266; 
    barns and stables, 98; out-buildings of various kinds, 173; total buildings burned, 537. Two commissions, composed of competent and disinterested
    persons, appointed by the governor of the State, and authorized by ads of the legislature, came
    to the town and adjudicated the losses of the citizens by the fire, The claims adjudicated by
    these commissions were carefully scrutinized.  Each claimant was examined separately and under
    oath, evidence besides his own being required. The claims thus adjudicated were as follows:
    Real estate, $713,294.34; personal property, $915,137-24: total, $1,628,431.58. Immediately
    after the fire the legislature of the State was convened in special session, and after visiting the
    town and ascertaining the destitution of the people, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars
    was appropriated to meet the immediate wants of the needy. This sum was divided, not pro-rata to the amount of losses sustained, but according to the
    necessities of each. Subsequently an appropriation of five hundred thousand dollars, followed a
    year or two later by another of three hundred thousand, was made. These appropriations were
    divided pro-rata, and, as will be seen from the figures given, paid about one half the losses by the
    fire. Certificates were given for the remainder, certifying to the amount, but not binding the State
    to pay it until the United States indemnifies the State.
    <p>Three causes have been assigned for the destruction of Chambersburg.  One of these is that
    it was in revenge for the innocent hospitality the town gave to John Brown and his
    misguided followers when planning their mad raid upon Harper's Ferry. A second is, that it was
    in retaliation for alleged acts of burning and destruction committed by Federal troops in the
    South, and specially in the Shenandoah Valley, by orders of General Hunter during the raid
    referred to in the opening of this article. A third opinion regards it as a barbarous, wanton, and
    unjustifiable act. The true cause will appear in the following statements. The first is a letter
    written by General Early, who gave the order, in response to one addressed to him by the writer:
    
<a name=earlytohoke>
<div align=right>YELLOW SULPHUR SPRINGS,  September 4th, I884.</div>
    J. HOKE, ESQ:</a>
   <p>Sir-Having been from home since the 5th of August, your letter of the 6th of that month
    did not reach me until a very few days ago, when it was forwarded to me from Lynchburg with
    a number of others.
     <p>As you desire my statement in regard to the burning of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania,
    under my order in July, 1864, I send you a copy of my "Memoirs of the Last Year of the War,"
    in which you will find, on pages 60 to 70, my account of that affair.  All I have to add, is that
    on my march from Lynchburg in pursuit of General Hunter, and down the valley on the
    expedition against Washington, I had seen the evidences of the destruction wantonly committed
    by his troops under his orders, including the burning of a number of private houses without
    provocation, among them being the family residence, at Lexington, of ex-Governor Letcher; also
    the Virginia Military Institute at the same place, and a part of the town of Newtown, in
    Frederick County; and in addition there had been a wholesale destruction of private property,
    including even wearing apparel of ladies, and bed clothing; the beds in many cases being cut to
    pieces and the feathers scattered to the winds. In addition, there had been the destruction of
    several towns in the South by Federal troops, among them being the town of Darien, Georgia, in
    the year 1863. When, therefore, on my return from the expedition threatening Washington, I
    found that Hunter, who had reached the lower valley on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, after
    his flight to the Kanawha Valley, had been engaged in his accustomed work, and had burned the
    valuable residences of several citizens of Jefferson County, I determined to demand compensation therefore from some town in Pennsylvania, and in the event
    of failure to comply with my demand to retaliate by burning said town. The town of
    Chambersburg was selected because it was the only one of any consequence accessible to my
    troops, and <i>and for no other reason.</i> The houses mentioned with their contents, all of
    which were destroyed, were fully worth at least $100, 000 in gold, and I required $500,000 in
    United States currency in the alternative, for the reason that said currency was rapidly
    depreciating, being then nearly three to one in gold, and I determined to secure the full equivalent
    of $100,000 in gold.  I will add that according to the laws of retaliation in war, I would have been
    justified in burning Chambersburg without giving the town a chance of redemption.
    <p>Compare the expedition of Hunter into Virginia in June, 1864, the campaign of Sherman in
    Georgia and South Carolina, of Banks in the trans-Mississippi, and Sheridan in the valley of
    Virginia, with General Lee in Pennsylvania, leaving out of consideration Beast Butler's
    performances in New Orleans, and then say whether the denunciations of those who applaud the
    destroyer of Atlanta, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina, and him who boasted that, besides
    burning the town of Dayton, he had so desolated the valley as that a crow flying over it would
    have to carry its rations, should have any terror for me.
    <p>Respectfully,
      <br> J. A. EARLY.
                       
<a name=earlymem>
<p>Accompanying the foregoing letter was a pamphlet of one hundred and thirty-six pages,
entitled "A Memoir of the Last Year of the War 
for Independence in the Confederate States of 
America, containing an account of the operations 
of his commands in the years 1864 and 1865, by Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early, of the Provisional Army of the Confederate States."</a>In a foot-note on page 70, General Early, speaking of the destruction of Chambersburg, says: "For this act I, alone, a
m responsible, as the officers engaged 
in it were simply executing my orders, and had no 
discretion left them." As General Early, then, 
assumes the entire responsibility in this matter, 
and claims as his justification the wanton 
destruction of property by General Hunter in the 
Shenandoah Valley, it is but fair to give him a 
further hearing, as well as to introduce other 
testimony to the allegations he makes. I therefore 
quote from his pamphlet as follows:
<p>"The scenes on Hunter's route from 
Lynchburg had been truly heart-rending. Houses 
had been burned, and helpless women and children 
left without shelter. The country had been 
stripped of provisions, and many families left 
without a morsel to eat. Furniture and bedding 
had been cut to pieces, and old men and women and children robbed of all the clothing they had 
except that on their backs. Ladies trunks had 
been rifled and their dresses torn to pieces in mere 
wantonness. * * We had renewed evidence of the 
outrages committed by Hunter's orders in burning 
and plundering private houses. We saw the ruins 
of a number of houses to which the torch had
 
    been applied by his orders. At Lexington he had burned the Military Institute, with all
    its scientific apparatus; and Washington College had been plundered and the statue of
    Washington stolen. The residence of ex -Governor Letcher at that place had been
    burned by his orders, and but a few minutes given Mrs. Letcher and her family to leave
    the house." (Page 48.)
    
     <p>Again General Early, on page 5o, says:
    
     <p>" On this day (July 2d) we passed through Newtown where several houses,
    including that of a Methodist minister, had been burned by Hunter's orders, because a
    part of Mosby's command had attacked a train of supplies for Sigel's force at this place.
    The original order was to burn the whole town, but the officer sent to execute it had
    revolted at the cruel mandate of his superior, and another had been sent who had but
    partially executed it, after having forced the people to take the oath of allegiance to the
    United States to save their, houses.  Mosby's battalion, though called guerrillas by the
    enemy, was a regular organization in the Confederate army, and was merely serving on
    detached duty under General Lee's orders. The attack on the train was an act of
    legitimate warfare, and the order to burn Newtown, and the burning of the houses
    mentioned, were most wanton, cruel, unjustifiable, and cowardly. "
    
     <p>One more quotation from this pamphlet is as follows:
    
     <p>"On the 26th (July) we moved to Martinsburg, the cavalry going to the Potomac.
    The 27th and 28th were employed in destroying the railroad, it having been repaired
    since we passed over it at the beginning of the month. While at Martinsburg it was
    ascertained, beyond all doubt, that Hunter had been again indulging in his favorite
    mode of warfare, and that, after his re-, turn to the valley, while we were near
    Washington, among other outrages, the residences of Mr. Andrew Hunter, a member of
    the Virginia Senate, Mr. Alexander R. Boteler, an ex- member of the Confederate
    Congress, and Edmund I. Lee, with their contents, had been burned by his orders, only
    time enough being given for the ladies to get out of the houses. * * I now came to the
    conclusion that we had stood this mode of warfare long enough, and that it was time to
    open the eyes of the people of the North to its enormity by an example in the way of
    retaliation. I did not select the cases mentioned as having more merit or greater claims
    for retaliation than others, but because they had occurred within the limits of the
    country covered by my command, and were brought more immediately to my attention.
    
    <p>"The town of Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, was selected as the one on which
    retaliation should be made, and McCausland was ordered to proceed with his brigade
    and that of Johnson's and a battery of artillery to that place, and demand of the
    municipal authorities the sum. of $100,000 in gold or $500,000 in United States currency, as a compensation for the destruction of the
    houses named and their contents; and, in default of payment, to lay the town in ashes,
    in retaliation for the burning of these houses and others in Virginia, as well as for the
    towns which had been burned in other Southern States. A written demand to that effect
    was sent to the municipal authorities, and they were informed what would be the result
    of a failure to comply with it. I desired to give the people of Chambersburg an
    opportunity of saving their town by making compensation for part of the injury done,
    and hoped that the payment of such a sum would have the desired effect, and open the
    eyes of the people of the North to the necessity of urging upon their government the
    adoption of a different policy."
    
     <p>As General Early bases his retaliatory policy upon certain specific acts of alleged
    vandalism upon the part of General Hunter, it is important that the fullest information
    upon those facts that can be obtained should be considered here. I will therefore
    introduce some extracts from an article written by General J. D. Imboden, for the
    Philadelphia <i>Weekly Times</i>, and republished in Annals of the War (pages 160-
    183), entitled "Fire, Sword, and the Halter." This article by General Imboden is lengthy
    and enters into details, covering the precise cases referred to by Early, as well as many
    others, to which the latter but incidentally refers. General Imboden says:
    <a name=imboden></a>
     <p>"Up to his occupation of Staunton, where his army was so much strengthened by
    Crook and Averell, as to relieve his mind of all apprehension of disaster, the conduct of
    General Hunter had been soldierly, striking his blows only at armed men. But at
    Staunton he commenced burning private property, and, as will be seen further on, the
    passion for house burning grew upon him, and a new system of warfare was
    inaugurated that a few weeks afterward culminated in the retaliatory burning of
    Chambersburg." * *
    
     "From Brownsburg General Hunter proceeded to Lexington, encountering only such
    delay as McCausland could effect with a single brigade of cavalry. At Lexington he
    enlarged upon the operations begun at Staunton. On his way, and in the surrounding
    country, he burnt mills, furnaces, store -houses, granaries, and all farming utensils he
    could find, beside a great amount of fencing, and a large quantity of grain. In the town
    he burnt the Virginia. Military Institute, and all the professor's houses except the
    superintendent's (General Smith), where he had his head -quarters, and found a portion
    of the family to sick to be removed. He had the combustibles collected to burn
    Washington College, the recipient of the benefactions of the Father of his Country by
    his will; but yielding to the appeals of the trustees and citizens, spared the building, but
    destroyed the philosophical and chemical apparatus, libraries, and furniture. He
    burned the mills and some private stores in the lower part of the town. Captain Towns, an officer in General Hunter's army,
    took supper with the family of Governor John Letcher. Mrs. Letcher having heard
    threats that her house would be burned, spoke of it to Captain Towns, who said it
    could not be possible, and remarked that he would go at once to head - quarters and let
    her know. He went, returned in a half hour, and told her that he was directed by General
    Hunter to assure her that the house would not be destroyed, and she might, therefore,
    rest easy. After this, she dismissed her fears, not believing it possible that a man
    occupying Hunter's position would be guilty of willful and deliberate falsehood to a
    lady. It, however, turned out other-wise, for the next morning, at half past eight o'clock,
    his assistant provost -marshal, accompanied by a portion of his guard, rode up to the
    door, and Captain Berry dismounted, rang the door bell, called for Mrs. Letcher, and
    informed her that General Hunter had ordered him to burn her house. She replied:
    'There must be some mistake," and requested to see the order. He said it was verbal.
    She asked if its execution could not be delayed till she could see General Hunter? He
    replied: 'The order is peremptory, and you have five minutes to leave the house.'  Mrs.
    Letcher then asked if she could be allowed to remove her mother's, her sister's, her own,
    and her children's clothing. This request being refused, she left the house.  In a very
    short time they poured camphene on the parlor floor and ignited it with a match. In the
    meantime Miss Lizzie Letcher was trying to remove some articles of clothing from the
    other end of the house, and Berry, finding these in her arms, set fire to them. The
    wardrobe and bureaus were then fired, and soon the house was enveloped in flames.
    Governor Letcher's mother, then seventy-eight years old, lived on the adjoining lot.
    They fired her stable, within forty feet of the dwelling, evidently to burn it, too; but
    owing to the active exertions of Captain Towns, who made his men carry water, the
    house was saved. While Hunter was in Lexington, Captain Matthew White, residing
    near town, was arrested, taken about two miles, and, without trial, was shot, on the
    allegation that he was a bush-whacker. During the first year of the war he commanded
    the Rockbridge Cavalry, and was a young gentleman of generous impulses and good
    character. The total destruction of private property in Rockbridge County, by Hunter,
    was estimated and published in the local papers at the time as over $2,000,000.  The
    burning of the Institute was a public calamity, as it was an educational establishment of
    great value.
    
     <p>"From Lexington he proceeded to Buchanan, in Botetourt County, and camped
    on the magnificent estate of Colonel John T. Anderson, an elder brother of General
    Joseph R. Anderson, of the Tredegar Iron Works, at Richmond.  Colonel Anderson's
    estate, on the banks of the Upper James, and his mansion, were baronial in character. The house crowned a high, wooded hill, was very
    large, and furnished in a style to dispense that lavish hospitality which was the pride of
    so many of the old-time Virginians.  It was a seat of luxury and refinement, and in all
    respect a place to make the owner contented with his lot in this world. Colonel
    Anderson was old-his head as white as snow-and his wife but a few years his junior. 
    He was in no office, and too old to fight-hence he was living on his fine estate strictly
    the life of a private gentleman. He had often, in years gone by, filled prominent
    representative positions from his county.  There was no military or public object on
    God's earth to be gained by ruining such a man. Yet Hunter, after destroying all that he
    could on the plantation when he left it, ordered the grand old mansion, with all its
    contents, to be laid in ashes. " * * *
    
     <p>General Imboden, then, details the burning of several fine mansions in the Lower
    Valley, referred to also by General Early. He says:
    
     <p>"I shall conclude this already long narrative by citing a few more instances of
    Hunter's incendiarism in the Lower Valley. It seems that, smarting under the miserable
    failure of his grand raid on Lynchburg, where, during a march of over two hundred
    miles, the largest force he encountered was under Jones, at Piedmont, and he routed
    that, thus leaving the way open to Lynchburg within three days, destroy the stores
    there and go out through West Virginia unmolested, he had failed to do any thing but
    inflict injury on private citizens, and he came back to the Potomac more implacable than
    when he left it a month before. His first victim was the Hon.. Andrew Hunter, of
    Charlestown, Jefferson County, his own first cousin, and named after the General's
    father. Mr. Hunter was a lawyer of great eminence, and a man of deservedly large
    influence in his county and the state. His home, eight miles from Harper's Ferry, in the
    suburbs of Charlestown, was the most costly and elegant in the place, and his family as
    refined and cultivated as any in the state. His offense, in General Hunter's eyes, was
    that he had gone politically with his state, and was in full sympathy with the
    Confederate cause. The general sent a squadron of cavalry out from Harper's Ferry,
    took Mr. Hunter prisoner, and held him a month in the common guard house of his
    soldiers, without alleging any offense against him not common to nearly all the people
    of Virginia, and finally discharged him without trial or explanation, after heaping these
    indignities upon him. Mr. Hunter was an old man, and suffered severely from
    confinement and exposure. While he was thus a prisoner, General Hunter ordered his
    elegant mansion to be burned to the ground, with all its contents, not even permitting
    Mrs. Hunter and her daughter to save their clothes and family pictures from the flames;
    and, to add to the desolation, camped his cavalry within the enclosure of the beautiful
    grounds, of several acres, surrounding the residence, till the horses had destroyed
    them.
    
     <p>"General Hunter's next exploit was at Shepherdstown, in the same county, where,
    on the 19th of July, 1864, he caused to be burned the residence of Hon. A. R. Boteler,
    'Fountain Rock.'  Mrs. Boteler was a cousin of General Hunter. This homestead was an
    old colonial house endeared to the family by a thousand tender memories, and
    contained a splendid library, many pictures, and an invaluable collection of rare and
    precious manuscripts, illustrating the early history of that part of Virginia, that Colonel
    Boteler had collected by years of toil. The only members of the family who were there
    at the time were Colonel Boteler's eldest and widowed daughter, Mrs. Shepherd, who
    was an invalid, her three children, the eldest five years old and the youngest eighteen
    months, and Miss Helen Boteler.  Colonel Boteler and his son were in the army, and
    Mrs. Boteler in Baltimore. The ladies and children were at dinner when informed by the
    servants that a body of cavalry had turned in at the gate, from the turnpike, and were
    coming up to the house."
    
     <p>General Imboden then proceeds to detail the manner of the burning of this house
    by order of General Hunter, and follows this description with another detailing the
    burning of the residence of Mr. Edmund 1. Lee, in the same locality. He then concludes
    as follows:
    
     <p>"If the people of Chambersburg will carefully read this record of wanton
    destruction of private property, this 'o'er true tale' of cruel wrong inflicted on the
    helpless, they will understand why, when goaded to madness, remuneration was
    demanded at their hands by General Early, and upon its refusal retaliation was inflicted
    on the nearest community that could be reached, and it was their misfortune to be that
    community.  Contrast Lee in Pennsylvania, in 1863, and Hunter in Virginia, in 1864, and
    judge them both as history will."
    
     <p>I follow these accounts by Generals Early and Imboden with an extract from a
    letter from <a name=slingluff>V. C. Slingluff, Esq.,</a> a leading member of the bar of the city of Baltimore, and
    a gentleman of unimpeachable veracity. Mr. Slingluff was a member of the First
    Maryland (Confederate) Cavalry, General Bradley T. Johnson's brigade. He participated
    in the valley campaign, and was an eye-witness of what he relates. He was also
    present, as a private, in the destruction of Chambersburg.  Mr. Slingluff says:
    
     <p>"* * Now  you would like to know if the men whom I have described (the men
    who assisted in burning Chambersburg, many of whom are now among the leading
    merchants, lawyers, doctors, and farmers of Baltimore and other parts of Maryland,)
    justified the burning of your town, in their individual capacity, irrespective of the
    orders from head-quarters, under which they acted. I must say to you 
frankly that they did, and I never beard one
       dissenting voice. And why did we justify so hard a measure? Simply because we had
       long come to the conclusion that it was time for us to burn something in the enemy's
       country. For the campaign of the preceding year, when our whole army had passed
       through your richest section of country, where the peaceful homes and fruitful fields
       only made the contrast with what we had left the more significant, many a man, whose
       home was in rains, chafed under the orders from General Lee, which forbade him to
       touch them, but the orders were obeyed and we left the homes and fields as we found
       them, the ordinary wear and tear of an army of occupation alone excepted. We had so
       often before our eyes the reverse of this wherever your army swept through Virginia,
       that we were thoroughly convinced of the justice of a stern retaliation.
       
            <p>" It is no pleasure to me to have to recall the scenes of those days, nor do I do so
       in any spirit of vindictiveness, but I simply tell the truth in justification of an act which
       you and others may suppose was without justification. We had followed Kilpatrick (I
       think it was) in his raid through Madison, Greene, and other counties, and had seen the
       cattle shot, or ham-strung in the barn-yards, the agricultural implements burned, the
       feather-beds and clothing of the women and children cut in shreds in mere wantonness,
       farmhouse after farm-house stripped of every particle of provisions, private carriages
       cut and broken up, and women in tears lamenting all this. I do not write here anything
       that I did not see myself. We had seen a thousand ruined homes in Clark, Jefferson,
       and Frederick counties,- barns and houses burned and private property destroyed, but
       we had no knowledge that this was done by 'official orders.' At last when the official
       order came openly from General Hunter, and the burning was done there under his
       orders, and when our orders of retaliation came, they met with the approbation, as I
       have said, of every man who crossed the Potomac to execute them. Of course we had
       nothing personal against your pretty little town. it just so happened that it was the
       nearest and most accessible place of importance for us to get to. It was the unfortunate
       victim of circumstances. Had it been further off and some other town nearer, that other
       town would have gone, and Chambersburg would have been saved."
       
            <p>These three persons whose statements have been given, while speaking of the
       general disregard of private property in the South, concur in the allegation of General
       Hunter's wholesale destructive propensities, and two of them specifically refer to the
       destruction of the properties of Andrew Hunter, A. R. Boteler, R. I. Lee, ex -Governor
       Letcher, J. T. Anderson, and the Virginia Military institute. These six properties
       were specifically named by General Early in his order to McCausland, and upon these he based his retributive demand upon Chambersburg. The responsibility, then, for the destruction of
       Chambersburg, it will be seen, rests upon General Hunter.  Justice to him, and to the
       people of the South, as well as the truth of history, demands a fair, candid, and impartial
       consideration of the case.

            <p>The fact of the destruction of the six properties named, as well as many others by
       General Hunter, in his valley campaign, has not been denied.  Federal soldiers, who saw
       these ruins, have freely admitted them. But while these facts are conceded, General
       Hunter claims that he had sufficient ground for his severity in the following
       considerations:  In no part of the South, perhaps, was the hostility to the Union so bitter
       and malignant as in the valley of Virginia. With but few exceptions the entire male
       population, capable of bearing arms, were either in the Confederate army, or the secret
       emissaries of such as were thus engaged. The entire valley was infested with guerrillas
       and bush-whackers who, during the day, assumed to be farmers and tradesmen, and at
       night carried on the nefarious work of waylaying straggling Federal soldiers and
       unprotected trains.  Familiar with every foot of ground in the valley, as well as with the
       mountain fastnesses, -they stole upon their victims, and then, under the cover of the
       night, fled to places of safety.  And as one of the evidences of the facts stated, the
       following account of an act of barbarity, committed by this class of men, is cited. It was
       published in one of the papers of Martinsburg, West Virginia, July 23, 1864, under the
       caption of "A Fiendish Act."  "Six Union soldiers were found strapped to a fence in the
       vicinity of Charlestown, having their throats -cut from ear to ear. The fiendish act is
       supposed to have been the work of resident Confederates, who are farmers and
       tradesmen during the day and guerrillas at night.  Virginia swarms with men of this class,
       who have, ever since the commencement of the war, pursued a course of this kind, and
       who have committed deeds so fiendish in their character as to put to blush the darkest
       and bloodiest deeds of our Indian savages.  It is said that General Hunter is as mad as -
       about this barbarous deed, and has arrested some sixty residents of the neighborhood
       in which these unfortunate men were found, and are now held in order, if possible, to
       ferret out the guilty parties and bring them to justice."
       
       <p>Compare the date of the foregoing barbarous act with the arrest 
       and imprisonment of
       Mr. Andrew Hunter, and the destruction of the properties referred to in that
       neighborhood, and the cause which led General Hunter to adopt so severe a retributive
       policy will be seen. In justification of the destruction of the property of ex -Governor
       Letcher, it is said, whether truly or falsely I can not say, that the form of a hand-bill
       was found in a printing establishment in Lexington, bearing Letcher's name, and urging the bushwhacking of
       Federal soldiers; and, further, that his house was occupied by concealed
       sharpshooters, who fired upon some of General Hunter's men. What the particular
       provocation was, which led to the destruction of the other properties named, has not
       been stated.
       
       <p>The three gentlemen from whom I have quoted-Early, Imboden, and Slingluff, -
       refer to the humane manner in which General Lee conducted his campaign in
       Pennsylvania in 1863, and claim that no wanton destruction of private property was
       made. This is freely admitted. With the exception of the railroad buildings in
       Chambersburg, and one or two buildings on the field of Gettysburg, no houses or barns
       were destroyed. Private property was taken for the use of the army, but, except in a few
       cases by stragglers, the regulations of seizure laid down by General Lee in general
       orders No. 72, and issued specially for the Pennsylvania campaign, were strictly
       observed. But while the comparative good conduct of the Confederates in Pennsylvania
       is admitted, it must also be remembered that there was no bushwhacking of them, nor
       depredations committed upon their trains.  Suppose General Lee had found a number of
       his men massacred by citizens as were the six Federal soldiers near Charlestown,
       Virginia, and the houses of the people used for concealed sharp-shooters, and his trains
       waylaid and robbed, would he not have adopted a different policy, and would not the
       laws of civilized warfare and the sentiment of the world have justified him in so doing?
       That a retributive policy would have been, adopted, and severe retaliation visited upon
       the people, is clear from a paragraph in General Order, No. 49, issued by Lieutenant-
       General  while in Chambersburg:  "Citizens of the country through which the army
       may pass, who are not in the military service, are admonished to abstain from all acts of
       hostility, <i>upon a Penalty of being dealt with in a summary manner."</i> The
       contrast, then, is not between the conduct of General Lee in Pennsylvania, and his
       treatment of the people there, and that of General Hunter in the Valley of Virginia and
       his treatment of the people in that locality, but between the conduct of the people of
       Pennsylvania, and their treatment of the Confederate army, and that of the people of the
       valley and their treatment of the Federals.
       
       <p>The policy of the commanders of the Federal armies operating in the Shenandoah
       Valley had been humane and lenient, notwithstanding the evils complained of, but
       when General Hunter succeeded to the command in that Place, he adopted a different
       policy. From the time he assumed command in that department he gave evidence that
       he had decided convictions as to how to deal with such inveterate haters of the Union.
       He was convinced that the mild and lenient course pursued by his predecessors had
       only emboldened them in their unwarranted methods, and he determined to adopt a retaliatory 

       policy.  Guerrillas and bushwhackers, whose depredations had heretofore gone 
       unpunished, were now notified that their claim to be in the regular Confederate service, 
       under which they claimed exemption from the summary punishment inflicted upon 
       irregular and unorganized soldiers, would no longer avail them. He accordingly issued 
       and circulated the following circular:<br>
<p>
<a name=hunter>       
<div align=right>
</a>
                 HEAD-QUARTERS OF WEST VIRGINIA,-IN THE FIELD.
                 <br>
       
                     Valley of the Shenandoah, May 24th,
                     1864.</div>
       
       <p>Sir-Your name has been reported to me with evidence that you are one of the
       leading secessionist sympathizers in the valley, and that you countenance and abet
       the bush-whackers and guerrillas who infest the woods and mountains of this region
       swooping out on the roads to plunder and outrage loyal residents, falling upon then
       and firing into defenseless wagon-trains and assassinating soldiers of this command
       who may chance to be placed in exposed positions. These practices are not recognized by the laws of war of any civilized nation, nor are the persons engaged therein
       entitled to any other treatment than that done by the universal code of justice to
       pirates, murderers, and other outlaws.
       
       <p>But from the difficulties of the country, the secret aid and information given to
       these bush-whackers by persons of your class, and the more important occupation of
       the troops under my command, it is impossible to chase, arrest, and punish these
       marauders as they deserve. Without the countenance and help given to them by the
       Confederate residents of the valley, they could not support themselves for a week. You
       are spies upon our movements, abusing the clemency which has protected your persons
       and property, while loyal citizens of the United States, residing within the Confederate lines, are
       invariably plundered of all they may possess, imprisoned, and in some cases put to death. It is
       from you and your families and neighbors, that these bandits receive food, clothing, ammunition
       and information, and it is from their secret hiding-places. in your houses, barns and woods, that
       they issue on their missions of pillage and murder.
       
       <p>You are therefore hereby notified, that for every train fired upon, or soldier of the Union
       wounded or assassinated by bush-whackers in any neighborhood within the reach of my
       command, the houses and other property of every secession sympathizer residing within a
       circuit of five miles from the place of the outrage, shall be destroyed by fire, and that for all
       public property jayhawked or destroyed by these marauders, an assessment of five times the
       value of such property win be made upon the secession sympathizers residing within the circuit
       of ten miles around the point at which the offense was committed. The payment of this
       assessment will be enforced by the troops of this department, who will seize and hold in close
       military custody the persons assessed, until such payment shall have been made. This provision
       will also be applied to make good from the secessionists in the neighborhood five times the
       amount of any loss suffered by loyal citizens of the 'United States, from the action of the bush-
       whackers whom you may encourage.
       
       <p>If you desire to avoid the consequences herein set forth, you will notify your guerrilla and bush-whacking friends to withdraw from that portion of the valley
    within my lines, and to join, if they desire to fight for the rebellion, the regular
    forces of the secession army in my front or elsewhere. <i>You will</i> have none but 
    yourselves to blame for the consequences that will certainly ensue if these evils are permitted to continue. This circular is not sent to you for the reason that you have
    been singled out as peculiarly obnoxious, but because you are believed to furnish
    the readiest means of communication with the prominent secession sympathizers of
    your neighborhood. it will be for their benefit that you communicate to them the
    tenor of this circular.       
 
    <div align=right>
                           D. Hunter<br> <i>Major-General
                            Commanding.</i></div>
    
    <p>In his invasion of Pennsylvania, General Lee fully appropriated to the use of his
    army the resources of our people, conveying away with him all he had transportation
    for. All was, however, taken under special instructions and by specified officers, and
    either paid for in such money as he had, or vouchers given. In the valley campaigns,
    Hunter and Sheridan did what Lee did in Pennsylvania, except paying for what they
    took, and in addition destroyed what they could not consume or carry away. This was
    done as a war measure to deplete the resources of the enemy. The Valley of Virginia
    bad been the great store house from which supplies had been drawn for the army about
    Richmond, and it was deemed necessary to destroy these resources.  Consequently all
    the grain, provender, and cattle that could not be used were destroyed, and barns,
    granaries, mills, and factories burned. It was an extreme measure allowable under the
    circumstances.  The policy, however, inaugurated by Hunter, as indicated in the
    foregoing circular, was still a sterner resort, and could never be justified unless the
    provocations were actually such as he states. If citizens -persons not regularly in the
    Confederate service, and wearing the Confederate uniform- committed depredations
    upon his trains and brutally waylaid and murdered his soldiers, he was justified in
    resorting to the extreme measure of retaliating Upon tile citizens and their property, and
    he was as clearly within the rules of civilized warfare in so doing as was Lee in his more
    humane policy in Pennsylvania. The fault lies with the people who first violated the
    rules of war by depredations upon the soldiers. The severe punishment which followed
    was but the sequel of their own actions. Chambersburg, then, was burned, not so much
    because of General Hunter's retaliatory policy in the Valley of Virginia, but because of
    the barbarous violations of the laws of war by the citizens of the last named place.
    
    <p>War is a game at which the two contending parties can play, and any retaliatory
    or cruel policy inaugurated by the one is invariably followed by a similar policy by the
    other. It need not seem strange, then, that the first opportunity the Confederates had
    of retaliating upon their enemies, they improved. They could scarcely have been
    expected to do otherwise.
