<center><b>GENERAL AVERELL'S DELAY<br></b></center>
<hr width=40><br>
    <p>*In so important a matter as this, in which a general officer of such well known vigilance and
    efficiency as General Averell, is charged with indiscretion, or negligence, resulting so
    disastrously as in this case, I have sought for the most positive information, and append here
    extracts from letters from two reliable persons whose means of information will not be
    questioned. The first is from Thomas R. Bard, Esq., an attorney at the bar of Hueneme, Ventura County, California. Mr. Bard was formerly a citizen of Chambersburg, but at the time of the war was in the forwarding and commission business, at Hagerstown, Maryland, and also the agent at that place of the Cumberland Valley Railroad
    Company, charged with the duty of superintending the transportation of troops and supplies.
    Mr. Bard, after detailing his departure from Hagerstown upon the approach of the Confederates
    in the evening of Friday, July 29th, and his attendance upon the telegraph office at Greencastle,
    and the passage through that place of Averell's forces, says;
    <p>"General Averell left three 'orderlies' at the telegraph office to convey to him all messages that
    might be received for him, and encamped his troops in a grove distant about one and a half miles
    north-east of Greencastle, and only nine and a half miles from Chambersburg. Late in the evening
    General Coach, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna, with headquarters at
    Chambersburg, sent a message to General Averell, which was promptly handed to one of the
    orderlies, who quickly mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of General Averell's camp.
    Mr. B. Gilmore, the telegraph operator at Chambersburg, kept us informed constantly of all that
    was transpiring at that place, and of the movements of the Confederate force. It is quite probable
    that I was informed by one of the operators as to the contents of the message from General
    Couch. At any rate, at the time, I understood that General Couch informed General Averell that
    the Confederate forces were at or had passed through Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and were
    moving toward Chambersburg and, that being without adequate forces to check the movement, he
    inquired whether Averell could be depended on for assistance. Later in the night two other
    messages were received from General Couch for General Averell, and were promptly delivered to
    the orderlies. The last of these messages was received probably about three o'clock in the
    morning of July 3Oth. These messages reported the rapid approach of the Confederates, and
    expressed great anxiety to learn if General Averell intended to render assistance for the defense of
    Chambersburg.
    <p>"There had been no reply from General Averell, and learning that General Couch had made
    preparations for leaving Chambersburg and that in all probability the communications with that
    place would soon be interrupted, I mounted a horse and hurriedly rode out to find General
    Averell.  On the road, about half way to the camp, I met the orderlies riding leisurely toward
    Greencastle. In reply to my inquiry if they had delivered their messages, they said that General
    Averell could not be found, and that they did not know what to do with the messages. Hastily
    informing them of the importance of the dispatches, I took them in my own hands, and telling
    them to follow me, I spurred my horse and was soon at the grove. There was no sentry or guard
    to halt me.  All was quiet.  There was not a sound save the champing of the feeding horses; there
    were no lights or fires except the embers where the men had prepared their evening meal. I dashed
    into the middle of the encampment, and there found a solitary man to answer my inquiry, 'Where
    is General Averell?' He could not tell me. An officer of a West Virginia regiment then appeared
    and said it would be difficult to find General Averell, but offered to aid me in the search. While he
    prepared to mount his horse, the booming of a cannon was heard in the direction of
    Chambersburg. The officer expressed surprise and asked, "What can that be?"  I told him it supplemented the messages which I brought, and indicated that McCausland had arrived at Chambersburg.   We rode hastily through the grove and soon found General Averell asleep by the side of a fence. On
    being awakened, he raised upon his elbow and heard the information I had brought. I had handed
    him the telegrams, but as there was no light I told him what they contained, and informed him
    that they had been delivered to his orderlies hours before. he made no reply, and, as I thought,
    was about to turn over and go to sleep. Minutes seemed hours to me, and growing impatient I
    said to him, 'General Averell, if you wish the to convey any answer to General Couch, I beg you
    to let me have it quickly, for it is barely possible that I can get back before telegraphic
    communications will be cut off.' Without rising to put his troops in motion, or without the
    slightest manifestation of interest in the condition of General Couch, or of the peril to which the
    loyal people of Chambersburg were exposed, he merely said, 'Tell Couch I will be there in the
    morning.' It was then, I think, about four o'clock, A.M. Returning to Greencastle, I found that
    already the Chambersburg office was closed, having first reported that General Couch had all his
    military forces and supplies on the cars, and that the Confederate advance was about to enter the
    town."
    <p>The other account is from H. R. Fetterhoff, M.D., of Baltimore, Maryland, but at the
    time of the war telegraph operator at Greencastle, Pennsylvania.  Dr. Fetterhoft says:
    
    <p>"At the time these events transpired I was telegraph operator at Greencastle, and had the
    means of knowing what was going on generally. In the evening of Friday, July 29th, 1864, about
    eight o'clock, General Averell's command passed through Greencastle on their way from
    Hagerstown toward Chambersburg, and bivouacked for the night a short distance north of the
    town along the road leading to Chambersburg. If my memory serves me right General Averell
    reported his arrival to General Couch at Chambersburg.  At least I so reported it to Mr.
    Gilmore, telegraph operator at Chambersburg. The General sent three or four orderlies to my
    office and informed me of his whereabouts. Mr. D. C. Aughinbaugh, operator at Hagerstown,
    Mr. T. R. Bard, and I think several other persons from that place, were at the office in the
    evening and at intervals during the night. The scouts reported that the Confederates had built
    campfires in the neighborhood of State Line, four miles south of Greencastle, and it was
    supposed that they had encamped there for the night. About midnight, or perhaps a little later,
    Mr. Gilmore informed me that the telegraph lilies west of Chambersburg on the Pittsburg
    turnpike had been cut, showing that the enemy after building the campfires at the State Line as a
    blind had moved in the direction of Upton and Bridgeport on General Averell's left flank. I
    immediately informed General Averell of this fact, when he sent me a message thanking me for
    the information, and requesting me to keep him posted in regard to any information I might
    obtain.  About one o'clock A.M. July 30th, General Couch sent an order to General Averell
    directing him to 'Move on to Chambersburg at once.' I immediately sent this message with an
    orderly, but never beard from him again. In about a half hour General Couch repeated the
    message in the same words, and I sent another, orderly with the message, but still no answer.
    The same order was repeated about every half hour until my orderlies were all gone and I had no one to carry the last message, when Mr. Bard came to my office and volunteered to deliver it. After searching for General Averell and finding
    him he delivered the message. I then learned that when I had sent General Averell the
    information that the Confederates were in his rear, or on his flank, he moved his head-quarters
    from the rear of his line, where it had been, up into the line without informing the orderlies or
    any one else, consequently no one knew where to find him, and the messages had not been
    delivered and only reached him near four o'clock A.M. when Mr. Bard delivered them. The
    Confederates entered Chambersburg about this time, and Mr. Gilmore bade me 'good-bye' and
    left the office."
