the Rosedale Seminary. We congratulate the one on the prospect of having an essential want supplied, and a flourishing
institution, of a kind second in importance to none but those sacred to worship, built up in our midst; and we congratulate the
other in the tokens of popular appreciation of which his school is the recipient both in word and in deed. More than eighty pupils
we understand, are in daily attendance; but Mr. R. is determined that the sphere of instruction should keep pace with the
increase of pupils, and that acceptable and thorough teachers shall be added from time to time, as occasion demands. See
advertisement in another column for proof of this. <p>We owe it to ourselves to sustain, unitedly, such an institution. If in the several departments of female education our efforts are
concentrated upon something which promises to be a permanency, rather than upon that which does not, our town will reap the
advantage. Parents at a distance may wish a safe and pleasant location for their daughters, with every needful facility for their
education, should not do better than commit them to the careful management of Mr. Reeves and his lady. Their house, with its
comfort, friendliness, and Christian influence within, and attractive grounds without, is just the place where young ladies should
be happy and studious.</td></tr></table></body></html>
