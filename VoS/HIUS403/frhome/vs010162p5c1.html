A large stage was erected in the church, over the alter, upon which were seated twenty-five little girls dressed in white.  These children sang a number of humns, national and sentimental pieces, in a most delightful manner.  A Melodeon was placed upon the stage at which Lucy Eyster, one of the children, presided with a most happy effect and with great skill for one of her years.  The orchestra, in the gallery of the church, also discoursed some very excellent music.  The stage and other parts of the church were handsomely decorated with evergreens, producing a very beautiful effect.  The most <i>practical</i> part of the celebration was the taking up of a collection in aid of the "Orphans Home," established by the Rev. Passavant, at Pittsburg.  Previous to taking up the collection an appropriate discourse was delivered by the Pastor of the church, Rev. Jacob Steek.  We would state, in connection, that the children of the Lutheran Sunday School contribute some sixty dollars a year to the support of an orphan in Mr. Passavants institution.  The collection was not intended to defray this expense but is a special donation to the "Orphan's Home."  At the conclusion of the celebration our esteemed fellow townsman Geo. R. Messersmith, Esq., Superintendent of the School, under whose auspicies this festival was gotten up, made the school a valuable "Christmas Present" consisting of 350 volumes for the Library.  These books are of the most approved kind, are nearly all of a large size and very handsomely and richly bound.  A very large audience was in attendance, the church being filled to its utmost capacity.  The celebration afforded to all present the hightest degree of gratification.</td></tr></table></body></html>
