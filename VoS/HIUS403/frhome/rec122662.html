<p>Fryday.  At 10 1/2 <font size = -2>A.M.</font> I wnet to Rebuks to 
help along with the butchering. L. told me I could not help any so I sat 
a little while in the room thinking whether to stay or to go home.  Just 
at this time Aunt Elenor came.  So I soon decided what to do. & got on my 
shawl and fixed baby and came home with her.  L. did not wish me to go 
but my judgment told me I had better.  Aunt brought me 1/2 dox. egs. & a 
small roll of butter.  I dressed myself and went down street with her & 
helped her pick a dress.  Called at the P.O. on my way home & got a 
letter from My Samuel with an order for fifty ($50) dollars, his county 
bounty.  I took it down to Mr. Hoke & had him draw the money & left it in 
his care taking a receipt for it from him...
