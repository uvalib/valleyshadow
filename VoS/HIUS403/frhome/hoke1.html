<H2>Hoke recounts the "Great Invasion"</H2>
<body>
The people who lived along the southern border during the war were 
kept
in an almost continuous state of anxiety. The booming of cannon was 
frequently
heard, and the rumors of approaching foes at times threw the whole 
community
into a state of intense excitement. Dr. Philip Schaff, in his notes on
Matthew xxiv. 6, as published in Lange's commentary, in a lucid and 
graphic
manner describes the excitement which prevailed along the border 
during the
week preceding the appearance of the invading army. The doctor, whose 
ability
as a scholar and writer is -widely known, resided in Mercersburg, 
Franklin
county, at the time of the war, and the scripture upon which his 
comments
are based is as follows: -,'And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of 
wars."
The doctor says: "I beg leave to quote a passage from my diary 
during the
famous Southern invasion of Pennsylvania under General Lee, in June 
and July,
1863, which may throw some light oil this passage (Matthew xxiv: 6.) 
in its
wider application to different periods of repeated fulfillment.<p>
