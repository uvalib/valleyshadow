<h3>OCTOBER 10</h3><p>

Rain today. A great saving for the farmers who were facing a great 
drought. business is flourishing in town. The Rebels are in
Mercersburg, and on the way to Chambersburg from St. Thomas. This evening 
they entered our town, demanding its
surrender. Some 1500-2000 cavalry, with some artillery. They immediately 
took possession of the bank and telegraph office.
Also requisitioned provisions, clothing, etc. as to their needs. It has 
all happened so quickly, we all felt safe knowing the Union
Army was in Williamsport, MD. The Confederate troops all look well fed 
and clothed, and so far, conducted themselves
orderly. They will be busy stripping our stores and gathering up horses. 
I have sent my three off with Proctor, I hope they got
away safely. I did not go to bed until after one o'clock, watching what 
may happen after all retire. So far, all quiet. Secreted
some of my most valuable papers and went to bed, slept soundly until 
morning. <p><HR>


<h3>OCTOBER 11</h3><p>

Clear and pleasant. Rose early and to the square. Saw Major Gen. Stewart 
and Gen. Hampden in conference. The stores
were all closed. Broke open IsaacHutton's shoe store, helped themselves 
freely. Then to the depot and confiscated a large
shipment of arms and clothes. Afterwards, set fire to all the buildings 
and left town by the Baltimore Pike. They had fired the
building of Wanderlick and Nead Co. which was used as a storehouse for 
government ammunition. The succeeding explosions
of shells and powder was tremendous. The loss must be very great. All the 
machinery and present locomotives destroyed at
the shops. This was all the fault of A.H. Lule, Supt. of the railroad 
shops. He should have sent the war supplies back to
Carlisle, instead of keeping them here, being warned as early as three 
o'clock the past afternoon. However, this saved our
stores from being pillaged as they got enough at the depot. Everybody out 
on the streets seeking news. 

About mid-day, a large scouting party of our troops came thru producing a 
great sensation. We hear of another group at
Waynesboro, marching towards Gettysburg hoping to head them off. All in 
all the invasion was a very orderly one. The troops
were well disciplined and polite. Not a single house or person injured. 
They were more orderly than troops of ours that have
passed this way. Outside of their plundering of Isaac Hutton's shoe 
store, nothing else occurred to criticize them. Many people
from the country came into town in search of news and carried home relics 
of the Rebel Invasion, as shells, balls, saberparts,
parts of musquets, etc. Nearly every man and boy had some souvenier.

<h3>OCTOBER 12</h3><p>

Clear and pleasant, the Sabbath. All is calm, who would suspect that so 
much excitement had prevailed yesterday. However,
there is much apprehension they will return. Some 2,000 troops from 
Maryland came this morning and encampted outside of
town on the Baltimore Pike. I knew not of their coming and arrival until 
this afternoon. At three, attending a religious service at
the Hall among the wounded soldiers. Rev. Bausman conducted the services.

<h3>OCTOBER 13</h3><p>
Cloudy, a little rain. The encamped Rebels have moved on to Fayetteville, 
and across the mountain to Cashtown. There they
went South thru Emmittsburg and Monrovia to the mouth of the Monocacy. 
Thus completely avoiding the searching Federal
forces, and disappeared into Virginia. Their mission accomplished. 
<p><hr>

<h3>OCTOBER 14</h3><p>

Pleasant. Out to my farm to ascertain the damage done by the soldiers. 
Much fencing gone for fuel, and what corn they didn't
use, tried to burn. Many farmers without horses and at a loss to do any 
work. We find no buildings burned or occupants
harmed.

<h3>OCTOBER 15</h3><p>

Much apprehension about the Rebels returning as they have camped along 
the Potomac. We can hear cannoning from the
vicinity of Hancock, perhaps some skirmishes. The Rebels had found little 
at our bank of value, but did not complain. They
were looking mainly for horses. I had previously sent mine with my man 
Proctor to Waynesboro, some 16 miles distance, for
safekeeping. Many others not as fortunate as they delayed. They did take 
eight young colored men and boys along with them,
in spite of their parents pleading. I fear we will never see them again, 
unless they can escape.

<h3>OCTOBER 24</h3><p>

Our church has decided on the final adoption of the much discussed 
Liturgy as a book to be used in our church and family
worship. I am glad this had been decided, we were much divided. 
<hr>

<h3>OCTOBER 25</h3><p>

Pleasant. Business at the bank, rode to my farm to inspect the new 
seeding. Home early in the evening to do some writing.
Agreeable to the solicitation of Doctor Wilson, an artist, I sat for my 
portrait. He noticed some of my landscape work, which
he commended. I suppose my work would improve with practice, but it is 
now too late in life to hope for much proficiency.
Some cavalry here this evening, to secure horses for Gen. McClelland's 
command. They hope to find two hundred by
tomorrow evening.<p> 

I fear Lincoln is a tool in the hands of the Abolitionists. We need a man 
of Jackson's iron will in our present emergency to hold
our National Government together.

<h3>OCTOBER 27</h3><p>

Cloudy. Our town filling up with drafted men to be sent to camp for 
training. Visited a wounded Mason (Captain Miller
Moody from Ohio) who lost one of his legs at Antietam. He is very low in 
spirits and much emaciated, his wife and sons are
visiting him. Spent some time with Wilson, the artist.

<h3>OCTOBER 28</h3><p>

Clear and pleasant. We had a sale of the Rebels worn-out horses, left 
here by Stewart's cavalry. Spent some time with Mr.
Wilson, the artist. <p>
