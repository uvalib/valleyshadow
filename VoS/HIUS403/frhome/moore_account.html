<p>  The Burning of Chambersburg, Pa., July 30, 1864, by General John 
McCausland's Confederate cavalry was a unique incident of the civil war, 
as it was the first time the Confederates had applied the torch in 
retaliation for similar offenses committed by the Federal army.
<p>It created consternation and indignation throughout the entire North.  
They had forgotten that Colonel Montgomery, of the Federal army, 
committed such gross outrages on private citizens in South Carolina, on 
raids made into the State-acts so outrageous and unwarranted that he was 
summarily dismissed from the army; Kilpatrick and Sheridan were 
barn-burners and mill-burners by instinct; or orders; Jackson, Miss., was 
partially destroyed; one-third of Alexandria, Va., was burned, and 
Jacksonville, Fla., nearly all destroyed by fire from the torch of Federal 
soldiers, yet when we asked them to take a little of their medicine we 
became incendiaries and freebooters.
<p>Chambersburg is in Franklin County, Pa., about fifty or sixty miles 
from the Potomac.  It was a substantial, well-built, and beautifully 
laid-out town of some 6,000 or 8,000 people.  These people had for some 
time been without any military protection, but at the time we were there 
General Couch was encamped at Mercersburg, sixteen miles distant, with a 
battery and a force of men, and General Averill was encamped at 
Greencastle, ten miles, distant, with 2,500 cavalry.  Why did they permit 
us to burn Chambersburg?  This is a question that has never been solved.  
they had three men to our one, as our force, all told, did not exceed 
1,000 men.
<p><center>A NORTHERN EXPLANATION</center>
<p>From a little pamphlet published a few months after the burning, 
written by Rev. B. S. Schenck, D. D., I 
quote this paragraph in explanation:<br>
<p><i>  "General Averill possibly might have saved Chambersburg, and I know 
General Couch exhausted himself to get Averill to fall back from 
Greencastle to this point.  I do not say that General Averill is to 
blame, for he was under orders from General Hunter, and not subject to 
General Couch.  He had a large force of the enemy in his front, and until 
it is clearly proved to the contrary I must believe he did his whole 
duty.  The enemy under McCausland, Bradley Johnson, and Gilmer, let it be 
recollected had at least 3,000 cavalry, with artillery at command, 800 
being in town, the rest within supporting distance.  Johnson's command 
occupied the high eminence one mile west of the town with a battery.  No 
better position could have been desired.  They were flushed at the 
prospect of plunder and pillage; their horses were fresh and sleek; their 
men resolute and defiant.  On the other hand, Averill and his men had 
been worn out and jaded by long and heavy marches in Western Virginia 
[viz] for a number of consecutive weeks.  Their horse were run down, and 
many of them ready to die, so that 280 of them could not be taken any 
farther, but were left here to recruit.  It is, therefore, only
scarcely probable, that, even if Averill's force of 2,500 men had been 
here, a successful resistance could have been made under these 
circumstances.  But Averill and his men were not here until several hours 
after the work of destruction was accomplished and the enemy, gloating 
over his vengeful deeds, was miles away on the Western turnpike towards 
Mercersburg."</i>
<p>I cannot explain why these troops did not intercept us, except upon the 
ground that we would whip them if they gave us the chance.  Averill's 
men were good soldiers, and in the many encounter we had with them they 
proved a match for us, and the reasons stated in the above paragraph may 
possibly explain why, but this pamphlet is so full of glaring falsehoods 
that upon the general grounds I believe nothing in it.  Chambersburg had 
been raided twice before McCausland went therein 1864-once by General 
"Jeb" Stuart in 1862, and in 1863 by a portion of General Lee's army, 
just prior to the battle at Gettysburg.  The farmers of Franklin and 
Adams counties had been kept in a state of suspense and uneasiness by 
McCausland's cavalry, which had made several incursions into that section 
with remarkable results.  For several weeks previous to that raid to 
Chambersburg, it had been reported that we had crossed the Potomac, and 
were steering up the Cumberland Valley, all which being untrue, the 
farmers afterwards treated these reports with indifference, apathy seized 
them, and when we did go we found everybody at home with stock, &c.
<p><center>McCAUSLAND'S REGIMENTS</center>
<p>McCausland's command consisted of the 8th, 14th, 16th and 17th 
Virginia Cavalry, and Colonel Witcher's Battalion, to which had been 
added for this occasion the Marylanders of General Bradley T. Johnson.  
We left the vicinity of Martinsburg on Thursday night, and crossed the 
Potomac about noon on Friday, July 29th, at Cherry Run, about 40 miles 
from where we started.  Harry Gilmore had asked the privilege of 
conducting the advance, which was granted, and when we arrived on the 
banks of the Potomac, the Marylanders were safely on the other side 
waiting for us.  The river at this point was deep and wide, and it was a 
novel sight to see men scattered over the river with a firm grip on the 
horses' tails, slowly toiling to a small island in the middle of the 
stream, from which point it was fordable. Not one man or horse was lost 
in crossing, and two hours sufficed for the whole command to safely land 
and form.  It was generally known where we were going, and when night 
came on we were twenty miless from the Potomac.  It was clear, starry 
night, and forty miles had to be made by daylight.  Orders had been 
issued for the men to avoid boisterous talking or laughing, and so well 
were the instructions carried out that we passed through villages and town 
with our 1,000 men and were not discovered by the sleepers.  On the 
approach of dawn it was whispered around that we were in the vicinity of 
Chambersburg, and when it became broad daylight we were in line of battle 
on the high hills overlooking the doomed city.
<p>The 8th regiment was dismounted and started into town, followed by a 
small detachment of mounted cavalry, on streets and alleys converging at 
what was called the "Diamond," about the centre of the town.  A battery 
of four small pieces occupied an eminence, which occasionally threw shells 
over the city which, I suppose, was done to intimidate rather than harm.
<p><center>TRIBUTE OR SACRIFICE.</center>
<p>When the men had arrived at the objective point, the citizens and City 
Council were summoned before General McCausland, and Adjutant-General 
Fitzhugh read them the order of General Early, levying a tribute of 
$100,000 in gold or $500,000 in United States currency, for the burning 
of property by the Federal army in Virginia.  The little pamphlet I 
mentioned above, written by Rev. Dr. Schenck, had this to say on this 
point:<br>
<p><i> "Captain Fitzhugh exhibited to J. W. Douglas, Esq., an attorney of 
this 
place, a written order, with the name of Jubal Early to it, directing that 
Chambersburg should be burned in retaliation for the burning of six 
houses in Virginia by Hunter.  The burning of Chambersburg was then 
ordered by one of the corps commanders of General Lee's army, instead of 
a guerilla chief, thus placing the responsibility squarely upon the 
shoulders of Gen. Lee.  We have, in support of this, the statement of Rev. 
Mr. Edwards, Episcopal clergyman of Hagerstown, who was 
taken as a hostage after Chambersburg had been destroyed.  He was brought to 
General Early's headquarters at Williamsport, and 
there paroled to effect his exchange.  General Early there informed him 
that he had directed Chambersburg to be burned in retaliation for the 
destruction of property in Virginia by Grant, Meade and Hunter, and that 
the account was now square."</i>
<p>  They seemed to think we were jesting and bluffing.  They asked for 
time to consider, which was understood by our men to gain time so that 
Averill and Couch could reach there.  An hour was granted, at the 
expiration of which they (the citizens and Council) announced that that 
amount of money was not in the town, and they would not pay it if they 
could.  A detail was at once made and ordered to fire the town, and in 
one hour the business portion of the beautiful city was blackened, 
smoking ruins.  The main part of the town was enveloped in flames in ten 
minutes.  No notice was given, except that if the terms of the order were 
not complied with, destruction would be the result.  This little book or 
pamphlet, which I have quoted from before, says:<br>
<p><i>"No time was given to remove women and children, the sick nor the 
dead, but the work of destruction was at once commenced.  They divided 
into squads and fired every other house, and often every house, if there 
was any prospect of plunder.  They would beat in the door with iron bars 
and heavy planks, smash up furniture with an axe, throw oil or fluid upon 
it, and ply the match.  They almost invariably entered every room of 
each house, rifled the drawers of the bureau, appropriate money, jewelry, 
watches and any other valuables, and would often present pistols to the 
heads of inmates and demand money or their lives.  Few houses escaped 
rifling-nearly all were plundered of everything that could be carried 
away.  Many families had the utmost difficulty to get out themselves in 
time. Several invalids had to be carried out as red flames licked their 
couches."</i>
<p><center>SAW NO ATROCITIES</center>
<p>Now, I was there, and I never saw anything out of the kind, and I am 
inclined to think the author of this book was drawing a decidedly "long 
bow."  He may not be an expert and varied at it as General Eagan in 
picturing General Miles, but approaches him gently.  I had my eyes and 
ears open in the two hours, the army was there, and I saw nothing and 
heard nothing of the atrocities said to have been committed.  No doubt 
wrongs and atrocities were committed by some, but no such thing as 
deliberate, wanton burning was ever practiced by the Confederate army.  
The burning of Chambersburg was purely a war measure, as much as the 
freeing of slaves.  Of course we all regretted that it was necessary to 
burn this city to teach our enemies a lesson, and every human heart must 
have sympathized with those who were so unfortunate as to be located 
there.  It was a measure I have never justified.
<p>The conflagaration at its height was one of the surpassing grandeur and 
terror and had the day not been a calm one, many would have been licked up 
by the flames in the streets.  Tall, black columns od smoke rose up to 
the very skies; around it were wrapped long fantastic shapes.  Here and 
there gigantic whirlwinds would lift clothing and light substances into 
the air, and intermingled with the weird scene could be heard the shrieks 
of women and children.  Cows, dogs, and cats were consumed in their 
attempt to escape.  It was a picture that may be misrepresented, but 
cannot be heightened, and must remain forever indelibly impressed upon 
the mind of those who witnessed it. 
<p>There were 369 buildings consumed, and many of them valuable.  The 
courthouse was estimated to be worth $80,000: Colonel A. k. McClure's 
residence $20,000; the German Reform printing establishment, $15,000; a 
banking-house $20,000.  In all, eleven squares were totally destroyed.  
In these houses there were all the household effect of these unfortunate 
citizens, which included fifty-nine pianos.  The total loss of everything 
was estimated to be over a million dollars.  I have seen gentlemen from 
Chambersburg recently, who tell me that the burned squares have been 
replaced with handsome new buildings, much superior to those we 
destroyed.  In the centre of the public square has been erected a 
monument commemorating the burning of the city by the "Rebels" in 1864.
<p><center>Colonel McClure Captured Them.</center>
<p>I may incidentally mention that we had orders to arrest and bring 
Colonel A. K. McClure of the Philadelphia <i>Times</i>, who at that time 
lived in Chambersburg, within our lines, but his hospitality completely 
captured those commissioned to do so, and he was never informed of the order.
<p>From the time we left the Potomac until we began to retreat from the 
burning city, not a gun was fired by our men, except the few shells 
thrown over the town during its occupancy by us.  Several of out men 
straggled and were killed by citizens or soldiers of the Federal army, 
who probably were at home.  *   *
<p>About noon we abandoned Chambersburg and turned our faces toward the 
Potomac.  Just on the outskirts of the city I saw a large bank barn, 
filled with hay or some very combustible material, on fire, probably the 
work of some of our soldiers.  It was an unwarranted piece of devilry, as 
our officers did everything they could to prevent such things.  The 
orders of our chief had been obeyed-to bring $100,000 in gold back with 
us, or burn the town.  The latter having effectually done, fire should 
have stopped there.
<p>We crossed a small mountain that evening west of Chambersburg, and were 
not on the road we came.  By noon the next day we were at Hancock, Md.  A 
terrific thunder storm was prevailing, and we did not go into town.  We 
recrossed the Potomac that night at Old Town, following the North Branch, 
and went into camp about two miles below Moorefield, in Hardy county.  
The Yankees under Averill had been close after us, and occasionally small 
brushes would take place between our rear guard and their advance, our 
object being only to check them until the brigade could get further on.
<p>The many days of weary and exhaustive marching had nearly worn out the 
men and horses-no sleep or stop for three nights-and the horses were 
unsaddled and turned out to graze-not dreaming of molestation by the 
Yankees.  But in this we were deceived.  They had kept close up to us, 
and towards morning they captured our outposts by disguising themselves 
as Confederates and stating they were sent to relieve them.
<p>This left the road open and clear to our camp.  Just as daylight began 
to show itself over the mountain the sleeping camp was aroused by volley 
after volley in quick succession, and the whistle of thousands of bullets 
greeted the ear.  Averill's 2,500 cavalry were in our camp.  As soon as 
our men understood what was the matter a confusion took place not easily 
described.  The Federals had as their war cry, "Remember Chambersburg!"
<p>It was a prevalent story in camp that Averill's men were instructed to 
take no prisoners.  We lost 100 men by capture and a large number 
killed-how many I don't know.  I was sleeping near the battery, and had an 
opportunity to see the awful destruction it did when Averill attempted to 
force the ford.  In five minutes the water was blue with floating corpses.
<p>Lieutenant Alfred Mackey, of Rockbridge, was killed instantly: a brave 
and good man, who refused to surrender, and was shot through, a 
ball entering under his armpit.  I was more fortunate than many; I rode a 
horse that could not be turned out to graze, as it was difficult to catch 
him.  I had picketed him, and about five minutes before the attack he 
woke me up by stepping over me, a habit he had.  Noticing that he had  
consumed all the grass in reach, I thought I would move him where we 
could get more.  While doing this I heard the first shot, and then a 
number in quick succession.  i understood the situation at once.  In two 
minutes men and horses were running in every direction.
<p>After the Yankees had covered about half of the camp, I saw some men 
running toward Moorefield-a general stampede.  With nothing but a halter 
on my horse and no saddle, I turned in the same direction, and away I 
went at 2.50 speed, a number of Yankees close behind me, shooting all the 
time.  My route lay up through a cornfield, the high corn at times hiding 
me from my pursuers.  I thought my fate was sealed when I had gone about 
a half mile and saw a high Jefferson fence directly across my path.  But 
my dear old friend, who carried me out of many difficulties, seemed to 
gather new strength, an inspiration born of despair, as he got closer to 
the new obstruction, and when at it, to my surprise and relief, he leaped 
over like a deer, never touching a rail or slacking his gait, and speed on 
with the swiftness of the wind until Moorefield was reached.
<p>I glanced back to see what had become of my pursuers, but they never 
got over the fence.  In a few minutes, on the southern side of the town, 
a number of our command had collected, determined to hold the Yankees in 
check; but they never came in any force farther than our camp.  I lost my 
saddle and bridle, and a small ham of meat that I had kept as a reserve 
when nothing else could be had.
<p>This completes the story of the burning of Chambersburg, and is 
written entirely from personal recollection.  Other may have seen it 
differently, but I have given the truth as I saw it.  northing, so far as 
I know, has been written by a Confederate on the subject, and yet it was 
on the most daring and reckless undertaking of the war.
<p><center>WANT NO NEW GRAVE-KEEPERS</center>
<p>What can I say of these daring riders, and, in general, of the 
Confederate soldier?  He stands alone!  Scorning a pension, too proud to 
beg, too honorable to steal and perjure himself by swearing that his 
poverty came from being in the army!  What a contrast to those who 
opposed him-963,000 of them living as government paupers, and 
$200,000,000 wrung out of the South to help pay these mendicants.  And 
yet the Confederate is more loyal to the United States Government than 
these cormorants at the public crib.  No doubt there are many deserving 
pensioners, who ought to be recognized by the government in the shape of 
an annuity, who acutually\tually received wounds and had their health undermined 
by the war.  The Confederate says, cheerfully, pay him.
  <p>  This is a time of "gush," but you will never get a Confederate who 
stood on the "fiery fringe of battle" to say that he wants a pension.  We 
are able and willing to work and make a living, and if we are not, the 
State and local authorities will see that we do not others than 
ourselves, we demur.  We have kept them green for forty years, why not 
forty years longer?  They need no care, except such as can be rendered by 
our fair daughters.  The memory of the dead will always be precious to 
us, for was there ever such an army that had such dauntless courage, such 
unwavering fidelity, and made so many heroic sacrifices?
