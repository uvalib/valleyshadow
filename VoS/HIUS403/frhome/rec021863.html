Sultry & rainy.  Mouth better.  Baby good.  Mended clothes all day--Annie 
P. went to Shepensburg for a sleighride with Hazelet--wore my 
hood--Evening--Rec'd a letter from my Sm'l.  Through the carelessness of 
his Capt. had to lie over in Harisburg where he wrote me from--He speaks 
of the wicketness of military men & asks my sincerest prayers for his 
preservation--O! for more religion--I feel very much on the 
background--My greatest desires are to become more spiritual.
