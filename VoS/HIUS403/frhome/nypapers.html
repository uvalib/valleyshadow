The heartlessness exhibited by some of the New York papers in reference 
to the burning of our once beautiful and flourishing town and the 
consequent suffering and distress of our citizens is without a parallel 
in the annals of brutality.  The fanatical <i>Tribune</i> and "satanic" 
<i>Herald</i> led off in the work of shamelessly detaining the citizens 
of this community.  From the <i>Herald</i> perhaps nothing better could 
be expected.  The system of black-mailing which it has carried on for the 
past thirty years has come to be regarded by the public as part of its 
legitimate business; and its wholesale libels upon the characters of 
innocent men and women are so well understood that they fall harmlessly 
at the feet of those whom they are intended to injure.  But from the 
<i>Tribune</i>, notwithstanding its fanaticism on the subject of slavery, 
better things were expected.  Its chief editor, Horace Greely, was 
regarded by his friends as an eminently benevolent and humane man.  Even 
his political opponents save him credit for sincerity in his wild 
idosyncracies about the equality of the human race and his loud 
professions of sympathy for the opposed and down-trodden of the earth.  
His heartless course towards the suffering people of Chambersburg proves 
him to be nothing but an arrant hypocrite.  Instead of being the 
philanthropist which he would fain have the world believe, he turns out 
to be an inhuman, brutal wretch, not a whit better than the incendiaries 
of McCausland who fired our town.  Perhaps, however, it was the 
misfortune of our suffering citizens that they were <i>white</i>; if they 
had been <i>black</i>, doubtless the bowels of his compassion would have 
opened and their distress would have drawn tears of sympathy big as hen 
eggs from the eyes of the whitenated and white-livered philosopher of the 
<i>Tribune</i>.

<p>

The conduct of Mr. Greely is the more inexcusable for the reason that the 
burning of Chambersburg was the indirect result of his barbarous 
teachings.  From the very beginning of this war's certain class of 
fanatical men in the north, of whom Mr. Greely is chief, have urged a 
system of warfare against the South's totally inconsistent with the 
civilization of the age.  To burn and destroy, lay waste and make 
desolate the Southern territory, was their theory of war.  They never 
seemed to dream of retaliation; or if they did they doubtless considered 
themselves to so far out of the reach of danger that, in any event, 
<i>they</i> and <i>their</i> homes would be safe.  And now when their 
pernicious policy is bearing bitter fruit to the people along the 
border--when our citizens have despoiled of their property and their late 
comfortable and happy homes transformed into heaps of smouldering ruins, 
they mock at our calamities and ridicule our distresses!  Such baseness 
would disgrace Sepoys or Hottentots.

<p>

We are glad to be able to make an exception in this matter of favor of 
the New York <i>World</i>.  It is a high-toned and honorable journal and 
refrained from joining its contemporaries in their unjust and libelous 
assaults on the people of this community.  After quoting an extract from 
Col. McClure's letter in the <i>Press</i> the <i>World</i> added the 
following truthful remarks:
<p>
"Now we submit that, in view of these facts, the people of Chambersburg 
and Southern Pennsylvania have been most cruelly used.  After filling all 
the calls for men honestly--after raising state defense regiments, and 
hundred day men in addition--they are stripped of their defenders by 
orders from Washington.  Their town is destroyed by the rebels, and then 
they are grossly insulted in their military by the organs of the very 
administration which left them exposed to their enemies."
