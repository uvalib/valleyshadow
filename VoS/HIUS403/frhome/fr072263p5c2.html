<p>Notwithstanding the innumerable inconveniences to which our citizens 
have been exposed by the robberies of the rebels and the continued 
occupation of our county by the military, the wheat crop has been safely 
harvested with comparatively little loss.  With due allowance for the 
loss resulting from want of 
labor, stock, wagons, and other implements stolen or partially destroyed 
by the rebels, quite a full average crop of wheat has been gathered.  The 
wheat was sowed very late last fall as a rule, because of the excessive 
drought, and much apprehension was felt by the farmers that the crop 
would be a partial failure; but it has turned out most fortunate, for had 
the wheat been ready to harvest by the 1st of July, as it usually is, it 
must have been almost if not entirely lost.  The rebles occupied the 
county until the 10th of July on the southern border, and after they left 
the farmers had to gather up the stock they had saved by sending it off, 
which took several days more, so that much of our wheat was harvested as 
late as the 20th of July.  Some loss was of course suffered, as it was 
too ripe to be cut and handled without shelling; but upon the whole, 
considering how narrowly they saved any part of it, the farmers have done 
well with their wheat.
<p>The crop of clover hay was lost in the entire county, excepting 
perhaps in a few ditricts bordering on Cumberland and in the valley.  
Considerable timothy is raised in the county, however, and it is saved, 
although not got up in good condition because of the unfavorable weather.
<p>The corn crop will be short for want of plowing.  In two-thirds of the 
county, the corn has not been worked since the 15th of June, as the 
rebels came on the 16th, and farmers could not have their stock at home 
for a month thereafter.  Just the season when corn needs to be worked 
most, it was necessarily neglected, and a short crop must be the 
consequence.  The season has been singularly favorable for corn, and 
there is a most luxuriant growth of stocks, grass and weeds; but it will 
not ear well when not worked in July.  Should the season still continue 
favorable, we may have nearly an average crop of corn; but had it been 
properly worked, Franklin would have produced the largest corn crop this 
season ever raised in the county.  The potatoes are, of course, suffering 
with the corn for want of plowing, but not to the same extent, as they 
were worked pretty generally after the farmers returned.
<p>The loss of a month in mid-summer to our farmers is a most serious 
embarrassment to them, and one from which they will not recover before 
next spring.  It will keep them behind their work until late in the 
fall, and the want of horses occasioned by the hundreds stolen by the 
rebels, will of course retard them very much in their operations.  Let 
them be careful to undertake only that which they can do well, for a 
small crop well putout is infinitely better than a large on badly done.
