THE REPOSITORY re-appears to-day after a suspension covering three 
issues, necessitated by the rebel vandalism which culminated in the 
burning of Chambersburg on Saturday, the 30th of July.  We print it 
somewhat reduced in dimensions for the reason that it is impossible to 
obtain a press sufficiently large for our old size in less than six 
months from the manufacturers.  Another reason--the increase of the cost 
of white paper over twenty percent, within sixty days--would fully 
justify the reduction, if it did not imperatively demand it; but it is 
enough that to print a larger sheet is a physical impossibility at 
present.  Our types, presses, and everything pertaining to the office, 
excepting only the ledger and newspaper list were destroyed; and as all 
the other offices in the town shared the same fate, we had to refit the 
office completely in all its departments before a paper could be 
printed.  We have done so as speedily as lightening could order, steam 
transport, and expert hands set up and print for us; and the Repository 
again greets its old readers to-day after having passed through the fiery 
ordeal of the full measure of rebel vengeance.
<p>
We need hardly remind our patrons that our loss has been a severe one, 
and that prompt payments of outstanding accounts is an imperative 
necessity to enable us to meet the extraordinary demands just made upon 
us.  We ask no patronage excepting upon the principle of rendering full 
compensation to both readers and advertisers; but we must enforce the 
CASH SYSTEM under all circumstances.  We have lost fully $7,500 by the 
fire; white paper now costs us nearly one-half more per sheet than it did 
one year ago; labor has justly advanced as the necessaries of life have 
increased in cost; everything we use has doubled or trebled in value, and 
we must strictly adhere to a cash business or suffer serious embarassments.
<p>
We hope, when better days shall come; when Peace and order and a restored 
Union shall be the golden fruits of this wanton, appalling war, to resume 
our old form and old prices; but till then, we are prepared to make any 
and every possible sacrifice to maintain the last hope of Free 
[F]overnment by the preservation of the Union of our fathers.  We can 
take no step backward, though fire and sword may threaten and at times 
fall with all of McCausland's fiendish fury upon our homes and places of 
business.  Every blackened wall and withered tree left us monuments of 
the unbridled atrocity of our foes, but hastens the day of final 
reckoning and triumph for the cause for the cause of Right; and sad and 
cruel as is the sacrifice, if it be well for the Republic, for ourselves 
we have no tears, no sorrows, no regrets, save that unholy treason has 
won a winding sheet so fearfully crimsoned with loyal blood.  There is no 
sacrifice that can be weighed in the balance with the unity of these States.
