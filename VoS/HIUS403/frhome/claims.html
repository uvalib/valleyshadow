During the spring of 1866, nearly six hundred Chambersburg residents filed 
claims 
at the Chambersburg courthouse to report destroyed property that was 
burned during <a href=burn.html>General McCausland's invasion on July 30, 
1864</a>.  The claims 
report detailed descriptions of lost personal property and real estate.  
Two appraisers were appointed to assess the validity of the claims and 
award appropriate monetary amounts to individuals who lost property.  On 
February 15, 1866, 
$500,000 was allocated to the residents of Chambersburg in relief of the 
burning by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania.  The money was distributed 
pro rata at about thirty percent of the awarded amount.  

<p>

The devastation of Chambersburg's burning 
on July 30, 1864, included losses of both personal property and 
real estate.  Personal items including tools, food, furniture, and clothing as well as real
estate ranging from houses to churches left many individuals without
basic necessities and shelter.  The total damage is estimated at 
three million dollars, of which $1,783,950 was real estate property. 
 Although the upper classes lost more total property than
the underprivileged, the poor undoubtedly suffered much more as a result of
the burning.  The poor residents did not have the money nor the resources to
purchase new supplies or find new places to live; many were left homeless and 
struggled to regain economic stability.  The richer families were able to survive
by residing in hotels or living temporarily with friends in neighboring areas.

<p>

  The claims also prove that the distinction between the battlefield 
and the homefront became less and less apparent as the war progressed. 
Throughout the beginning of the war, Chambersburg was able to distance itself from battles and occupation.  However, 
as warfare became more militant and soldiers became less tolerant and more impatient,
the northern homefront that once seemed safe suddenly was being inhabited by rebels.  
<a href=occnorthmain.html>The occupations of 1862 and 1863</a> are 
examples of this trend toward destroying the
supposed barrier between the warfront and the homefront.  The claims provide
explicit evidence that the residents of Chambersburg were not expecting such an
invasion.  Very few buildings survived and thousands of dollars in personal 
property were destroyed.  Very few individuals responded to the threat of
General McCausland; consequently, hardly any steps were taken to prevent the 
damage caused by the rebels.
