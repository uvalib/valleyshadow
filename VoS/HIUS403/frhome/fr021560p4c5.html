Samuel Philips, pastor of the German Reformed Church, of this place, preached a powerful sermon, in his own
church, on Sabbath evening last, the 12th inst. After the sermon a collection was taken up for the benefit of the poor of
Chambersburg. <p>Wm. Heyser, Sr., Esq., the President of the Bank of Chambersburg, an Elder in Mr. Philip's church, was to have delivered an
address upon the same occasion; but having been confined to his room for three or four days before, and still being unable to
go out, he was not present -greatly to the disappointment of the audience. All of the congregation sympathize with him in his
affliction and hope that he will soon be able to be about again.
<p>The sermon delivered by Mr. Philips was an able effort. The incidents of genuine benevolence which he cited were well worthy
the imitation of all good, pious zealous christians. The rule of conduct in the life of the founder of Methodism -John Wesley- we
think can scarcely be equalled. It appears that Mr. Wesley started out in his ministerial life with the firm determination to do
good to the poor. Accordingly he gave, the first year of his ministerial labors, out of a salary of thirty pounds sterling, two
pounds to the poor -living on twenty-eight. His second year he got sixty pounds sterling for his services, and, continuing to live
upon twenty-eight, he gave thirty-two to the poor. The third year his salary was one hundred and twenty pounds. He made out
to live, as formerly, on twenty-eight pounds, and gave to the poor the enormous sum of ninety two pounds sterling -about four
hundred and sixty dollars in one year. 
<p>We never heard of this trait in the character of Wesley till Mr. Philips related it; but such being part of Wesley's life, we have
no difficulty in accounting for the cause of his wonderful success in preaching the everlasting word to famishing mortals.
<p>Would it not be well enough for other ministers to continue this good work which Mr. Philips has started -giving the proceeds
of a collection taken up every such an occasion to the poor of the town?</td></tr></table></body></html>
