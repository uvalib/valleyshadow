<b>THE LATE ELECTION</b>

November 16, 1864

The election is over and the Democracy are defeated, by what we means we 
need no stop here to inquire.  It is enough to know that Abraham Lincoln 
has been re-elected for another term of four years.  We labored earnestly 
to accomplish his defeat because we conscientiously believed that his 
re-election would be fraught with the most direful consequences to our 
suffering and bleeding country, and would render Peace and reunion an 
almost hopeless impossibility.  We believe so still; and unless the 
honest and conservative portion of the Republican party, who aided in the 
re-election of Mr. Lincoln while disapproving his policy, will now assert 
their manhood, organize in opposition to his destructive and ruinous 
policy and compel him to change it, we can see no hope for the future.  
Without a change of policy the future must be dark and bloody.  Financial 
ruin must overtake us sooner or later, to be followed by a starless 
midnight of despotism, from which there will be no deliverance.  
Gentlemen of the Republican party, the power is in your hands--use it 
wisely, humanely, and with a sole view to the good of the whole country, 
and perhaps the evils which we predict may yet be averted.  If you do not 
so use your power, but prostitute it to party purposes in the future as 
you have in the past, these evils will come upon us, and the people in 
their wrath will hold <i>you</i> responsible for them.

<p>

Of the future course of the Democratic party is is too soon yet to 
speak.  Its policy in the future will necessarily be shaped by future 
exigencies.  But there need be no delay in saying that for the next four 
years, as having the past four years, it will vindicate its honor and its 
patriotism alike.  It will never degenerate from constitutional 
opposition to faction; it will uphold and advocate in opposition what it 
would enact in administration, with an impartiality unshaken by interest, 
passion, injustice, obloquy, or failure; it will fan the embers of civil 
liberty; it will hold fast to "the Union at all hazards" in the new and 
most terrible dangers which that Union now has to encounter from the 
incompetency of the rulers re-elected to be the instruments of the 
natural salvation.

<p>

We speak for the Democratic party when we say that neither defeat nor the 
yet unforeseen calamities of another four years of Republican misrule 
will shake the settled purpose of its loyal, devoted and patriotic 
members, to keep its measures directed to the attainment of the utmost 
possible good for the country at every varying stage of public affairs.

<p>

It is our most serious conviction that if Mr. Lincoln continues his 
present pernicious policy, the disasters which it will accumulate upon 
him will induce him before his next term shall expire, to make a peace 
recognizing the independence of the South a disunion peace.  Now, as 
ever, the Democratic party will, in the language of its noble 
standard-bearer, who has well deserved the highest honors of the nation 
stand steadfast, immovable, and faithful to the Union at all hazards.  It 
will be its duty to resist a disunion peace by all the moral power of a 
great party, which, though not in possession of the government, can yet 
exert a weight influence upon the public opinion of the country.

<p>

We say then to the Democratic party, stand firm and preserve your 
organization intact.  You made a gallant fight on the 8th of November, 
but were overcome by the power and patronage of the federal government.  
It was a contest between the people and the power.  Power triumphed this 
time but it may not always triumph.  We firmly believe that if the 
country is to be saved at all, it must be saved by and through the 
Democratic party.  We are fully persuaded that it alone can restore the 
Union.  It is this conviction which as lent vigor to its arm, which has 
fired its loyal heart.  But appalling as is the thought of a new lease of 
Republican administration, even this terrible alternative is preferable 
to an abandonment of the Union.

<p>

In the coming period of great civil convulsion the policy of the country 
will in many points be justly controlled by events impossible to be 
foreseen.  But on the one essential point of the Union, it is the duty of 
the country not to be dominated by events, but to make events tend to the 
future greatness of the Republic.  The mission and the most sacred duty 
of the Democratic party is to keep the public mind steady to this polar 
star, alone visible in the blackness of the night now closing in about us.
