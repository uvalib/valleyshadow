you to perform. It is this- -our County Commissioners have laid off the yard in tear of the Court House in a most beautiful and
ornamental manner, and desire to have it further adorned by planting Flowers and Shrubery. This they think the ladies of our
county would gladly undertake, and will, therefore, leave it to be adorned by them in whatever manner their good taste may
suggest, always ready to give whatever assistance may be needed. We must commend our Commissioners for the view they
have taken of this matter--it is right and considerate, and we hope our ladies will not be backward in coming forward with
whatever offering they have to bestow; no matter how trifling the donor may consider it, it will gratefully receive a place. The
Court House is often the place where the attendance of their fathers, husbands, brothers and perhaps, "a dearer one still, and a
nearer one" is required, and something to please the eye, and glad the heart, may create a happy thought and make them feel
that "a thing of beauty is a joy forever."</td></tr></table></body></html>
