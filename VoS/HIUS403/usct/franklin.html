<P>
The majority of the Franklin men who served in the United States Colored 
Troops were farmers and laborers prior to their enlistment. As evidenced in the 
1860 census, they owned little land and had accumulated little wealth.. 
Thus, one incentive to join the war effort was the bounty they would 
eventually receive. In addition, some of the Franklin men substituted for 
white men, thereby receiving more money for joining the army. 
<P>
To learn more about these men's pre-war life, search the 1860 Franklin 
County Population Census. This census provides information about the 
men's family life as well as their age, occupation, place of birth, etc.
