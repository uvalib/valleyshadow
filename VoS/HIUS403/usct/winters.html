The Winters family seemed to have a knack for historical timing.
Joseph and Jacob Winters were probably brothers.  In any case, we know
more of the life of Joe who wrote his autobiography "ten days after
the battle of Gettysburg."  He lived to be 103 years old and died in
Alexandria, Virginia.<p>
Joe Winters father, James, was a brickmaker and made the brick for the
gun works at Harpers Ferry.  Joe lived in Harpers Ferry when his
father made the bricks and then moved with his family to "Halltown" in
Charlestown--the farm on which John Brown was later hange--and
eventually to Chambersburg in 1830.<p>
Called "Indian Dick" by Chambersburg residents, Joe's connection to
the blistering events of John Brown became real in 1859.  According to
Joe's Autobiography, he heard through the grapevine that John Brown
was in Chambersburg incognito, and he arranged the meeting between
Brown and Frederick Douglass in a stone house on West Washington
Street.  Joe Winters claims some credit for influencing Brown to make
his raid on the arsenal his father helped build.
<p>When the Civil War broke out, Joe Winters wrote a poem "at the time
of the draft for the Civil War," called <a

Jacob Winters fought in the Civil War with the U. S. Colored Troops
22nd Regiment Co. D.<p>
