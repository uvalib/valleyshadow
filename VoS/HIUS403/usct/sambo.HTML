When the war broke out, Charles Graham Halpine, an Irishman, enlisted in a 
three months' regiment in New York. In 1862, he was on the staff of 
General David Hunter at Hilton Head, South Carolina. General Hunter 
organized the first regiment of negro troops to be mustered into the 
Federal service. Halpine contributed the following song to the <I>New 
York Herald</I> over the signature "Private Miles O'Reilly."

<h3><b>Sambo's Right to Be Kilt</b></h3>
<P>
<BR>Some tell us 'tis a burnin' shame
<BR>To make the naygers fight;
<BR>An' that the thrade of bein' kilt
<BR>Belongs but to the white:
<BR>But as for me, upon my sowl!
<BR>So liberal are we here,
<BR>I'll let Sambo be murthered instead of myself
<BR>On every day in the year.
<BR>On every day in the year, boys,
<BR>And in every hour of the day;
<BR>The right to be kilt I'll divide wid him,
<BR>An' divil a word I'll say.
<P>
<BR>In battle's wild commotion
<BR>I shouldn't at all object
<BR>If Sambo's body should stop a ball
<BR>That was comin' for me direct;
<BR>And the prod of a Southern bagnet,
<BR>So ginerous are we here,
<BR>I'll resign, and let Sambo take it
<BR>On every day in the year.
<BR>On every day in the year, boys,
<BR>And wid none o' your nasty pride,
<BR>All my right in a Southern bagnet prod
<BR>Wid Sambo I'll divide!
<P>
<BR>The men who object to Sambo
<BR>Should take his place and fight;
<BR>And it's betther to have a nayger's hue
<BR>Than a liver that's wake an' white.
<BR>Though Sambo's black as the ace of spades,
<BR>His finger a thrigger can pull,
<BR>And his eye runs sthraight on the barrel-sights
<BR>From undher its thatch of wool.
<BR>So hear me all, boys darlin',
<BR>Don't think I'm tippin' you chaff,
<BR>The right to be kilt we'll divide wid him,
<BR>And give him the largest half!
