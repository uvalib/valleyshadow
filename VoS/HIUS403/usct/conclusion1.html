Today, the United States Colored Troops (USCT) are finally receiving the 
recognition they deserve as significant members of the Union Army. 
Scholars have only recently started to define the USCT's place in 
history and the movie <i>Glory</i> even brought their story into 
popular culture. In 1997, the United States government comissioned the 
<a href=http://www.afroamcivilwarmemorial.org>African-American Civil 
War Memorial</a>. It will be unveiled in March 1998 and is the first 
"official" USCT war memorial. 
<P>
The purpose of this site is to give human faces and names to the 
saga of African-American troops in the Civil War. This site is unique in 
that it focuses on the colored troops from a single county in Pennsylvania. 
These men all came from Franklin County, yet they fought for their 
freedom across the country. While we certainly hope that you have gained a 
greater understanding of each of these men's lives, we also hope that you 
have learned a great deal about the United States Colored Troops in 
general and their important role in the Civil War.
