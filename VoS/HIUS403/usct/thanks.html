<h5><font color="#000000">A flag is the emblem of sovereignty -<br> 
         a symbol and guarantee of protection.<br> 
          Every nation and people are proud of <br>
         the flag of their country. England, for <br>
          a thousand years boasts her Red flag<br>
        and Cross of St. George; France glories<br>
        in her Tri-color and Imperial Eagle; ours<br>
         the Star-spangled Banner, far more<br>
         beautiful than they - this dear old flag! -<br>
          the sun in heaven never looked down <br>
        on so proud a banner of beauty and glory. <br>
        Men of the Black Brigade, rally around it! <br>
         Assert your manhood, be loyal to duty, <br>
          be obedient, hopeful, patient. Slavery<br>
        will soon die; the slaveholders rebellion, <br>
         accursed of God and man, will shortly <br>
        and miserably perish. There will then be,<br>
        through all the coming ages, in very truth,<br>
        a land of the free - one country, one flag, <br>
         one destiny. I charge you, Men of the <br>
        Black Brigade of Cincinnati, remember<br>
          that for you, and for me, and for your<br>
         children, and your childrens children, <br>
          there is but one Flag, as there is but <br>
       one Bible, and one God, the Father of us all.</font><br>

             Acting Camp Commandant<br>
 presenting the National flag to The Cincinnati Black Brigade<br>
