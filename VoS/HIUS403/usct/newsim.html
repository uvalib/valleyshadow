<BR>Excerpt: Since the skies of our national horizon are beginning to look 
bright, and the dark and threatening clouds of war
disappearing, the question is often asked, what shall be done with the 
freedmen? We confess the question easier asked
than answered, yet it may be never so difficult, it must be answered, and 
that too, in a way becoming a free intelligent and
christian people.

The following images deal with life after the war. The first of these 
images asks the question, "What will become of the black man after the 
war?" The second image attests to the existence of racial prejudice in 
the military more than twenty years after the Civil War, and how it 
affected the black soldier.

International Drill Competition in 1887 barred black units. This 
cartoon depicts a black soldier being refused entry by a superior. In 
response, the black soldier makes reference to the recent past, when 
black soldiers fought and died for the Union Army. The organizers of the 
drill competition rescinded the ban.
