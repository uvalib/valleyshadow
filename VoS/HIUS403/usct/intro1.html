In 1865, Garland H. White, black chaplain of the 28th U.S. Colored 
Infantry, wrote: "The historian pen cannot fail to locate us somewhere 
among the good and the great, who have fought and bled upon the alter of 
their country."  Over 100 years later, the "historian pen" has finally 
begun to examine the story and significance of the United States Colored 
Troops.

Welcome to the United States Colored Troops of Franklin County, 
Pennsylvania site.  We are students at the University of Virginia and 
created this site under the guidance of the Valley of the Shadow site. 
The purpose of the Valley of the Shadow site is to chronicle the 
experiences of two counties, one North and one South, before, during, and 
after the war.  In conjunction with this mission, this site is an effort 
to recount the stories of the men from Franklin County who served in the 
United States Colored Troops. This was a particularly challenging feat 
considering most historical accounts of black involvement in the Civil 
War focus on the role of the white officer in the United States Colored 
Troops rather than that of the black soldier. Thus, this is one of the 
first attempts to examine the United States Colored Troops not in terms 
of the men who led, but in terms of the men who fought.  
<P>
We researched over 100 Franklin men who served in the
United States Colored Troops.  Using their military records as well as other
primary sources from the era, we have placed their experience in the greater
context of the Civil War era. Because the Union did not organize the 
regiments of the United States 
Colored Troops by location, enlisted men from Franklin County served in 
over 21 regiments. Thus, the compass represents the fact that 
Frankin men experienced the Civil War all over the nation. It is also 
important to note that the men of the United States Colored Troops did 
not enlist in the army until mid-1863. We have therefore designated the 
Pre-War Years as 1859-1863, the War Years as 1863-1865, and the Post-War 
Years as 1865-1890.
