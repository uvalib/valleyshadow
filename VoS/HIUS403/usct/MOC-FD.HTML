When first the rebel cannon shattered the walls of Sumter and drove away 
its starving garrison, I predicted that the war then and there 
inaugurated would not be fought out entirely by white men. Every month's 
experience during these dreary years has confirmed that opinion. A war 
undertaken and brazenly carried on for the perpetual enslavement of 
colored men, calls logically and loudly for colored men to help suppress 
it. Only a moderate share of sagacity was needed to see that the arm of 
the slave was the best defense against the arm of the slaveholder. Hence, 
with every reverse to the national armsd, with every exulting shout of 
victory raised by the slaveholding rebels, I have implored the imperiled 
nation to unchain againt the foes her powerful black hand. Slowly and 
reluctantly that appeal is beginning to be heeded. Stop not now to 
complain that it was not heeded sooner. That it should not may or may not 
have been best. This is not the time to discuss that question. Leave it 
to the future. When the war is over, the country saved, peace established 
and the black man's rights are secured, as they will be, history with an 
impartial hand will dispose of that and sundry other questions. Action! 
action! not criticism, is the plain duty of this hour. Words are now 
useful only as they stimulate to blows. The office of speech now is only 
to point out when, where, and how to strike to the best advantage. There 
is not time to delay. The tide is at its flood that leads on to fortune. 
From East to West, from North to South, the sky is written all over. 'NOW 
OR NEVER.' Liberty won by white men would would lose half its luster. 
'Who would be free themselves must strike the blow.' 'Better even die 
free, than to live slaves.' This is the sentiment of every brave colored 
man amongst us. There are weak and cowardly men in all nations. We have 
them amongst us. They tell you this is the 'white man's war'; that you 
'will be no better off after than before the war'; that the getting of 
you into the Army is to 'sacrifice you on the first opportunity.' Believe 
them not; cowards themselves, they do not wish to have their cowardice 
shunned by your brave example. Leave them to their timidity, or to 
whatever motive may hold them back. I have not thought lightly of the 
words I am now addressing you. The counsel I give comes of close 
observation of the great struggle now in progress, and of the deep 
conviction that this is your hour and mine. In good earnest, then, and 
after the best deliberation, I now, for ythe first time during this war, 
feel at liberty to call and counsel you to arms. By every consideration 
which binds you to your enslaved fellow-countrymen and to the peace and 
welfare of your country; by every aspiration which you cherish for the 
freedom and equality of yourselves and your children; by all the ties of 
blood and identity which make us one with the brave black men fighting 
our battles in Louisiana and in South Carolina, I urge you to fly to 
arms, and smith with death the power that would bury the Government and 
your liberty in the same hopeless grave. I wish I could tell you that the 
State of New York calls you to this high honor. For the moment her 
constituted authorities are silent on the subject. They will speak by and 
by, and doubtless on the right side; but we are not compelled to wait for 
her. We can get at the throat of treason and slavery through the State of 
Massachusetts. She was first in the War of Independence; first to break 
the chains of her slaves; first to make the black man equal before the 
law; first to admit colored children to her common schools, and she was 
first to answer with her blood the alarm-cry of the nation, when its 
capital was menaced by rebels. You know her patriotic governor, and you 
k.now Charles Sumner. I need not add more. 
<P>
Massachusetts now welcomes you to arms as soldiers. She has but a small 
colored population from which to recruit. She has full leave of the 
general government to send one regiment to the war, and she has 
undertaken to do it. Go quickly and help fill up the first colored 
regiment from the North. I am authorized to assure you that you will 
receive the same wages, the same rations, the same equipments, the same 
protection, the same treatment, and the same bounty, secured to white 
soldiers. You will be led by able and skillful officers, men who will 
take especial pride in your efficiency and success. They will be quick to 
accord to you all the honor you shall merit by your valor, and to see 
that your rights and feelings are respected by other soldiers. I have 
assured myself on these points, and can speak with authority. More than 
twenty years of unswerving devotion to our common cause may give me some 
humble claim to be trusted at this momentous crisis. I will not argue. To 
do so implies hesitation and doubt, and you do not hesitate. You do not 
doubt. The day dawns; the morning star is bright upon the horizon! The 
iron gate of our prison stands half open. One gallant rush from the North 
will fling it wide open, while four millions of our brothers and sisters 
shall march out into liberty. The chance is now given you to end in a day 
the bondage of centuries, and to rise in one bound from social 
degradation to the place of common equality with all other varieties of 
men. Remember Denmark Vesey [sic] of Charleston; remember Nathaniel 
Turner of South Hampton; remember Shields Green and Copeland, who 
followed noble John Brown, and fell as glorious martyrs for the cause of 
the slave. Remember that in a contest with oppression, the Almighty has 
no attribute which can take sides with oppressors. The case is before 
you. This is our golden opportunity. Let us accept it, and forever wipe 
out the dark reproaches unsparingly hurled against us by our enemies. Let 
us win for ourselves the gratitude of our country, and the best blessings 
of our posterity through all time. The nucleus of this first sentiment is 
now at Readville, a short distance from Boston. I will undertake to 
forward to Boston all persons adjudged fit to be mustered into the 
regiment, who shall apply to me at any time within the next two weeks.
