<P>
After the war, most men returned to their homes in Franklin County, 
where they resumed their lives as farmers and laborers. Although during 
the war they'd been forced to change their lives significantly, their 
post-war lives closely resemble their pre-war lives.
<P>
To find out more about these men's post-war lives, search the 1890 Franklin 
County Special Veterans Census. This census provides information about 
the men's military experience as well as general information about their 
lives in 1890. It is important to note that this census is not as 
reliable as the 1860 Franklin County Population Census. This census 
includes information about black and white soldiers from Franklin County, 
however this information was never established as fact. For 
example, in the 1890 Franklin County Special Veterans Census, Washington 
McAlver is listed as being in the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry. 
However, we found no compiled service record for McAlver at the National 
Archives. Thus, there is a strong possibility that McAlver did not serve 
in the USCT.
