<h3><b>The Negro Soldier Bill</b></h3>

<P>	In the National House of Representatives on Friday a week, the 
negro soldier bill, introduced by Mr. Stevens, was under discussion. We 
select from the debate as follows:
<P>	The House resumed the consideration of the negro soldier bill.
<P>	Mr. Wadsworth (Ky.) protested against its passage. It was a 
confession to the world of our desperate condition, and that our efforts 
to suppress the rebellion have failed. Unsuccessful in saving the 
Constitution and hope of liberty on this Continent, it was now proposed 
to acknowledge that the negro was now our only hope of salvation. This 
he would not admit. He still thought that there was wisdom, valor and 
strength enough in the people to preserve all we held dear, and 
that Almighty God will turn aside the troubles which now embarrass us.
<P>	The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) had explained the 
reason for the passage of this bill, which was drawn up by the Secretary 
of War himself. It was to put the negro soldier on an equality with the 
white as to military protection in the event of being taken prisoners; 
but this was not the true reason.--Its purpose was to organize in 
military array the negro, proclaimed free by the President's 
proclamation, to entrench them on the soil of the cotton States, and 
maintain them there, to exterminate or drive off the whites of that 
section. Of what use would be the proclamation of emancipation unless 
followed up by the arming the negroes as now proposed. The President 
having now taken the step there was no retreat from it. He had yielded 
to the clamors of his ultra friends. While opposing the bill generally, 
he contended it is not our policy to call negroes into the war as 
soldiers when we can obtain a far better class of defenders.
<P>	Mr. Wright (Penna.) said this government and the Union were the 
result of compromise. In concession and compromise it had its birth; the 
very day the Declaration went forth to the Colonies from Independence 
Hall, there was compromise and concession. From that period to 1850 such 
a policy has prevailed. The Union was then saved by the compromise of 
the great and ruling spirits of the land, Clay, Webster, Calhoun and 
others, meeting together for that purpose.  Were gentlemen here less wise 
than those men? If ever there was a time in the history of the country 
when concession and compromise should be exhibited it was now.
<P>	The enactment of a measure repulsive to the sentiment of a large 
mass of people might produce such a state of affairs that we some morning 
might awake to find we have no government in existence. [A voice--"Yes 
we will."]
<P>	Mr. Wright was willing to make any honorable sacrifice, now that 
the other side of the chamber show a corresponding disposition. If 
gentlemen here would all agree upon a base of compromise as to the 
conduct of this war, it would not last three months. He opposed the bill 
because, among other reasons, it would produce demoralization, and the 
soldiers of the army had said to him that if black men were sent to them, 
they will regard it as a condemnation of their conduct, and leave the 
service if they can. How far this feeling extends, he was not able to say.
<P>	He said the white Anglo-Saxon race was capable of taking care of 
itself; but if we have not power to maintain our position, negroes cannot 
help us out of the difficulty. They were not reliable in the military 
service.
<P>	He believed that by a reconstruction of the Cabinet, and the 
restoration of General McClellan to the army, the country could be 
saved. [At this point applause broke forth in heavy volumes from the 
galleries, accompanied by stamping of feet and clapping of hands.]
<P>	The Speaker said if such disorders were repeated, he would order 
the galleries to be cleared.
<P>	Mr. Wright said that McClellan was not a favorite of his. He had 
never advocated him here, but he believed that no other general in the 
army embodies the feelings and sentiments of his troops.
<P>	If you want to carry victory on your arms you must have a 
commander in whom the army have confidence. It was idle to talk about 
victory with a demoralized army. McClellan, he repeated, was the head of 
the American Army, and should be placed in command. [The galleries again 
broke forth in applause, but somewhat suppressed in consequence of the 
Speaker's admonition, which was now repeated.]
<P>	Mr. Wright, resuming, said, let the President make a new and 
mixed Cabinet, representing the two great parties of the country, restore 
General McClellan to command, and call for two hundred thousand men, who 
would rush to his standard in an instant.
<P>	Addressing the Republicans, he said: You must abandon your ultra 
notions, or we are gone.  We have got to compromise. Abandon the 
proposition to bring negroes into the army, or we are lost.
<P>	Mr. Diven (N.Y.) did not think that this bill was of such 
paramount importance as to justify the excitement it has produced in this 
hall. He thought the President already possessed the power to employ 
negro soldiers.--Provision was already made for their employment in all 
conditions to which their services can be made efficient, but he 
preferred his own proposal, offered in June last, making provision for 
their emigration, and, in addition to their employment, making provision 
for themselves and families; their operations to be confined to rebel 
localities, and not to operate on the border States loyal to the Union.
<P>	Mr. Cox, while opposing the bill, remarked that its object was to 
produce a dissolution of the Union; for gentlemen from border States have 
said that it would be impossible to restore the Union if negroes are 
brought into the field, like fiends of hell in accordance with the policy 
which began in hate and is followed up by a spirit of vengeance. A large 
portion of our army is made up of Celtic blood, and he would tell 
gentlemen that they would not fight beside negroes. The prejudice cannot 
be eradicated.
<P>	As Mr. Lovejoy had made some allusion to his diminutive size, he 
was reminded of an epitaph, which he lately saw in a newspaper about the 
gentlemen from Illinois, as follows:
<P>	
Beneath this stone good Owen Lovejoy lies, 
<BR>
Little in everything except his size;
<BR>
What though his burly body fills this hold;
<BR>
Yet through Hell's key-hole crept his little soul.
	
<P>	[Great laughter.]  But he did not believe this of the gentlemen 
from Illinois.
