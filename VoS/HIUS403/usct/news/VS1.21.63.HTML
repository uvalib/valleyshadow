<P>
There is a marked difference between the black and 
white man. The immortal Thomas Jefferson made seventeen points of 
difference. "They differ in color, in their hair, and in the shape of 
their bodies. The black man has more beard than the white man. He 
prespires more profusely--a striking proof that his condition is best 
adapted to a warm climate. There is a slight difference in the 
arrangement of the lungs, by which the black has more exhaling than the 
white. The black requires less sleep--this will account for their 
midnight revels to the music of the banjos, fiddle, bones, triangle, &c. His love is more ardent, but less imaginative than that of the white 
man. His grief is more transient.  He reflects less--hence their 
constant whistling, humming and singing negro melodies. His reasoning 
powers are decidedly inferior--which experience has demonstrated in 
numberless instances. The black has less originality--a truth doubted by 
none. He has no turn for the arts of painting and sculpture. He has as 
good an ear for music as the white man, but no skill in composing. And 
lastly, the black has no poetical tendencies.
