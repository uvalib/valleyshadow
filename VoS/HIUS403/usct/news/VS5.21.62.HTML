<h3><b>Emancipation and its Consequences</b></h3>
<P>
	Underlying the slavery question is the still more important negro 
question.--Some persons seem to imagine that slavery is the source from 
which springs all our national troubles, and that if we can only get rid 
of slavery our difficulties must all speedily terminate.  Never was there 
a greater delusion.  All the trouble we have about slavery is 
self-created and self-imposed.  It springs entirely from a disregard of 
the Constitution.  That instrument guarantees to each State the exclusive 
right to determine and regulate its own domestic affairs, and also 
providess for the rendition of fugitive slaves.  Had the North faithfully 
adhered to these provisions it would not now be troubled and agitated by 
either the slavery or the negro questions.  Because it did not execute 
the fugitive slave law in all its rigor, and because the Abolitionists 
are now clamorous for emancipation in the States, are we now threatened 
with an inundation of freed negroes.
<P>	Supposing emancipation to be an accomplished fact, supposing the 
Constitution to be violated and the four millions of slaves in the 
Southern States declared forever free, and this decree executed by the 
military power, how much better off are we than with slavery as an 
existing institution in the Southern States?  We put this question to 
practical men as a practical one.  Theories vanish in the presence of an 
every-day question of this magnitude.  We do not propose to examine the 
consequences of such a palpable violation of the Constitution--abrogation 
would be a better word--involved in the consumation of the Abolition 
programme; but let us for the present confine ourselves to the practical 
question, what would we do with four millions of liberated negroes?  This 
is the negro question separated from the question of slavery.
<P>	In the first place we take it for granted that few Northern men, 
even among the most radical of the negro worshippers, would be so bold as 
to propose the absorption of this inferior and servile race into Northern 
society--making them the equals of the white men--investing them with 
citizenship--rendering them eligible to office--mingling with them upon a 
perfect social and political equality.  The very idea is abhorrent to the 
instincts of every white man.  It would degrade the whites without 
elevating the blacks.  The barrier separating the two races is 
impassable--They must live together as superior and inferior, as masters 
and servants or not at all.  In the Southern States the relation between 
the races is that of master and slave.  At the North, where perpetual 
slavery is not tolerated, it is that of master and servant; and the gulf 
separating the whites from the blacks, the dominant from the servile 
race, is just as wide at the North, where slavery is prohibited by law, 
as at the South; where it is protected by law.  The separation between 
the races is in accordance with an immutable edict of nature, and is not 
produced by statutes or local regulations.
<P>	We take it, then, as settled beyond contingency that free white 
citizens and negroes can never live togehter upon terms of social and 
political equality.  We also assume as a fact that an increase of the 
free negro population of the North is not desirable; and furthermore, 
that in the event of emancipation of the four millions of Southern 
slaves; the great mass of them will flock to the North for the reason 
that they could not remain at the South without without relapsing into 
slavery.  The question then appeals directly to us, what shall we do with 
these liberated negroes?
<P>	"Colonize them," answers one, without reflecting upon the 
enormous cost to the Government, and without considering that the 
Abolitionists, as a class, are opposed to colonization.  If they have the 
power to force emancipation they will also have the power to prevent 
colonization.  Their vision does not extend beyond negro freedom.  This 
accomplished and they will take no pains to relieve the country of the 
enormous burden put upon it through their instrumentality.  Beside, the 
cost of colonizing four millions of negroes would be more than the 
country could bear in addition to the expenses of the war, which latter, of 
itself, must prove a crushing weight for generations.  And, supposing 
colonization to be practicable, it would necessarily be slow work, and 
the North would have this immense surplus free negro population upon its 
hands for years to feed and clothe.
<P>	Let any man reflect seriously upon this negro question, and he 
will discover how interminable are the difficulties surrounding it.  And 
when we consider how easily the difficulty may be avoided by simply 
obeying the Constitution and the laws, and permitting each State of the 
Union to manage and control its own domestice affairs, it is surprising 
that men should be so reckless of consequences, so utterly insensible to 
the evil progeny they are begetting; as to insist upon the emancipation 
of four millions of negroes to overrun and devastate the Northern 
States.--Patriot and Union.
