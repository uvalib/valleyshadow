<P>
Mr. William D. Kelley is indignant. He does not care much whether the 
Federal taxes are so imposed that Massachusetts gets off nearly scot free 
whilst Pennsylvania pays twice as much as she ought; but when it becomes 
a question of who "drew the first blood," a negro or a Yankee, all his 
passions are aroused. He really cannot permit his favorite to be deprived 
of this great honor. When the future historian inquires of his muse who 
was the protomartyr in "the crusade for liberty," Kelley insists that she 
shall answer that he was black. He is proud of his State, and this is the 
way he defends her.
<P>
Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, wished it to be understood that the 18th 
came before the 19th of April, and it was the blood of a <i>colored</i> 
man from Pennsylvania that was first shed in this war.
<P>
He is determined that all the glory shall not be monopolized by 
Massachusetts, and this is the share he demands for Pennsylvania. No 
matter that her soil has been invaded, her farms wasted, her granaries 
robbed, whilst Massachusetts laughed at a safe distance; no matter that 
hundreds of children have been disgraced, deposed, dishonored, or refused 
opportunity for distinguishment; no matter that McClellan is maligned 
Fitz John Porter degraded, Franklin placed in a subordinate command, 
Patterson vituperated, Negley and Andrew Porter dropped; no matter that a 
Governor has been snubbed and a Commonwealth derided; her's is the great, 
everlasting glory of producing a negro who was killed on a day preceeding 
the 19th of April. Surely this ought to suffice any Pennsylvanian, 
however greedy of distinction for his State he may be.
