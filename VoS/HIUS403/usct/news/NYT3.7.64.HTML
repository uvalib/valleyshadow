<h3><b>The Ovation to the Black Regiment</b></h3>
<P>
There has been no more striking manifestation of the marvelous times that 
are upon us than the scene in our streets at the departure of the first 
of our colored regiments. Had any man predicted it last year he would 
have been thought a fool, 
even by the wisest and most discerning. History 
abounds with strange contrasts. It always has been an ever-shifting 
melo-drama. But never, in this land at least, has it presented a 
transition so extreme and yet so speedy as what our eyes have just beheld.
<P>
Eight months ago the African race in this City were literally hunted down 
like wild beasts. They fled for their lives. When caught, they were shot 
down in cold blood, or stoned to death, or hung to the trees or the 
lamp-posts. Their houses were pillaged; the asylum which Christian 
charity had provided for their orphaned children was burned; and there 
was no limit to the persecution but in the physical impossibility of 
finding further material on which the mob could wreak its ruthless hate. 
Nor was it solely the raging horde in the streets that visited upon the 
black man the nefarious wrong. Thousands and tens of thousands of men of 
higher social grade, of better education, cherished precisely the same 
spirit. It found expression in contumelious speech rather than in the 
violent act, but it was persecution none the less for that. In fact the 
mob would never have entered upon that career of outrage but for the fact 
that it was fired and maddened by the prejudice which had been generated 
by the ruling influences, civil and social, here in New York, till it had 
enveloped the City like some infernal atmosphere. The physical outrages 
which were inflicted on the black race in those terrible days were but 
the outburst of malignant agencies which had been transfusing the whole 
community from top to bottom, year after year.
<P>
How astonishingly has all this been changed! The same men who could not 
have shown themselves in the most obscure street in the City without 
peril of instant death, even though in the most suppliant attitude, now 
march in solid platoons, with shouldered muskets, slung knapsacks, and 
buckled cartridge-boxes down through our gayest avenues and our busiest 
thoroughfares to the pealing strains of martial music, and are everywhere 
saluted with waving handkerchiefs, with descending flowers, and with the 
acclamations and plaudits of countless beholders. They are halted at our 
most beautiful square, and, amid an admiring crowd, in the presence of 
many of our most prominent citizens, are addressed in an eloquent and 
most complmentary speech by the President of our chief literary 
institution, and are presented with a gorgeous stand of colors in the 
name of a large number of the first ladies of the City, who attest on 
parchment, signed by their own fair hands, that they "will anxiously 
watch your career, glorying in your heroism, ministering to you when 
wounded and ill, and honoring your martyrdom with benedictions and with 
tears."
<P>
It is only by such occasions that we can at all realize the prodigious 
revolution which the public mind everywhere is experiencing. Such 
developments are infallible tokens of new epoch.
