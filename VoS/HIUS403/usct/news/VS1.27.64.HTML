<h3><b>The Negro and the War</b></h3>

<P>	Although Mr. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation has been 
powerless for good within the rebel lines--as idle as "the Pope's bull 
against the comet"--failing in its weakness to strike the shackles from 
the limbs of a single slave that could aid the rebellion; yet as our 
lines have advanced, it has nominally liberated thousands, and as the 
armies of the Union march on, "conquering and to conquer," it may liberate 
thousands more. The effect of this proclamation has simply been to free 
the slaves from their masters, and while it provides no remedy for the evils 
of slavery, leaves them in filthy camps to die of starvation and 
disease. Deadened as the sensibilities of the whole nation have become 
to scenes of suffering and distress, the tales of horror which come up to 
us from the camps of freed negroes along the Mississippi cannot fail to 
enlist our sympathies. The poor blacks, left to the tender mercies of 
their pretended friends, are dying daily by fifties and hundreds: and 
unless something be done to better their condition, the whole race must 
soon be blotted out, and this war, which has been perverted from its 
original purpose to aid in their enfranchisement, may result in their 
total extinction. A recent report made by Mr. Yeatman, president of the 
Western Sanitary Commission, portrays the horrors of the contraband camps 
along the Mississippi in such fitting terms that we will transfer a few 
paragraphs to our columns. He says:
	
<P>	"At Young's Point, D.L. Jones, of the 9th Louisiana Regiment, 
African descent, is in charge of the camp. There are now some 2,100 in this 
camp, in miserable huts, tents and hovels.  There appears to be more 
squalid misery and destitution here than in any place I have visited. 
The sickness and death were most frightful. During the summer, from 
thirty to fifty died in a day, and some days as many as seventy-five 
during the latter part of June, July and August.
<P>	"At De Soto, immediately opposite Vicksburg, there are about 275 
old men, women and children, to whom the Government furnishes rations, 
but from some cause or other none had been received for more than two weeks 
preceding my visit, and great destitution and dissatisfaction existed. 
<P>	"At Natchez is a camp of 2,100 freedmen, all in cabins, which are 
without proper light and ventilation, overcrowded, and most prolific 
sources of disease. Seventy-five had died in one day. I was informed 
that some had returned to their masters on account of suffering. 
Physicians are greatly needed.
<P>	"This camp had numbered four thousand at one time, not it reduced 
to 2,100--a sad tale to tell, but nevertheless true. The same I doubt 
not can be said of other camps. Who ever will ride along the levee from 
Milliken's Bend to De Soto, as I did, and see the numerous graves along 
the way, for the distance of twenty-five miles, cannot doubt it."
	
<P>	This is the glorious jubilee of freedom to which Mr. Lincoln 
invites the slaves of the South. It is for such liberty as this he asks 
them to leave their master's plantations, where they were comfortably 
housed, clothed and fed; where they were tenderly cared for in helpless 
youth and feeble old age; where in sickness they received their medicines 
from the master's store, and gentle nursing from the members of his 
household. Aye, let our canting philanthropists talk to them of the 
blessings of liberty--let them go and tell these starving contrabands 
what an inestimable privilege it is to be a free man--and they will reply 
"Give us bread for ourselves and our hungry wives and little ones; give 
us houses to shelter our shivering limbs from the rains and snows of 
winter; give us medicine that we may not die like dumb cattle, and you 
may take back your boasted liberty!" What are the blessings of liberty, 
which we hear so much about, to suffering, starving, dying men? What 
does it profit to tell a man he is free, and deprive him of his bread?
<P>	This pretended philanthropy is as insincere as it is ruinous. The 
very men who have advised and sanctioned this emancipation 
proclamation, who have cried out the loudest against the poor 
compensation given to slave labor and the evil treatment of slaves by 
their masters, are the ones who are to-day profiting by the labor of the 
liberated slaves, who defraud them out of their earnings, who subject 
them to a sorer bondage than they have ever before experienced. In 
confirmation of this statement we again refer to the report of Mr. Yeatman:
	
<P>	"The firemen on the steamboat on which I was a passenger from St. 
Louis to Memphis were all colored, and were receiving forty-five dollars 
per month. These men were afraid to go ashore at Memphis, for fear of 
being picked up and forced into Government employment at less than one 
fourth their existing wages. Beside the fact that men are thus pressed 
into service, thousands have been employed for weeks and months, who 
never received anything but promises to pay.
<P>	"This negligence and failure to comply with obligations have 
greatly disheartened the poor slave, who comes forth at the call of the 
President, and supposes himself a free man, and that by leaving his rebel 
master he is inflicting a blow on the enemy, ceasing to labor and to 
provide food for him and for the armies of the Rebellion. Thus he was 
promised freedom, but how is it with him?  He is seized in the street, 
and ordered to go and help unload a steamboat for which he will be paid, 
or sent to work in the trenches, or to labor for some Quartermaster, or 
to chop wood for the Government. He labors for months, and at last is 
only paid with promises, unless perchance it may be with kicks, cuffs and 
curses. Under such treatment he feels that he has exchanged one master 
for many masters: these continued abuses sadden and depress him, and he 
sighs to return to his former home and master. He, at least, fed, 
clothed and sheltered him.
<P>	"One of the freedmen, Henson Jackson, working at Wilton's 
plantation, said that they get corn wherever they can find it on 
abandoned plantations: that they frequently have to go as far as Tensas 
Bayou, that he has been without bread for days, that four pounds of meat 
per week are all that is allowed him, that he pays for his flour, and has 
worked since April without receiving any pay or clothing whatever, that 
he only receives tickets for actual days work, to be paid when the crop 
is sold. Others from the same farm testified to the same thing and 
laborers from other plantations give similar testimony. None received 
molasses, rice, or beans, and hominy only when they choose to make it 
themselves.
<P>	"The poor negroes are everywhere greatly depressed at their 
condition. They all testify that if they were only paid their little 
wages as they earn them, so that they could purchase clothing, and were 
furnished with the provisions promised, they could stand it: but to work 
and get poorly paid, poorly fed, and not doctored when sick, is more than 
they can endure. They do not realize that they are free men. They say 
they are told they are, but then they are taken and hired out to men who 
treat them, so far as providing for them is concerned, far worse than 
their "secesh" masters did. Besides this they feel that their pay or 
hire is lower now than it was when "the secesh" used to hire them. This 
is true."
	
<PL>	This accounts for the canting hypocrisy of these abolition 
fanatics. They wanted to reap some benefit from the labor of the negroes 
of the South, and hence their pretended friendship. Their grasping 
cupidity denies to the slave even the wages his old master gave him. 
True is it that he has but exchanged one master for many masters; and no 
wonder is it, that he sighs for his former home and master, who at least, 
fed, clothed and sheltered him. Says Mr. Yeatman, "They do not realize 
that they are free men. They say <i>they are told they are</i>, but then 
they 
are taken and hired out to men who <i>treat them worse than their "secesh" 
masters did!</i>" This is "the great moral idea" which we are told is being 
worked out under the Providence of a God of Justice! This is the spirit 
of freedom and equality which breathes through our institutions, and 
animates the charter of our liberties, and finds its warrant in the 
Gospel! Isn't the idea a grand and ennobling one?
<P>	There is another feature of this negro question which is every 
day becoming of vaster importance. We are placing arms in the hands of 
hundreds of thousands of fierce and untutored slaves. Is it expected 
that when the war is over they will quietly lay down those arms? They 
will be acquainted with army drill and tactics, they will have learned 
the modes of organizing armies and conducting campaigns. Will they not 
strike a blow for this "liberty and equality," of which they have heard 
so much, but which they have never realized? After England had armed the 
Sepoys of India, they rose against the dominant race and deluged the land 
in blood. How was it when the subject race in St. Domingo had arms in 
their hands? May we not have similar scenes enacted within the United 
States? Let every man put the case to his own heart, and suppose that he 
belonged to this negro army of three hundred thousand. Would he be 
content to lay down his arms until negro equality was acknowledged in its 
fullest and freest terms? Would he not contend that he had been wronged 
by the very men who profssed to be his friends, and would he not strike 
to avenge that wrong? When we look at this question, we cannot resist 
the thought that the darkest and bloodiest chapter in the history of 
America is yet to be written.
<P>	But we are told the negroes are to be colonized. We must 
remember, however, that the consent of the negro himself must be obtained 
to this scheme, and probably he will prefer to live in the United 
States. He will have the power, backed by an army of three hundred 
thousand of his own race, and he will use it. After this war is over, 
the negro will live just where he pleases. But suppose this should not 
be the case, colonization has proved a miserable failure. The President 
and the Secretary of State tried the experiment, during the last year. A 
colony was sent to the Isle De Vache, we believe one of the West Indies, 
and news has already been brought back that it is on the verge of ruin. 
An agent of the government has returned and reports the colonists well 
nigh starved to death, and unless the government sends a steamer to 
return them to the United States very soon, not one of them will be left 
alive. The island is fertile, the climate genial, the colonists were 
well equipped with all the necessaries of life and labor; but ignorant, 
thriftless and improvident, they have sunk beneath the weight of their 
own independence. Thus ends the first experiment of establishing a grand 
African Utopia. Truly may we say, in view of those facts, that the 
Abolitionists have wrought out for the negro nothing but evil and that 
continually.
