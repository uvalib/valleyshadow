<h3><b>Colored Substitutes</b></h3>
<P>
It is said that Provost Marshal General Fry has issued instructions to 
the various Provost Marshals that, under existing laws, they can receive 
or accept colored substitutes for white persons. The decision will 
naturally cause a great reduction of the rates demanded for white 
substitutes.
