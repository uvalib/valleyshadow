<H3><B>Our Negro Troops</B></H3>

<P>	The Richmond <I>Enquirer</I> of the 17th inst. solves the problem of 
negro prisoners by 
frankly admitting that they have been murdered. Speaking of the 
government sending 
negro troops to the field it says: "Should they be sent to the field, and 
be put in battle, <I>none 
will be taken prisoners--our troops understand what to do in such cases</I>. 
If any negroes 
have been captured during the war we have not heard of them." Thus is 
answered the 
repeated inquiries of the North as to the fate of our negro soldiers who 
fell into rebel hands 
at Milliken's Bend; at Port Hudson; at Morris Island, and other places. 
<I>They have all been 
brutally murdered</I>. None have been captured--"none will be taken 
prisoners," says the 
<I>Enquirer</I>, and it boasts that rebel troops have been thoroughly 
indoctrinated with the 
fiedish ferocity of the rebel leaders, for the same paper adds--"our 
troops understand 
what to do in such cases."
<P>	Hitherto the government has been unable to get any official 
information from the 
rebels as to the fate of our negro prisoners; but the truth cannot now be 
long suppressed 
even in official circles. What course the authorities will take we can't 
pretend to indicate; 
but they will doubtless vindicate the rights and avenge the wrongs of our 
negro troops to 
the uttermost. To this the government stands pledged not only by its 
acceptance of such 
troops, but by its formally plighted faith; and it would not recede from 
it if it could; it 
certainly could not if it would. Every negro soldier, regularly mustered 
into the services of 
the United States, who has been captured under the National Flag, must be 
accounted for 
by the rebel authorities, and wherein the common dictates of humanity 
have failed to insure 
justice to prisoners the terrible <i>lex talionis</i> must do its work.
<P>	The suicidal madness of the rebel leaders seems to be without 
measure. We now 
hold more than one-half their originally claimed territory, with its 
property and population. Fully 50,000 negro troops are now regularly in service, most of them 
holding military 
possession of the lands whereon they once were slaves; and should success 
crown the 
efforts of Gens. Grant and Banks, not less than 100,000 more negro 
soldiers will be added 
to the army during the next four or six months. These troops will be the 
military power of 
the government in the Southern States, where they are acclimated, and 
will they be 
strangers to the dictates of vengeance when they find that they are to be 
murdered 
remorselessly, if captured, as their comrades have been?  This question 
is one for the 
relentless friends of treason to answer. The negro will make all things 
even in time, and if 
he must teach humanity to his arrogant foe by fearful vengeance, the 
crimsoned chapter will 
be the work of the once master—not of the once slave.
