<h3><b>A Good Idea</b></H3>

<P>
It is the intention, we understand, in future, to devote our entire term 
of Court for the special purpose of trying the filthy cases among the 
colored population of our country. This will afford them time to gather 
together as many cases as will occupy the Court and time, and also to 
crowd our pretty Court House with a crowd of drunken, worthless darkies, 
who can ornament the building by poking their heads out of the windows, 
standing around in every hole and corner, and squirting toacco juice on 
the passers by. While this arrangement is being made it is also intended 
to give notice to the public that J.L. Dechert has the best, cheapest and 
prettiest stock of Hats, Caps, &c, this side of Philadelphia. Just give 
him a call and see.
