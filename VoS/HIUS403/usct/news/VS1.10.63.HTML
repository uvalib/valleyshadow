<P>	We want those men who rail at slavery to show us something better 
for the white and black: to give us some general system; for the white 
man and the negro can't stand on the same level. Laws can't make them do so; 
and in a system involving so much of human interest, so much of happiness 
and misery, we deem it wild, extravagant and reckless to pull down before we 
know how to build up. The system of slavery has grown up out of the 
necessities of the two races in contact, and what hath been the growth of 
ages can't be changed by revolution; it requires ages to change, and the 
change must come out of the same necessities acting on the parties concerned.	
<P>	We don't think it incumbent on us to go into any defense of 
slavery in the abstract. A great deal of nonsense has been written on 
this subject. We grant that if the negro can do better for himself and 
his posterity in any other condition, without more injury to the white 
man, it is the duty of the latter to give him a chance. Our opinion is, 
he can do no better, nor as well as he has been doing. To set the negro 
free and in competition with the white man would be cruel. We had as 
soon think of setting all the boys of twelve free, and all the girls of 
ten, under the idea of universal freedom. They would be about as 
competent as this negro race now.
