<h3><B>Capture of Fort Pillow by the Rebels: Horrible Butchery of Our Troops</B></H3>

<P>Cairo, Ill., April 14.--On Tuesday morning Forrest, with some 6,000 men, 
attacked Fort 
Pillow. Soon after the attack Forrest sent a flag of truce demanding the 
surrender of the 
fort and garrison, in the meanwhile disposing his force so as to gain an 
advantage.
<P>	Maj. Booth, of the 3d Tennessee United States Heavy Artillery, 
formerly the 1st 
Alabama Cavalry (colored), refused to receive the flag of truce and 
fighting was resumed.
<P>	Afterwards a second flag came in, which was also refused.  Both 
flags gave the 
rebels the advantage of gaining new positions.
<P>	The battle was kept up till 3 o'clock P.M., when Maj. Booth was 
killed and Maj. Bradford took command. The rebels had come in swarms over 
our troops, 
compelling them to surrender.
<P>	Immediately upon the surrender, there ensued a scene which 
utterly baffles 
description. Up to that time comparatively few of our men were killed, 
but, insatiate as 
fiends and bloodthirsty as devils incarnate, the Confederates commenced 
an indiscriminate 
butchery of the whites and blacks including those of both colors who had 
been previously 
wounded.
<P>	The dead and wounded negroes were piled in heaps and burned, and 
severl citizens who joined our forces for protection, were killed or 
wounded.
<P> The black soldiers, becoming demoralized, rushed to the rear, their 
white officers 
having thrown down their arms. Both white and black were bayonetted, 
shot or sabred, 
and even dead bodies were horribly mutilated. Children of seven or eight 
years of age, and 
several negro women were killed in cold blood. Soldiers unable to speak, 
from their 
wounds, were shot dead and their bodies rolled down the banks into the river.
<P>	Out of a garrison of 600 men only 200 remained alive.
<P>	Among our dead officers are Capt. Bradford, Lieuts. Barr, 
Ackerstrom, Wilson, Revel and Maj. Booth, all of the 13th Tennessee Cavalry; 
Capt. Posten, 
Lieut. Lyon, of the 
13th Tennessee, and Capt. Young, of the 24th Missouri, Acting Provost 
Marshal, were 
taken prisoners. Maj. Bradford was also taken, but is said to have 
escaped. It is feared, however, that he has been killed.
<P>	The steamer Platte Valley came up about 3 1/2 o'clock. She was 
hailed by the 
rebels under a flag of truce and her men sent ashore to bury the dead and 
take aboard such 
of the wounded as the rebels had allowed to live. Fifty-seven were taken 
aboard, including 
seven or eight colored men. Eight of them died on the way up. The 
steamer arrived here 
this evening and was immediately sent to the Mound City hospital to 
discharge her 
suffering passengers.--Among the wounded of the colored troops are Capt. 
Porter, Lieut. 
Libberts and Adjutant Lemming.
<P>	Six guns were captured by the rebels and carried off, including 
two 10-pound 
parrotts and two 12-pound howitzers. A large amount of stores were 
destroyed and carried 
away. The intention of the rebels seemed to be to evacuate the place and 
move on towards 
Memphis.
