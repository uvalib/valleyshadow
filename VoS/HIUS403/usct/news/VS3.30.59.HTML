<h3><b>How Our Negroes Live</h3></b>

<P>
Some twelve years ago we indited the following description of how our 
negroes then lived. It would appear by the columns of one of our local 
contemporaries that their morals and their manners of living have not 
much improved since that day. So long as miserable huts, of the character 
we have described are erected, "filty, thieving, whisky drinking negroes" 
will seek our community to inhabit them. If there were no such "local 
habitations" provided for them they would take up their abode in other 
quarters and this neighborhood would get rid of their troublesome 
presence. Strike at the root of the crib!--
<P>
UGLOW'S ARCADE.--In one of the black streets of our town there may be 
seen a long low range of buildings, of a <i>sui generis</i> style of 
architecture--baffling description in itself, and without a parallel for 
comparison. Come, reader, let me take you by the collar and drag you into 
this abode of crime and wretchedness of destitute and degraded humanity. 
We know you will not come willingly, so come <i>nolens volens</i> Now, 
take your stand in this corner and observe the "sights to be seen." Here, 
in this wretched apartment, eight by ten feet square, you may see by the 
light of that dim lamp, twenty human beings--fourteen women and six 
children--from a babe a week old to the urchin just entering her teens. 
Observe their actions and listen to their conversation. What disgusting 
obscenity! what horrid implications! Their licentious and blasphemous 
orgies would put to the blush the imps of pandemonium. Drinking whisky 
and inhaling tobacco smoke you would hardly suppose would keep soul and 
body to gether; yet you perceive no indications here that would lead you 
to suppose they subsist on anything else. You seem impatient to get out 
of the atmosphere of this room; mount that ladder and take a look in the 
room above. One look will be sufficient. Here huddled promiscuously 
together, on beds--no, not on beds; there is an idea of ease and comfort 
attached to a bed, that would never enter your mind on looking at these 
heaps of filthy rags--are men, women and children; arms, heads and legs, 
in a state of nudity, protrude through the tattered covering in a wild 
confusion. Poverty, drunkenness, sickness and crime, are here in all 
their most miserable and appalling aspects. But, come, we have twenty 
rooms of this description to visit in this building, and we cannot devote 
any more time to this set. What! twenty rooms filled with beings of this 
kind? Do not let it startle you in the least, my friend, or disturb the 
serenity of your christian equanimity. <I>They do not know they are 
accountable beings</I>, and a society has been formed in this place to 
keep them in "blissful ignorance." Its satellites are very active in the 
good work, and we will one day furnish you with a copy of the report of 
their proceedings. As the exhibition you have just witnessed has no doubt 
prompted you to do something to meliorate the condition of this benighted 
portion of your race, we would advise you to go home, while in the mood, 
and make a generous donation to the <I>Foreign</I> Missionary Society, 
which will be gladly received and appropriately expended in a string of 
heads for the Heathen!
