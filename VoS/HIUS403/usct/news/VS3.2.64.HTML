<h3><b>Cool Rascality</b></h3>
<P>
On Thursday, whilst the freight train stopped at the Depot, some soldiers 
who were on the train bound for Chambersburg got off and thrusting their 
hands into the pockets of a colored boy in the employ of Mr. Eskins at 
the Hotel, took his purse containing all the money he had. We are sorry 
that such mean, pitiful villains should disgrace the United States 
uniform, and we trust that for the credit of the service, if not for the 
sake of common justice, that the perpetrator of this shameful robbery may 
be sought out and punished.
