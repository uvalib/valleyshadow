<H2><B>Hon. Joseph Holt on Employing Slaves as Soldiers</B></H2>

<P>
	The following is the chief part of a letter addressed to 
Secretary Stanton by Mr. Holt:
<P>	The right of the Government to employ for the suppression of the 
rebellion persons of African descent held to service or labor under the 
local laws, rest firmly on two distinct grounds: First, as Property. 
Both our organic law, and the usages of 
our institutions under it, recognize fully the authority of the Government 
to seize and apply to public use 
private property, on making compensation therefor. What the use may be 
to which it is to 
be applied does not enter into the question of the right to make the 
seizure, which is 
untrammeled in its exercise save by the single condition mentioned.
<P>	Secondly, as persons:  While those of African descent held to 
service or labor in 
several of the States, occupy under the laws of such States the status of 
property, they 
occupy also under the Federal Government the status of "persons." They 
are referred to as 
<I>nomine</I> in the Constitution of the United States, and it is not as 
property but as "persons" 
that they are represented on the floor of Congress, and thus form a 
prominent constituent 
element alike in the organization and in the practical administration of 
the Government.
<P>	The obligation of all persons--irrespective of creed or color--to 
bear arms, if 
physically capable of doing so, in defence of the Government under which 
they live, and by which they are 
protected, is one that is universally acknowledged and 
enforced. Corresponding to this 
obligation is the duty resting on those charged with the administration 
of the Government, 
to employ such persons in the military service whenever the public safety 
may demand it. Congress recognized both this obligation on the one hand, 
and this duty on the other, 
when, by the 12th section of the act of 17th of July, 1862, it was 
enacted that the President 
be and he is hereby authorized to receive in the service of the United 
States, for the purpose 
of constructing intrenchments, or performing camp service or any other 
labor, or any 
military or naval service, for which they may be found competent, persons 
of African 
descent, and such persons shall be enrolled and organized under such 
regulations, not 
inconsistent with the Constitution and laws, as the President may prescribe.
<P>	The terms of this act are without restrictions, and no 
distinction is made, or was 
intended to be made, between persons of African descent held to service 
or labor, and those 
not so held.
<P>	The President is empowered to receive them all into the military 
service, and to assign 
them such duty as they may be found competent to porform. The tenacious 
and brilliant 
valor displayed by troops of this race at Port Hudson, Milliken's Bend 
and Fort Wagner, 
has sufficiently demonstrated to the President and the country the 
character of service of 
which they are capable. In the interpretation given to the enrollment 
act, free persons of 
African descent are treated as "citizens of the United States," in the 
sense of the law, and 
are everywhere being drafted into the military service.
<P>	In reference to the other class of persons of this race, those 
held to service or labor, 
the twelfth section of the act of July is still in full force, and the 
President may, in his 
discretion, receive them into the army and assign them such field duty as 
he may deem 
them prepared to occupy. In view of the loyalty of this race, and of the 
obstinate courage 
which they have shown themselves to possess, they certainly constitute, 
at this crisis in our 
history, a most powerful and reliable arm of the public defence. Whether 
this arm shall 
now be exerted is not a question of power or right, but purely of policy, 
to be determined 
by the estimate which may be entertained of the conflict in which we are 
engaged, and of 
the necessity that presses to bring this waste of blood and treasure to a 
close.
<P>	A man precipitated into a struggle for life, on land or sea, 
instinctively and almost 
necessarily puts forth every energy with which he is endowed, and eagerly 
seizes upon 
every source of strength within his grasp; and a nation battling for 
existence, that does not 
do the same, may well be regarded as neither wise or obedient to that 
great law of self-preservation from which is derived our most urgent and 
solemn duties. That there exists a 
prejudice against the employment of soldiers of African descent, is 
undeniable; it is, 
however, rapidly giving way, and never had any foundation in reason or 
loyalty. It originated with and has been diligently nurtured by those in 
sympathy with the rebellion, and its utterance at this moment is 
necessarily in the interests of treason.
<P>	Should the President feel that the public interests require 
he shall exert the power 
with which he is clothed by the twelfth section of the act of the 17th 
July, his action should 
be in subordination to the constitution principle which exacts that 
compensation shall be 
made for private property devoted to the public uses. A just 
compensation to loyal 
claimants to the service or labor of persons of African descent enlisted 
in our army, would 
accord with the uniform practice of the Government and with the genius of 
our institutions.
<P>	Soldiers of this class, after having perilled their lives in 
defence of the Republic, 
could not be re enslaved without a national dishonor revolting and 
unendurable for all who 
are themselves worthy to be free. The compensation made therfor should 
be such as 
entirely to exhaust the interest of the claimants; so that when soldiers 
of this class lay down 
their arms at the close of the war they may at once enter the enjoyment 
of that freedom 
symbolized by the flag which they have followed and defended.
