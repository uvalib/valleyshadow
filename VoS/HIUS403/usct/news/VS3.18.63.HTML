<P>	We learn from the Boston papers, that the 'Americans of African 
descent' in that vicinity are not satisfied with the proposition to form 
them into separate military organizations under white officers. They 
claim that it makes to great a distinction in point of equality, which 
they will not submit to. If equality is the point to be gained in this 
war, they demand that it should be recognized in the army. In this, 
however, they seem to forget that the white soldier might object to such 
an amalgamation. In this neighborhood, there has, so far been no effort 
to procure negro recruits, that we have heard of, and it is currently 
said that such an effort, if made, will be useless. They will have to be 
drafted, if obtained at all.
