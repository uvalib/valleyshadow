<h3><b>Judge Kelly on the Negro Troops</b></h3>

<P>	At a recent meeting held in National Hall, Philadelphia, to 
promote the enlistment of 
negro troops, Judge Kelly delivered an address replete with eloquence and 
patriotism. We 
subjoin several extracts:
<P>	My Fellow-Citizens--Before proceeding to the consideration of the 
grave question 
which brings us together, let me say that the rebel army of Northern 
Virginia is no more. [Immense cheering.] As an organization, it will 
never leave the soil of Pennsylvania, 
though fragments of it may struggle across the Potomac. [Renewed 
cheering.]  Henceforth 
Virginia is dedicated to Freedom! [Cheers.] West Virginia was freed by 
the suffrages of 
her patriotic men, and Virginia by the power of the United States.  
[Applause.] Never 
again will the insolent aristocracy of the Old Dominion breed 
fair-skinned and blue-eyed 
girls, or stalwart black men, for the slave markets of the far South.  
[Long continued 
cheering.]
<P>	Citizens of African descent, it is to you I would speak. Are you 
content to spend 
your lives as boot blacks, barbers, waiters and in other pursuits little 
if any better than 
servile or menial, when the profession of arms--the terrible but glorious 
work of the 
war--invites you to acknowledged manhood, freedom and honor. [Applause, 
and cries of No, no.]
<P>	After two hundred years of unmitigated oppression, Providence has 
opened the 
way for the Africo-American to prove his manhood to the world and command 
the respect 
and gratitude of those of his fellow-citizens whose cupidity and prejudice 
have enslaved and 
degraded him. Will you not spring to arms and march to the higher 
destiny that awaits 
your race, though it may require your mangled bodies to strew the 
glorious pathway? [Cheering, and cries of Yes, yes!] Yes, you will. Let 
it not be said that the Third United 
States Colored Volunteers, though a Pennsylvania regiment, contained but 
few or no 
Philadelphians. But fill its ranks quickly. You will bear at its head 
the flag around which 
freedmen and their descendants should most proudly rally:
<P>	The flag of Pennsylvania, the first commonwealth, kingdom or 
empire to abolish slavery--the Commonwealth whose act of emancipation--a solemn expression 
of gratitude 
to God for the freedom he had vouchsafed to its people--antedates British 
emancipation 
more than forty years--is the one we ask you to carry aloft.  It is the 
symbol of our honor 
and greatness. We cheerfully confide it to your hands, assured that you 
will carry it in 
triumph to any point at which treason has raised its rebellious head, and 
under its folds 
prove to mankind that each one of you is, in the sterner elements of 
manhood, a match for 
the haughtiest aristocrat of the Confederacy. [Applause.]
<P>	Old men, despite the disabilities under which you labor, some of 
you have 
accumulated wealth: we do not ask you to enlist--we want the young and 
vigorous. But 
when you go to your homes to-night do your duty--gather about your 
able-bodied sons, 
and let them know that if they prove cowards in this grand crisis of the 
history of your 
race, you will disinherit and denounce them.--Mothers, you love your 
sons--but think 
you that you love them better than did the mothers of the brave white 
boys and men who 
have borne our banners over so many terrible fields? No, you will not 
claim this; gather, 
then, your sons around you, and spurn him who will not prove that when 
you suffered the 
pangs of maternity it was to give birth to a <I>man</I>. And, girls, I 
have a 
word to say to you. The fellow who shrinks from the smell of gunpowder is 
very apt to be afraid of thunder. I 
have known such to creep into bed during a storm, and beg to be covered 
up closely. If, 
during this war, some spruce young dandy troubles you with a tender 
question, let him 
know that you would rather marry the wooden leg and empty jacket sleeve 
of a war-worn hero than any man who might require you to tuck him up during 
every thunder storm. [Cheers and laughter.]
<P>	And now white men and women, let me have a word with you. Will 
you assist the 
Supervisory Committee in the work it has in hand? Will you give to these 
brethren of the 
heroes of Port Hudson and Milliken's Bend your broadest, fullest 
sympathy? Will you 
pour in upon Congress memorials in overwhelming numbers, demanding that, 
as to pay 
and pension, they shall be treated as liberally as other soldiers are? 
[Cheers, and cries of Yes, 
yes, you will.] Will you watch over their widows with fraternal care, 
and see that their 
orphans are secured such educational opportunities as a great and humane 
Commonwealth 
should provide for the orphans of patriots who have laid down their lives 
in her cause and 
under her flag? [Renewed cries of Yes, and we will.] Yes, I am sure 
that in these respects 
you will be just, and I hope you will be generously magnanimous.
<P>	In the gloomy days through which we have just passed, I have been 
buoyant with hope amounting to faith. Behind the dark and heavy cloud 
that hung so oppressively near us, I saw, in the 
rapidly developing providences of God, the sure promise of victory and 
peace. During 
weary, sorrowing months and years of war, we have sighed for "the coming 
man" who 
was to bring up these great blessings. We have not found him.--Not 
Butler, nor Banks, 
nor Fremont, nor Grant, nor Rosecrans, nor Meade--though he has invested 
our quiet 
Gettysburg with the combined glories of Magenta and Solferino--has shown 
himself to be 
the man whose genius and power were to deliver us from protracted war. 
To admit this is 
but to admit that our great soldiers are not ubiquitous.--Donelson and 
Vicksburg, each in 
turn; New Orleans, Port Hudson and Gettysburg have each been worthy the 
attention of a 
great General. Shall we then cease to hope for him whose coming hope has 
so long 
prophesied? Oh no! he waits our bidding. He is the Colored Man! He has 
made Port 
Hudson the Thermopyls of his race; he occupies and surrounds Richmond; he 
is ready to 
intercept Lee's stragglers in the Shenandoah valley; he occupies the 
strongholds of 
Tennessee; he will give you Charleston, which is in his power, and, in 
distant Texas, he 
will respond with a joyous "Aye, aye," to your call, and run the Union 
flag to the top of 
every staff upon her prairies; he holds at his mercy every acre of 
Confederate territory; as a 
chattel, he feeds, clothes and arms every rebel soldier; as a man, 
assured of your 
sympathy, he will crush every rebel stronghold. Yes, sneer at or 
doubt it as you may, 
the negro is "the coming man" for whom we have waited. Give him the 
chance to attest his 
nature at all these points around which our white brethren perish, in swamp 
andd hospital, and throttling and crushing his old oppressor, he will give 
us speedy victory, and a peace 
that shall never again be disturbed by civil war. [Tremendous and 
long-continued cheering.]
