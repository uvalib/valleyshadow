<h3><b>Deserters Caught</b></h3>
<P>
A brace of soldiers were arrested, on Thursday night, by the Night 
Police, for disorderly conduct at a negro house, in the <i>faubourg de 
Wolfstown</i>, and lodged in jail. They turned up to be a couple of 
deserters from Capt. Brand's company. They were taken back to their old 
quarters at Camp Curtin, and will not likely grant themselves another 
<i>furlough</i> to wander about the out-skirts of "Camp Slifer" for some 
time to come.
