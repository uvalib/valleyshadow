<h3><b>Negro Recruits</b></h3>

<P>
Some forty or fifty black recruits for the Massachusetts 
Regiments, left this for Boston, on monday morning last. We are only too 
glad to get rid of these worthless negroes; but we scarcely like the idea 
of their being credited to Massachusetts, and thus filling up her quota 
under the last draft, while Pennsylvania was compelled to fill her quota, 
under the same draft, with free white male citizens.
