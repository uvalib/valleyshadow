Some of the nigger worshipping papers are calling upon the Administration 
to put arms in the hands of the slaves and let them butcher their masters 
and their families. None but cowardly Abolitionists would entertain such 
a thought as that. These fellows being too timid to engage in the 
struggle, and fearful that they will be called upon, are anxious to 
change the aspect of the contest so that their safety will be sure. They 
would sit, and calmly look on, upon the horrible disasters that would 
result from such a course as they propose, with a grin of satisfaction, 
fully contented so long as they were sure that their own worthless bodies 
were out of harm's reach.
