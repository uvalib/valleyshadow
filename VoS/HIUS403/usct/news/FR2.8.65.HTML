Since the skies of our national horizon are beginning to look bright, and 
the dark and threatening clouds of war disappearing, the question is 
often asked, what shall be done with the freedmen? We confess the 
question easier asked than answered, yet it may be never so difficult, it 
must be answered, and that too, in a way becoming a free intelligent and 
christian people. Whilst the war lasts, but one duty remains, that is, to 
keep up our armies to their full complement, and supply them with every 
thing necessary to prosecute the war vigorously and successfully. We have 
Generals the ablest and bravest in the world, and who have the full 
confidence of the people. The last election was but a warrant to them 
from the people to use all means necessary to suppress the rebellion, and 
conquer a lasting and permanent peace. This they are doing as fast as the 
most sanguine could ask. Victory everywhere perches proudly upon our 
banners and as the southern traitors are yielding and our armies marching 
unmolested through their borders; the civil authorities are tacstly 
seeking terms of compromise and peace honorable to themselves if 
possible. Whilst the affairs in the field stand so favorable, we find 
nearly one million of freedmen, and the number daily increasing, 
accessible to the people of the loyal States. They are ignorant, stupid 
in many cases, and passive recipients of the first influences which 
strike them. The transition from slavery to freedmen has doubtless 
jostled their minds a little, and developed new hopes and desires, and 
prepared them to hear and think as they never could before.--The proper 
instruction will elevate them rapidly--wrong influence will make them 
more miserable than they were before emancipation. If we do not carry 
them light, truth, strength and courage, they will inevitably sink under 
the flood tide of vices which follow an army. Their usefulness has been 
fairly tested, they have entered the ranks, have shown good capacity in 
acquiring knowledge sufficient to make good soldiers, and at Fort Wagner, 
in front of Petersburg and elsewhere, they have shown themselves equal to 
the best soldiers. No one who 
speaks dispassionately upon the subject will say that they will not make 
courageous and available soldiers. They have on more than one occasion 
received the commendation of their Generals for valuable and efficient 
services.
<P>
That they make good mechanics is fairly proven by the fact, that many of 
them are such, even in the degraded condition of Slavery. They are found 
in almost every one of the rougher trades, and skilled equal to any even 
of our own race, who labor in the same occupations. In many parts of the 
South, it was no unusual thing for planters, to have all the necessary 
mechanics among his slaves, and the slaves were valued according to their 
skill in whatever trade they were taught. They are proverbial for their 
powers of imitation. They are as a general thing fond of music and 
acquire it easily, and always where they have the least opportunity 
become excellent performers. We find even some without the advantages of 
instruction, or much opportunity for practice become quite proficient.
<P>
But we need not stop here, we find them entering the learned and 
honorable professions. We have them in the ministry, and doing much honor 
to the profession. We have them in the profession of medicine, editing 
newspapers, and but a few days since on motion of Hon. Charles Sumner, 
one Brooks was admitted to practice law in the Supreme court of the 
United States. This man Brooks is admitted to be gifted with 
extraordinary intellectual powers, and although young in years, stands at 
the head of the profession he has chosen for himself.
<P>
What then shall be done with the freedmen? Shall we allow them to look 
out for themselves and provide for their wants as best the can? Shall we 
keep open our stables and employ them as ostlers, use them as waiters at 
our dining-tables, servants anywhere and everywhere? Or shall we colonize 
them and send them to some other part of the globe, as an inferior and 
useless race. No, none of these. There is a higher duty required of us, 
and our own national salvation demands it. We must come to their help, 
and pour in upon them the inspiration of a higher and better life; they must 
be taught to read and write, under the tuition of religious teachers, and 
in this way, they will be elevated very rapidly and enjoy the blessings 
of liberty.
<P>
We are bound by many considerations to come to their help. They are a 
part of our fallen race, and from this part, we are required by the 
spirit and aim of the religion we profess, to save all the lost that is 
possible. They have been degraded and oppressed by our nation, and we 
have for years denounced the institution that bound them to the earth. We 
therefore owe them more than common benevolence to amend for the injury 
we have done them. If we therefore at once fit them for the position of 
freemen; if they are made intelligent, virtuous, industrious, they will 
prove a great blessing to themselves and the nation, but if they are left 
in ignorance, the victims of loose and vile men, they will prove a curse 
to themselves and our country.
<P>
In many parts of the country societies are organized for the purpose of 
raising funds to send teaches among them. This is a step in the right 
direction. Let the right kind of teaches be sent, and plenty of them, ad 
it will not be long until a new era shall dawn upon our country, and we 
can truthfully say, that our country is, "the land of the free" "and the 
home of the brave." If history be true, our own race were as degraded 
intellectually when the Romans invaded Britain, as ever the African race 
was, yet by moral and intellectual training, it has surpassed all others, 
and now stands the most powerful and enlightened race upon the face of 
the earth.
<P>
What may be done with the African race in the future we cannot tell. We 
know they have capacity, and this being the land of their birth, our duty 
is with the present. That they have giants among them even in their 
degraded condition does not admit of a doubt. In this broad land of ours, 
under the blessings of our Government, they can be made useful to 
themselves, the country and posterity. Let it the effort by fairly made.
