<H2><B>Rebel Atrocities</B></H2>


<P>	The leaders of the rebellion, defeated at every point, have 
resolved in their 
desperation to exhaust inhumanity in their death struggle. Never before 
in the history of 
civilized warfare, has such a record of brutality been made as has 
recently marked the 
career of the insurgents; and now they openly acknowledge it before the 
world, and plead 
in extenuation of it their purpose to compel the government to accept 
their theory of the 
war; their views of the status of soldiers, and their system for the 
exchanged prisoners. They now hold some 13,000 Union prisoners--many of 
them private citizens, arrested and 
imprisoned without even the pretence that they were spies, or on any 
other ground subject 
to capture and confinement by the rules of war. Yet they are crowded 
into loathsome 
prisons; subjected to the most barbarous treatment at the hands of low 
officials; fed, as a 
rule, on most unwholesome food and often insufficient in quantity; and 
denied almost 
every article essential to their comfort. Our military prisoners often 
fare worse, if possible, 
and the testimony from all sources in concurrent, that they are dying by 
hundreds from 
actual starvation, and from disease engendered by the habitual atrocities 
practiced in every 
conceivable shape upon them by the subordinate rebel officers.
<P>	Our government has exhausted its efforts to effect a just and 
equitable exchange of 
prisoners, but without success. It has generously offered to postpone 
the questions in 
dispute as to negro troops; officers of negro troops, and the alleged 
return to service, 
without authority, of the rebels captured at Vicksburg; and exchange man 
for man and 
officer for officer until one side or the other should be without 
prisoners; but this 
proposition has been declined by the rebel authorities. The last offer 
made by our 
government was to exchange 10,000 men, which would leave but few in rebel 
hands: but 
they rejected it, and they stand before the world to-day as holding 
thousands of prisoners 
of war--recognized by all civilized Nations as entitled to humane 
treatment--for no other 
reason, than to coerce our government into a partial, recognition of the 
Southern 
Confederacy in order to rescue our brave soldiers from the horrors of 
rebel brutality. When the government proposed to send rations to our suffering heroes, the 
rebel officers quibble first upon one point and then upon another, and finally reject 
the needed provisions 
entirely; and when the benevolence of private individuals and christian 
and sanitary 
associations demands access to their deadly prisons, they dare not openly 
reject the 
proffered humanity, but they deny all agents admission to our prisoners, 
and manage by 
arbitrary official regulations to defeat measurably if not wholly the 
relief intended.
<P>	Finding, however, that our government cannot be driven from its 
just purpose, we 
have hope now that the exchange of prisoners will soon be resumed by the 
rebels, and that 
citizen prisoners will soon be at liberty. The brilliant victory of Gen. 
Grant at Chattanooga 
is an argument in favor of the early exchange, and of the humane 
treatment of prisoners, 
that can be scarcely be unheeded at Richmond. It opens to our army the 
very heart of 
Georgia and a most vital point of the remnant of the bogus Confederacy; 
and unless non-combatants are speedily discharged by the rebels, Gen. Grant has 
abundance of material in 
Georgia, in the persons of chivalric planters, to make the rebel 
authorities glad to recognize 
the propriety of adhering to the dictates of humanity in the treatment of 
prisoners. We do 
not doubt that, unless the exchange of prisoners shall be speedily 
resumed by the rebels, 
Gen. Grant will commence such retaliatory measures as must operate like 
magic upon the 
rebel leaders. He will not imitate their barbarous vengeance by starving 
prisoners, or 
confining them in loathsome prisons to die an hundred deaths by ??? 
disease; but he 
doubtless will take prominent rebel citizens and hold them as hostages 
for our non-combatants now imprisoned without any charges against them whatever; and if necessary 
to carry retaliation still farther, he can, by the accepted rules of war, 
inflict punishment 
upon hundreds of his prisoners lately captured, as they are in the rebel 
service in insolent 
violation of their parole at Vicksburg, and their lives are thus forfeited.
<P>	--There is one chapter of rebel atrocity in this war that remains 
to be written, and 
we hazard little in saying that when it shall be truthfully portrayed, 
all other atrocities of the 
war will pale before it. We refer to their treatment of our negro 
troops. The rebel leaders 
have steadily refused to recognize negro troops or their officers as 
entitled to the treatment 
of prisoners of war. Various acts of assembly of the insurgent States; 
an act of the rebel 
Congress, and several proclamations of Jeff Davis, alike condemn them to 
the ignominious 
death of the felon; and it is feared that in many instances they have 
fulfilled their threatened 
vengeance  Notwithstanding their various laws and proclamations, they 
have not dared to 
fulfill them so far as to execute officers of negro troops; for they well 
know that such 
inhuman butchery could not escape our notice, and when once known, they 
are well 
convinced that retaliation would come in the name of Justice and take eye 
for eye and tooth 
for tooth with terrible certainty. But our government has no 
information, and can get none, 
of the negro soldiers captured by the rebels. Every effort has been 
made, officially and 
otherwise, to ascertain the fate of our negro troops captured, but as yet 
no evidence of their 
existence can be found. There have been some hundreds captured.  At 
Milliken's Bend, 
where two negro regiments, by matchless heroism, saved Gen. Grant's lines 
of 
communication, a few were captured--principally wounded men; at Banks' 
unsuccessful 
assault on Port Hudson, where they won immortal honor by their bravery, 
many of their 
wounded and some not wounded fell into the enemy's hands; in Gen. 
Strong's fatal assault 
upon Battery Gregg, near Charleston, many of his wounded negro troops 
were taken, and 
in various skirmishes and battles in Louisiana and on the Gulf, negro 
soldiers have been 
made prisoners by the rebels; and since their capture our government has 
never herd of 
them! Earnest and persistent inquiries have been made by our officers at 
every point; but 
all efforts have failed to elicit any information respecting them. The 
government is well 
convinced that they have been either brutally murdered, or what is 
equally revolting, sold 
into slavery. The fearful reckoning to come upon the rebels from this 
cause has doubtless 
made them resort to every possible pretext to prevent the exchange of 
prisoners; for the 
issue touching negro troops must be met as soon as a general exchange is 
effected, and 
they dread to face the government and the world on their own record of 
inhumanity. But 
they cannot long delay this terrible retribution. Our government is 
bound by every 
consideration of duty; by its plighted faith to its soldiers, regardless 
of color, to vindicate 
their rights and avenge their wrongs; and there is no alternative but to 
demand and take life 
for life until exact justice is measured out to the remorseless 
murderers, and humanity is 
taught them through their fears, since it cannot reach them through their 
conceptions of 
justice. To this fearful necessity our government is driven by the 
persistent atrocities of the 
leaders of this causeless, this wicked war; and when the day of avenging 
justice comes, we 
may hope for some measure of humanity thenceforth on the part of the foes 
of the 
Republic.
