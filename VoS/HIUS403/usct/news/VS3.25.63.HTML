<P>
A negro recruiting officer visited this place last week 
and of course was quite a "lion" among the "free Americans of African 
descent;" but, as far as we know, he did not obtain a single recruit.--It 
is rumored that one of the "sable brethren" retorted to the urgent 
appeals of the recruiting officer in favor of his cause: "Nigger has nuf 
fin to do with dis war.  Two dogs fight over a bone--did you ever see de 
bone fight?"
