<h3><B>Rebel Atrocities</b></h3>

<P>	An official investigation of the rebel butcheries at Fort Pillow 
has been made by a 
committee of Congress, and they more than confirm the first reports of 
the fiendish atrocity 
of the rebel victors. After referring to their shameless violation of a 
flag-of-truce and the 
capture of the Fort, the report says:
	
<p>	Then followed a scene of cruelty and murder without a parallel in 
civilized war, 
which needed but the tomahawk and scalping-knife to exceed the worst 
atrocities ever 
committed by savages. The Rebels commenced an indiscriminate slaughter, 
sparing neither 
age nor sex, white or black, soldier or civilian. The officers and men 
seemed to vie with 
each other in devlish work. Men, women and children, wherever found, 
were 
indiscriminately shot down, beaten and hacked with sabres. Some of the 
children, not 
more than ten years old, were forced to stand up and face their mothers 
while being shot. The sick and wounded were butched without mercy, the Rebels even entering 
the hospital 
buildings and dragging them out to be shot, or killing them as they lay 
there unable to offer 
the least resistance. All over the hillside the work of murder was going on.
<P>	Numbers of our men were gathered together in lines or groups, and 
deliberately 
shot. Some were shot while in the river, while others on the bank were 
shot and their 
bodies kicked into the water, many of them still living, but unable to 
make any exertion to 
save themselves from drowning. Some of the Rebels stood upon the top of 
the hill, or a 
short distance down its side, and called to our soldiers to come up to 
them, and as they 
approached shot them down in cold blood, if their guns or pistols missed 
fire forcing them 
to stand there until they were again prepared to fire. All around were 
cries of "No quarter, 
no quarter!" "kill the--negroes!" "shoot them down!" All who asked for 
mercy were 
answered by the most cruel taunts and sneers.
<P>	Some were spared for a time only to be murdered under 
circumstances of greater 
cruelty. No cruelty which the most fiendish maligmity could devise was 
omitted by their 
murderers. One white soldier, who was wounded in the leg so as to be 
unable to walk, 
was made to stand up while his tormentors shot him. Others who were 
wounded and 
unable to stand up, were help up and again shot. One negro who had been 
ordered by a 
Rebel officer to hold his horse, was killed by him when he 
remonstrated.--Another, a mere 
child, whom an officer had taken up behind him on his horse, was seen by 
Chalmers, who 
at once ordered the officer to put him down and shoot him, which was 
done.  The huts and 
tents in which many of the wounded had sought shelter were set on fire 
both that night 
and the next morning, while the wounded were still in them, those only 
escaping who were 
able to get themselves out, or who could prevail on others less injured 
than themselves to 
help them out, and even some of them thus seeking to escape the flames 
were met by these 
ruffians and brutally shot down, or had their brains beaten out. One man 
was deliberately 
fastened down to the floor of a tent, face upwards, by means of nails 
driven through his 
clothing and into the boards under him so that he could not possibly 
escape, and then the 
tent set on fire. Another was nailed to the side of a  building, 
outside of the fort, and then 
the building set on fire and burned. The charred remains of five or six 
bodies were 
afterwards found, all but one so much disfigured and consumed by the 
flames that they 
could not be identified, and the identification of that one is not 
absolutely certain, although 
there can hardly be a doubt that it was the body of Lieut. Akerstrem, 
Quartermaster of the 
Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry, and a native Tennesseean.--Several witnesses 
who saw the 
remains, and who were personally acquainted with him while living here, 
testified that it is 
their firm belief that it was his body that was thus treated.--These 
deeds of murder and 
cruelty closed when night came on, only to be renewed the next morning, 
when the 
demons carefully sought among the dead lying about in all directions for 
any other 
wounded yet alive and those they killed.
<P>	Scores of the dead and wounded were found there the day of the 
massacre by the 
men from some of our gun-boats, who were permitted to go on shore and 
collect the 
wounded and bury the dead. The Rebels themselves had made a pretense of 
burying a 
great many of their victims, but they had merely thrown them, without the 
least regard for 
care or decency, into trenches and ditches about the fort, or the little 
hollows and ravines on 
the hillside, covering them but partially with earth. Portions of heads 
and faces, hands and 
feet, were found pro-truding through the earth in every direction 
even when your 
committee visited the spot two weeks afterwards, although parties of men 
had been sent on 
shore from time to time to bury the bodies unburied, and rebury the 
others and were even 
then engaged in the same work. We found the evidences of this murder and 
cruelty still 
most painfully. We saw bodies still unburied, at some distance from the 
fort, of some sick 
men, who had been fleeing from the hospital, and beaten down and brutally 
murdered, and 
their bodies left where they had fallen. We could still see the faces, 
and hands and feet of 
men, white and black, protruding out of the ground, whose graves had not 
been reached by 
those engaged in reinterring the victims of the massacre, and although a 
great deal of ruin 
had fallen within the preceding two weeks the ground, more especially on 
the side at the 
foot of the bluff where the most of the murders had been committed, was 
still discolored by 
the blood of our brave but unfortunate men, and the logs and trees showed 
but too plainly 
the evidences of the atrocities perpetrated there. Many other instances 
of equally atrocious 
cruelty might be enumerated, but your committee feel compelled to refrain 
from giving here 
of the heart-sickening details, and refer to the statements contained in 
the voluminous 
testimony herewith submitted.--Those statements were obtained by them 
from 
eyewitnesses and sufferers. Many of them, as they were examined by your 
Committee, 
were lying upon beds of pain and suffering; some so feeble that their 
lips could with 
difficulty frame the words by which they endeavored to convey some idea 
of the cruelty 
which had been inflicted on them, and which they had seen inflicted on 
others. In 
reference to the fate of Maj. Bradford, who was in command of the fort 
when it was 
captured, and who had, up to that time, received no injury, there seems 
to be no doubt. The general understanding everywhere seemed to be that he had been 
brutally murdered the 
day after he was taken prisoner.
<P>	How many of our troops thus fell victims to the malignity and 
barbarity of Forrest 
and his followers cannot yet be definitely ascertained. Two officers 
belonging to the 
garrison were absent at the time of the capture and massacre. Of the 
remaining officers but 
two are known to be living, and they are wounded, and now in the Hospital 
at Mound 
City. One of them (Capt. Porter) may even now be dead, as the Surgeons, 
when your 
Committee were there, expressed no hope of his recovery. Of the men, 
from three hundred 
to four hundred are known to have been killed at Fort Pillow, of whom at 
least three 
hundred were murdered in cold blood, after the fort was in possession of 
the Rebels, and 
our men had thrown down their arms and ceased to offer resistance.  Of 
the survivors, 
except the wounded in the hospital, at Mound City, and the few who 
succeeded in making 
their escape unhurt, nothing definite is known, and is to be feared that 
many have been 
murdered after being taken away from the fort. When your committee 
arrived at Memphis, 
Tenn., they found and examined a man, (Mr. McLegan,) who had been 
conscripted by 
some of Forrest's force, but who, with other conscripts, had succeeded in 
making his 
escape.
<P>	He testifies that while two companies of Rebel troops, with Maj. 
Bradford and 
many other prisoners, were on their march from Brownsville and Jackson, 
Tenn., Maj. 
Bradford was taken by five Rebels, one an officer, led about fifty yards 
from the line of 
march, and deliberately murdered in view of all those assembled. He 
fell, killed instantly 
by three musket balls, and while asking that his life might be spared, as 
he had fought them 
manfully and was deserving of a better fate. The motive for the murder 
of Maj. Bradford 
seems to have been the simple fact that, although a native of the South, 
he remained loyal to 
his Government.
