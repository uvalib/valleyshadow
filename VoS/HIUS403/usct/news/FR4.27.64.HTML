<h3><b>Rebel Savagery</b></h3>

<P>	We have already given a brief account of the inhuman brutality 
practised by the 
rebels upon the troops of Fort Pillow after it had been surrendered; but 
the details increase 
in horror as they are developed. The negro troops fought most gallantly 
until overpowered; 
but they were outnumbered immensely and were overcome. A corespondent 
thus 
describes the scene after the rebels got possession of the Fort:
<P>	After the rebels were in undisputed possession of the fort and 
the survivors had 
surrendered, they commenced the indiscriminate butchery of all the 
Federal soldiers. The 
colored soldiers threw down their guns and raised their arms in token of 
surrender, but not 
the least attention was paid to it. They continued to shoot down all 
they found. A number 
of them finding no quarter was given, ran over the bluff to the river, 
and tried to conceal 
themselves under the bank and in the bushes, were pursued by the rebel 
savages, and 
implored to spare their lives. Their appeals were made in vain, and they 
were all shot 
down in cold blood, and in full sight of the gunboat. I passed up the 
bank of the river and 
counted fifty dead strewed along. One had crawled into a hollow log and 
was killed it it; 
another had got over the bank into the river, and got to a board that ran 
out into the water. He lay on it on his face, with his feet in the water.  
He laid there when 
exposed stark and 
stiff. Several had tried to hide in crevices made by the falling bank, 
and could not be seen 
without difficulty, but they were singled out and killed. From the best 
information I could 
get the white soldiers were, to a very considerable extent, treated in 
the same way. One of 
the 13th Tennessee on board--D.W. Harrison--informs  me that after the 
surrender he 
was below the bluff, and one of the rebels presented a pistol to shoot 
him. He told him he 
had surrendered and requested him not to fire. He spared him, and 
directed him to go up 
the bluff to the fort. Harrison asked him to go before him, or he would 
be shot by others, 
but he told him to go along. He started, and had not proceeded far 
before he met a rebel 
who presented his pistol. Harrison begged him not to fire but paying no 
attention to his 
request, he fired and shot him through the shoulder, and another shot him 
in the leg. He 
[sic] full, and while he lay unable to move, another came along and was 
about to fire again, 
when Harrison told him he was badly wounded twice, and implored not to 
fire. He asked 
Harrison if he had any money. He said he had a little money and a 
watch. The rebel took 
from him his watch and ninety dollars in money, and left him.  Harrison 
is probably fatally 
wounded. Several such cases have been related to me, and I think, to a 
great extent, the 
whites and negroes were indiscriminately murdered. The rebel Tennesseans 
have about the 
same bitterness against Tennesseans in the Federal army, as against the 
negroes. I was told 
by a rebel officer that Gen. Forrest shot one of his men and cut another 
with his saber for 
shooting down prisoners. It may be so, but he is responsible for the 
conduct of his men, 
and Gen. Chalmeres stated publicly while on the Platte Valley, that though 
he did not 
encourage or countenance his men in shooting down negro captives, yet 
that it was right 
and justifiable.
