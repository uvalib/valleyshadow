<h3><b>The Nigger in Cars</b></h3>
<P>
The United States Senate--supposed to be the highest and most dignified 
body in the country--last week passed a resolution to compel the street 
Railroad companies of Washington City to allow negroes to ride in their 
cars. This is eminently proper in that locality. As niggers rule the 
roost at Washington it is no more than fair that they should ride in the 
cars.
