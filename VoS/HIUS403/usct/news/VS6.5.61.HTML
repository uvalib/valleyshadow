<h3><b>Horrible Occurrence</b></h3>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon a number of soldiers, from different companies, 
collected in that disreputable quarter of our town,
known as Wolfstown, and for some cause, that we have not been able to 
clearly ascertain, made an attack upon a house
occupied by a colored man named Frank Jones. The windows of the house 
were broken in, the doors forced open, the stove
upset and the colored man and his wife knocked down. In the melee Jones 
discharged a gun the contents of which wounded
two of the soldiers in the legs. The cry was then raised to "kill the 
nigger" and he immediately fled from the house going out
of the backdoor and crossing the lots in the direction of West Market 
street. When his flight was discovered a Lieutenant in
one of the Pittsburg companies, attached to the Seventh Regiment, who had 
arrived on the ground, called for "six good men"
to follow him, and led off in pursuit of the negro. The soldiers pursued 
the man to the residence of GEORGE EYSTER, Esq.,
on Federal Hill, where they found him concealed in the kitchen 
chimney.--They dragged him from the chimney but assured
the lady of the house, Mr. Eyster not being at home, that they would do 
him no harm, that they intended only taking him to
jail. This we believe, was the sole intention of the party who first 
arrested Jones.--They brought him down the yard until near
the gate, at the lane leading to the barn, here they were met by the 
Lieutenant who had given chase from Wolfstown, who
ordered the men, who had hold of Jones, to stand aside when he instantly 
discharged his revolver into him, the first ball
striking him in front of the body. Jones then turned and made for the 
fence, when four other shots were fired at him, from the
same pistol, in rapid succession, the ball striking him in the back. 
While this was going on one of the soldiers was beating him
over the head with a heavy club. He fell on receiving the fifth shot when 
a number of bayonet and sword wounds were
inflicted upon him. He was a long time dying while the Lieutenant and the 
soldiers stood around him and would not permit
any one to afford him any relief. 
<P>
A large and excited crowd soon collected at the spot and threats were 
very freely made to burn the body, quarter it, &c.
Several shots, one of which accidentally struck a soldier in the right 
groin, inflicting a severe would, were fired, at the dead
body. Mr. Eyster, upon whose premises the body lay, and who is 
Prosecuting Attorney for the county, obtained a company
of soldiers from Gen. WILLIAMS to keep down further disturbance and to 
have the body removed. This company was
marched to the spot where the body lay but through the order of a 
subordinate officer was marched back and the body suffered
to remain on the ground exposed to further mutilation. Mr. EYSTER then, 
with the assistance of some citizens, removed the
body to the jail and had it locked up. 'Squire Hammond summoned a Jury of 
Inquest and a post-mortem examination of the
body ordered to be made. This duty was assigned to Drs. HAMILTON and 
BOYLE who on Sunday morning made a
thorough dissection of the body at the jail, and before the Jury of 
Inquest described the number, extent and character of the
wounds on the body. It appears from their testimony that there were 
twenty wounds in all, six being bullet wounds and the
balance incised and contused wounds. One of the shot wounds in the back 
was described as having passed through the
shoulder blade and through both large cavities of the heart and lodged in 
the breast bone in front. Another of the wounds was
described as a sword wound passing through the arm, entering the chest, 
breaking a rib, and then deeply penetrating the lung.
After the examination the body was laid out in suitable grave clothing, 
placed in a coffin, and sent home to the family of the
deceased, who had it buried on Monday forenoon. 
<P>
The soldiers wounded by Jones are in the Hospitals of their respective 
regiments, and their injuries, though severe, are doing
well. The soldier, accidently shot, it is also thought will recover from 
his wound. 
<P>
We understand the finding of the jury implicates four persons in the 
killing of Jones. One has already been arrested, and
warrants are in the hands of the proper officers for the arrest of the 
other parties implicated. 
<P>
We purposely refrain from mentioning names, or making any comments that 
would excite or prejudice the public mind against
the parties envolved in this unfortunate occurrence. It would be highly 
improper to do so as the matter will undergo a legal
investigation, and the accused will be dealt with, not as public opinion, 
but, as justice may determine. 
<P>
The particulars of the affair, as we have given them above, are mainly 
derived from the evidence taken before the Coroners
jury.
