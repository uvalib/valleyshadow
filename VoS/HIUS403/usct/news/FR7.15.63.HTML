<P>
Hon. Benjamin Flanders, writing from New Orleans to a gentleman of 
Philadelphia, pays the following tribute to the bravery of the colored 
troops:
<P>
"The unanimous report of all those who were in the recent severe fight at 
Port Hudson, in regard to the negroes, is, that they fought like devils. 
They have completely conquered the prejudice of the army against them. 
Never was there before such an extraordinary revolution of sentiment as 
that of this army in respect to the negroes as soldiers."
