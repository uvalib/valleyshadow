When black men enlisted in the United States Colored Troops, the Union 
did not organize their regiments by location. As a result, enlisted
men from Franklin County served in at least 21 separate 
regiments and experienced the Civil War all over the country. Below are 
regiment histories, a selection of battles in which Franklin men fought, 
and a map illustrating where these battles took place. Information about 
these battles as well as the regiment histories were 
compiled from <i>The Official Records of the War of the Rebellion</i>. Histories were 
composed only for regiments in which four or more Franklin men fought.
