<P>
Included in the Franklin County Military Dossiers are the USCT military 
records we compiled during the months of September through November 1997 
at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.  The members of the group 
spent many 
hours researching each member of the USCT from Franklin County. The USCT 
were unique in that they did not serve in county-based regiments. Instead, 
each USCT unit included men from a wide array of states and counties. 
Franklin men served in at least 21 separate regiments. Using the 1890 
U.S. Special Census for Veterans for Franklin County and the Lebanon 
Cemetary records (Chambersburg, Pennsylvania), we compiled a list of over 
130 Franklin men who served in the USCT regiments. There is a strong 
possibility that there are more men from Franklin County who served in 
the USCT. 
<P>
While we were working on this project, the National Archives was 
microfilming all of the USCT records. 
This presented a special challenge for our research. As a result, some of 
the records are more complete than others. We would like to 
thank the archivists at the National Archives for their patience and 
help.
