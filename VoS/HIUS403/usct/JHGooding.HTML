<title>Letter to Pres. Lincoln from James Henry Gooding</TITLE>

<P>
Your Excellency, Abraham Lincoln:
<P>
Your Excellency will pardon the presumption of a humble individual like 
myself in addressing you, but the earnest solicitation of my comrades in 
arms, besides the genuine interest felt by myself in the matter, is my 
excuse for placing before the executive head of the nation our common 
grievance.
<P>
On the 6th of the last month, the paymaster of the department informed us 
that if we would decide to receive the sum of $10 (ten dollars) per 
month, he would come and pay us that sum, but that, on the sitting of 
Congress, the regiment would, in his opinion, be allowed the other $3 
(three). He did not give us any guarantee that this would be as he hoped; 
certainly <I>he</I> had no authority for making such guarantee, and we 
cannot suppose him acting in any way interested.
<P>
Now the main question is, are we <I>soldiers</I> or are we 
<I>laborers</I>? We are fully armed and equipped; have done all the various duties pertaining to 
a soldier's life; have conducted ourselves to the complete satisfaction 
of general officers who were, if any, prejudiced <I> against</I> us, but who 
now accord us all the encouragement and honor due us; have shared the perils 
and labor of reducing the first stronghold that flaunted a traitor flag; 
and more, Mr. President, today the Anglo-Saxon mother, wife, or sister 
are not alone in tears for departed sons, husbands, and brothers. The 
patient, trusting descendants of Africa's clime have dyed the ground with 
blood in defense of the Union and democracy. Men, too, Your Excellency, 
who know in a measure the cruelties of the iron heel of oppression, 
which, in years gone by, the very power their blood is now being spilled 
to maintain, ever ground them to the dust.
<P>
But when the war trumpet sounded o'er the land, when men knew not the 
friend from the traitor, the black man laid his life at the altar of the 
nation--and he was refused. When the arms of the Union were beaten, in the 
first year of the war, and the executive called for more food for its 
ravaging maw, again the black man begged the privilege of aiding his 
country in her need--to be again refused.
<P>
And now he is in the war, and how has he conducted himself? Let their 
dusky forms rise up out of the mires of James Island and give the answer. 
Let the rich mold around Wagner's parapets be upturned, and there will be 
found an eloquent answer. Obedient and patient and solid as a well are 
they. All we lack is a paler hue and a better acquaintance with the alphabet.
Now, your Excellency, we have done a soldier's duty. Why can't we have a 
soldier's pay? You caution the Rebel chieftain that the United States 
knows no distinction in her soldiers. She insists on having all her 
soldiers of whatever creed and color to be treated according to the 
usages of war. Now, if the United States exacts uniformity of treatment 
of her soldiers from the insurgents, would it not be well and consistent 
to set the example herself by paying all her <I>soldiers</I> alike?
<P>
We of this regiment were not enlisted under any "contraband" act. But we 
do not wish to be understood as rating our service of more value to the 
government than the service of the ex-slave. Their service <I>is</I> 
undoubtedly worth much to the nation, but Congress made express provision touching 
their case, as slaves freed by military necessity, and assuming the 
government to be their temporary guardian. Now so with us. Freemen by 
birth and consequently having the advantage of <I> thinking</I> and acting 
for ourselves so far as the laws would allow us, we do not consider ourselves 
fit subjects for the contraband act.
<P>
We appeal to you, sir, as the executive of the nation, to have us justly 
dealt with. The regiment do pray that they be assured their service will 
be fairly appreciated by paying them as American <I>soldiers</I>, not as 
menial 
hirelings. Black men, you may well know, are poor; $3 per month, for a 
year, will suplly their needy wives and assure us our whole pay, we are 
content. Our patriotism, our enthusiasm will have a new impetus to exert 
our energy more and more to aid our country. Not that our hearts ever 
flagged in devotion, spite the evident apathy displayed in our behalf, 
but we feel as though our country spurned us, now we are sworn to serve 
her. Please give this a moment's attention.
