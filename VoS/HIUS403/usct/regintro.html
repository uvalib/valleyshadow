<h2>When black men enlisted in the Colored Troops, the Union did 
not organize their regiments by location. Due to this practice, enlisted men from Franklin County served in several regiments. They experienced the

"The Official Record of the War of the Rebellion" chronicles the journey of these regiments throughout the war.</h2>
