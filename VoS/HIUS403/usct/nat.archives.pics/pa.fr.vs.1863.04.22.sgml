irresponsible Lieutenant named Ashmead," and put on a train to unknown destination, probably
Fort McHenry. Why he was arrested in unknown. A number of prominent citizens of both

<summary>The editors attack the Transcript's frenzy over the supposed discovery of a secret
society of draft resisters in Berks County. In fact, say the editors, these men had banded together
to legally test the draft in the courts and pledged money to support the legal fees of the members
if one were drafted. The Transcript has blown the situation far out of proportion by interpreting it
as part of a secret society of millions.</summary>
