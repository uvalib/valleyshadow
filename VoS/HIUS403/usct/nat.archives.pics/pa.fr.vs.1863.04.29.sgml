<head>Swan on Sumner--Speech of Hon. W. D. Swan</head>
<origin></origin>
<commentary></commentary>
<transcript>"This policy, sir, of Mr. Sumner and his coadjutors, so persistently forced upon the
President of the United States, at last compelled him, against his own judgement, to issue his
proclamation in favor of emancipation."</transcript>
<trailer></trailer>
<names></names>
<summary>Senator W. D. Swan denounces the attempts of Senator Sumner to subsume the states
in the Union, and to essentially recognize the act of secession by declaring the seceded states null
and void. He also argues that Sumner and others have essentially threatened Lincoln with
imposing a dictatorship if he did not issue the emancipation proclamation.</summary>

<summary>The editors propose having a community picnic, to which they would invite their
political enemies, particularly Lieutenant Albert S. Ashmead of the Provost Guard, and the editors
of the Dispatch and Village Record. They could make it a genuine Union picnic, and once
everybody is together and having a good time, a prayer could be offered that God would "turn to
naught the counsels of wicked and foolish fanatics and restore this blood-bought Union of
ours."</summary>

that we had an institution such as a 'provost marshal' in this town? . . . We felt ourselves unable to
answer this very pertinent inquiry, but perhaps Mr. 'Albert S. Ashmead, Lieutenant and Provost
Marshal' can."</transcript>

<summary>The editors note that the Democratic party of the state will meet in a few months to
nominate candidates for Governor and Supreme Judge of the state. For Supreme Judge, the
incumbent, Hon. Walter H. Lowrie, should be nominated, the editors argue, but the governor's
race has no clear favorite. There are a number of people whose names have been mentioned, but
no one's nomination is certain. The editors do not have a favorite and mention no names. 
However, they urge Democrats to avoid intra-party fighting, as they feel this is the only way the
party could be defeated in the fall.</summary>

<summary>A "large and enthusiastic meeting of the Democracy" took place at the Court House
on Saturday night. Capt. Samuel B. McKesson was elected president, and elected vice-presidents
were: James Reilly and Col. John M. Gilmore of Chambersburg, Samuel West of Hamilton
Township, and John Wolfkill of Guilford Township. William Kennedy, C. M. Duncan and W. S.
Stenger, Esquires, were appointed to draft resolutions, which were the same as those passed by
the Pennsylvania legislature and published earlier in the week.  These resolutions, when passed,
signified to the editors the "manifest indication of the Democracy to cling to them in the fearful
struggle for Constitutional rights through which the nation is now passing." J. McD. Sharpe, W.
S. Stenger, and William Kennedy, Esqs, all addressed the meeting. A committee for the
permanent organization of a Democratic club was then appointed, consisting of Hiram M. White,
John M. Gilmore, John S. Ludwig, B. F. Nead, and C. M. Duncan; a committee to draft the
bylaws was also appointed, consisting of Hiram C. Keyser, John Armstrong, and George M.
Stenger. The meeting was adjourned to reassemble at Montgomery's Hotel on Saturday, May
9.</summary>
