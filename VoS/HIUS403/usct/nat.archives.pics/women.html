Just as a study of the religious attitudes and activities of Franklin 
County gives insight into the daily life of Franklin County, so does a 
study of women's lives before and during the war.  A look into the lives 
of women gives an idea of the values which the Franklin residents held 
in high regard, the types of entertainment enjoyed, and suggests the 
ways in which life changed with the progression of the war.
<p>Women of Franklin County were limited in the roles they could play in society.  Women were, in the first place, to stay home, tending the house and garden.  Secondary to this place in th home, was education.  However, although eduacation was valued, wo
men were expected to receive only the most rudimentary education.
<p>Outside of the church, entertainment fell mostly to dramatic and 
musical performances.  These performances were both local and travelling 
in nature.  Beyond these performances, a women could find entertainment 
and social interaction inside of civic activities.
<p>As the war came and progressed, the lives of Franklin residents 
became noticeably more difficult.  This increasing difficulty can be 
seen clearly both in how women behaved and how they were perceived.  
A change in the behavior of women can be seen simultaneously in a switch 
in the civic activities in which they participated and the crimes they 
comitted.  Even as some women, most likely the wealthy, became the main 
participants in charity for both the poor and the soldiers, others were 
pushed by poverty to such crimes as infancticide and shoplifiting.
