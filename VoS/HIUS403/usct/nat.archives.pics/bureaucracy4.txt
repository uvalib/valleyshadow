The people of Augusta County appeared to have 
neither cared much for the 
Freedmen's Bureau nor its purpose to aid freedmen.  
This is indicated by the fact that the local 
newspapers rarely mention the 
Freedmen's Bureau and its functions in Staunton, 
although the Bureau 
correspondence records indicate that the office 
was actively involved 
with the local black community. The Staunton 
community regarded the Freedmen's Bureau at the most as a 
policing force and not much else.  One of the earliest mentions of the 
Freedmen's Bureau's was in <A HREF="local/vD1-31-66.html>January 31, 1866 
in the <I>Valley Virginian</I></A>.  This article reported that a fight had 
occurred between two parties of black men and that the Freedmen's Bureau was 
investigating the case. 
<P>
In all other senses, the community considered the Freedmen's Bureau as a 
symbol of hostile Northern intentions to advance the black community at the 
expense of the whites.  Many Southerners believed that freedmen should turn 
to their <A HREF="local/10.17.66.html">former masters </A> for aide and that 
a government agency for such a purpose was unnecessary.  
<P>
People associated with the Freedmen's Bureau were considered to be Northern 
radicals and were under constant watch of the local community.  
In <A HREF="local/vD1-31-66.html">January 1866</A>, it had to be publicly 
declared that Mr. Tukey, the Superintendent of the Staunton Freedmen's Bureau 
at that time, was not involved in circulating a petition to return Union 
troops to the Valley. In <A HREF="local/v4-4-66.html">April</A> of the same 
year, the Freedmen School teacher in Staunton, John Scott was accused of 
having an affair with a black student when he was seen "escorting" her down 
New Street. 
<P>
Despite the community's suspicion of the agents of the Freedmen's Bureau, the local newspapers did not report on the Bureau office's administrative changes. There were no announcements in the local papers about the opening of the office, the changing of agents, and so forth. The personnel history of the Staunton Bureau office has been pieced together from Bureau correspondence.

The financial and administrative problems suffered by the national Freedmen's Bureau hindered the work of the Staunton Bureau at the local level.    


The exact location of 
the Freedmen's Bureau office in Staunton could not be determined; however, 
an article in the <I>Valley Virginian</I> in 1866 mentioned that a saloon 
opened near the Court house and the Freedmen's Bureau, putting these two 
offices within a block radius of each other.
