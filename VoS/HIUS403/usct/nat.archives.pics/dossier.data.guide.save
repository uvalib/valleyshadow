Military Dossier Guide For Data Entry

September 24, 1997


1.  Do not use any colons (:) anywhere in the database.

2.  Use semi-colons to separate entries within a field, i.e. if someone 
were wounded in action twice or three times, the semi-colon separates 
each event.

3.  Be consistent in data entry abbreviations, i.e. for regiment enter 
the same abbreviation each time:

	Use:
		107th Pa.
		107th Pa. 

	Not:
		107th Pa.
		107 Pa.
		107th
	
4.  Searchable dates must have a ! before and after the date
	All dates must have numerical entries for mn/day/yr
		i.e. !09/22/64!
	If you only have month or year, then the day is 00
		i.e. !09/00/64! or !00/00/64!

5.  Where possible, abbreviate entries.

	For example, if a soldier were in the hospital for 6 consecutive
		months with the same illness, do not use 6 entries under 
		hospital, instead use one entry with the dates from and to

6.  Searchable dates are those used in the following fields:
(Enlistment date is automatically searchable and does not need !)

birth place and date
hospital
prison
wia
kia
deserted
captured
dod
dow
discharge
paroled
death
promotions
transfers and other service

So, dates in the Muster Sheet field do not need ! and are not searchable.

7.  Use commas and periods in fields where necessary, esp. the following:

personal information
prewar life
postwar life
notes
physical description
conscript

8.  Promotion and transfers:  use from to,
	i.e. From Co. B 77th Pa. to Co. D 107th Pa. !date!
