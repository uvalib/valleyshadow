AN ACT to authorize the formation of volunteer companies for local defense.

  The Congress of the Confederate States of America do enact, That for
  the purpose of local defense in any portion of the Confederate States,
  any number of persons not liable to military duty, may associate
  themselves as a military company, elect their own officers and establish
  rules and regulations for their own government, and shall be considered
  as belonging to the Provisional Army of the Confederate States, serving
  without pay or allowances, and entitled, when captured by the enemy,
  to all the privileges of prisoners of war: Provided, That such company
  shall, as soon as practicable, transmit their muster-roll, or a list of the
  names of the officers and privates thereof, to the Governor of the State,
  the commanding general of the department, or any brigadier general in
  the State or Confederate service, to be forwarded to the Secretary of
  War; but the President or the commander of the military district may,
  at any time, disband such companies: Provided, That in the States and
  districts in which the act entitled "An act to further provide for the
  public defense," approved April the sixteenth, eighteen hundred and
  sixty-two, and the acts amendatory thereof, have been suspended,
  persons of any age, resident within such States or districts, may
  volunteer and form part of such companies so long as such suspension
  shall continue: Provided, That no person shall become a member of said
  company until he shall have first

  taken the oath of allegiance to the Confederate States of America in
  writing, a copy of which shall be filed with the muster-roll of said
  company as above prescribed.

  Approved October 13, 1862.

HDQRS. POST,
  Staunton, June 15, 1864--2.30 p. m.
  MAJ.: Your note of the 13th reached me yesterday by return courier.
  It states "McNeill and Gilmor are in the Valley below." Maj. Gilmor
  has just showed me your note of the 12th requesting

  PAGE 152-70   OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. XLIX.
  [Series I. Vol. 37. Part I, Correspondence. Serial No. 70.]

  
  him to join the major-general commanding with all his force, and
  directing him to order similar force likewise-McNeill and Mosby, I
  suppose. If the intention of yours of the 13th to me was to supersede
  that of the 12th to Gilmor, I would respectfully call attention to the fact
  that there is now only McNeill's sixty men between me and the
  Potomac, and he will, under Maj. Gilmor's order, be removed. If
  consistent with the exigencies of the case, would it not be well to permit
  Gilmor and McNeill to remain below? If both, or either, are kept there,
  I ask that they be instructed to keep me advised of the enemy's movements,
  and especially of all that threatens this point. I will have the
  telegraph ready for work to-morrow.

  There are 200 wounded Yankees here at the hospital and forty nurses.
  I had no guard when I got here and did not know when the enemy might
  get back; so I went to work and paroled the whole of them. I sent a
  copy of the parole. It is the same that they gave our hospital men,
  except the clause regarding escape, which I added because I had no
  guard, and because I did not know whether the paroles were binding
  anyhow. Is the parole they gave our men binding now? Is mine binding
  to them unless we keep the men and deliver them at a point of
  exchange? Is there not some special agreement between the two
  Governments about hospital paroles? Cannot these fellows be returned
  to their own lines as fast as convalescent by mutual consent of Gen.'s
  Breckinridge and Hunter, instead of sending them to Richmond? I have
  not yet deliver to the surgeon in charge of them a copy of the parole or
  the list.

  Respectfully, your obedient servant,

  E. G. LEE,
  Col., Cmdg. Post.

  Maj. J. STODDARD JOHNSTON,
  Assistant Adjutant-Gen.

  [Inclosure.]

  STAUNTON, VA., June 12, 1864.
  We, the undersigned, do solemnly swear that we will not bear arms
  against the Government of the Confederate States, or in any way aid or
  assist the enemies of the Confederate States, or attempt to escape from
  the custody of the same, until regularly exchanged as prisoners of war.
