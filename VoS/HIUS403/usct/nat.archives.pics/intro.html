<p>The newspaper transcription index is organized by county and then by
topic. Over a thousand articles have been transcribed and indexed.  Some
readers may use the index to find articles on major events; others may
choose to follow the everyday activities of local people and groups.

<p>At the bottom of each list or page there are links to the 
index pages and to the corresponding topic in the other county's
 index.  We hope that users will toggle back and forth on any
topic from one county to the other.
<p>You can also browse the newspaper articles by month and year.
These files are organized by newspaper.

<p><h4>Please be aware that the language in these newspapers is often
highly offensive.  It is important to note that this highly
offensive language does not represent the views of the <i>Valley</i>
project.  Please read this language not as
statements of fact, but in the context of mid-nineteenth-century
politics and society.</h4>

<p><b>Printing Guidelines:</b> To print a transcription, we
suggest that you select only the text in the article you wish to print.  
Otherwise, Netscape will print the whole file, which contains a month of 
transcriptions and can be very long.
