Included in the Franklin County Military Dossiers are the USCT military 
records we compiled during the months of
September through November 1997 at the National
Archives in Washington, D.C. While the majority of the information 
collected in this database is
related to the men's war experience, we have also included information
about their post-war lives. This information was found in the men's
pension reports, many of which we have digitized and made available on
this site.    <P>
The members of the group spent many
hours researching each member of the USCT from Franklin County. The USCT
were unique in that they did not serve in county-based regiments. Instead,
each USCT unit included men from a wide array of states and counties.
Franklin men served in at least 21 separate regiments. Using the 1890
U.S. Special Census for Veterans for Franklin County and the Lebanon
Cemetary records (Chambersburg, Pennsylvania), we compiled a list of over 130
Franklin men who served in the USCT regiments. There is a strong 
possibility that there are more men from Franklin County who served in
the USCT.
<P>
While we were working on this site, the National Archives was microfilming 
all of the USCT records.
This presented a special challenge for our research. As a result, some of
the records are more complete than others. We would like to thank the 
archivists at the National Archives for their patience and 
help.
