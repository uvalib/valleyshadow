When black men enlisted in the USCT, the Union did not
organize their regiments by location. Due to this practice, enlisted
men from Franklin County served in a number of regiments. They
experienced the Civil War all over the country. Below is a map of 
a selection of the battles in which Franklin men fought. Information 
about these battles as well as the regiment histories were compiled from "The 
Official Records of the War of the Rebellion."
