Jacob Winters is buried in Lebanon Cemetary in Chambersburg, Pa.  His
grave marker reads:<p>
<center><h4><a href="winters.html">Jacob Winters</a><br>Co. D. 22nd Regt. Col. Inf. (GAR)<br>Jan.
4, 1915</h4></center><p>
Winters is joined in <a href="lebanon.html">Lebanon Cemetary</a> by other black men who fought
for the Union against the Confederacy.  Three men, James Krunkleton, William H. Little,
and Corporal Jno. Plowden, for example, fought in
the legendary 54th Massachusetts Infantry.  In all, approximately
forty African-American men in Lebanon Cemetary have G.A.R. headstones,
most of them indicate their regiments.<p>
In May 1863 the War Department authorized the formation of the United
States Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.).  Most of the U.S.C.T. units were
infantry, though a few were organized in cavalry, engineer, and light
and heavy artillery.  Most state African-American units, such as the
Corps d'Afrique, became part of the U.S.C.T. and were redesignated,
with the exception of a few state units from Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Louisiana.  Most of the U.S.C.T.'s officers were
white; only about 100 black officers were appointed, most of them in
General Benjamin Butler's Department of Louisiana.<p>
The project plans to locate the Compiled Military Service Records of all African-Americans from Franklin Co.
who served in the Civil War.  This information will come available on
the second CD.  Most of these soldiers enlisted later in the war.
