Approximately 180,000 black men served in the Union Army. The United 
States Colored Troops suffered over 68,000 casualties and nearly 37,000 
black men gave their lives to the Union cause. The United 
States Colored Troops (USCT) of Franklin County performed two very important 
functions. First, these men helped ensure a Union victory. Their 
enlistment came at a crucial point in the war. Tens of thousands of 
men had died, yet the outcome of the war was still very much unsettled. 
Second, they helped debunk numerous myths about the black race, 
proving to the world that the black man was a capable soldier. In their 
struggle to do so, however, the black man was forced to overcome many 
obstacles.

According to recent studies including Joseph Glatthaar's <I>Forged in 
Battle: The Civil War Alliance of Black Soldiers and White Officers</i>, 
racial prejudice played a significant role in the making of policy within 
the USCT. Obvious examples of discrimination include the fact that the 
army segregated regiment by race and did not allow blacks to become 
commissioned officers. The USCT received sub-standard medical 
care and equipment in comparison to white regiments. In addition, the Union 
Army delegated non-combat labor duty to members of the USCT on a regular 
basis. The image below shows black troops re-interring bodies 
following the battle of Cold Harbor.

Black soldiers were also discriminated against in that they received 
lower wages than white soldiers. Between July 1862 and June 1864, black 
soldiers were paid considerably less than white soldiers. In retaliation, 
in September 1863, Corporal James Henry Gooding of the 54th Massachusetts 
(Colored) Infantry asked President Lincoln in a letter, "Are we 
soldiers or are we labourers? We have done a soldier's duty. Why can't we 
have a soldier's pay?" Lincoln responded that preferential 
treatment for whites was necessary to ease the social impact of 
the employment of blacks. In less than a year, however, Congress 
authorized equal pay for all soldiers.

Racial tension between the white and black troops constituted a 
significant problem within the Union Army. According to Glatthaar, white 
troops felt great apprehension about fighting beside soldiers they 
considered inherently inferior. One manifestation of racial 
prejudice resulted in the purposeful death of a private of the 45th U.S. 
Colored Infantry by a group of white officers. Although the mistreatment 
of black soldiers continued, many white soldiers eventually came to accept the 
presence of blacks in the military. Their intentions in doing so, 
however, were not always noble. In 1862, Charles 
Graham Halpine, an Irishman on the staff of General David Hunter at 
Hilton Head, contributed "Sambo's Right to Be Kilt" to the <i>New York 
Herald</i>. The song expressed the popular opinion among white soldiers 
that they would kindly allow the black man to take their place on the 
battlefield if only to save their own lives.

The mistreatment of blacks by Union men also occurred at home in Franklin 
County. According to a <i>Valley Spirit</i> article, on a Saturday
afternoon in June 1861, "a number of soldiers, from different companies, 
collected in that disreputable quarter of our town, known as Wolfstown, 
and for some cause, that we have not been able to clearly ascertain, made 
an attack upon a house occupied by a colored man named Frank Jones." The 
man was shot at least five times, "when a number of bayonet and sword
wounds were inflicted upon him." In August, a white soldier named Goerge 
Hackerdon was tried in the murder of Frank Jones and found not guilty. Four 
years later, in a <i>Franklin Repository</I> article, it was reported 
that Lieut. Morgan S. Bryan, convicted in the death of Frank Jones, was 
pardoned by Governor Curtin.

Confederate soldiers constituted an even bigger threat to the black men 
of the USCT. Southern whites resented the fact that black troops, many of 
whom were ex-slaves, joined the war effort in support of the Union. In 
<i>The Sable Arm: Negro Troops in the Union Army, 1861-1865</I>
<P> Despite 
the hardships the colored troops faced because of racial 
discrimination, they possesed a strong will to fight for the Union cause. 
A black sergeant proclaimed, "If I fall in the battle anticipated 
remember, I fall in defence of my race and my country." Another lieutenant 
told his troops prior to an advance, "Boys it may be slavery or death to 
some of you today." To this, a black soldier replied, "Lieutenant, I am 
ready to die for liberty." Minutes later, the soldier was shot dead 
by the enemy.
