<p>In March of 1862, without authorization from the War Department, Major 
General David Hunter declared all slaves in South Carolina, Georgia, and 
Florida free. He then called for the district commanders to send all 
capable blacks to headquarters for enlistment into the Union Army. Although 
the Militia Act of July 17, 1862 granted Lincoln the power to organize black 
men into the army, he cancelled Hunter's orders on the grounds that 
employing black men would alienate the border states and cause them to join the 
Confederacy.

<p>According to recent studies including Joseph Glatthaar's <i>Forged in 
Battle: The Civil War Alliance Between Black Soldiers and White 
Officers</i>, 
the Union held several reservations about enacting a plan for 
black enlistment. First, Northern whites feared that the act would be 
perceived as an act of desperation. By allowing blacks to serve in the 
military, Northern whites would be admitting to the world that they were 
not capable of winning the war by themselves. The white community also  
believed that black men lacked the skill and courage necessary to fight. 
And, although many of the blacks that would eventually serve in the Union 
Army had endured numerous hardships throughout their pre-war lives, whites 
doubted that the black man could survive the military experience. Thus, 
persistent racial prejudice in the North hindered black involvement in the war 
effort and, as a result, many people feared any notion of elevating 
the black men to the status of soldier.

<p>Government opposition to black troops gradually weakened as the Civil War 
continued. On August 25, 1862, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton authorized 
General Rufus Saxon to accept into service no more than 5,000 volunteers of 
African descent. Over a year later, in May 1863, the War Department 
formed the Bureau of Colored Troops to organize the recruitment and 
enlistment of blacks as well as the appointment of their white officers. 
Within a few months, the bureau had raised 30 black regiments. 
It is not a coincidence that the enlistment of black men began so late in the 
War. The government only seriously considered employing blacks after thousands 
of white men had died in combat. Black regiments therefore served to revitalize 
the weary Union forces. Below is an image of Northern recruitment poster.

Following the passage of the Conscription Act in March 1863, the 
<i>Cleveland Leader</i> stated, "Since Congress passed the conscription bill, 
opposition to the negro enlistment has subsided. 
The Negro as a ...soldier...was a monster. The Negro substitute is very 
acceptable." Thus, racial prejudice fueled both sides of the argument 
regarding the employment of blacks. On the one hand, the proposition to enlist 
black men was initially struck down because the white population feared 
that it would result in the equality of the races. On the other hand, the 
eventual acceptance of the black man as a soldier was only possible because 
whites considered the lives of black men to be expendable.

<p>Regardless of the white man's justification for the enlistment 
of colored troops, black men,  North and South, rejoiced in light of 
this personal victory. Fighting against the slave-owning South was a 
significant opportunity for former slaves and free men alike to prove their 
worth. According to an officer in the United States Colored Troops, "One of 
the greatest incentives 
in fitting [the black man] for a soldier was the inspiration of his being 
an American citizen, and being recognized as a soldier in the same uniform that
white soldiers wear, with the menial service of serfdom forever buried. 
He felt himself lifted to a higher plane, worthy to be the Country's defender."
