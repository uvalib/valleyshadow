<h3><b>Poems</b></h3>
<P>
"The Colored Soldiers" by Paul Lawrence Dunbar (1872-1906)
<P>
And their deeds shall find a record,
<BR>In the registry of Fame;
<BR>For their blood has cleansed completely
<BR>Every blot of slavery's shame.
<BR>So all honor and all glory
<BR>To these noble Sons of Ham--
<BR>To the gallant colored soldiers,
<BR>Who fought for Uncle Sam!
<P>
"The Unsung Heroes" by Paul Lawrence Dunbar (1872-1906)
<P>
A song for the unsung heroes who stood the awful test,
<BR>When the humblest host that the land could boast
<BR>went forth to meet the best;
<BR>A song for the unsung heroes who fell on the bloody sod,
<BR>Who fought their way from night to day and struggled up
<BR>to God.
