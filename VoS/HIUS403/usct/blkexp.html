Approximately 180,000 black men served in the Union Army. The United 
States Colored Troops suffered over 68,000 casualties and nearly 37,000 
black men gave their lives to the Union cause.<a 
href=foot.html><sup>1</sup></a> The USCT of Franklin 
County performed two very important functions. First, these men helped 
ensure a Union victory. Their enlistment came at a crucial point in the 
war. Tens of thousands of men had died, yet the outcome of the war was 
still very much unsettled. Second, they helped debunk numerous myths 
about the black race, proving to the world that the black man was a 
capable soldier. In his struggle to do so, however, the black man was 
forced to overcome many obstacles.

According to recent studies including Joseph Glatthaar's <I>Forged in 
Battle: The Civil War Alliance of Black Soldiers and White Officers</i>, 
racial prejudice played a significant role in the making of policy within 
the USCT. Obvious examples of discrimination include the fact that the 
army segregated regiment by race and did not allow blacks to become 
commissioned officers. The USCT received sub-standard medical 
care and equipment in comparison to white regiments. The black men of the 
USCT were also discriminated against in that the Union Army punished 
black troops more frequently than whites. In addition, the Union Army 
delegated non-combat labor duty to members of the USCT on a regular 
basis. The image below shows black troops re-interring bodies 
following the battle of Cold Harbor.

Black soldiers were also discriminated against in that they received 
lower wages than white soldiers. Between July 1862 and June 1864, black 
soldiers were paid considerably less than white soldiers. In retaliation, 
in September 1863, Corporal James Henry Gooding of the 54th Massachusetts 
(Colored) Infantry asked President Lincoln in a letter, "Are we 
soldiers or are we labourers? We have done a soldier's duty. Why can't we 
have a soldier's pay?"<a href=foot.html><sup>2</sup></a> Lincoln 
responded that preferential 
treatment for whites was necessary to ease the social impact of 
the employment of blacks. In less than a year, however, Congress 
authorized equal pay for all soldiers.

The black men of the USCT were also discriminated against in that the
Union Army punished black troops more frequently than whites. While
colored troops consituted only ten percent of the Union forces, eighty
percent of all Union soldiers executed for mutiny were black.<A

Racial prejudice determined not only the manner in which the Unoin 
Army as a whole treated blacks, but also how individual white soldiers 
treated them. Racial tension between the white and black troops 
constituted a significant problem within the Union Army. According to Glatthaar, white 
troops felt great apprehension about fighting beside soldiers they 
considered inherently inferior. One manifestation of racial 
prejudice resulted in the purposeful death of a private of the 45th U.S. 
Colored Infantry by a group of white officers.<a 
href=foot.html><sup>4</sup></a> Although the mistreatment 
of black soldiers continued, many white soldiers eventually came to accept the 
presence of blacks in the military. Their intentions in doing so, 
however, were not always noble. In 1862, Charles Graham Halpine, an 
Irishman on the staff of General David Hunter at 
Hilton Head, contributed "Sambo's Right to Be Kilt" to the <i>New York 
Herald</i>.<a href=foot.html><sup>5</sup></a> The song expressed the popular 
opinion among white soldiers 
that they would kindly allow the black man to take their place on the 
battlefield if only to save their own lives.

The mistreatment of blacks by Union soldiers also occurred at home in 
Franklin County. According to a <i>Valley Spirit</i> article, on a Saturday
afternoon in June 1861, "a number of soldiers, from different companies, 
collected in that disreputable quarter of our town, known as Wolfstown, 
and for some cause, that we have not been able to clearly ascertain, made 
an attack upon a house occupied by a colored man named Frank Jones." The 
man was shot at least five times, "when a number of bayonet and sword
wounds were inflicted upon him."<a href=foot.html><sup>6</sup></a> In 
August, a white soldier named Goerge 
Hackerdon was tried in the murder of Frank Jones and found not guilty. Four 
years later, in a <i>Franklin Repository</I> article, it was reported 
that Lieut. Morgan S. Bryan, convicted in the death of Frank Jones, was 
pardoned by Governor Curtin.

The Confederate Army constituted an even greater threat to the men of the 
USCT. In <i>The Sable Arm: Negro Troops in the Union Army, 
1861-1865</i>, Dudley Taylor Corning attests to the fact that Confederate 
soldiers resented the black man's willingness to support the Union 
cause. As a result, the Confederate Army committed numerous atrocities 
against the regiments of the USCT. One such occurrence took place during 
General Nathan Bedford Forrest's capture of Fort Pillow, Tennessee. 
According to Forrest's calculations, the Union forces consisted of "about 
500 negroes and 200 white soldiers." Of these 700 men, Forrest estimated 
that "upward of 500 [were] killed."<a href=foot.html><sup>7</sup></a> 
According to an account in the 
<i>Franklin Repository</I>, "All around were cries of "No quarter, no 
quarter!" "kill the--negroes!" "shoot them down!"<a 
href=foot.html><sup>8</sup></a> 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, officer of the 1st South Carolina Infantry, 
acknowledged the sacrifices of the USCT in <I>Army Life in a Black 
Regiment</I>: "No doubt there were reasons why this particular war was an 
especially favorable test of the colored soldiers. They had more to fight 
for than whites. Besides the flag and the Union, they had home and wife 
and child. They fought with ropes around their necks, and when orders 
were issued that the officers of the colored troops should be put to 
death on capture, they took a grim satisfaction. It helped their esprit 
de corps immensely. With us, at least, there was to be no 
play-soldier."<a href=foot.html><sup>9</sup></a> Below is an image of the

Despite the discrimination colored troops were forced to 
endure throughout the war, they nonetheless fought valiently and in so 
doing proved to the nation that they were capable soldiers. Most notably, 
the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry demonstrated during their 
assault on Fort Wagner that the black man would not back down--that 
he would stand his ground no matter the consequences. Forty percent of 
the regiment's men were casualties at Fort Wagner. Of the six Franklin men 
who served in the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry, two were 
wounded in action and a third was found dead in Charleston, cause 
unknown. But the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry was not the only 
successful black regiment. All over the country the black men of the USCT 
did their part to ensure Union victory. And, at the same time, they 
forced the whites to reevaluate their conceptions of the black race.
