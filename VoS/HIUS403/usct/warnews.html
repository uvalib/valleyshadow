The following articles were compiled from the <i>Franklin
Repository</I>, the <i>Valley Spirit</I>, and the <i>New York Times</i>. 
The former two sources provide us with local views regarding blacks and 
their involvement in the war. The <i>Franklin Repository</I>, the 
county's republican newspaper, is generally accepting of the black 
community's role in the war. Most of the articles from the <i>Franklin 
Repository</i> inform the reader of the atrocities committed against black 
soldiers by the Confederate Army. On the other hand, many of the articles 
collected from the 
<i>Valley Spirit</I>, Franklin County's democratic newspaper, suggest a 
resentment toward blacks and the attention being paid them by the national 
government.
<P> 
Please note that the language in these newspapers is often highly offensive. 
This highly offensive language does not represent the views of this 
site's creators. We have decided to present the
newspapers in their original form and content, not edit out language or 
views we don't agree with. This
language represents the widely held opinions of many 
mid-nineteenth-century Americans. Please read
this language not as statements of fact but in the context of 
mid-nineteenth-century politics and society.

Newspaper)</b></h3>

<LI><a href=news/FR7.15.63.HTML>Brief War Items, July 15, 1863</a>
<BR>Excerpt: The unanimous report of all those who were in the recent 
severe fight at Port Hudson, in regard to the negroes, is, that they
fought like devils. They have completely conquered the prejudice of the 
army against them.
<LI><a href=news/FR12.2.63.HTML>Rebel Atrocities, December 2, 1863</a>
<BR>Excerpt: There is one chapter of rebel atrocity in this war that 
remains to be written, and we hazard little in saying that when it shall be
truthfully portrayed, all other atrocities of the war will pale before 
it. We refer to their treatment of our negro troops. The rebel
leaders have steadily refused to recognize negro troops or their officers 
as entitled to the treatment of prisoners of war.
<LI><a href=news/FR12.30.63.HTML>Our Negro Troops, December 30, 1863</a>
<BR>Excerpt: The <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> of the 17th inst. solves the 
problem of negro prisoners by frankly admitting that they have been
murdered. Speaking of the government sending negro troops to the field it 
says: "Should they be sent to the field, and be put
in battle, <i>none will be taken prisoners--our troops understand what to do 
in such cases</i>. If any negroes have been captured
during the war we have not heard of them."
<LI><a href=news/FR4.20.64.HTML>Capture of Fort Pillow, April 20, 
1864</a>
<BR>The black soldiers, becoming demoralized, rushed to the rear, their 
white officers having thrown down their arms. Both white
and black were bayonetted, shot or sabred, and even dead bodies were 
horribly mutilated.
<LI><a href=news/FR4.27.64.HTML>Rebel Savagery, April 27, 1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: We have already given a brief account of the inhuman 
brutality practised by the rebels upon the troops of Fort Pillow after it
had been surrendered; but the details increase in horror as they are 
developed. The negro troops fought most gallantly until
overpowered; but they were outnumbered immensely and were overcome.
<LI><a href=news/FR5.11.64.HTML>Rebel Atrocities, May 11, 1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: Some of the Rebels stood upon the top of the hill, or a 
short distance down its
side, and called to our soldiers to come up to them, and as they 
approached shot them down in cold blood, if their guns or
pistols missed fire forcing them to stand there until they were again 
prepared to fire. All around were cries of "No quarter, no
quarter!" "kill the--negroes!" "shoot them down!" All who asked for mercy 
were answered by the most cruel taunts and
sneers.
<LI><a href=news/FR2.15.65.HTML>Pardoned, February 15, 1865</a>
<BR>Excerpt: Lieut. Morgan S. Bryan, convicted in the Courts of this 
country for shooting Frank Jones, and sentenced to the Eastern
Penitentiary, has been pardoned by Gov. Curtin, and is now at his home 
in Pittsburg.

Newspaper)</B></h3>
<UL>
<LI><a href=news/VS1.27.64.HTML>The Negro and the War, January 27, 
1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: The effect of this proclamation has simply been to free the
slaves from their masters, and while it provides no remedy for the evils 
of slavery, leaves them in filthy camps to die of
starvation and disease. Deadened as the sensibilities of the whole 
nation have become to scenes of suffering and distress, the
tales of horror which come up to us from the camps of freed negroes 
along the Mississippi cannot fail to enlist our
sympathies.
<LI><A href=news/VS3.2.64.HTML>Cool Rascality, March 2, 1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: On Thursday, whilst the freight train stopped at the Depot, 
some soldiers who were on the train bound for Chambersburg got
off and thrusting their hands into the pockets of a colored boy in the 
employ of Mr. Eskins at the Hotel, took his purse
containing all the money he had.
<LI><a href=news/VS3.2.64.2.HTML>The Nigger in Cars, March 2, 1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: The United States Senate--supposed to be the highest and most 
dignified body in the country--last week passed a resolution to
compel the street Railroad companies of Washington City to allow negroes 
to ride in their cars. This is eminently proper in
that locality. As niggers rule the roost at Washington it is no more than 
fair that they should ride in the cars. 
<LI><a href=news/VS6.15.64.HTML>A Race For Glory, June 15, 1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: Mr. William D. Kelley is indignant. He does not care much 
whether the Federal taxes are so imposed that Massachusetts gets
off nearly scot free whilst Pennsylvania pays twice as much as she ought; 
but when it becomes a question of who "drew the
first blood," a negro or a Yankee, all his passions are aroused.

<LI><a href=news/NYT3.7.64.HTML>The Ovation to the Black Man, March 7, 
1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: There has been no more striking manifestation of the 
marvelous times that
are upon us than the scene in our streets at the departure of the first
of our colored regiments. Had any man predicted it last year he would
have been thought a fool,
even by the wisest and most discerning. History
abounds with strange contrasts. It always has been an ever-shifting
melo-drama. But never, in this land at least, has it presented a
transition so extreme and yet so speedy as what our eyes have just 
beheld.
