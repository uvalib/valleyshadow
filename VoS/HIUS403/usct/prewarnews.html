<P>
The following articles pertain to life in Franklin County before the war and 
during the recruitment of black men. They were compiled from the 
<i>Franklin Repository</I> and the <i>Valley Spirit</I>. The <i>Franklin
Repository</I>, the county's republican newspaper, is generally 
accepting of the black population in Franklin County as well as their 
employment in the Union Army. On the other hand, the articles collected from 
the <i>Valley Spirit</I>, Franklin County's democratic newspaper, portray the 
blacks as a class of worthless drunks whose participation in the war would 
only result in defeat.
<P>
Please note that the language in these newspapers is often highly 
offensive. This highly
offensive language does not represent the views of this web site's 
creators. We have decided to 
present the newspapers in their original form and content, not edit out 
language or views we don't agree with. This
language represents the widely held opinions of many 
mid-nineteenth-century Americans. Please read
this language not as statements of fact but in the context of 
mid-nineteenth-century politics and
society.

<LI><a href=news/FR8.5.63.HTML>Judge Kelly on the Negro Troops, 
August 5, 1863</a><BR>Excerpt: Citizens of African descent, it is to 
you I would speak. Are you content to spend your lives as boot blacks, barbers,
waiters and in other pursuits little if any better than servile or 
menial, when the profession of arms--the terrible but glorious
work of the war--invites you to acknowledged manhood, freedom and honor.
<LI><a href=news/FR11.25.63.HTML>Hon. Joseph Holt on Employing Slaves as 
Soldiers, November 25, 1863</a><BR>
Excerpts: The tenacious and brilliant valor 
displayed by troops of this race at Port Hudson, Milliken's Bend and
Fort Wagner, has sufficiently demonstrated to the President and the 
country the character of service of which they are capable.
In the interpretation given to the enrollment act, free persons of 
African descent are treated as "citizens of the United States,"
in the sense of the law, and are everywhere being drafted into the 
military service.

<LI><a href=news/VS3.30.59.HTML> How Our Negroes Live, March 30, 
1859</a>
<BR>Excerpt: Some twelve years ago we indited the following 
description of how our negroes then lived. It would appear by the columns of
one of our local contemporaries that their morals and their manners of 
living have not much improved since that day. So long
as miserable huts, of the character we have described are erected, 
"filty, thieving, whisky drinking negroes" will seek our
community to inhabit them.
<LI><a href=news/VS4.20.59.HTML>A Good Idea, April 20, 1859</a>
<BR>Excerpt: It is the intention, we understand, in future, to devote our 
entire term of Court for the special purpose of trying the filthy cases
among the colored population of our country. 
<LI><a href=news/VS6.5.61.HTML>A Horribble Occurence, June 5, 1861</a>
<BR>Excerpt: On Saturday afternoon a number of soldiers, from different 
companies, collected in that disreputable quarter of our town,
known as Wolfstown, and for some cause, that we have not been able to 
clearly ascertain, made an attack upon a house
occupied by a colored man named Frank Jones. 
<LI><a href=news/VS6.15.61.HTML>Nigger 
Worshipping Papers, June 15, 1861</a>
<BR>Excerpt: Some of the nigger worshipping papers are calling upon the 
Administration to put arms in the hands of the slaves and let them
butcher their masters and their families. None but cowardly Abolitionists 
would entertain such a thought as that.
<LI><a 
href=news/VS8.21.61.HTML>Court Proceedings</a><BR>
Excerpt: Commonwealth vs George Hackerdorn--Murder. Defendant was charged 
with being one of the parties who participated in the
riotous affray, which resulted in the murder of Frank Jones, on the 
evening of the first of June last, on "Federal Hill," near
this town. 
<LI> <a href=news/VS1.29.62.HTML>Deserters Caught, January 28, 1862 </a>
<BR>Excerpt: A brace of soldiers were arrested, on Thursday night, by the 
Night Police, for disorderly conduct at a negro house, in the
faubourg de Wolfstown, and lodged in jail.
<LI><a href=news/VS5.21.62.HTML>Emancipation and its Consequences, May 
21, 1862</a><BR>
Excerpt: In the first place we take it for granted that few Northern men, 
even among the most radical of the negro worshippers, would
be so bold as to propose the absorption of this inferior and servile race 
into Northern society--making them the equals of the
white men--investing them with citizenship--rendering them eligible to 
office--mingling with them upon a perfect social and
political equality. The very idea is abhorrent to the instincts of every 
white man. It would degrade the whites without elevating
the blacks. The barrier separating the two races is impassable--They must 
live together as superior and inferior, as masters and
servants or not at all.
<LI><a href=news/VS1.10.63.HTML>Rail at Slavery, January 10, 1863</a><BR>
Excperpt: We want those men who rail at slavery to show us something better 
for the white and black: to give us some general system;
for the white man and the negro can't stand on the same level. Laws can't 
make them do so; and in a system involving so
much of human interest, so much of happiness and misery, we deem it wild, 
extravagant and reckless to pull down before we
know how to build up.
<LI><a href=news/VS1.21.63.HTML>Black and White, January 21, 
1863</a><BR>
Excerpt: There is a marked difference between the black and white man. The 
immortal Thomas Jefferson made seventeen points of
difference.
<LI><a href=news/VS2.11.63.HTML>The Negro Soldier Bill, February 11, 1863</a>
<BR>Excerpt: In the National House of Representatives on Friday a week, 
the negro soldier bill, introduced by Mr. Stevens, was under
discussion. 
<LI><a href=news/VS3.18.63.HTML>Boston Papers, March 18, 1863</a><BR>
We learn from the Boston papers, that the 'Americans of African descent' 
in that vicinity are not satisfied with the proposition
to form them into separate military organizations under white officers. 
They claim that it makes to great a distinction in point
of equality, which they will not submit to. 
<LI><a href=news/VS3.25.63.HTML>Negro Recruits, March 25, 1863</a><BR>
Excerpt: A negro recruiting officer visited this place last week and of 
course was quite a "lion" among the "free Americans of African
descent;" but, as far as we know, he did not obtain a single recruit.
<LI><a href=news/VS4.29.63.HTML>Negro Recruits, April 29, 1863</a><BR>
Excerpt: Some forty or fifty black recruits for the Massachusetts 
Regiments, left this for Boston, on monday morning last. We are only
too glad to get rid of these worthless negroes; but we scarcely like the 
idea of their being credited to Massachusetts, and thus
filling up her quota under the last draft, while Pennsylvania was 
compelled to fill her quota, under the same draft, with free
white male citizens.
<LI><a href=news/VS6.29.64.HTML>Colored Substitutes, June 29, 1864</a>
<BR>Excerpt: It is said that Provost Marshal General Fry has issued 
instructions to the various Provost Marshals that, under existing laws,
they can receive or accept colored substitutes for white persons. The 
decision will naturally cause a great reduction of the rates
demanded for white substitutes.
