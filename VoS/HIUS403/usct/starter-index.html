<h3>USCT Team Starter Index</h3></center>

The USCT Project will trace the history of the Franklin County men who 
fought in these units.  The USCT were not organized by county.  So, 
Franklin men fought in a wide number of units.  Some fought, for example, 
in the 54th Massachusetts, made famous for its glorious charge on Fort 
Wagner and for the death of its Colonel, Robert H. Shaw.  Others fought 
in USCT designated units.  Reconstructing the histories of these Franklin 
people will require a good deal of historical detective work.
<p>
The first order of business for this team will be to locate the units in 
which these men fought and then going to National Archives to retreive 
their Compiled Service Records for entry into a database.  The team will 
have a list of all Franklin black and mulatto men of military age and a 
web site to check their unit designations.  After compliling the list of 
men who served and their units, the team will go to National Archives for 
the CSR.

The following index is a partial list of what has already been assembled 
by the Valley project team for the USCT.
