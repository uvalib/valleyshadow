<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>Augusta County is situated in Virginia's fertile Shenandoah Valley, approximately forty miles to the west of Charlottesville and ninety miles northwest of Richmond.  In the nineteenth century it was primarily 

a farming community, with Staunton, its only real city to speak of, at the center of commercial activity.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>For the residents of Augusta County in 1860, the Civil War was in no way an inevitable prospect.  Many Augustans were firm supporters of the federal union and argued strongly against secession.  In the 1860 pr

esidential election the county voted overwhelmingly for John Bell, of the Constitutional Union Party.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>However, by 1861 the mood in Augusta County had begun to change.  Desire to preserve the union did not disappear, but secessionist rhetoric across the South was working to steadily undermine Augustans' absolut

e dedication to it.  The Virginia Convention passed its ordinance for secession on April 17th, 1861, and Augusta County passed the ordinance shortly thereafter--3130 to 10.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>When Augusta County residents joined the Confederacy, they shed their doubts about the righteousness of the Southern Cause.  In one sense they had no choice--to not support it would be to effectively turn thei

r backs on Augusta men fighting in the war.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>Attempting to examine support for the war effort becomes difficult for precisely this reason.  For example, when people on the home front donated blankets to the Confederate Army, they did so for any number of

 reasons--they could have done it with the independence of the Confederate States of America in mind, or possibly because they hoped the blankets would keep Augusta soldiers warm and better their chances of coming home alive. 
<br> 
<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>To be sure Augustans had complex motivations for their actions during the war, but the letters, diaries, and newspaper articles they left behind tell us that many of them were absolutely dedicated to the South

's cause.  Though our examination of Augusta sources has not been complete, we have found substantial evidence of strong support in the county until the end of the war, in contrast to the conclusion on the part of some prominent Civil War historians that 

popular support on the Southern home front was in decline after 1863.  (For more information on the historiography of the Southern home front, see Gary Gallagher's "The Confederate War")
