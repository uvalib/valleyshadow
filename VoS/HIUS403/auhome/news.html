<img src="images/block.gif" width=30 height=5>Staunton had two newspapers during the American Civil War, the Spectator 
and the Vindicator, though neither ran through the entire war.  After an
absence during the first years of the war, the Vindicator resumed publication 
in February 20, 1863.  The Spectator's presses ran through most of the war, 
but the paper's equipment was demolished during the Union troops' occupation 
of Staunton (June 6-10, 1864).  While both newspapers were decidedly skewed
to the Confederate cause, the Spectator's language is certainly more caloric.
<p>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=30 height=5>The wartime news media of the 1860s was not an objective source of information 
in either the North or the South.  For this reason, it would be unwise to rely 
solely on newspapers to construct an accurate picture of Civil War events.
However, the biased content of the Spectator and Vidicator articles makes them 
much more valuable in a sense to students of social history than an objective 
account would be. 
<p> 
<img src="images/block.gif" width=30 height=5>The articles reproduced here provide a partial view of the issues and events 
Augusta residents had to contend with during the Civil War.  And while we can 
assume that not all Augustans shared the opinions expressed in the Spectator and 
the Vindicator, these two papers were vital in both shaping and reporting on public 
opinion in the county.
