<img src="images/block.gif" height=1 width=30>The Battle of Piedmont was fought on June 5, 1864.  The battle is named after a little village north of Waynesboro and southwest of Port Republic.  It was significant in that it was the battle for control of S
taunton, an important Confederate storehouse and railroad hub.  The Confederate forces, under William E. "Grumble" Jones were badly outnumbered (by 30% to up to over 100%, depending on the source) by the United States forces under David Hunter.  Short on 
men, Jones called in the Home Guard units, including Augusta County's 3rd 
Battalion Valley Reserves, to protect Staunton.  (The 3rd Battalion at 
this point was a six-week old assemblage of 17 and 18 year-old boys and 
45-50 year-old farmers.)  The battle front shifted 
back and forth but ultimately ended in a rout of the Confederates, with 
General 
Jones dead and General Hunter prepa ring to move on Staunton.
