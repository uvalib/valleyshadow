November 19,

A long hiatus again, so many things of absorbing interest. An item by the way from the Central
Presbyterian. It is estimated that 142,000 Confederate soldiers
have been converted as convicts since the war began. If human testimony can establish any thing it
establishes this, that there has been a most wonderful work of grace in our army. How could a
broader seal have been set upon the righteousness of our cause? The Lord has looked upon our
affliction & our pain, & forgiven our sins, to a certain extent at least. I have gradually arrived at the
firm persuasion that multitudes of our dying soldiers have been met by redeeming grace. 
<p>
Mrs. Gilbert one of our neighbors died a few months since, & when dying, she exclaimed with
delight "O there's Jimmy & Johnny." They had come for their departing mother. They were two of
our young soldiers who had died not very long before from wounds received in battle. No one knew
the state of their minds, but does not this circumstance support the hope that their pious mother's
prayers had been answered for them? A similar instance, Jimmy Holladay when dying exclaimed "O
there's father." These boys (the oldest was but just out of his teens) were excellent soldiers, went to the army at the first sound of the
trumpet, & had never taken a furlough. Their bodies were brought home & buried in one grave. We
all thought they deserved a monument & accordingly Ellen went around & soon collected about
$500 for the purpose. It cannot be obtained however till after the war. Men are drawn off so closely
that it is difficult to get a horse shod or a pair of shoes made or a stick of wood hauled. Then the
most common articles are many of them exceedingly rare. But then if we do have to sit in the dark
for nights except for an hour or so that the children are learning their lessons, & submit to multitudes
of privations far greater than that, we do it cheerfully as the price in part of our liberty.
