[On Thursday night, April 17, 1862, the report came that
Jackson was attacked that morning by thirty-five thousand men and
one hundred cannon, and was in full retreat toward Staunton. At
that time there were in Staunton clothing for ten thousand or
twelve thousand soldiers, ammunition, cannon and other arms,
besides the ordinary quartermaster and commissary stores. On the
19th, it being understood that General Jackson had ordered the
evacuation of Staunton, the convalescent patients at the hospital
and a portion of the military stores were sent by railroad to
Charlottesville. The money, etc., of the Staunton banks, the
records of the courts, etc., were also sent to Charlottesville.
At the same time, General Johnson's command, in his absence, fell
back from the Shenandoah mountain to the village of Westview, in
Augusta. It turned out, however, that Jackson had given no
orders for these movements, and a degree of confidence was
speedily restored. But by the 24th, some of the enemy had
appeared on North mountain, at Buffalo Gap, and also at Jennings'
Gap. On the 28th the enemy occupied Harrisonburg, "and helped
themselves to whatever they wanted." There were conflicting
reports as to the movements of Jackson and Ewell, but it was
evident that they had withdrawn from about Harrisonburg toward
tale Blue Ridge. On Saturday, May 3, the news came that Jackson
was crossing the Blue Ridge at Brown's Gap, leaving Ewell at
Swift Run Gap, and the way open for the enemy from Harrisonburg
to Staunton. Sunday, May 4, was a day full of rumors and
excitement. Among other reports, it was stated that 10,000 of the
enemy were advancing upon Johnson, at Westview, seven miles west
of Staunton. In the afternoon, however, several trains of railway
cars arrived from the east, crowded with soldiers. Pickets were
immediately posted on all the roads leading from town toward
Harrisonburg, and no one was allowed to go in that direction.
General Jackson and his staff arrived, on horseback, before
night, and it was soon found that the army had entered the Valley
again, through Rockfish Gap. Train after train arrived on Monday,
and a part of the command came on foot. Jackson's old brigade,
(known as "Stonewall") encamped two miles east of town. In the
evening the town was full of country people, who were permitted
to come in, but not to go out. On Tuesday, the 6th, we had news
that the Federal army at Harrisonburg, had started down the
Valley, in a hurry, the day before; we also learned that
Johnson's command had moved westward, but where to we did not
know.]
<hr>
<p><font size=+1>Wednesday night, May 7.</font>--Jackson's army 
started to-day, all
the First brigade (except the Fifth regiment), and the artillery,
passing through town, and marching towards Buffalo Gap. We are
entirely at a loss to know the destination of the command, but
presume it will soon turn and move down the Valley. The force
which has passed through since Sunday, numbers at least 10,000;
and this is exclusive of Johnson's brigade, which is from 4,000
to 5,000 strong.
<p>         
A portion of Ashby's cavalry, about 800, passed through town
in the afternoon, and camped on the Buffalo Gap road.
<hr>         

<p><font size=+1>Thursday night, May 8.</font>--General Johnson, 
surprised the
Federal scouts,--some two hundred cavalry,--on yesterday at
Ryan's, in the Pastures, killing from six to ten (variously
reported), and capturing two. They left their tents behind them.
* * Cannonading was heard to-day from early morning till 4
o'clock P. M., in the direction of the Shenandoah mountain. * *
<name><fn>J. D.</fn> <ln>Imboden</ln></name>
 has arrived with authority to raise companies for
guerilla service in western Virginia.
<hr>
<p>         
On <font size=+1>Friday morning, May 9th</font>, tidings came of the 
battle 
of McDowell, in Highland county. A number of the wounded in the battle
were brought in on the 10th, and also the corpses of eight or ten
of the slain. "These poor fellows were from Georgia, and their
comrades are sending the remains home."
<hr>
<p>
<font size=+1>Sunday night, May 11th</font>, Jackson's recent movements, 
which
were so incomprehensible to us, are now all explained. On last
Sunday we heard that 8,000 or 10,000 of the enemy were
threatening Johnson at Westview, only seven miles from Staunton.
This proved untrue, and we became incredulous as to reports of
any Federal troops advancing from the northwest. It turns out,
however, that the enemy in considerable force were advancing from
the direction of Romney, through Pendleton county, and no doubt
with the expectation of assailing Johnson by surprise and
overwhelming him. Jackson being advised of their movement,
countermarched as he did to reinforce Johnson, and coming upon
the enemy suddenly at McDowell, scattered them to the four winds.
* *"Yankee shinplasters," sutler's tickets, are very abundant in
Staunton.<hr>
<p>
<font size=+1>Friday night, May 16.</font>--Part of Jackson's army is at
Stribling's Springs. Some of the cavalry is in town.
   <p>      
The command moved down the Valley on Tuesday morning, the
20th.<hr>
      <p>   
<font size=+1>Tuesday morning, May 27.</font>--Yesterday morning we had 
news that
Jackson had routed the enemy under Banks, and chased them beyond
Winchester, taking 2,000 prisoners, and capturing all their
military stores.<hr>
 <p>
        
<font size=+1>Wednesday, May 28.</font>--A number of Staunton people have 
gone
to Winchester to buy goods, having heard that the town was well
supplied with many articles very scarce here. An order has come
for all the wagons in the county and adjoining counties to go
down to remove the captured stores.
    <p>     
Some four thousand prisoners, captured in the lower Valley,
were taken to Charlottesville, without passing through Staunton.
On the 29th there were about thirteen hundred sick and wounded
soldiers in the military hospital here.<hr>
       <p>  
<font size=+1>Monday night, June 2.</font>--Intelligence of the renewal 
of the
battle near Richmond on yesterday. Seventy-five thousand men on
each side engaged. * * The whole Federal army on the Richmond
side of the Chickahominy. Five hundred of our men drowned; some
say, however, that the drowned men were Federal soldiers. * * Two
hundred and seventy-five wagons expected to-morrow with the
stores captured at Martinsburg.<hr>
         <p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday, June 4.</font>--It seems to be true that Jackson has
retired far up toward Harrisonburg, before a large force of the
enemy. * * A large number of wagons, sent down the Valley to
bring up the capture stores, returned to-day, many of them empty.
The enemy pressed too closely for us to bring off all the
supplies. Upward of 3,000 Federal prisoners were at Mt. Crawford
to-day waiting till a bridge could be built across North river.
     <hr>    <p>
<font size=+1>Thursday, June 5.</font>--A day of rumors. We heard that the
Federal prisoners at North river (Mt. Crawford) had refused to
come across. Then it was said they were not at the river, but at
Harrisonburg. The first report was next repeated.
<name><ln>Imboden</ln></name> started
down about 2 o'clock with his three small cannon and two larger
pieces. Many laborers, white and black, went also to aid in
building the bridge. Late in the afternoon we heard that Shields
(Federal) was at or near Port Republic, that our men had burnt
the bridge across the Shenandoah at that point, and that Shields
would probably advance upon Staunton by way of Mt. Meridian. Next
it was circulated that Jackson had come through Harrisonburg and
gone towards Port Republic to attack Shields, and that large
reinforcements had come over to Jackson from Gordonsville.
       <hr>  <p>
<font size=+1>Friday, June 6</font>.--Jackson's army is at Port Republic. The
enemy under Fremont, are said to be near Harrisonburg, variously
estimated from 17,000 to 40,000. Shields is on the east side of
the Shenandoah with from 10,000 to 18,000 men.
       <hr>  <p>
On the <font size=+1>7th</font>, we heard "the sad news that Ashby had 
been killed
near Harrisonburg."
        <hr> <p>
On <font size=+1>Sunday evening, the 8th</font>, we had the first tidings 
of the
battle of Port Republic. A body of demoralized Confederate
cavalry dashed into town, proclaiming that our army was defeated.
They were put under arrest by <name>Major <fn>A. W.</fn>
<ln>Harman</ln></name>, acting
commandant of the post. Further news of the battle was received
on the 9th. Many soldiers of the two regiments from Augusta were
wounded, and one,(Doom), was killed.
    <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday night, June 9.</font>--A report this morning that 
Fremont was
routed yesterday and Jackson was assailing Shieids to-day. * *
The cannonading was heard in town till past 9 o'clock and then
ceased. About 10 o'clock a courier arrived with intelligence that
Jackson had ordered a retreat across the Blue Ridge. This news
flew through town and caused great depression of spirits. About
II o'clock another courier arrived with the report that Fremont
was hastily retreating towards Harrisonburg, blockading the road
behind him, and that Shields was in a fair way of being captured.
Of course there was universal rejoicing. In the afternoon,
however, it was ascertained that Fremont had not retreated, but
was still on the field with, (according to one report), 60,00
men. It was stated at the same time that Jackson had defeated
Shields this morning. Late in the evening several citizens and
one or two wounded soldiers arrived from the army. Shields was
driven back with a reported loss of 500 men and eight cannon,
while Fremont's army was drawn up on the west side of the
Shenandoah, unable to give any assistance. Jackson crossed the
river this morning to attack Shields and destroyed the bridge so
that Fremont could not follow. It is impossible for me to record
the incidents related, or to describe the scenes in town.
      <hr> <p>  
<font size=+1>Wednesday night, June 11.</font>--A rumor this morning that 
the Yan-
kees were coming this way, crossing North river at Mt. Crawford,
and another, that Fremont was retreating. From 9,000 to 11,000
reinforcements are on the way to Jackson.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Thursday night, June 12.</font>--A report this morning that 
Fremont
was marching up North river with a view this way. At the same
time it was said he had 40,000 men, while Jackson's effective
force amounted to only 15,000. During the day there were vague
rumors that the Federal army had passed through Harrisonburg,
going down the Valley. Late in the afternoon these last rumors
were confirmed by persons from Harrisonburg. The Yankees went off
last night in haste, burning their baggage and committing many
depredations upon the property of our people. They even destroyed
the gardens as far as they could. It is reported that their whole
number was 15,000--that is, Fremont's column.
         <p>
A letter from a Michigan girl to her brother, a soldier in
the Federal army, picked up down the Valley, begs the latter to
beware of poisoned springs.
        <hr> <p>
<font size=+1>Friday night, June 13.</font>--Many Federal soldiers are 
said to be
wandering in the woods, and some have been brought in every day
since the battle, (of Port Republic). Twenty of them surrendered
to one of our men.
       <hr>  <p>
<font size=+1>Saturday night, June 14.</font>--Six or seven railroad 
trains full
of soldiers arrived this evening from Richmond,--General
Whiting's command. * * For several days past it has been reported
that Andrew Johnson, the Union Governor of Tennessee, was
assassinated at Nashville. Also that Butler, the Federal general
in command at New Orleans, was killed.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Sunday, June 15.</font>--More troops arrived to-day by
railroad. Four regiments left town this morning, moving down the
Valley turnpike, viz,: the Eleventh Mississippi, Sixth North
Carolina, Fourth Alabama,and Fourth Texas. These regiments
constitute Whiting's brigade. Many of them are good-looking young
men although roughly clad, as usual. They all seem glad to get up
to this region.
   <hr><p>      
<font size=+1>Tuesday night, June 17.</font>--Many troops arrived 
yesterday and others
to-day. Whiting's brigade and others are encamped on the Valley
turnpike three miles from town. There are large encampments on
the hills to the left of the Middlebrook road, near the railroad,
and a small one on a hill north of town. A Texas brigade is here
to which the Staunton artillery is attached. ** Soldiers are
constantly going from house to house applying for something to
eat. They threaten us with famine, and to-night I was obliged to
refuse a request for supper, lodging, and breakfast for five who
applied in a batch. The commissary is well enough supplied, but
the men like something better than camp fare. The more
respectable soldiers fare worse than others, as they do not
forage to the same extent.
     <hr> <p>   
<font size=+1>Wednesday night, June 18</font> To the surprise of 
everybody, the
troops near town began to move off this morning in the direction
of Waynesborough. The Texas brigade (Hood's), started at 5
o'clock, A. M. Whiting's brigade retraced their steps through
town between 8 and 9 o'clock, and marched down the Waynesborough
road. Several artillery companies moved in the same direction.
Lawton's brigade, several detached regiments two or three
artillery and two or three cavalry companies were still about
town late in the afternoon; but at 6 o'clock two railroad trains,
full of soldiers, were getting ready to start. * * We hear that
Jackson's whole command was to-day moving to Waynesborough, to
cross the Blue Ridge.General Jackson was in town nearly all day,
but no one found out the purpose of the movements mentioned.
There was a large number of wagons in connection with the various
brigades. Many of our regiments are very much reduced in numbers.
One company of the Forty-fourth Virginia had, a few days ago,
five officers and six privates. * * A member of the Thirty-first
regiment, from northwest Virginia, came into our office this
evening, and meeting there an acquaintance from the same region,
told with great glee that in the Monday's fight near Port
Republic, he had shot the major of the First Virginia regiment in
the Federal service. He manifested a savage joyousness in
relating the fall by his hand of his fellow-townsman. * * Brown
sugar now sells by the barrel at 45 cents a pound; bacon 30
cents.
<hr><p>

         
<font size=+1>Thursday night, June 19.</font>--Everybody wondering to-day the
cause of Jackson's movement across the Blue Ridge. Some suggest
that he is going to Richmond, intending to fall upon McClellan's
rear.* *Several persons arrived to-day from Buckingham,
Upshur County, having come through without interruption. That
route has been closed for more than a year.
   <hr><p>      
<font size=+1>Saturday night, June 21.</font>--Still no intelligence from any
quarter.* * Twenty-five or thirty Yankee prisoners were in the
court-house yard this evening, having been brought up from
Harrisonburg. All but three wounded, and all but three Dutch.
      <hr><p>   
<font size=+1>Monday night June 23.</font>--We have scarcely had a rumor 
to-day.
Neither railroad trains nor mails from Richmond for several days.
Several thousand cavalry in the Valley. No other troops.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Tuesday, June 24.</font>--No railroad train yet, and all 
the news we
have had from the east for about a week has been brought by
persons traveling on horseback.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>On the 26th and 27th</font> we heard heavy cannonading, 
indicating a
conflict near Richmond.
<hr> <p>
<font size=+1>Friday, June 27.</font>--The battle was renewed this 
morning, and at
the last account, (by telegraph), was raging all along the line.
At least one hundred thousand men are arrayed on each side. What
multitudes are now passing into eternity, and how many more are
at this moment writhing in pain on the bloody ground!
    <hr><p>     
<font size=+1>Monday afternoon, June 30</font>--The battle near Richmond was
continued on yesterday. Cannonading distinctly heard in this
place. We have no details of the fight since Friday, but
telegraphic dispatches received to-day state that the Federal
army was retreating towards the James River. The reports are
encouraging for our side. Eight members of the Staunton Guard
wounded, besides the <name><fr>captain</pf> <ln>Burke</ln></name>. Three 
of the Staunton
Artillery reported killed.
       <hr><p>  
<font size=+1>Wednesday morning, July 2,</font>--Very heavy and rapid 
cannonading, was
kept up yesterday evening till long after dark. We heard it dis-
tinctly at our house. [The distance by air line is about a
hundred miles.] A telegraphic dispatch between 9 and 10
o'clock last night stated that the enemy was defeated again on
Monday, and that there was every prospect of capturing, or
routing, the whole army. But the newspaper accounts never come up
to the telegraphic reports. The battle has been raging for a
week. The railroad train came rolling through from Richmond
yesterday.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday morning, July 4.</font>-- * * I am certain of this 
only, that
the enemy has been repulsed, losing several thousand men in
killed, wounded and prisoners, and some cannon, etc.; and
that our loss is also heavy.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday morning, July 7.</font>--A great variety of reports 
from Richmond
since Friday, but no reliable intelligence. At one time we hear
that the greater part of the Federal army is surrounded and will
certainly be captured, [there was a rumor yesterday that 50,000
had been taken], and immediately afterwards it is asserted
that it has effected its escape. The latter I believe to be true.
McClellan has, no doubt, at last reached a position on James
river, where his transports and gunboats are, his columns a good
deal shattered, but not seriously reduced in numbers. We have
about five thousand prisoners, (besides the wounded left on the
field),including one Major-General and four or five Brigadiers.
No estimate has yet been made of the slain.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Tuesday, July 8</font>--Yesterday a poor woman who lives in 
town heard
that her husband, a soldier in the Fifty-second regiment, had
been killed. Her wailings, which were kept up for an hour or two,
were most distressing.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday, July 14.</font>--For several days we have had no 
intelligence
in regard to the war, from any quarter. Yesterday afternoon, how-
ever, a report came by railroad that the Yankees were in
considerable force at Culpeper Courthouse.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Thursday, July 17.</font>--The town as quiet all this week 
as if no war
were raging in the land. No railroad train since Monday, and no
news from any quarter. Brown sugar selling in Staunton at 75
cents a pound. No coffee here for sale, but selling elsewhere
at $2 a pound.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday, July 25</font>--A report this morning of skirmish 
at Luray
yesterday, in which we captured twenty-five men, ten wagons, etc.
* * To all appearance Richmond is more closely invested now than
before the late battles.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday, July 28</font>--The prisoners, etc., captured at 
Luray arrived
last evening. Jackson has been collecting his forces in the
neighborhood of Gordonsville. He is said to have about 15,000,
but receiving reinforcements. His ranks very much reduced by
sickness, "absence without leave," etc.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday Morning, August 1.</font>--This morning, while 
sitting in my
office, I heard a sound of lamentation. Upon going out I found
the noise proceeded from an upper room in the courthouse. A
negro woman informed me that it was a soldier crying because
he had to go to the war! He was brought in under the conscript
act. Poor fellow! Although I pitied him, there was something
very ludicrous in his wailings. Several men and women stood in
the street, some laughing and others denouncing the recruit.*
         <hr><p>
*The ancient Romans would not have considered the lamentations of
the young recruit at all ridiculous. Julius Caesar relates that
even the veterans of his Tenth Legion bewailed aloud and shed
tears when ordered to march against the Germans.
<hr><p>

<font size=+1>Saturday, August 9.</font>--According to report, Jackson's 
army is
pressing towards Culpeper Courthouse, the enemy falling back.    
Federal officers are said to be rigidly enforcing Pope's order in
the lower Valley, requiring all persons over fourteen years
of age to take the oath of allegiance to the United States, or
move outside the Federal lines, with their clothes only.
   <hr><p>   
News of the battle of Cedar Mountain was received on August 10th,
but, as usual, reliable details were not obtained till several
days afterwards. Several railroad trains with wounded soldiers
arrived on the 12th and 13th, among them fifty Federal soldiers.
A young man named <name><ln>Baylor</ln></name>, of this county, was
killed, and <name><fn>William
H.</fn> <ln>Gamble</ln></name> lost an arm.
      <hr><p>   
<font size=+1>Monday, August 11.</font>--Passing the court-house yard a 
while ago I
observed a number of persons standing before several "blue
jackets" stretched Upon the grass. These latter turned out to
be deserters from the Yankee army in the lower Valley. A dozen of
them arrived here last evening.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday August 13.</font>--Twenty-one deserters from the 
Federal army
came in to-day.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday, August 18.</font>--We hear that troops are pouring 
in to both
sides on the line of the Rapidan. * * There is a great stir among
persons liable to military service under the conscript act.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday, August 20.</font>--A number of Marylanders, who 
have come off
in consequence of the draft ordered by the Federal Government,
have arrived here. Quite a cavalcade of them came into town a
while ago. The railroad trains again used for army
transportation; we have had no regular mails for a week.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday, August 29.</font>--We hear of vigorous movements in 
northwest
Virginia by our rangers, etc. <name><ln>Imboden</ln></name> has 800 men 
now, and
Jenkins has more than 2,000. They have been joined by large
numbers in consequence of the Federal draft.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday, September 1.</font>--Many rumors for several days 
past, but no
reliable intelligence. A report last night that a battle occurred
on Friday at Manassas.
 <p>
This was the bloody battle of "Second Manassas." Among the slain
were <name><fn>William S. H.</fn><ln> Baylor</ln></name>, Colonel of the 
Fifth
 regiment; <name><fn>Edward</fn>
<ln>Garber</ln></name>, Captain in the Fifty-second regiment;
<name><fn>William</fn> <ln>Patrick</ln></name>,
Major of cavalry; <name><fn>Preston</fn> <ln>Byers</ln></name> and others 
from Augusta county. *
    <p>     
* <name><pf>Colonel</pf> <ln>Baylor</ln></name> was the only son of
<name><fn>Jacob</fn> <ln>Baylor</ln>, <sf>Esq.</sf></name>, and was
born in 1831. He was educated at the Staunton Academy and
Washington College, Lexington, and studied law at the University
of Virginia. For some years he was Commonwealth's Attorney for
the town of Staunton. When killed he was in command of the
Stonewall Brigade, and it is said would soon have been com-
missioned Brigadier General if he had lived.<p>
    <name><pf>Major</pf> <ln>Patrick</ln></name>, son of Mr.
<name><fn>Charles</fn> <ln>Patrick</ln></name>, was born on South
River Augusta, in 1822. He was a farmer, an intelligent
gentleman, and a gallant soldier.<p>
    <name><pf>Captain</pf> <ln>Garber</ln></name> was a son of Mr.
<name><fn>Albert J.</fn> <ln>Garber</ln></name> of Staunton,
and a young man of great promise, as was <name><fn>Preston</fn>
<ln>Byers</ln></name>.
        <p>
By September 8, the Confederate army was in Maryland, and
recruits were again passing through Staunton. Jackson captured
Harper's Ferry with many prisoners, etc., and the battle of
Boonsboro was fought.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday, September 24.</font>--All the wounded men who 
can walk have
been creeping up from Winchester, trying to get to their homes.
Staunton is full of them. Many look very forlorn, hands and arms
hurt, faces bound up, badly clad, barefooted and dirty.
        <hr> <p>
<font size=+1>September 25.</font>--Last night the town was overflowing 
with wounded
soldiers from the army and recruits going down.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Saturday night, September 27.</font>--Late this evening 
nearly five
hundred Yankee prisoners were brought up from Winchester. They
marched four abreast. It was pitiful to see so many human beings
led or driven along like sheep. Troops have been moving down the
Valley from this point nearly every day this week. Most of the
wounded who have arrived here have been forwarded to Richmond.
Others continue to come, however. Night before last the town was
alive with them. They were fed as far as possible, by citizens.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Thursday, October 2.</font>--An ambulance train laden with 
wounded
soldiers has come in from Winchester. From the number of Northern
vehicles in the train one might suppose that the Federal army was
passing along. * * The number of ambulances arrived and on the
road this side of Mt. Sidney is said to be two hundred and
twenty-five.
         <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday, October 8.</font>--The scene at the railroad 
depot this
morning was in striking contrast to those of former times. Many
wounded soldiers were going home on furlough or discharge,--some
on two crutches, others on one, and several supported by two
men each. A poor fellow came limping along, using a rough staff
in place of one of his legs, which was wounded. One leg of his
pants was cut off at the knee, and the other was slit open so as
to expose the bare limb. What clothing he had on was dirty, as
usual with most soldiers returning from the army.
  <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Monday, October 13</font>.--There was a distribution of 
public salt
today. Considerable crowd and pressure. One pound allowed to each
individual. Several wagons went through town to-day on their way
to Kanawha county for salt. News was received on the l3th, of
Stuart's cavalry excursion into Pennsylvania, capture of
Chambersburg, etc.
    <hr> <p>    
<font size=+1>Saturday, October 18.</font>--A dreadful railroad accident 
at Ivy,
Albemarle county, a few days ago, to a train bringing soldiers up
this way. Seven or eight men killed and sixty or seventy wounded.
But what of this at a time when men are killed by hundreds and
thousands every day! Soldiers still pressing through the town to
the army. Provisions of all kinds scarce and prices high. Flour,
$14 per barrel;butter, 75 cents per pound; clothing very
difficult to get.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday, October 22.</font>--We have more to fear from 
the scarcity of
subsistence and clothing than from the Federal armies. * * Felt
hats sell for $10 to $l5. The price for making a pair of common
shoes is from $5.50 to $6. The cannon of twenty-three dismantled 
artillery companies have been sent to Staunton. Up to a few days
ago, 13,000 recruits for General Lee's army had passed through
town since the battles in Maryland.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday, October 31.</font>--Rumors for several days past 
that our army
is falling back from Winchester or going into eastern Virginia.
It is said that Jackson is to remain in the Valley this side of
Winchester. Troops still going down.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday, November 7.</font>--A long trail of ambulances with 
sick
soldiers just arrived from Winchester. * * General expectation
that the war will close in a short time, either from European
intervention, or a change of feeling in the Northern people.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Wednesday, November 12.</font>--Yankees said to be at 
Shenandoah
mountain, twenty-six miles from Staunton. * * The South Carolina
cavalry regiment, which has been in the vicinity of town for some
time past, went out just now to see after the enemy. They passed
through town and made an imposing display.
<hr><p>
Monday, November 17.--Our cavalry have returned from Highland
(across the Shenandoah mountain), and report that no Yankees
are in that region this side of the Alleghany mountain. * * More
than a hundred Yankee prisoners were brought up the Valley
yesterday. A hundred or more on the 13th.
 <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Thursday, November 20.</font>--Yankees in 
Highland,--Millroy and
Kelley,--committing great depredations in Crab Bottom. Several
Yankee prisoners on parole are walking about our streets, one
strapping fellow in Zouave uniform,--red pants, etc.
 <hr><p>
<font size=+1>Tuesday, November 25.</font>--The scene has greatly 
changed. The enemy
under Burnside are opposite Fredericksburg, demanding the
surrender of the place. General Lee is there commanding our
forces. Jackson and D. H. Hill have moved from the Valley in
the same direction.
    <p>     
Intelligence of the battle of Fredericksburg was received on
December 12th, 13th, and continuously to the 23rd.
     <hr>  <p>  
<font size=+1>Tuesday night, December 23.</font>--As an incident of the 
times, I
mention that a milliner of Staunton went to Baltimore recently to
purchase goods, taking a female companion with her. The goods
had to "run the blockade," in other words, to be smuggled across
the lines, and the two women returned, each concealing a large
number of bonnet frames under her hood and wearing any quantity
of dresses and cloaks.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Thursday night, December 25.</font>--Upon joining a crowd 
near the
courthouse, I learned that the sentinels had 1ast night halted
citizens on the streets, and ordered them not to pass unless they
were going to their homes. We all agreed that it was a
high-handed usurpation, which should not be submitted to. So we
addressed a communication to Colonel D., the commander of the
post, inquiring if the guard had acted in pursuance of orders,
and if so, whether the proceeding, was to be continued to-night.
He stated in his reply that the guard were inexperienced and had
misunderstood their instructions. The paper sent him, however,
showed that the Provost Marshal was present at one of the street
corners, and required the sentinel to use gun when necessary to
arrest passers-by.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Friday night, December 26.</font>--At a sale near town 
to-day, corn
went off at $3.60 a bushel, oats $2.05, bran $1.05, and other
things in proportion.
<hr><p>
<font size=+1>Sunday night, January 4,1863.</font>--Returning from the 
cemetery this
morning I walked over the hill and through the grounds where
deceased soldiers are buried. The number of graves has greatly
increased since I was there last. It was almost appalling to see
the rows of graves recently dug waiting with gaping mouths for
the still living victims. The sight brought before me vividly the
sufferings of the soldiers dying in military hospitals, far from
home and kindred, and all the horrors of a time of war.
   <hr><p>      
<font size=+1>Friday night, January 30.</font>--A general impression that 
the war
will soon be over.
     <hr> <p>   
<font size=+1>February 7.</font>--A number of deserters from the Federal 
army opposite
Fredericksburg have arrived here within a few days past.
         <hr><p>
<a name="rations"></a><font size=+1>February 23</font>.--The money value of a day's rations for 
one hundred
soldiers, formerly about $9, is now at market prices more than
$123. Coffee $3.50 to $4, and sugar $1 a pound; butter $1.75.
<hr><p>
By <font size=+1>March 11th</font>, flour had gone up in Staunton to $25 
a barrel,
bacon $1 a pound, indicating " either a time of famine or an
utterly ruinous depreciation of the currency."
<p>
Early in 1863, the people of Staunton relied upon Confederate
candles "for light in their dwellings at night. Candlewick was
dipped in melted wax and resin, and wrapped around a stick, one
end being passed through a wire loop fastened to the stick.
The end of the wick burned freely when lighted, but the
illumination was very feeble, and unless the candle were watched,
and the wick drawn through the loop and trimmed every few
minutes, the whole affair was soon aflame.
   <hr><p>      
<font size=+1>March 27.</font>--At an auction sale yesterday, common 
dinner plates
brought $3.75 a piece. Many persons have had their glass and
chinaware broken up since the war began, and there is a great
demand for such articles.
      <hr><p>   
<font size=+1>Saturday, April 11.</font>--The Thirty-first and part of the
Twenty-fifth Virginia regiments arrived to-day and go to join
Imboden at the Shenandoah mountain. The remainder of the
Twenty-fifth is expected tonight. It is probable that a movement
is on foot to procure cattle in the northwestern part of the
State.<hr>
