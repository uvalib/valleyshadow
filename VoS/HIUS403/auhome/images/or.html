AN ACT to authorize the formation of volunteer companies for local defense.

  The Congress of the Confederate States of America do enact, That for
  the purpose of local defense in any portion of the Confederate States,
  any number of persons not liable to military duty, may associate
  themselves as a military company, elect their own officers and establish
  rules and regulations for their own government, and shall be considered
  as belonging to the Provisional Army of the Confederate States, serving
  without pay or allowances, and entitled, when captured by the enemy,
  to all the privileges of prisoners of war: Provided, That such company
  shall, as soon as practicable, transmit their muster-roll, or a list of the
  names of the officers and privates thereof, to the Governor of the State,
  the commanding general of the department, or any brigadier general in
  the State or Confederate service, to be forwarded to the Secretary of
  War; but the President or the commander of the military district may,
  at any time, disband such companies: Provided, That in the States and
  districts in which the act entitled "An act to further provide for the
  public defense," approved April the sixteenth, eighteen hundred and
  sixty-two, and the acts amendatory thereof, have been suspended,
  persons of any age, resident within such States or districts, may
  volunteer and form part of such companies so long as such suspension
  shall continue: Provided, That no person shall become a member of said
  company until he shall have first

HDQRS. POST,
  Staunton, June 15, 1864--2.30 p. m.
  MAJ.: Your note of the 13th reached me yesterday by return courier.
  It states "McNeill and Gilmor are in the Valley below." Maj. Gilmor
  has just showed me your note of the 12th requesting

  PAGE 152-70   OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. XLIX.
  [Series I. Vol. 37. Part I, Correspondence. Serial No. 70.]

  
  him to join the major-general commanding with all his force, and
  directing him to order similar force likewise-McNeill and Mosby, I
  suppose. If the intention of yours of the 13th to me was to supersede
  that of the 12th to Gilmor, I would respectfully call attention to the fact
  that there is now only McNeill's sixty men between me and the
  Potomac, and he will, under Maj. Gilmor's order, be removed. If
  consistent with the exigencies of the case, would it not be well to permit
  Gilmor and McNeill to remain below? If both, or either, are kept there,
  I ask that they be instructed to keep me advised of the enemy's movements,
  and especially of all that threatens this point. I will have the
  telegraph ready for work to-morrow.

  There are 200 wounded Yankees here at the hospital and forty nurses.
  I had no guard when I got here and did not know when the enemy might
  get back; so I went to work and paroled the whole of them. I sent a
  copy of the parole. It is the same that they gave our hospital men,
  except the clause regarding escape, which I added because I had no
  guard, and because I did not know whether the paroles were binding
  anyhow. Is the parole they gave our men binding now? Is mine binding
  to them unless we keep the men and deliver them at a point of
  exchange? Is there not some special agreement between the two
  Governments about hospital paroles? Cannot these fellows be returned
  to their own lines as fast as convalescent by mutual consent of Gen.'s
  Breckinridge and Hunter, instead of sending them to Richmond? I have
  not yet deliver to the surgeon in charge of them a copy of the parole or
  the list.

  Respectfully, your obedient servant,

  E. G. LEE,
  Col., Cmdg. Post.

  We, the undersigned, do solemnly swear that we will not bear arms

  Hon. J. A. SEDDON,
  Secretary of War:

  Mr. SECRETARY: The rumor you hear is to painfully true, as you will
  perceive from the inclosed dispatches sent to me this morning, a little
  after midnight, by the President. There is no force to send, except from
  Gen. Lee, and as the position is in his command, all was left to his
  better judgment, especially as he has directed all the movements of
  Breckinridge, Jones, and Imboden, down to this time. I offered him my
  services to facilitate the movements he might desire.

  Very respectfully and truly, yours,

No 22.

  Report of Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden, C. S. Army, commanding
  Valley District, of operations November 4-14.

  STAUNTON, November 14, 1863.
  COLONEL: On the evening of the 4th instant, I received a note from
  Lieutenant Byrd, commanding detachment at Hightown, in Highland
  County, that the enemy had appeared over 5,000 strong at
  Camp Barrow, on the east side of Cheat Mountain, and a few hours
  later another dispatch that he had moved toward Huntersville.

  At daybreak on the 5th, I left my camp, 4 miles from Bridgewater,
  and moved to Buffalo Gap and encamped. I ordered six days'
  rations (hard bread and bacon) to be sent on the cars to Goshen

  PAGE 548-48   OPERATIONS IN N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA.   [CHAP. XLI.
  [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]

  
  Depot, and on the 6th I left Buffalo Gap with my best mounted men
  (about 600 men) and a section of artillery, without baggage. Halted
  at Goshen, issued provisions to the men, and encamped at Bratton's,
  in Bath County.

  Started at dawn on the 7th, and passed the Warm Springs at 1
  p. m. on the Huntersville road. There heard that a battle was
  fought on the 6th between the forces of General Echols and Colonel
  Jackson and the enemy at Mill Point, in Pocahontas. I resolved to
  fall upon the enemy's rear if possible and pushed on. At the foot
  of Back Creek Mountain a courier from Covington brought me a
  dispatch from Captain Skeen that Echols was badly defeated; had
  retreated through Lewisburg toward Monroe; that a large column
  of the enemy had arrived at Lewisburg from Kanawha, making the
  entire hostile force at that point 15,000 strong. Believing it impossible
  to cross by Huntersville and do any good, I changed my course
  down Jackson's River toward Covington. That night I received a
  telegram from General Samuel Jones in cipher, which I could not
  read, never having been furnished the key.

  On Sunday, the 8th, I pressed on to Covington, where I found
  more than 100 panic-stricken refugees from Colonel Jackson's
  command, and that night more came in. I placed a company on picket
  at Callaghan's. A little after dark my picket was attacked. Had
  one horse shot, but repelled the enemy and held the post.

  When I changed my course down Jackson's River on Saturday I
  sent an order to the Rockbridge Home Guards and Cadets, who were
  at Millborough, to go to Clifton Forge, which they did on Sunday,
  and encamped only 13 miles from me. They numbered about 800
  men and had two 6-pounder guns.

  On Monday, the 9th, at dawn, the enemy appeared in force at
  Callaghan's and attacked my picket. It came in slowly. One and a
  half miles west of Covington I took position on the crest of a mountain
  to give battle. The force that drove in my picket was about 400
  cavalry. When the head of the column came within about 1,200
  yards I opened on it with my artillery, and by a few shots repulsed
  and scattered it, when two companies of my cavalry charged and
  drove the whole force back at full run to Callaghan's, where they
  joined the main column, over 3,000 strong, and moved off on the
  Warm Springs road. As soon as apprised of this fact, and that the
  enemy had seven pieces of artillery along, I felt sure he intended
  to get in my rear, if possible, by a country road, which I knew was
  entirely practicable. I at once withdrew to a hill 1 mile east of
  Covington, and sent to hurry up the Rockbridge forces, intending
  to give battle at that point (a very strong position) to whatever
  force might appear. In the meanwhile a part of my cavalry, under
  Colonel Imboden, were thrown out about 4 or 5 miles to watch the
  enemy's movements.

  Early in the afternoon it was ascertained that Averell had left
  the Warm Springs road and gone off toward Huntersville. As it
  was possible this might be a ruse, and that he would sweep around
  by the Warm Springs and reach Millborough, I resolved to move,
  via Clifton Forge, to Goshen as quick as possible, sending scouts to
  watch Averell and report to me at Goshen. I commenced my march
  at once, and in a little over twenty-four hours made Goshen, a
  distance of 40 miles, on the 10th. Hearing from my scouts I dismissed
  the Rockbridge forces. My scouts reported Averell as making for
  Monterey, up Back Creek, and moving very rapidly.

  On the 11th, I came to Buffalo Gap, where I ascertained beyond a

  CHAP. XLI.]   EXPEDITIONS AGAINST LEWISBURG, W. VA.   PAGE 549-48
  [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]

  
  doubt that Mulligan, with a fresh force of 800 men from Petersburg,
  would form a junction that evening with Averell at Monterey. I
  then deemed a raid on Staunton highly probable, and to repel it
  (tired as were my men) I ordered up l50 men to top of Shenandoah
  Mountain (16 miles distant) that night, and followed in the morning
  with 750 more and four pieces of artillery, and called out the Augusta
  Home Guards. Mulligan and Averell did form a junction, making
  their united force near 4,000 men, but made no effort to reach
  Staunton. They went on toward Hardy.

  Having sent Captain McNeill into Hardy two weeks ago with 200
  men, who are still there, I immediately dispatched three couriers to
  his party to obstruct the roads about and north of Franklin, and
  take position in the cliffs and bushwhack the enemy as he passed.
  I also sent 40 fresh cavalry to harass him at different points in the
  mountains. I expect to hear good accounts from both these parties.
  The force that accompanied me was much jaded, having marched
  nearly 200 miles in six days through the mountains and over bad
  roads. Although I inflicted no appreciable damage on the enemy, I
  am certain I saved all the furnaces (six or eight in full blast) on the
  west side of Rockbridge and Botetourt Counties. I have information
  that leaves no doubt that the column I repulsed at Covington were
  furnished with several days' rations and ordered to proceed down
  Jackson's River, burn the depots and bridges, destroy the furnaces,
  and retreat by Millborough and Warm Springs to the main body.

  I will rest two days, and on Monday move down into the lower
  end of Rockingham or Shenandoah, and see what further can be
  done before winter sets in. I am satisfied Averell will seek to winter
  his cavalry at Moore field. Forage and other supplies are abundant
  in that rich valley. He has over 3,000 men, Mulligan over 1,000--a
  force too large for me to drive out. I will harass them all winter,
  but that is all I can do. To-morrow I start Captain Hill with a
  company to Barbour County to try and capture a train from Grafton
  to Beverly. There are but about 500 men left at Beverly.

  I beg leave to add my testimony to the admirable spirit displayed
  by the people of Rockbridge in coming to my assistance. At 7 p. m.
  on Thursday, the 6th, the news reached Lexington of this raid. By
  7 p. m. the next day 800 men were 12 miles on their march to
  support me. My thanks are especially due Col. J. W. Massie, commanding
  home guards, and. General F. H. Smith, commanding cadets, for
  the energy and zeal they manifested and the skill with which they
  moved their commands so rapidly through the mountains.

  I regret to have to add that of nearly 200 stragglers from Colonel
  Jackson's--whom I found at Covington and supplied with funds to
  subsist themselves, and supplied with arms, where they had lost their
  own, out of some Virginia State arms I found at Covington--a large
  number ran off to the woods and mountains as soon as my artillery
  opened on the enemy, although I had organized them into two
  companies and ordered them to take part in the fight I then expected
  would occur. A part remained and were willing to fight, but a large
  number fled most shamefully before the enemy was nearer than 2
  miles of where I left them to await orders.

  Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

  J. D. IMBODEN,
  Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Staunton, Va., 17, 1864.
  GEN.: Pursuant to your telegram of the 3d instant, I took
  command of this post on the 4th. A few hours after doing so I heard
  that the enemy were moving on Gen. Jones' flank, toward Port
  Republic, and fearing a cavalry dash, took the responsibility of getting
  the heavy stores and official papers here in readiness for moving. I
  received no orders and no information leading me to think the place in
  danger until Sunday afternoon, June 5, at 5 p. m., when a note
  addressed to a gentleman here was handed me. It stated that Gen.
  Jones was killed, and the "army broken and routed," and general
  Vaughn retreating toward Fishersville. I immediately strained every
  nerve to get all stores and supplies away, but time was so limited, and
  for lack of any warning whatever the

  CHAP. XLIX.]   THE LYNCHBURG CAMPAIGN.   PAGE 153-70
  [Series I. Vol. 37. Part I, Correspondence. Serial No. 70.]

  
  means were so limited also, that it was utterly impossible to remove
  everything. Another disadvantage was that, having been in command of
  the post brief a time, I did know what was here, and had no time for
  inquiries. Nearly all the wagons of the post quartermaster had been
  taken for the newly arrived troops, who came unfurnished with
  transportation. The precautionary measures of Saturday enabled us to get
  off 900 sacks of salt, a large lot of leather, &c. All the ammunition was
  saved, all the bacon, and most of the quartermaster's stores. At 11 p. m.
  June 5 I got an order from Brig.-Gen. Vaughn, in reply to a communication
  of mine, returning to Waynesborough. This is the only order of any
  description, the only warning or notice I received from any one.

  I inclose a report, which is as accurate as I am to make, of what
  was left here. I did not destroy what was left, because I could not do so
  without destroying the buildings, unless I moved the things out, for
  which I had no time, but the enemy carried nothing off; they destroyed
  all. I gave a trusty gentleman of the town authority to give to citizens,
  before the enemy got in, what they wanted. He distributed all the
  commissary and some of the quartermaster's stores, and saved, by
  claiming it as his own, about a hogshead of sugar. The depot, woolen
  factory, Government stables, steam-mill, wagon shops, and store-houses
  for tax in kind, were burned. The quartermaster's, commissary, and
  ordnance buildings were not burned, being private property. The
  railroad was effectually destroyed for three miles, and partially for three
  more. The bridge at Christian's Creek, about fifty feet long, was
  burned. The telegraph destroyed for six miles; that I have repaired. The
  hands are slowly at work on the railroad. At the rate they are moving
  it will take a month or more to repair it. I would respectfully suggest
  that the railroad company be requested to employ C. R. Mason, of this
  place, as the most suitable person to undertake the repairs of this road.

  Having no instructions, I had to use own judgment about the time of
  leaving, and the direction the trains should be sent. Such things as could
  be gotten on the cars was sent to Lynchburg; the commissary supplies
  I sent to Gen. Vaughan, and all the other wagon trains across the
  Blue Ridge, at Tye River Gap, into Nelson County, not wishing to
  encumber the army with a train it could not use. I regarded that as a
  point safe from every attack, at least until the quartermaster could
  receive orders from the brigadier-general commanding. With these I sent
  the surplus hospital train, the convalescents, negroes, &c.

  I left at daylight on Monday morning, after everything was gone. The
  enemy on the 10th captured a small portion of the quartermaster's train,
  which unfortunately had with it the quartermaster and commissary
  official papers, all of which were burned. Our sick and wounded at the
  hospital, with attendants, were paroled by the enemy. They left 300
  wounded and forty nurses here of their own, with one assistant surgeon.
  Upon arriving on the 12th I had no guard, and did not know whether we
  would hold the place or not, so to be at least even with the Yankees I
  paroled all of them. I inclose a copy of the parole,* the last clause
  added because being entirely alone here, I wished to keep those who
  were able to do so from running

  __________
  * See p. 152.

  off before I could get a guard. I have only a provost guard now.
  I have not yet given a copy of the parole to the surgeon, and I shall not
  do so until I hear from Judge Ould, to whom I have written for
  instructions.

  I obeyed that part of your order in reference to organizing a local force,
  and doing all in my power to aid in the defense of the valley. Before it
  was received over 700 reserve, and 800 others, convalescents, detailed
  men, furloughed soldier, &c., had been collected and sent to the field,
  where they still are.

  I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

  Adjutant and Inspector Gen., Richmond.

  Memorandum of property abandoned upon evacuation of post at
  Staunton, Va., on 6th June, 1864.

  Commissary stores: Twenty barrels four (mostly broken), 10 barrels
  corn meal (mostly broken), 600 sacks salt, 2 hogsheads sugar (1 of these
  saved by a citizen), 5,000 empty sacks (in bad order), 5 bales cotton
  cloth (to be exchanged for supplies), 8 bales cotton yarn (to be
  exchanged for supplies), and tables, desks, safe, &c.

  Ordnance stores: 1,000 damaged small-arms, 150 pairs spurs and straps
  (common), 200 pounds horseshoes, 20 condemned saddles, 150 new
  saddles of Richmond Arsenal, one 12-pounder Napoleon, dismounted,
  which had been captured from the enemy; 2 howitzers, iron
  (32-pounders), of which they only broke the trunnions; 1 howitzer, iron
  (12-pounder), in same condition.

  Quartermaster's stores: 1,000 wooden buckets, 8 or 10 boxes deceased
  soldiers' clothing, 2 or 3 boxes new clothing, 40 or 50 good wagons,
  large number of picks and shovels, small lot of harness (not much
  value), and sundry other things of no great value or importance,
  together with office furniture.

  In addition to the foregoing, there was a considerable quantity of
  provisions belonging to or intended for the Ordnance department in
  Richmond. The agent in charge of them estimates their value at
  $400,000.

  This report is only approximate, the loss of official papers by capture
  preventing an accurate one. All these stores were destroyed by the
  enemy, save what were given to citizens during a brief period of the
  morning of the 6th instant.

  attention to study and obedience to all the rules of discipline, there

  is coupled with the desire of each cadet to complete his course a restless
  feeling of uncertainly as to whether they ought not, every one of them,
  to be in the field, and an apprehension that the war may be over before
  they have struck one below for Southern liberty.

  It is understood that you regard this institution with much interest as
  being to the Confederate States, to a considerable extent, what West
  Point was to the late United States, and as possessing the capacity
  beyond any other Southern institution of training the best officers for the
  Army.

  In this view, of it shall be your opinion that the cadets are more in line
  of their duty to our country in the course of training at the Military
  Institute, and will in fact render more important service to the Southern
  Confederacy by completing their course than by entering the Army
  before they graduate, I am well assured that a full expression of your
  opinion and wished will have a controlling influence over them and
  effectually remove all doubt or apprehension in their minds as to the line
  both of duty and expediency.

  The Board of Visitors and the superintendent are most anxious to direct
  the operations of the institute so as most effectually to meet the wants
  and wishes of the Confederate Government, and I beg leave to say for
  them that it will be most gratifying to receive from you any suggestions
  or recommendation as to the character and duration of the course of
  instruction, and on any and all other matters which in your judgment
  has, or may have, an important bearing upon its prospective value to our
  common cause.

  I beg leave, therefore, with the highest respect, to ask a full and
  unreserved expression of your opinion upon the whole subject.

  Very respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,

  WM. H. RICHARDSON,
  Adjutant-Gen. of Virginia, Ex officio Member of the Board.

  Gen. Hunter commands the forces advancing upon me. He occupied
  Mount Jackson at noon to day. His cavalry outnumbers ours two to one;
  his infantry four to one; his artillery four to one. He is moving on my
  flank, and will compel me to fall back. There is no point this side of
  Mount Crawford where I can successfully resist him, and there it is very
  doubtful, though I will do my best.

  Operations to-day prevented getting Richmond papers, and consequently
  from hearing of Sheridan. Up to 4 p. m. on Tuesday he was all right.
  At that time he was engaged burning railroad track between Church's
  [Christian's] Creek and Staunton. I am satisfied no troops have gone
  from here against him, and they cannot in the next two day. By that
  time he will be through and on his way to a position where he can
  defend and supply himself. Stevenson can, I think, spare troops enough
  for Kelley. If he cannot, send Stevenson a new regiment or two to
  defend Harper's Ferry, and let his older troops go to Kelley.

  Medical Director's Office,
  Camp near Berryville, Va., June 22, 1863.
  Dr. S. P. Moore,
  Surgeon-Gen., C. S. Army:

  Sir: The First and Third Corps of this army are now concentrated
  in the vicinity of Berryville and the two Gaps of the Blue Ridge-Ashby's
  and Snicker's.  I have directed that all our sick and wounded
  be collected at Jordan's Springs preparatory to their removal up the
  Valley to Staunton.

  The town of Winchester is in such a filthy condition, and low forms
  of fever so rife, that I deemed it unwise to permit any of our sick and
  wounded to remain there.  The Yankee sick and wounded prisoners
  I have ordered to be placed in a hospital camp just out of town.

  Jordan's Springs is a very suitable place for a hospital; the patients
  are very well cared for and are comfortable.

  It will be impossible, however, to feed them here but for a short time.
  Necessity will compel their removal toward Staunton.  I am unable
  to ascertain definitely whether there are hospitals at harrisonburg
  and Mount Jackson, and the capacity for their accommodations.  These
  points would make good by-road hospitals, temporarily, in which
  the sick and wounded who could not bear a long journey in ambulance
  wagons might be accommodated.  It is very desirable, however,
  that all, if possible, should be sent to Staunton, as those in the
  intermediate places might fall into the hands of the enemy, in the
  event of the army's advance or the abandonment of the Valley.
  There are between 700 and 800 sick and wounded from every portion
  of our army at Jordan's Springs, a vast majority of whom are very
  slightly sick, and will soon rejoin their commands.

  The enemy's sick and wounded at Winchester number about 500.
  Our loss in the battle of Winchester was very small.  The list of
  casualties has not yet been received.  Much property of all kinds
  was captured.

  The Second Army Corps, who were in advance of the army and
  fought the battle, appropriated "the spoils."  A large quantity of
  medical and hospital supplies must have fallen into our hands, but
  Medical Director McGuire and his medical officers left behind them
  only the odds and ends.  Surgeon McGuire has not yet forwarded
  an inventory of the captured articles.  Every preparation is being
  made to enter the enemy's country, as you will perceive from Gen.
  Orders, No. 72, a copy of which I herewith inclose.*  I directed
  Surgeon Geddings to telegraph to you for funds; however, I believe
  we can manage to make purchases by giving certified receipts, or by
  transfer of funds from the Quartermaster's Department to the Medical
  Department.  Col. Corley informs me that this transfer will
  be made, if necessary.

  If medical officers can be spared from Richmond or other general
  hospitals, I would respectfully request that 12 or 15 surgeons and
  assistant surgeons be ordered to report to me, for duty with this
  army, as soon as practicable.

  Our rapid movements and constant skirmishing with the enemy,
  and insufficient ambulance, make this demand for additional medical
  officers necessary.  I have ordered to Winchester Surgeon [J. E.]
  Claggett, with other medical officers, who have been on duty at the
  different temporary hospitals along the lines of railroad.

  Surgeon Geddings will establish a purveying depot at Winchester
  for the present.

  I fear there will be some difficulty in transporting the necessary
  supplies from Staunton by road wagons.

  The purveying depot needs additional assistant surgeons, which I

  I respectfully ask that you assign two officers competent to perform
  the duties.

  War Department, C. S. A.,
  Richmond, Va., June 22, 1863.
  Gen. D. H. Hill,
  Comdg., &c.:

  Gen.: I have had the satisfaction of receiving your letter by
  a courier, informing me of the prompt disposition you are making
  of your forces, and offering valuable suggestions with a view to the
  contingency of an attack on Richmond by the enemy.  My intelligence
  is positive that the enemy have left Suffolk, and that only a
  small force remains on the south side, at a point a few miles from
  Norfolk.  You are doubtless right in your conjecture that the movements
  on the Blackwater were a feint to cover the evacuation.

  The forces at the command of the enemy in Lower Virginia have
  doubtless been concentrated at Yorktown, but I find it hard to believe
  they amount even to 20,000 men, enough to make a diversion,
  and, if Richmond were found defenseless, to take it, is all I think the
  enemy would plan under the fright which Gen. Lee's advance is
  evidently causing at Washington and in the North.  Still, it is wiser
  to expect and prepare for the largest force they may bring.

  I do not think they will attempt an advance by the south side, as
  Richmond is their main object, and they would, besides, dislike to
  open entirely their reserves, stores, and defenses at Yorktown.  But
  if they do, by means of the bridge above Drewry's Bluff, we can
  concentrate as easily on the south as the north side.  Provided you
  have [M.] Jenkins' brigade ready to aid Ransom's, or to be thrown to
  this city, I think we will be reasonably safe.

  I do not think it safe just now for you to exchange Jenkins'
  brigade for Colquitt's, lest we should be struck while in transitu.
  When things become more settled, the change would probably be
  judicious, and you can, of course, under your discretion as commander,
  at any time make the disposition.

  I fear Gen. Beauregard can hardly spare a regiment of cavalry
  from his line, almost as extended as yours, but I will apply to him
  on the subject.

  The prisoners returned by the truce-boat have, I fear, through the
  atrocious barbarity of the enemy, been so infected with small-pox as
  to render it unsafe to mix them with other troops.  You had better
  have them separated and examined.  As far as you deem safe to employ
  them, act on your suggestion, which is approved.

  Very truly, yours,

  Secretary of War.

  MOUNT TORRY FURNACE,
  June 11, 1864--8 a. m.

  GEN.: The enemy's cavalry (one brigade, 2,000 strong, and a
  battery) burnt this furnace last night, and camped in the gorge above.
  Attack, except upon his rear guard, was impossible. He is now moving
  over an almost impracticable road from this furnace to the head of Back
  Creek, and thence to the head of Tye River. He is making for the
  railroad between Lynchburg and Charlottesville. I am cutting out the
  blockade at Howardsville Gap, and will be across the mountain by 3 p.
  m. I have sent messengers to the people on Rockfish and Tye Rivers to
  blockade all the roads in front of the enemy to-night, and inform me on
  what road he moves. If McCausland fell back to Tye River Gap last
  night, he too, will get in front of this detachment. I have made this
  important move without waiting to hear from you, as time is very
  precious, and, understanding your views as expressed yesterday, have
  no doubt it is the proper movement. Your communications with
  Lynchburg depend upon my success in "heading off" this force. My
  men are in fine spirits, and move with a will. You can send a courier
  to me to-night via Greenfield, in nelson, where he will get information
  of my route. The enemy will be much jaded by climbing over the
  mountain to-day. We had a skirmish with his rear, and captured several
  Yankees and negroes this morning. Col. O'Ferrall is still harassing
  him.

HDQRS. ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
  January 27, 1863.
  Brig. Gen. W. E. JONES,
  Cmdg. Valley District:

  GEN.: The question of provisioning this army is becoming one of
  much difficulty. I have thought that the present might be a favorable
  time for you to send into the counties of Hampshire, Tucker, Randolph,
  Pendleton, and Highland, and any others that you may find convenient
  or useful, with a view of collecting cattle or salt meat for our use. I
  have heard that in the counties named cattle may be procured by
  judicious and energetic men acquainted with the country and the
  inhabitants; and a necessity exists for employing every meats to supply
  our wants. It is not my intention that you should interfere with or
  interrupt any agent of the Government engaged in collecting supplies,
  but request, on the contrary, that you give them any aid in your power.
  Should there be any region unoccupied in which provisions can be
  secured, I hope you will lose no time in endeavoring to collect them.

  I am glad to learn, by your recent report, that you have a body of
  cavalry in the lower part of the Valley, to restrain the operations of
  Gen. Milroy. By having movable camps, and relieving the men
  engaged, from time to time, you will be able to protect our citizens and
  curtail the operations of predatory parties.

  CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,
  Richmond, Va., June 6, 1863.
  His Excellency M. L. BONHAM,
  Governor of South Carolina, Columbia, S. C.:

  SIR: Under the instructions of the President, I have the honor to address
  you on a subject deemed by him of great moment. The numerically
  superior armies of the enemy confronting us in the field at all the most
  important points render essential for success in our great struggle for
  liberty and independence greater concentration of our forces, and their
  withdrawal in a measure from the purpose of local defense to our cities
  and least exposed States. Being the invaded country, it is impossible
  throughout the extent of our limits to maintain permanently, without
  dispersion, which causes weakness everywhere, adequate forces at the
  numerous points where we may be attacked. The recent raids of the
  enemy in different portions of our productive, but thinly populated,
  districts strikingly illustrate both our liability to distracting and
  desolating invasions, and the impracticability of affording from our
  armies, with sufficient promptness, the soldiers necessary for prevention
  or punishment. It becomes essential, therefore, that the reserves of our
  population capable of bearing arms, yet required for the useful
  operations of society and the maintenance in the field of our embodied
  forces, should be relied on for employment in the local defense of
  important cities, and in repelling, on emergencies, the sudden or
  transient invasions of the enemy. How best to organize such reserves
  and make them most effective has been the subject of consideration with
  the Department, and I venture to present some suggestions for your
  consideration and action.

  The militia of the respective States might on occasion be called out, but
  this would be attended with the serious evil of being dilatory in
  execution, and by its generality be exhaustive of the already diminished
  population engaged in the necessary work of production and supply. The
  difficulty of assembling, and after discharge again reassembling them,
  would probably induce their retention on each call beyond the time
  strictly necessary. Experience, too, has not shown this kind of force to
  be very reliable or efficient, as it is difficult, from the want of previous
  preparation and co-operation, to inspire them with confidence in their
  leaders or themselves. Local organizations or enlistments by
  volunteering for limited periods and special purposes, if they can be
  induced, would afford more assurance of prompt and efficient action.
  For these the legislation of Congress has made full provisions by two
  laws, one entitled "An act to provide for local defense and special
  service," approved August 21, 1861;* the

  __________
  * See Vol. I, this series, p. 579.

  CONFEDERATE AUTHORITIES.   PAGE 581-128
  [Series IV. Vol. 2. Confederate Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 128.]

  
  other entitled "An act to authorized the formation of volunteer
  companies for local defense," approved October 13, 1862,* to which
  your attention is revoked, and of which, as they are brief, copies are
  appended.

  Under the former of these, of organizations could be effected with the
  limitation prescribed in their muster-rolls of service only at home, or at
  specified points of importance within the particular State, they would be
  admirably adapted to obtain the desired ends of calling out those best
  qualified for the service; of employing them only when and so, long as
  they might be needed; of having them animated with esprit de corps,
  reliant on each other and their selected officers, and of thus securing the
  largest measures of activity and efficiency, perhaps, attainable from
  other than permanent and trained soldiers.

  After the most active and least-needed portion of the reserves were
  embodied under the former law, the latter would allow smaller
  organizations, with more limited range of service, for object of police
  and the pressing contingencies of neighborhood defense. Could these
  laws generally be acted on, it is believed as full organization of the
  reserve population would be secured for casual needs as would be
  practicable. These laws, however, contemplate only voluntary action,
  and no compulsion or draft can be restored to secure organizations under
  them. It may well be doubted whether at this stage of the war, with the
  engrossing duties pressing on the militate population at home, and the
  experience had of the privations of military service, the spirit of
  volunteering would be sufficiently eager and active to secure the prompt
  formation of such organizations. The apprehension at least of a draft,
  otherwise unavoidable, would aid powerfully patriotic impulses, and by
  interesting all to encourage and assist such organizations might suffice
  to assure them. The President has, therefore, determined to make a
  requisition on the Governors of the several States to furnish, by an
  appointed time, for service within the State, and for the limited period
  of six months, a number of men proportionate to the relative population
  of each, unless the same can be organized previously in such voluntary
  corps as may render them subject to his call for like duty; and it is
  recommended to you to announce by proclamation such requisition, and
  that, unless by a preceding day the requisite forces can be presented by
  voluntary organizations under the first-named law, a draft will be made
  on all the militia not engaged in voluntary organizations under that law
  to furnish the requisite quota.

  When the need of the country for such additional service if fully
  presented to and realized by the patriotic population of your State, and,
  in addition, the question is narrowed to the election between voluntary
  organizations for special service within the State, under officers of their
  own selection, and with the privilege of remaining at home in the
  pursuit of their ordinary avocations, unless when called for a temporary
  exigency to active duty and the continuous service for an appointed
  time, under compulsory draft as militiamen, it is confidently believed
  that the general preference will be promptly manifested for the former.

  In the formation of these organizations it is reasonable to be expected
  that such portion of the population as may have seen service, but have
  been, by detail, discharge, or other cause, released from the Army, will
  constitute an important element, and that officers in

  __________
  * See p. 206.

  PAGE 582-128   CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
  [Series IV. Vol. 2. Confederate Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 128.]

  
  like situations will be elected to command, and thus there will be
  afforded the untried men a confidence and an encouragement wanting to
  ordinary militia. Without the general disturbance of a call on the militia
  the organizations nearest to the points of attack would always be readily
  summoned to meet the emergency, and the population resident in the
  cities and their vicinities would, without serious interruption to their
  business or domestic engagements, stand organized and prepared to man
  their intrenchments and defend, under the most animating incitements,
  their property and homes.

  In pursuance of the views thus imperfectly presented, and to reconcile
  greater concentration to our armies, with adequate internal protection to
  your State, I am instructed by the President, in his name, to make on
  you a requisition for 5,000 men, to be furnished by your State, for
  service therein, for the period of six months from August 1 next, unless
  in the intermediate time a volunteer force, organized under the law for
  local defense and special service, of at least an equal number be
  mustered and reported as subject to his call for service within your
  State.

  Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

  JAMES A. SEDDON,
  Secretary of War.

  His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

  SIR: Brig. Gen. A. E. Jackson has been, we understand,
  relieved of the command of his brigade in Western Virginia, and
  ordered to report to Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. We regret his removal
  from that department, and, whatever may have been the representations
  of others, we take it upon ourselves to say that he can be relied on with
  as much confidence as any officer in that department. He has been badly
  treated and stripped of his troops for the last year. His full and intimate
  knowledge of the country, his known zeal, courage, and ability, make
  his detention in that department the subject of public anxiety. We
  respectfully request, if practicable, that he be assigned to command a
  brigade in Western Virginia. The loss of Gen. W. E. Jones, we
  think, makes it the more necessary and proper.

  The representations reaching the Department from various sources were
  that Gen. Jackson had been able to obtain the command of only a few
  hundred irregular troops, in no wise worthy of the name of a brigade,
  and that they were ill-discipline and inefficient. In consequence it was
  thought better he should be transferred to some more important field of
  operations, where his services could be made more available, and he
  was accordingly ordered to Gen. Johnston's army, where he is now
  in command of a brigade. It is doubted whether the exchange asked
  would be agreeable to Gen. J. himself, while it certainly would not,
  in my judgment, promote the general service.

HARRISONBURG, September 29, 1864--7.30 p. m.
  (Received October 2.)
  Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,
  City Point:

  In my last dispatch I informed you that I pressed Early so closely
  through New Market, at the same time sending cavalry around his flank,
  that he gave up the Valley and took to the mountains, passing through
  Brown's Gap. I kept up the pursuit to Port Republic, destroying 75
  wagons and 4 caissons. I sent Gen. Torbert, who overtook me at
  Harrisonburg, to Staunton with wilson's division of cavalry and one
  brigade of Merritt's. Torbert entered Staunton on the 26th, and
  destroyed a large quantity of rebel Government property-harness,
  saddles, small-arms, hard bread, flour, repair shops, &c. He then
  proceeded to Waynesborough, destroying the iron bridge over the South
  Branch of the Shenandoah, seven miles of track, the depot buildings,
  Government tannery, and a large amount of leather, flour, and stores,
  &c., at that place. He found the tunnel defended by infantry, and retired
  via Staunton, destroying, accordingly to your original instructions to me.
  This morning I sent around Merritt's and Custer's divisions, via
  Piedmont, to burg grain, &c., pursuant to your instructions. My
  impression is that most of the troops which Early had left passed
  through

  the mountains to Charlottesville. Kershaw's division came to his
  assistance, and, I think, passed along the west base of the mountain to
  Waynesborough. The advance of my infantry is at Mount Crawford,
  eight miles south of Harrisonburg. I will go on and clean out the Valley.
  I am getting twenty-five to forty prisoners daily, who come in from the
  mountains on each side and deliver themselves up. From the most
  reliable accounts, Early's army was completely broken up and is
  dispirited. It will be exceedingly difficult for me to carry the infantry
  column over the mountains and strike at the Central road. I cannot
  accumulate sufficient stores to do so, and think it best to take some
  position near Front Royal, and operate with the cavalry and infantry. I
  will, however, stay here for a few days. Kershaw had not reached
  Richmond, but was somewhere in the vicinity of Gordonsville, when he
  received orders to rejoin Early. The destruction of the grain and forage
  from here to staunton will be a terrible blow to them. All the grain,
  gorge, &c., in the vicinity of Staunton was retained for the use of
  Early's army; all in the lower part of the Valley was shipped to
  Richmond for the use of Lee's army. The country from here to Staunton
  was abundantly supplied with forage and grain, &c.

CITY POINT, VA., July 3, 1864--5 p. m.
  (Received 8.15 p. m.)
  Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,
  Chief of Staff:

  You can direct Sigel in answer to his dispatch of 10.30 a. m. of to-day
  better than I can. Early's corps is now here. There are no troops that
  can now be threatening Hunter's department, except the remnant of the
  force W. E. Jones had, and possibly Breckinridge. If there is anything
  threatening any portion of his department, however, you need not send
  him here.

WAYNESBOROUGH, June 6, 1864.
  Went in the fight yesterday with an aggregate of 5,600. I have not over
  3,000 effective men, including Imboden's cavalry, 800. I don't know
  where Gen. Elzey is; think he has gone toward Charlottesville.
  Enemy occupied Staunton this morning Crook will from junction
  to-night or to-morrow with Hunter. Crook's force reported at 10,000.
  McCausland and Jackson are falling back upon this place. Hunter has,
  I think, 10,000 men, with twenty-four pieces of artillery; Crook has
  thirty.

  Maj.-Gen. SHERMAN, Acworth, Ga.:

  On Sunday Gen. Hunter fought a battle with the rebels at Mount
  Crawford, sixteen miles from Staunton, and gained a complete victory.
  The rebel Gen. W. E. Jones was killed on the field. Our forces
  occupy Staunton. The rebels are in the mountains between Staunton
  and Charlottesville. Dispatches from Gen. Grant to this morning
  report no movements or change of position on either side. Gen.
  Crittenden has at his own request been relieved from the Army of the
  Potomac. Do you want him? Mr. Lincoln was renominated by acclamation
  in the Baltimore Convention to-day.

  now. Have been driven back. I will try to protect Staunton, but unless
  re-enforcements come at once I cannot do it. May have to fall back by
  way of Waynesborough. Gen. E. W. Jones killed.
