<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>Approximately seventy percent of the adult white male population was fighting in the army as early as 1862.  The number of slaves dwindled as the war progressed--some left of their own accord and others were drafted into the Confederate Army.  In 1864 the Confederate Congress began drafting all white males over the age of seventeen, taking many young men away from home  In light of this information, it clear that white females were the one constant in Augusta County throughout the Civil War.
<br>  
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>During the Civil War, the white women of Augusta County worked to support their families as best they could.  In many instances they were thrust in the new position of having to head a family as well as having to manage a farm.  They also had to supply their husbands, sons and brothers with food, clothing & correspondence, contending with the problems of scarce supplies and devalued currency in the process.  They also tended to their sick and dying relatives who came home on furlough.  According to Joseph Waddell, Augusta County historian and diarist, many women visited the Staunton hospital to care for the wounded there. 
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>In addition to their familial duties, many women also actively supported the Confederate cause.  For example, women donated a church bell to be melted down for the manufacture of cannons and they collected money to build a monument to the fallen soldiers of Augusta County.  In Harrisonburg, not far north of Augusta County, a group of women even petitioned Secretary of War James A. Seddon to form their own regiment to fight General Sheridan in 1864.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>A picture that emerges from the Augusta documents dealing with women is one of a strong female community.  Although the war took an almost daily toll on Augusta County in life and property loss, the war served to bring these women together instead of driving them apart.   They acted communally, whether by collecting supplies to make clothing for soldiers or by hiding plows from Union soldiers, as diarist Nancy Emerson describes.
