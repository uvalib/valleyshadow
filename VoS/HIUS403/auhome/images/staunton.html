<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>At the start of the Civil War the residents of Staunton numbered four thousand.  The town was home to three banks, two newspapers, three hotels, and approximately eighty businesses.  For a small Southern town, Staunton had more than its share of modern conveniences--gas street lights and a telegraph office, for example.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>Staunton was also a manufacturing center, boasting Hardy's Wagon Works, a woolen factory, and a boot and shoe factory. The Virginia Central Railroad carried Staunton goods beyond the Valley, and five stagecoach lines carried passengers to and from Staunton.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>Staunton was known for its thriving educational institutions as well.  Four institutions, The Augusta Female Seminary (now Mary Baldwin College), the Virginia Female Institute (now Stuart Hall),  the Wesleyan Female Institute, and the Staunton Male Academy, were well-established before the start of the war.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>During the war Staunton was vital to Confederate operations in the Valley.  It was designated as an Army depot, a quartermaster and commissary post, and a center for both the training and mobilizing of troops.  In the later years of the war, temporary military encampments were set up on the outskirts of town and Confederate soldiers roamed the streets--often begging for food. 
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>The town's Institute for the Deaf, Dumb & Blind was quickly converted to a hospital, treating Confederate and well as Union prisoners of war.  In July of 1863 alone, the Staunton hospital treated 8,390 soldiers.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>Throughout the war, Confederate guards marched Union prisoners through the streets of Staunton on their way to the railroad station, where they would be sent by train to Richmond. Three captured Union generals, Harney, Kelley, and Crook, were paraded through Staunton on their way to Richmond prisons.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>Union forces threatened Staunton & Augusta County from 1862 on, but they did not invade the county until 1864.  After the Battle of  Piedmont on June 5, 1864, Union troops occupied Staunton, burning shops, factories, & mills.  They also destroyed miles of railroad track.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=40 height=2>Though Union troops wiped out many of Staunton's prime assets, they quickly moved on, leaving Staunton residents free to rebuild & continue supporting the Confederacy.  The railroad was repaired, and according to Augusta historian and diarist Joseph Waddell, Union prisoners of war were still brought to Staunton after the occupation.
