Staunton had two newspapers during the American Civil War, the Spectator 
and the Vindicator.  After an absence for a few years, the Vindicator 
resumed publication in February 20, 1863, and the Spectator's machinery was demolished during the Union troops' 
occupation of Staunton (June 6-7, 1864).  Both are decidedly skewed to the 
Confederate cause, but the Spectator's language is certainly more caloric.
<p>
The wartime news media in the 1860s was not an objective source of 
information, and its information may often be erroneous, if not 
misleading.  Nevertheless, while the Augusta County residents each 
had different opinions, very many of them were at least exposed to 
the opinions of these two newspapers, which are important for forming and 
reporting popular opinion.
