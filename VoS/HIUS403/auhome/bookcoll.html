<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>The Booker Collection consists of Civil War correspondence, a diary, and miscellaneous documents relating to the Brooks family of Waynesboro, Augusta Co.  These items are now in the possession of Andrew Brooks Booker, a direct descendant through Mary Susan Brooks.  All five of James and Eleanor Brooks' sons fought in the Civil War, three died and only two survived.  William died in 1861 of an unidentified illness, and Moffett died the following year of illness as well.  Andrew died in 1863 of wounds sustained at the Battle of Chancellorsville.  Most of the documents in the third section pertain to Andrew, both during his military career and after his death.
