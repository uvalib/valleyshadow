<h3>Augusta Home Units Team Starter Index</h3></center>

<p>
The Augusta Home Guard units were organized throughout the war to defend 
Staunton and the people of Augusta County.  The main unit designations 
for these men were the 3rd Battalion Valley Reserves, Capt. Avis' Co. 
Provost 
Guard Staunton, and the Marquis' Boys Battery.  These troops saw action 
at the Battle of Piedmont, where regular U.S. troops on June 5, 1864, routed 
the smaller, 
weaker Confederate forces.  The victory allowed the U.S. forces to occupy 
Staunton for the first time during the war.<p>

The Valley project has already researched the men and compiled their 
miiltary dossier files.  The team entered the personal information of the 
3rd Battalion Valley Reserves into a <A 
HREF="http://mrc.itc.virginia.edu/valley/search.cfm">searchable 
database</A>.  
Also from the Valley Project are the Staunton newspapers--the <A 
HREF="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~ela/ssnews2.html">Spectator</A> and 
the <A 
HREF="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~ela/rvnews2.html">Vindicator</A>, both 
of which have search functions for their wartime publications. <P>

The 3rd Battalion Valley Reserves were of two types of men: teenagers and 
men in their late 40s.  Few were soldiers
