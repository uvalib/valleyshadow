Dear Ma,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Your letter by Jimmy Burns was received this evening.  Charles' letter came yesterday, after looking for a letter for over a week.  I had begun to think you had forgotten me, it was so long coming.  He mentioned that Johnny had gone somewhere (but didn't say where) except that I would no doubt see him before I got his letter.  He didn't tell me what he had gone for, or anything about it, nor did you except that he sent to Gen Lee a recommendation for my detail.  What sort of a thing is it and <u>who</u> recommended me.  I suppose he was in Richmond and took the contract to the war office.  I haven't gotten the letter you say he wrote me and have never gotten but one letter from him since I left.  I have been very anxious to hear from him and know what is doing at the furnace.  It will now soon be time it was put in blast.

<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>When I commenced writing I had just returned from preaching, which we have every night.  Dr. Hoge and Mr. Lacy are gone.  There is a chaplain with each regiment of the brigade, two Presbyterians and three Methodists.  Lieut Culton has resigned-unable to stand infantry service.  I don't know who will get his place, if his resignation is accepted.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We heard considerable firing across the river yesterday, but haven't heard the cause Wednesday morning.  I will get the box today-am very much obliged to you all for it.  I am not much afraid of it being much like what I get here, there is but one place I ever saw that I got such rations.  I am sorry Miss Sue Harden is about to leave the neighborhood-young people are very scarce there.  Emmett is on another trip to Uncle John's, wonder if he will get there this time.  I heard Mary Susan was to atttend a small party at Dr. Dold's- a kind of farewell to him I suppose.  I am very well.  Love to all the friends.
