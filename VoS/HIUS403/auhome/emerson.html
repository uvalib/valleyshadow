<p>The last Sab. in May, <name>Jackson</name> was fighting in Winchester, 
the first
in Jn. was the battle of Seven Pines near Richmond, which commenced on
Sat.  A sacramental meeting was in progress in this place at the same
time.  Preaching by <name>Mr. Harris</name>.  The second Sab. in June,
<name>Jackson</name>, or
rather <name>Ewell</name> was fighting at Port Republic with
<name>Fremont</name>.  The firing
was heard here all day by many, a distance of 33 m.  The next day
firing was heard for some hours- an engagement between
<name>Jackson</name> & <name>Shields</name>.

<p>Firing has been heard in the vicinity of R. for several days, &
intense anxiety had been felt to learn the result. Tidings were bro't to
church that our armies have been victorious thus far, that many
prisoners and cannons have been taken-heavy loss on both sides.
Public thanks were offered for their deliverance.  Our help is in God
& in him alone.  The battle [] & continues to do so for a []

<p><name>Mr. Wright</name>, a neighbor who has four sons in the army, one

<h3>Wed.</h3>

<p>A steady rain.  A week today since the fighting commenced.
Battles inevitably bring rain.  We got a Whig of Fri. yes. & devoured
it eagerly, but got little about the battle as they are not permitted
to publish yet.  Heard that some Louisianians advanced to the charge
with the name of <name>Butler</name>, as their was any, fought
desperately.  <name>Butler</name>
& <name>Hunter</name> & <name>Wood</name>!  Noble triumvirate.
<name>Lincoln</name> & <name>Seward</name> & <name>Greely</name>,
triumvirate No 2.  <u><name>Greely</name></u> it may be, the most deeply 
stained of
the whole.  <name>Butler</name> is the best man for our cause within the 
limits of
the S. C. He has given a union to the Southern heart, and a name to
the Southern cause as one that none among ourselves could possibly
have done.  They thought they


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson5.jpg">page 5</a></h2>
<p>were united & in earnest, before his reign came, but there's a
difference since.  <name>Lincoln</name> performed a similar operation for 
us at the
commencement of the struggle by his proclamation for 75,000 men,
insulted Va. almost to a man and drove them out of the Union as by a
thunderbolt.
</div>

<div type="entry" n=>
<h3>Thurs.</h3>
<p>No prayer meeting yes.  Got a Whig this morning and
devoured it as usual.  News encouraging.  The Eng Par. are loud in
their denunciation of <name>Butler</name>.  A Montreal paper also speaks 
in terms
of unease and reprobation says N. O. will yet take frightful vengeance 
for these
bitter wrongs.

<h3>Fri. July 4.</h3>
<p>What are the people in Yankeedom thinking of today?  Perhaps
however they have not got the breath yet & are still hugging the
delusion that Richmond will soon be theirs.  Mac. will get up a battle
of falsehoods as usual, but truth will out sometime, & how astound


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson6.jpg">page 6</a></h2>
<p>ing when it comes.  Pity, pity, that the Northern people should
have been made the dupes of such a set of knaves.  I seldom think of
it without remembering the lying spirit which was permitted to take
posession of Ahab's prophets that he might be persuaded to go to R- &
fall.  This judgement from God has fallen upon the North because of
their declension from him.  Its effects, it is true, have come upon
us, & more heavily thus far than upon them, but the end is not yet.
We too have cause for deep humiliation, but we shall achieve our
independence, & if guided aright, shall [] a high destiny & be far
more prosperous than ever yore.  Never for one moment since this
struggle commenced has my mind wavered as to the final result.


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson7.jpg">page 7</a></h2>
Never could I for one moment believe that a righteous God would
suffer us to be trodden down as the mud of the streets, overtaken as
cruel and insolent invaders might thereafter.  Too many prayers have
been ascending to heavens night & day for such an event to come to
pass.  Retribution may possibly be delayed a short time but it will
most assuredly come.  The violent dealing of the wicked will acrue
down upon his own head.  May heaven lighten the blow, & turn the
hearts of both nations to him & to one another.

<h3>Sab. July 6</h3>
<p>About this time the funeral of <name>Wm. H. Randolph</name> took 
place.  He lies
in the center of the grave yard by the side of his young wife.  Was
killed in the battles of Richmond. Not long after was the funeral of
<name>Mrs. Buchanan</name>.  And after was the funeral of <name>George
Baylor</name> killed at the
battle of Cedar Run in his 20th year, so young, & such a universal
favorite.

<h3>Dec. 29</h3>
<p>A long hiatus.  Couldn't help it. So many things to occupy the
attention.  It would be in vain to attempt to enumerate the multitudes
of events which have happened since the last date.  The 29th & 30th of
Aug. the second battle of Manassas took place.  At this battle <name>Col.
Wm. Baylor</name> was killed, leaving a heartbroken wife & mother & 
sister to
mourn his loss, but they have hope in his death.  <name>James
Gabert</name> was
also killed in this battle.  His brother <name>John</name> was wounded 
before but
died after, & was brought home to be buried.  <name>L Kerr</name> another 
neighbor
of ours died the 14th Sept. of typhoid fever.  Before this on the
10th, little <name>Emily Baylor</name> died of diptheria.  On the
20th, <name>David B.</name>
died of the same disease at the age of twelve.  Thus two or rather
six, died out of three families, two from each.  Fifteen new of cases
have been added to our [] and during this year.  A <name>Mrs.
Wright</name> living
with her two of three [] went to S. to see her son who was wounded,
took the small

<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson9.jpg">page 9</a></h2>
<p>pox, & she & her husband died.  The son of another neighbor came
from the army with it, and nearly all the family took it.  One, an
infant died.  Another neighbor who visited them took it, & died.

<h3>Jan 1, 1863</h3>
<p>When has a year departed so crowded with events, & such events as
the last.  How many battles have we fought, & how has God blessed our
armies with victory.  Blessed be the Lord who has not given us up a
prey to their battle.  As a nation, we have in a measure acknowledged
God, & he has appeased for us most wonderfully, on one occasion giving
us two great victories in one day; one at Richmond in Kentucky, & the
other I think at Leesburg in Va.  Our President, who is a plain,
simple, consistent Christian, as appears, a member of the Episcopal
church, has appointed days of special prayer on those occasions, when
our cause seems dark, our prospect rather, & in every case, the answer
was manifest.  After the two victories in one day, a day of
thanksgiving was appointed & generally & joyfully observed.  It was
stated in


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson11.jpg">page 11</a></h2>
<p>the Co. Presbyterian, that services were held in the churches,
business generally suspended, & the city had the air of a quiet
Sabbath.  Three out of four daily papers closed their offices.
<p>We have cause for gratitude more than we can express, that we have
civil & military leaders who acknowledge God.  The Pres. and vice
Pres. <name>Stephens</name>, the commander in chief of our armies,
<name>Robert E. Lee</name> who
is said to be a Christian of the same stamp as <name>Davis</name>,
<name>Stonewall
Jackson</name>, who is an elder in the Pres. ch in Lexington, his brother in
law, <name>Gen D. H. Hill</name>, & others.  <name>Gen. Jackson</name> 
sent a special request to
the churches some time since for their prayers.  He writes in the Whig
& other papers in Nov. called upon the ladies every where to unite in
support of prayer for <u>peace</u> either singly or socially on the
first of Dec. at 12 o'clock.  I know not how far it was observed, but
have no doubt wherever known

<h3>Jan. 8,</h3>
<p>The first of Jan has come & gone, & <name>Lincoln</name>'s 
proclamation has
brought no desolation.  What awful disappointment will be expressed by
our friends the abolitionists.  Never was a more quiet and orderly
Christmas & New Years.  Even <name>Sister C.</name> who is so quiet and 
timid,
<u>forgot</u> to be afraid!  I do not forget it, but a little
circumstance may show how much I was terrified.  <name>Bro. L.</name> 
having been
to Charlottesville, <name>Cousin S</name>, went to S. for him, & did not 
get home
till late.  I sat up for them, and having occasion to visit my
chambers, went repeated ly in the dark & near midnight.  Indeed, never
since have I been in this state have I felt any reluctance to visiting
any part of the house in the dark either here or in Highland.
<p>This whole agitation about slavery wh. has prevailed at the S.
these years, is the most


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson13.jpg">page 13</a></h2>
<p>monstrous humbug ever got up since the flood.  I am if
possible a thousand times better satisfied of the prosperity of
slavery than I was before the war.  I believe this violent abolition
spirit grows out of attempting to be wise above what is written, & it
shows itself out where it is carried out, by leading those possessed
with it to throw away the bible.  It is my full belief that the
infatuation which has precipitated the North into this war, is a
judgement from God upon them for their deep declension from him
manifested among other ways by their fanaticism and every other ism.
The fear of the Lord had nearly f? above the land, as there is season
to fear & therefore their whirlwind had suffered to burst upon them.
It has spent much of its force upon us thus far, but if this is the
end of the matter, I have miscalculated this eclipse altogether.
Both nations may have to make a long sojurn in

<h3>Mh. 6,</h3>
<p>Have written but little for a long time on account of
indisposition.  Am staying in bed from influenza, but must try to
write a little about <name>Bp. Meade</name>.  He died within a few 
months, had been
bishop of the diocese of Va. more than 30 yrs.  <name>Sister C.</name> 
had known
him for her childhood, & says he was one of the most excellent &
devoted of the episcopal clergy which is saying not a little in her
opinion.  <name>Bishop Meade</name> used often to come to her aunt's 
where she spent
much of her time when a child, & she describes him as one of the
meekest & most Godly of men.  Not many years since, he attended a
confirmation in Staunton, <name>Sister C.</name> happened to be present 
and told me
on her return how solemn & searching his address was.  He lived near
Winchester had embelished his place with the finest fruits & flow-


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson15.jpg">page 15</a></h2>
<p>ers, & there was his wife's grave.  Just before his death, he was
called to Richmond to consecrate <name>Bishop Wilmer</name>.  That 
finished he was
attacked with disease which speedily removed him to his home above.
On his deathbed he called for <name>Bishop Johns</name> who was as a son 
to him, &
gave him his opinion of the war.  He told him the cause in which we
are engaged is a <u>holy</u> cause - but I will leave the space.  I
can get the printed account. (Cannot obtain it.)
<p>One bitter pang his Heavenly Father kindly spared him, the
knowledge <u>that his beautiful hime had been desecrated & desolated
by the ruthless Yankees.</u> I say <u>Yankees</u> because that is the
universal appellation given her to the whole nation.

<p>Owing to the inflation of our economy, produced in part by the
abundant issue of treasury notes, our business affairs are involved in
much perplexity.  Every article is from two or three time its usual
value.  Corn is 3,25 a bushel, flour 20 or 25 dollars a barrel, pork
30, a hundred, butter from one to two dollars a pd in R.  Those who
have much to sell make great profits, but those who have all to buy
and little to sell like ourselves, are in danger of faring hardly.
Providence has kindly provided for us however.  We had some stores on
hand of sugar, molasses, coffee, clothing, shoes &c.  Some lady not
far off lately bought two calico dresses for 50 dollars apiece, but we
have had to buy nothing, & as to bread stuff, some of my brother's
people, have sold to him at the old prices.


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson17.jpg">page 17</a></h2>
<p>It is a hard case that my money is beyond my reach in this time of
need.  I have no claim upon this family, do not even teach the
children since <name>Cousin S.</name> commenced his school, &
<name>Sister C.</name> often tells
me she wishes me to do nothing but what I find necessary for
exercise.  Still I have ever been treated with the utmost kindness and
assured of a home as long as they have one.
<p>We have much to be grateful for.  For months we were under frequent
apprehensions that the Yankees would come in & get posession of the
Valley, but the Lord mercifully preserved us from the danger, & has
delivered us from the fear.  In our circumstances it would probably
have been death to some of us.  How many pleasant homes have these
barbarians desolated, strewing the gardens with fragments of glass &
china, filling the air with feathers from


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson18.jpg">page 18</a></h2>
the beds, hewing up for wood, or <u>boxing them up to send
home</u> How many churches have they polluted, how many graves
desecrated.  How have they soaked our soil with the blood of our
noblest & best & then to cap the climax of injury & insult, talk of
<u>reconstructing the union</u> May the righteous Lord plead our cause
against an ungodly nation, as he has done already, glory to his name.
Render not to them their deserts O Lord.  The Lord be gracious to all
there as well as here who have shown me kindness by wishing me well, &
reward them a thousandfold, & if any of them are polluted with their
guilt, cleanse them & deliver them from the doom that hangs over that
land.  A just God will visit sooner or later, & there will be no escape
but by deep repentance.  I cherish the cheering conviction howeverm
that most if not all of my friends are clear from this guilt.
<p>We hear a good deal of late about the S. W.

<p>backing out from the war.  Wish they would make haste & do it &
send us some of their corn & bacon.  We are bound to have Missouri,
Kentucky & Maryland with us.  The S. W. will make a treaty of peace &
commerce with us, & the rest may go to grass (speaking after the
manner of men) or wherever else they can find pasture.  The government
at W. seems to have become awfully corrupt, & will probably be removed
in some way which time will reveal.  There is a piece in the Whig from
the London Times about <u>Lincoln the Last</u> in which he is set
forth about right.

<h3>Mh. 11,</h3>
<p>A young man from the neighborhood, not half a mile distant indeed,
was taken by the Yankees a few months since, & has not returned.  They
look for him daily as prisoners have been exchanged, but he comes
not.  Hope it will not be with him as with <name>Willie Hite</name>, 
another young
man living a few miles from us, who had been taken, & reached home
only to die from the hardships he had experienced.

<p><name>James Holladay</name>, <name>Sister C</name>'s nephew, was a 
similar instance.  He was
in Williamsburg sick when that place was taken, attempted to escape,
but fell from exhaustion & was taken by them.  He was taken to
Washington first, says he had no special reason to complain of his
treatment there.  Many things were sent in by the secession ladies.
He was soon removed however to Ft. Delaware, where he was treated in
the most inhuman manner, had nothing but a narrow board, or rather
two, one overlapping the other, a sort of shelf to lie on, a little
piece of fat meat & bread twice a day, & was cursed & kicked about by
the officers, some of them Dutch, with their thick boots, especially
those who were sick & could not work.  He was there four or five
months, his mother the meantime not knowing whether he was dead or
alive.  An exchange of prisoners was finally effected, & he was
brought home to die, lived two or three weeks after his return.  He
was a most amiable, unselfish youth, wholly devoted to his mother.

<h3>June 26</h3>
<p>We have glorious news from <name>Milroy</name>'s army.  We have taken 
Winchester
& several thousand prisoners & stores without number.  The old brute
himself narrowly escaped.  There is such a good story in the Whig I
must copy it.  It is told in a letter from a lady in Winchester.  She
says God only knows what we have had to bear from the Federals, & then
proceeds to speak among other things of an old negro who was kept on
nothing but water for three days because he refused to work & said he
was "secesh."  The fourth day an officer went to him with the inquiry
"Are you secesh yet?"  His reply was "<u>Bless de Lord, Massa, I is
secesh yet.</u>" He was then set to splitting wood with iron balls
attached to his hands & feet.  This Lady's brother was the the guard
house & saw him, & saying he ought to have iron balls on his 


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson22.jpg">page 22</a></h2>
<p>neck & arms.  The old fellow went on splitting saying "Bless de
Lord, massa, any where you can put 'em.  You can kill de body but you
can't kill de soul, & when dat gets to heaven, <u>it will be secesh
yet.</u>" Noble fellow.  It does one good to hear such instances.  I
do not know how I could stand the starving process myself, but think I
would have to be right hungry before I would give in.  She adds that
her brother called to the officer saying, "Hello Grant, is that what
you call freedom."

<h3>July 8, 1864</h3>
<p>Long time has elapsed since the foregoing was written, &
innumerable have been the events which have transpired in the
interval.  The most important of these to me are two severe illnesses
which have occured since last Oct.  A few particulars of these I will
note down, as I write for the information of my northern friends,
should say of them have the curiosity to read this journal & leave
herewith the request that it may be forwarded to them at some future
time should it not be in my power to do it myself.
<p>The attacks spoken of bore symptoms of typhoid pneumonia at first,
& the fever in each attack continued many days, especially the
quickness of the pulse, ranging from 120 to 125.  This was attended &
suceeded by extreme prostration so that many of my friends apprehended
that I would never be able to arise.  By the blessing of God, however,
upon the close attention


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson24.jpg">page 24</a></h2>
<p>of my physicians & the most careful nursing, I was at length
restored although confined to my my bed the second time nearly three
months.  I cannot at all do justice to my feelings here without
speaking positively of <name>Sister C.</name>'s kindness in watching over 
me with
the tenderest care by day & by night through both these illnesses.
Much more might be added did not my limits forbid.  I must be indulged
in describing my little bed, set under the windows by the side of
hers, & at right angles with it, in here for the last eight nor nine
months, I have slept at night & lain often a great part of the day.
<p>Some of the neighbors sat up with me a few nights, but for the most
part, <name>Eva</name> attended upon me, sleeping in the same room & 
bringing me
nourishment at bedtime & at midnight & soon in the morning.  If she
got worn out, <name>Sister C<<name>name>. in spite of all my persuasions, 
would do it
herself.
<p>For weeks during the second illness, I took no
</a></h2>

<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson25.jpg">page 25</a></h2>
<p>solid food & very little of anything.  The doctor however said I
must eat often, & after I began to get an appetite I did not fail to
profit by his suggestion, for my stomach felt like a shrivelled scroll
if I did not eat very frequently.  No one would have supposed I could
lose much flesh, but I did, & when able to rise from my bed, looked
like a walking skeleton.  By a kind Providence, we had a small
quantity of cocoa on hand.  This suited me pretty well, which was
fortunate as I could not take tea & coffee.  I was kept constantly
supplied with chicken soup, which with porridge & a little bread &
butter formed a sufficient variety.  But enough on this head.

<h3>July 9</h3>
<p>One thing I omitted to mention, a severe cough a thing very unusual
for me.  It hung on for many weeks, & indeed is not entirely cured
yet.  This cough seemed a sort of epidemic.  Within the last year, it
has prevailed extensively, has been so violent & long con-

<p>tinued, that many have insisted it was the whooping cough, even
those who have had that already.
<p>I was taken the second time, the last of Feb.  Have recovered so as
to be able to go about the house but not so as to go to church or to
visit abroad, & feel still very weak so that it often requires a
painful effort to get about.  During this time, <name>Sister C.</name> 
has been
sick two or three times.  Once she had inflamation of the stomach &
was threatened with apoplexy but was mercifully spared to us.
<name>Eva</name> was
sick & laid up for some time, & she got over done.  One of the
neighbors lent us a little chap to wait on me.  <name>Josie</name> was 
sick a long
time too, though not at the same time with his mother.
<p>Our friends at the North have probably been thinking some about us
of late, hearing that the Yankees have taken Staunton, though
<u>what</u> they have thought is beyond my power to divine, ignorant
as we

<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson27.jpg">page 27</a></h2>
<p>are of each others feelings.  <name>Sister C.</name> & I very often 
talk of
them, wonder how they fare & what they think of us, whether they set
us down for incorrigible rebels against "the best government in the
world," always winding up however by arguing that we do not & cannot
believe they favor this unjust & abominable war, though such strange
things happen these days that nothing ought to astonish us.
<p>But I commenced with the intention of telling a story about some
Yankee raiders.  We have often had alarms about their coming but have
been preserved by a kind Providence until this season.  Not long
since, they favored us with two visits (on June 9 & 10th) which will
not soon by forgotten in these parts.  The first day, they came in
from the West, across the mountain.  A party of 40 or 50 perhaps, came
riding up, dismounted & rushed in.  "Have you got any whiskey" said
they, "got any flour?  got any bacon?" with plenty of oaths "Come on
boys," says one, "we'll find it all"  With that, they pushed rudely


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson28.jpg">page 28</a></h2>
<p>by <name>Sister C.</name> who was terribly alarmed, & had been from 
the first
news of their coming, & spread themselves nearly all over the house.
Finding their way to a fine barrel of flour which a neighbor had given
us, they proceeded to fill their sacks & pillow cases, scattering a
large percent on the floor, till it was nearly exhausted.  The last
one told us, on our remonstrating, to hide the rest.
<p>Some went upstairs, opened every trunk & drawer & tossed things
upside down or on the floor, even my nice bonnets, pretending to be
looking for arms.  They stole <name>Cousin Samuel</name>'s gold sleeve 
buttons &
pin (a present to him) his best shirt, a good coat, & pair of shoes.
The shoes, it being nearly impossible to get shoes these days, he
afterwards persuaded the fellow to sell him back for an Ohio ten
dollar note, as good as gold to him.  He could with a much better
appetite doubtless have knocked him down,

<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson29.jpg">page 29</a></h2>
<p>but there was no choice in the matter.
<p>We did not say anything to provoke them, but did not disguise our
sentiments.  They went peeping under the beds, looking for rebels as
they said.  <name>Baxter</name> told them there were no rebels here 
(meaning rebel
soldiers) <name>Cate</name> spoke & said <u>We are all rebels.</u>
<name>Ellen</name> spoke &
said "Yes <name>Baxter</name>, I am a rebel."  The Yankee looked up from her
drawer, which he was searching [] then, & said "That's right."
<name>Cate</name>
then said, "I am a rebel too & I <u>glory</u> in it."  When
<name>Sister C.</name>
remonstrated with them about taking the shoes, asking them why they
injured innocent persons who had taken no part in the war, one of them
replied, "You need not tell me that, I know all the people along here
have sons in the army."  She then pointed to B & said "That is my
only son."  <name>Ellen</name> then said, "I have no brothers in the 
army, I wish
from my heart I had."  He then said, "Now Sis, I don't wish you had
brothers in the


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson30.jpg">page 30</a></h2>
<p>in the army.  I wouldn't like to kill one of your brothers.  I got
some corn here," (pointing to his plunder) An officer rode up after the
rest had gone having the appearance of a gentleman, & asked civilly if
he could get some flour.  <name>Sister C.</name> telling him how they had 
stripped
us of nearly every thing they could find, said he could go & see what
they had left, & help himself.  He said no, he never had searched a
house & never would, & it was a shame they do so.
<p>That night they camped a mile or two from us, extending along the
road two or three miles, & got a fine supper from the farms around
them.  <name>Sister C.</name> was afraid to undress, but lay down quite 
exhausted
two or three hours in the night.  <name>Ellen</name> kept watch the first 
part of
the night, & <name>Cousin S.</name> the last.  E soon called to him, "I hear
footsteps."  He went out & saw some coming up the road with a torch.
Thinking they might be coming

<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson31.jpg">page 31</a></h2>
<p>to burn the house, he came to our door, saying we had better have
someithing ready to throw around us if we should be called out for any
reason taking care not to alarm us.  But our fears were groundless.
They started off in the night for Staunton where there were several
thousand of them.  Our visitors belonged to <name>Averill</name>'s command.
</div>
<div1 type="entry" n=18640713>
<h3>July 13,</h3>
<p>They told us that <name>Crook</name>'s men were a great deal worse 
than they, &
that was true, but they were bad enough & worse at some other places
than with us.  At one of our neighbors, <name>Mr. H.</name> they took 
every thing
they had to eat, all the pillow cases & sheets but what were on the
beds, & the towels & some of the ladies stockings.  One of them made
up a bundle of ladies clothing to take, but his comrade shamed him out
of it.  They then poured out their molasses, scattered their preserves
& sugar & other things about the floor, & mixed them all together &
destroyed things generally


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson32.jpg">page 32</a></h2>
<p>The ladies there are very amiable & genteel in their appearance
whcih makes it the more strange.  Their visitors as well as ours
however had taken a drop too much.  This gentleman had kept some
things for sale of late, had a quantity of tobacco & some other things
on hand, all which they took to the amount of several thousand
dollars.
<p>At another neighbors, they took all of their meat (some 30 pieces
of bacon) & nearly everything else they had to eat, all their horses
(4) & persuaded off their two negro men.  One of these was afterwards
seen by one of our men crying to come back, but was watched so closely
that he could not escape.  No wonder he cried.  He has been twice on
the brink of the grave with pneumonia, & was nursed by his mistress as
tenderly as if he had been a brother, & she was always kind to him,
his master also.  He will not find such treatment anywhere else


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson33.jpg">page 33</a></h2>
<p>The Yankees (I give them this appellation becaues every body else
does) took off all the negro men & boys they could, as well as all the
horses, told the women they would take <u>them</u> next time they
came.  Many sent their horses to the woods.  Some of these were found
& captured.  People here do their farming with horses instead of oxen,
& it is an impossible loss to have them and the servants swept off to
such an extent, just as harvest is about to begin too.  Many sent off
their servants in one direction & another, some of whom were overtaken
& captured & others escaped.
<p>The lady before mentioned has told me since that no tongue can tell
her feelings the day the Yankees were there.  In the first place, they
fired on her little son & another boy several times, as they sat on
the fence watching their approach, & afterwards pretended that they
took them for confederate soldiers from their being dressed in gray.
Then her husband & oldest son


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson34.jpg">page 34</a></h2>
<p>were hid in the bushes in the garden, & she was in momentary fear
of their being discovered & fired upon.  The men & boys always kept
out of the way, as they were sometimes taken off, & did not know what
treatment they might receive, & thus the women were left to shift for
themselves as best they could.  Another of our neighbors was fired
upon several times until he either dropped or lay down, it was not
known which.  They said it was because he ran, but he was passing
between their pickets & ours, who were firing at each other, & was
obliged to run.  We heard of the circumstance, & were very uneasy, but
he providentially escaped injury.  They always fire upon those who run
from them.
</div>

<div1 type="entry" n=18640715>
<h3>July 15,</h3>
<p>Those who left their houses fared worse than others, at least their
houses did.  The wife of a worthy miller living near us, became so
much alarmed that


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson35.jpg">page 35</a></h2>
<p>went with her little children to a neighbors'.  They stripped her
house completely, destroying everything, left nothing but a straw bed
& one sheet.  It was a hard case, for it was with difficulty that Mr.
H. with his large family, could get along before.  Another lady who
was alone, was so much frightened by a drunken soldier who came in,
that she left the house.  The Yankees destroyed every thing there
too.
<p>We were better off than most in having <name>Cousin S</name> with us.  
We feared
they would take him, but they only inquired if he was a soldier, &
when told that he was a teacher, did not molest him.  He had a large
school (upwards of 40) & had refused many more applications.  It was nearly
out at that time, & was closed abruptly because parents liked to stay at home
& keep their children with them.  He was the chief man in hiding our
things.  I know not wh[at]


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson36.jpg">page 36</a></h2>
<p>we should have done without him.  Some hid their things & had them
discovered but we were more fortunate.  (Some were betrayed by their
servants) Some hid nothing, thinking they would not be disturbed but
found themselves woefully mistaken.  Others thought they might be
worse dealt with if they hid anything.
<p>A lady near Staunton a little time since had two Yankee officers
come to take tea with her.  She was strong "secesh," but she got them
a good supper.  It was served up in very plain dishes.  They perceived
that she was wealthy, & inquired if she had not hid her plate &c.  She
told them she had.  They asked where.  She told them in the ash heap.
They said "That is not a good place.  It is the first place
searched."  They very kindly & politely showed her a good place
(in their opinion) She followed their advice & saved her things.  In
another instance, some Yankee officers politely showed a lady where to
hide her


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson37.jpg">page 37</a></h2>
<p>her silver &c.  The soldiers came & searched in vain.  Just as they
were going away, a little black chap who had followed them around says
to them in a tone of triumph, "Ah you did not find Missis things hid
inside the ____"  They went & found & took them.
<p>Very early on the morning of June 7th, knowing that the Yankees
were coming (the night had been mostly spent in preparing for them)
<name>Br. L</name> had taken <name>Eva</name> & <name>John</name>, the 
horse & rockaway, & started out he
knew not whither exactly, perhaps to Eastern Va.  He wanted to be
guided by circumstances.  We had been in a great quandry as to what
course was best for him to pursue.  If he went abroad, he might fall
into the hands of the Yankees.  If he staid at home, they would
probably take him, having such a spite against preachers & especially
as he has written & spoken so freely, that his sentiments are
generally known.  They might insist upon

<h3>July 16,</h3>
<p>It was finally concluded to ship the whole cargo, & let them go &
seek their fortune.  <name>Eva</name> had been right sick, threatened with
pneumonia, but when the time came, she was very anxious to go &
thought she was able.  So she wrapped up well, took a strong dose of
coffee, & set off.  We heard nothing from them for a week.  Then word
came that they had been seen riding behind a train of wagons which
they could not pass, & that those wagons were afterwards captured so
that there was little doubt they were taken too.  <name>Sister C.</name> 
was in
such a state from anxiety, loss of sleep & fatigue, for she & the
children had had all <name>Eva</name>'s work to do, that this news 
brought on
spasms such as she used to have.  A note was now brought in from a
friend, saying that <name>Mr. E.</name> was seen at such a time in E. Va. 
beyond
the reach of the Yankees, & was therefore safe.  There might be some
mistake about this, but we tried to believe it & rest upon it.


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson40.jpg">page 40</a></h2>
<p>In a few days, we got a letter from <name>brother L.</name> saying 
that he hoped
to get home soon, & so he did.
<p>It seems he wandered around for several days, & then went over to
E. Va, to Amherst County where he taught school on first coming to
Va. but here he was not safe.  In a day or two, news came that the
Yankees were coming, & were just upon them, He mounted his horse &
made for the woods, his host also, taking their servants with them.
They barely escaped, for in five minutes from the first alarm the
Yankees were in the house.  The fugitives slept in the woods three
nights which was no benefit to <name>Eva</name> in her weak state.  She 
has not
been well since her return, but has lingered along sometimes better &
sometimes worse, & is now under the doctor's care.  The Yankees took
from this plantation several hundred weight of bacon (nearly all there
was) a hundred bushels of corn, a quantity of flour, oats &c. & all
the horses.

<h3>July 19</h3>
<p>I have been anticipating. On the 10th of June we received another
visit from our invaders, at least, several thousand of them passed our
house on their way from Staunton to Lexington.  <name>Sister C.</name> 
requested
one of them who was gentlemanly in his appearance, to guard us, & he
did so.  They were four hours in passing.  None of them came in but
the guard.  Some went in the spring house however, & helped themselves
to milk & one went off with a large panfull in each hand.
<name>Ellen</name>
called after him to "Bring back those pans," but he only laughed &
went on.  Another who had been taking a cool draught from a pan, came
out with his chin covered & some on the end of his nose, like a cat
from the cream pot.  E. accosted him with "<u>Ar'nt you ashamed</u>?"
putting on as much emphasis as she well could & adding, "Who do you
think is going to drink that milk, after you have put your nose in
it!"  The fellow made no reply but walked off.


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson42.jpg">page 42</a></h2>
<p>I did not see much of them, <name>Sister C.</name> prefering to have 
me stay
home in our room.  I was just getting able to walk about.  They did
not find the way down there at all.  The room was built on after we
came here, & they might have thought that the door had [] into it, led
out of doors.  I did not feel afraid of them in the least, but did not
have opportunity to say much to them.
<p>Volumes might be written, & doubtless will be, according them
heroic achievements, but I must cut my story short.  They burnt a
building in S. <name>Gov. Letcher</name>'s house, the military institute in
Lexington, & some of the mills about the country.  My brother had a
barrel of flour, four bushels of wheat & eight of corn at a mill a few
miles distant from us, all which they took, a great loss in these
times for a poor preacher.  It was the


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson43.jpg">page 43</a></h2>
<p>whole of wheat he received this year from the people at Walker's
Creek, where he supplies one fourth of his time.  I forgot to say that
they took from us, a very large ham of bacon, two large rolls of
butter & whatever else they could lay their hands on, at the first
visit.
</div>
<div1 type ="entry" n=18640720>
<h3>July 20,</h3>
<p>One thing which happened at a neighbors was too good to omit.  A
fellow went into their spring house, helped himself to what he liked,
& finally lighted upon a jar of <u>tar</u>.  He asked what it was.  A
daughter of the family, the only person at home, told him it was
<u>blackberry jelly</u>.  He took it, & made off.  She called after
him to know if he would have some cream with it.  With that he put his
fingers in it, & began to suck them, then threww down the jar & went
off cursing with all his might.  His captain coming up just then,
asked the girl what that fellow was cursing so for.  When told, he
said he thought the Yankees were sharper than that.

<h3>July 21,</h3>
<p>It is doubtful whether this irruption should be called a raid, when
so many were consumed in it.  The number in S. was estimated at 15,000
or more.  Some passed here, & some took other routes.  It is natural
to inquire what became of this cloud of locusts from the bottomless
pit.  They told us, we need not trouble ourselves about our wheat
harvest, for they were coming back to reap it for us, but the good
Lord disappointed their expectation.  It was reported that many of
them suffered greatly, & some even perished with hunger afterwards, in
passing through some districts which they had ravaged.  Their violent
dealing if so came down upon their own pate.  They brought on quite a
number of reapers, which we captured.  As we had the work to do, it
was but fair that we should have the wherewith to do it, especially as
they broke up so many of our tools.


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson45.jpg">page 45</a></h2>
<p>But to return to our inquiry.  From Lexington they went to take
Lynchburg.  Our men followed them, but we had not enough to handle
them, till we got reinforcements near L.  Then they retreated before
us, & went on to Parkersburg & Wheeling.
<p>There is a report very current now, that <name>Gen. Grant</name> is 
killed, but
there are so many rumors that I never believe anything till confirmed
beyond a doubt.  It is too good news to be true.  Perhaps, however,
his cause was the best for us that could have been pursued.  He fought
our men in their fortifications, sacrificed them, & saved ours.  Will
he not have a heavy account to render, crimsoned with the guilt of so
many murders.

<h3>Aug. 9, </h3>
<p>The Central Presbyterian contains an advertisement copied from the

Minna, which was attempting to run the blockade.  Fine


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images//va.au.emerson46.jpg">page 46</a></h2>
<p>paper, beautiful print, flexible leather covers, & only weighing
two ounces--just the thing, says the editor, for our soldiers.  And
what good does any one suppose these testaments will do their
soldiers?  Will the blessing of God attend stolen goods?  A large lot
of bibles too he says, of the <u>same</u> kind.  Nothing has aroused
my indignation so much for a long time.  I could hardly go to sleep
the next night for thinking of it.  How outrageous for people calling
themselves <u>Christians</u> to be chuckling over the infamous
robberies of their countrymen, taking the bread of life out the mouths
of our famished soldiers, & giving it to profane creatures who will
not probably care the snap of their fingers for it.  If you ask me how
I know that their soldiers are more profane than ours, I answer in the
same way that I know most things, by testimony, abundant testimony
<u>thats our testimony</u>

<p>A long hiatus again, so <u>many</u> things of absorbing interest.
An item by the way from the Central Presbyterian.  It is estimated
that 142,000 Confederate soldiers


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson47.jpg">page 47</a></h2>
<p>have been converted as convicts since the war began.  If human
testimony can establish any thing it establishes this, that there has
been a most wonderful work of grace in our army.  How could a broader
seal have been set upon the righteousness of our cause?  The Lord has
looked upon our affliction & our pain, & forgiven our sins, to a
certain extent at least.  I have gradually arrived at the firm
persuasion that multitudes of our dying soldiers have been met by
redeeming grace.
<p><name>Mrs. Gilbert</name> one of our neighbors died a few months 
since, & when
dying, she exclaimed with delight "O there's <name>Jimmy</name> &
<name>Johnny</name>."  They
had come for their departing mother.  They were two of our young
soldiers who had died not very long before from wounds received in
battle.  No one knew the state of their minds, but does not this
circumstance support the hope that their pious mother's prayers had
been answered for them?  A similar instance, <name>Jimmy Holladay</name> 
when dying
exclaimed "O there's father."  These boys (the


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson48.jpg">page 48</a></h2>
<p>oldest was but just out of his teens) were excellent soldiers, went
to the army at the first sound of the trumpet, & had never taken a
furlough.  Their bodies were brought home & buried in one grave.  We
all thought they deserved a monument & accordingly <name>Ellen</name> 
went around &
soon collected about $500 for the purpose.  It cannot be obtained
however till after the war.  Men are drawn off so closely that it is
difficult to get a horse shod or a pair of shoes made or a stick of
wood hauled.  Then the most common articles are many of them
exceedingly rare.  But then if we do have to sit in the dark for
nights except for an hour or so that the children are learning their
lessons, & submit to multitudes of privations far greater than that,
we do it cheerfully as the price in part of our liberty.

<p>The New York Observer, it seems, is in the [] against us.  The
articles not many months since appeared discounting upon the causes of
the fail


<hr><h2><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson49.jpg">page 49</a></h2>
<p>ure to put down the rebellion--they had underestimated our strength
& overrated their own, the nation must go to work with new zeal &c.
Had they succeeded in grinding us to powder, it had pleased them well,
but they forgot the Power above who had "strengthed us, helped us, &
caused us to stand & will do so" unworthy as we are, & who will in his
own good time, bring us off conquerors & more than conquerors.
"Blessed be the Lord who has not given us as a prey to their killer."
And these to think of their high religious profession.  Sister C.
often says to one, "I have no faith in the Fulton St. prayer
meeting."  We used to attend it with great interest when in N.Y.  How
differently we should have felt had we known that some of those same
men perhaps, & perhaps not the same individuals, would be engaged in
one short year in hounding over their blood [] soldiers to robbery &
murder.  I used to read the
