Owing to the inflation of our economy, produced in part by the abundant issue of treasury notes, our
business affairs are involved in much perplexity. Every article is from two or three time its usual
value. Corn is 3,25 a bushel, flour 20 or 25 dollars a barrel, pork 30, a hundred, butter from one to
two dollars a pd in R. Those who have much to sell make great profits, but those who have all to
buy and little to sell like ourselves, are in danger of faring hardly. Providence has kindly provided for
us however. We had some stores on hand of sugar, molasses, coffee, clothing, shoes &c. Some lady
not far off lately bought two calico dresses for 50 dollars apiece, but we have had to buy nothing, &
as to bread stuff, some of my brother's people, have sold to him at the old prices.
