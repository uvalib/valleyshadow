Dear Beak.<br>

<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I came to this place from Waynesboro several days ago, it is situated on the Virg. Central R. Road, 21 miles West of Staunton & 18 miles East of Charlottesville.  We now have all of our goods at this point.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Samuel's family is here, as well as all of the Caviden family.  Sam went to Gordon's ville this morning, where Top Coffman, [illegible], & Mahaney also are.  We expect to ship our things to Gordonsville soon.  It is likely I shall remain at Greenwood several days, as we cannot get cars to transport our stores.  I received your letter on yesterday direct here from Waynesboro & was very sorry to hear that Mary was sick.  I hope she is better again.  Should you write to me direct to Greenwood Depot, Albemarle Co. Va. & if I should move to Gordonsville or Charlottesville I will have the Post-Master to forward your letter.  As to the position of our Army Gen'l Jackson is at Conrad's Store, Rockingham Co. & the Yankees between Harrisonburg & Staunton.  Gen'l Edward Johnson at Westview, 6 miles west of Staunton & the Yankees at Buffalo Gap in Augusta 10 miles west of Staunton.  There is a good deal of excitement among the people in Albemarle & Augusta Counties.  People are leaving Staunton as fast as they can get off.  I do not know much to write about, my whole attention is occupied with our military Stores.  It is likely I may be in Gordonsville soon & likely we may turn off  at Charlottesville & go to Lynchburg.  How glad I am I paid you a visit to Madison last week as Providence only knows when I will get to see you again.  Should we get to remain any time in Gordonsville, I will write to you & you must try & come & bring the children down, as I would like to see you all again.  We are all so busy and I fear I could not get up to Madison, although I will do all I can to get up.  Tell your Pap I couldn't get any plaster, as to lime I think I could get plenty of it in Augusta, but there is no transportation at all for anything but government goods & even that is hard work to keep them far enough out of reach of the Yankees.  Tell your Pap I should like very much to accommodate him, & will as all I can to get them.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I do hope things will assume a more favorable aspect soon, as I assure you I am getting tired of situating all the time.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I can not hear a word from New Market .  Half of the men out of N.M. are in Augusta & Albemarle.  If you write to me soon direct to the post office, if you delay a day or two--direct it to Gordonsville--care of Capt S.M. Sommers.
