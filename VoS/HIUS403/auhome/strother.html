Before the war David Hunter Strother wrote and illustrated for 
<i>Harper's Magazine</i>, and published four renowned travel books.  Born 
in raised in Martinsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia), Strother was a 
Valley native.  With the gathering crisis, Strother staunchly supported 
slavery, but remained devoted to the preservation of the Union.  In 
mid-1861 he could be neutral no longer, and joined the U.S. Army.  In 
1864 he was in the staff of Gen. David Hunter, and shortly after the 
battle of Piedmont he became his chief of staff.  He resigned from the 
army when Sheridan took Hunter's command, and died in 1888.  Strother 
recorded a great deal in his war diary, and his perspective as "the 
enemy" as well as "the native" to the Shenandoah Valley is invaluable.  
Below are the 1864 diary entries from May 31 to June 10, by David Hunter 
Strother, the "Virginia Yankee."
<hr>
MAY 3I, TUESDAY.<hr>
. . . In the kitchen of Rude's House lived a woman of the mountain breed 
with a large family and one or more married daughters. Last night two of 
these women had babies. The General had rebuked Provost Marshal Starr for 
permitting Rebels to come within our lines, and he was sore on the 
subject. Seeing Starr drinking punch in the tent, I approached him with 
an alarmed look. "Colonel," I said, "two Rebel citizens came into camp 
last night without papers and are now about headquarters kicking up a 
row." The Colonel, alarmed and indignant, called hastily to the guard to 
arrest them. He wanted to know who had seen them. I referred him to Dr. 
[R. S.] Hayes and the joke came out.
<p>
At midday it was intensely hot and everybody slept. We are not to move 
until we hear from Crook. A regiment under Major [Joseph K.] Stearns has 
been sent to burn Newtown in revenge for the loss of our train there. It 
seems this train was taken in the streets of the town by Harry Gilmor. A 
captain of the guard was killed and some prisoners taken, and by wine, 
drunk, no doubt.
<hr>
JUNE 1, WEDNESDAY.<hr>
La Rouchefoucauld says the way men bring themselves to face danger is by 
turning their thoughts aside from it and occupying their thoughts with 
something else. I yesterday overheard a freckled-faced boy discoursing 
with a comrade in this wise, "Some men when they go in think they are 
going to be killed. That's not a good way. I try not to think about it at 
all." It seemed singular to me to hear the maxim of a philosopher, 
scholar, and wit repeated so exactly by a raw boy who never thought much 
and perhaps never read anything. Thus it is that the wisdom of the sage 
renowned in history goes no further and teaches no more than the 
practical experience of the people.... We move tomorrow. Fired and 
reloaded my pistol.
<hr>
JUNE 2, THURSDAY.<hr>
My fine bay horse disappeared this morning, stolen probably.... The 
ground along the road from New Market to Spartapolis lies just as it does 
at New Market, a series of similar military positions. We were stopped 
near Big Spring by a Rebel picket which skirmished with our cavalry. 
While halted here to reconnoiter, news came that our rear was attacked. 
This produced some excitement and tremor, more than was agreeable to see. 
The attack was nothing more than a bushwhacking of a wagon guard which 
had tarried behind for forage. Nobody was hurt. We stopped in sight of 
Harrisonburg on the hills north of town. Our advanced cavalry skirmished 
sharply with the enemy, driving him out of the town....
<p>
After locating the troops we took the house of a Mr. Grey for 
headquarters, a fine brick house on a hill above the town and where taste 
and comfort were visible at every turn. In his library I found John P. 
Kennedy's Swallow Barn with my illustrations and also Harper's Magazine 
with the "Porte Crayon" series. The office of the Rock-ingham Register 
was gutted, the press broken up, and the debris burned in the street, the 
rain falling on the heap of ashes....
<hr>
JUNE 3, FRIDAY.<hr>
. . . The enemy is reported to be at Mt. Crawford in a strong position 
with the River in front. They are fortifying and intend to fight us 
there, and their force including Bradley Johnson's command and militia is 
about twenty-five hundred. The sound of distant cannon has been heard by 
several persons, some report from the direction of Buffalo Gap and others 
say from the gunboats below Richmond. This is an immense distance to hear 
guns, but they are one- and twohundred-pounders and the citizens say they 
are frequently heard here....
<p>
I advised the General to move by way of Port Republic, cross the river 
there, and take Waynesboro with his cavalry, thereby cutting off stores 
and railroad stock at Staunton. He would also cut off the enemy that way, 
which would demoralize him greatly. This he determined to do, moving in 
the morning.... The requisition on the town for meat and flour has 
created great consternation and disgust. It seems hard but it is 
necessary as the army must feed. The soldiers in addition are plundering 
dreadfully from all accounts. This is not necessary and should not be 
permitted, especially as there are some wounded Union soldiers here who 
have been well treated by the citizens.
<p>
Major Stearns who was sent back to burn Newtown got in today. The people 
he said were in no wise guilty and had made a general submission to the 
Government, taking the oath of allegiance. He therefore had used his 
discretion and not burned the place. The General was angry and ordered 
him to make a written report. I complimented Stearns and told him the 
chief's anger would blow over. I took an opportunity to speak on the 
subject and satisfied the General that Stearns was right. After nightfall 
a number of rockets were sent up from the top of the house to warn Crook 
of our position. There was no response that we could see.
<hr>
JUNE 4, SATURDAY.<hr>
Rose early and left Harrisonburg by the Port Republic road. Passed the 
spot where Ashby fell and the Cross Keys battleground. At the urgent 
request of Meigs and myself a regiment of cavalry was sent to demonstrate 
against Mt. Grawford, Meigs conducting the troops himself. Our advance 
drove off a picket of the enemy who escaped toward Mt. Crawford. The 
enemy evidently did not expect us to move by this route and so far have 
had no information of our line of march. This picket will carry the news 
by the time we have crossed the river.... At the river in front of Port 
Republic we stopped and getting up the pontoon train started to throw the 
bridge. It was awkwardly done and so slow that it was evident that we 
would lose all the benefit of our early march. There seemed to be no one 
of the engineers who understood how to put up the canvas pontoons, and 
Meigs was absent with the cavalry demonstration. In an orchard under an 
apple tree I found General Stahel who gave me a Rebel newspaper to read. 
There was in it a letter from a Sanitary Commission agent thanking 
persons for contributions. It was ludicrous and yet painful to read, as 
indicating the dreadful poverty of the country. The articles detailed 
were a bundle of rags from J--B--, three eggs from Mrs. A--M--, four 
chickens from X--, a dozen red peppers and two onions from Q--E--, etc., 
a long list.
<p>
Thirteen wagons carrying forage to the enemy were captured at Port 
Republic by our cavalry and scouts. Ellicott says they should have 
captured a hundred, but the cavalry was cowardly. While we were talking, 
a cavalry trumpeter attempted to cross the river and was washed from his 
horse and drowned. Half a dozen men stripped and went in to save him, but 
were not able to do this or to find his body. At the same time the woolen 
factory on the opposite side was in flames. We were not able to cross the 
pontoon bridge until six P.M. The troops were bivouacked in line of 
battle a mile south of the town. The hill in which Weyer's Cave is found 
was in full view two miles distant. By the delay in crossing the river 
and this untimely halt we lost the opportunity of making a dash to 
Waynesboro.
<hr>
JUNE 5, SUNDAY.<hr>
I was awaked this morning by General Hunter himself. We felt certain that 
this would be a day of battle, and after advancing a few miles the 
cavalry began skirmishing and the first New York battalion led by Major 
Stearns made a fine charge, driving the enemy pelf mell and capturing 
over seventy prisoners. Among our prisoners was Captain Imboden, brother 
of the general, and a Captain Phillips from the James River near Brandon. 
I was ordered to examine these men and got from the first batch but 
little of importance. Captain Imboden was a handsome fellow, gay and 
excited from the recent "Echaufferie." I gave him a drink from my bottle 
and went to the front again....
<p>
The whole army was drawn up in order of battle. Behind us a large mill at 
Mt. Meridian was ascending in volumed flame. The 13th Connecticut which 
disgraced itself at New Market was drawn up to hear an address from the 
General. His address was not oratorical but direct and soldierly. He told 
them the enemy was before them and they would presently have a chance of 
retrieving their reputation. They didn't seem much elated with the 
prospect and scarcely got up a decent cheer in response.
<p>
As the enemy did not advance, our troops were put in motion and the 
cavalry continued to drive the enemy back upon their main position. 
Forward was the word to horse, foot, and artillery. We were advancing 
over some hills and slopes, the enemy was posted on the rising ground 
around the village of Piedmont [New Hope] concealed in the woods as 
usual. Already the shells and shot began to whistle around our ears. Our 
artillery I thought all this time was too distant, and I persuaded the 
General to have it all brought up. He consented and ordered DuPont to 
place two batteries in positions on a spur on the left.... About 11:30 
the enemy's artillery seemed to be silenced by our heavier fire and he 
seemed to be retiring at all points. There was doubt whether the enemy's 
silence was not a deceitful calm covering some important movement. The 
General and staff rode forward for some distance in front of the 
batteries to reconnoiter.
<p>
The enemy's position was strong and well chosen. It was on a conclave of 
wooded hills commanding an open valley between and open, gentle slopes in 
front. On our right in advance of the village of Piedmont was a line of 
log and rail defenses very advantageously located in the edge of a forest 
and just behind the rise of a smooth, open hill so that troops moving 
over this hill could be mowed down by musketry from the works at short 
range and to prevent artillery being used against them. The left flank of 
this palisade rested on a steep and impracticable bluff sixty feet high 
and washed at its base by the Shenandoah. Just behind this work was the 
village itself, a single street of wooden houses, and nearly a mile in 
the rear was another line of rail defenses also located in the border of 
a wood crossing the valley and terminating with the twenty-pounder 
battery on the ridge to their extreme right. This was the view of the 
field from the bluff whence we made the reconnoissance.
<p>
No sooner had the staff appeared on the open, rising ground than the 
whole of the enemy's heretofore silent guns opened on it. After a 
satisfactory view the General retired into an adjoining wood where the 
vengeful shell pursued him until the prompt and well-delivered return 
from our two batteries directed by Captain DuPont in person silenced 
them. While we were in this position Sullivan advanced to attack the 
palisades in his front. The advance was gallantly made and the roar of 
musketry continuous. This was about one P.M. But in a few moments we had 
the mortification to see the lines break and retire in confusion, while 
the enemy followed, advancing from their works with yells of triumph 
mingled with the derisive cries of "New Market, New Market." The staff 
withdrew to a house in the center of the valley to watch the movements. 
The escort was ordered to dismount behind the house so as not to attract 
fatal fire. We found here some skulkers plundering and two women crying 
bitterly. The soldiers were kicked and driven out and the women 
reassured. The General asked for the owner of the house and was informed 
that he was down in the cellar with the little children. The General had 
him brought out and reviled him for his cowardice. He said he was a 
Dunkard preacher and a Union man and begged we would not let our horses 
bark his apple trees. This request at a time when a bloody battle was 
going on with death around and the fate of an army uncertain disgusted us 
all. [Major Daniel H.] Harkins cursed the fellow and ordered him into the 
cellar again with his whimpering boys....
<p>
It became evident that the enemy was massing his whole power in front of 
Sullivan for a decisive attack. The troops could be seen moving from 
behind the more distant works around the village and into the wood. 
Colonel Starr was ordered to ride with full speed to Colonel Thoburn1 and 
order him to move his brigade across the valley and assail the enemy's 
open flank. The critical point of the day had arrived as the yells of the 
combatants increased. At length Thoburn's columns appeared moving in 
gallant array across the open field. He crossed the meadow and was rising 
the opposite slope before the enemy seemed to notice his movement. Even 
then only a few shots from the distant battery struck his lines. The 
shells struck and burst, and the line closed up without confusion or 
appearance of trepidation. As this gallant infantry moved in line and 
column to its destination, news came that General Stahel had been wounded 
and also that a train of supply wagons convoyed by five hundred cavalry 
instead of following us to Port Republic had taken the direct road to 
Staunton....
<p>
I rode back to see Stahel, who had been wounded in the arm by a piece of 
shell. He said it pained his arm too much to ride but he started on foot 
to the front. I rode back then at a full trot, the earth shook with the 
roar of guns and musketry, and the fresh, hearty cheers rose with the 
smoke and sounded like victory. Back rolled the cheers from the front. 
Stretcher men, ambulance drivers, wounded men, butchers, bummers, and all 
took up the shout and back upon the hill crests. Negroes, teamsters, and 
camp followers re-echoed the joyful shout. I saw streams of greybacks and 
butternuts passing from the woods at a double-quick guarded by cavalry 
men with drawn satires. The cheers redoubled as the squads of captives 
continued to stream across the open ground to our rear....
<p>
While we stood there I saw some Rebel officers talking with their guard 
and gesturing toward our group. Presently an orderly approached and said 
that two officers wished to see the General. Two spry-looking officers 
advanced, and one addressing the General introduced himself as Captain 
[Boyd] Faulkner of Martinsburg and claimed kindred. The General was curt 
and hardly civil and presently ordered the sergeant to take them to the 
rear. I said nothing but Lang asked Faulkner if he did not know Colonel 
Strother. I had so far said nothing but upon this introduction I bowed. 
The Captain exclaimed, "What, Colonel Strother, are you here too?" He 
came up and shook hands, introducing his companion whose name I forget. 
He said he could have escaped but that he preferred to be taken rallying 
his men.
<p>
At three P.M. the enemy were routed and in full retreat. The cavalry came 
in with the report that the Rebel General Jones was killed and brought 
some papers and small articles taken from the body to prove the 
statement. The General desired me to go down and verify it beyond a 
doubt. I found a crowd around a body coarsely clothed in a dirty grey 
suit without any military trappings or insignia about it. He had on a 
pair of fine military boots well worn and fine woolen underclothes 
perfectly clean and new. His hands were small and white, and his 
features, high white forehead, brown beard, and long hair indicated the 
gentleman and man of the upper class. I concluded that this was truly the 
body of the General. Just then four Rebel prisoners came up with a 
stretcher to carry the body to burial under the orders of the provost 
marshal. I asked each of these men if they recognized the body. They 
said, "Yes, that is the body of our commander, General William E. Jones." 
Meanwhile Lang visited his pockets and got some curious papers from it. 
One contained a memorandum in figures giving a summation of his forces at 
seven thousand men and sixteen guns. The other was a letter to General 
Jones from General Imboden....
<p>
The cavalry followed the enemy about a mile and then got a round of grape 
and canister in their faces which drove them back. I was very anxious to 
follow up vigorously, but to my mortification the General ordered the 
troops to go into camp on the battlefield, we taking headquarters in a 
small cottage in the village of Piedmont. The worthlessness of our 
cavalry was probably what induced the General to content himself with the 
affair as it stood. We had a good supper and a triumphant evening. The 
bands played and the men sang and shouted. The army was intoxicated with 
joy. Verily they had wiped out the disgrace of New Market. Sullivan had 
three horses shot under him and won laurels for gallantry today. The 
General wrote him a very complimentary letter....
<hr>
JUNE 6, MONDAY.<hr>
Started for Staunton.... A goose story. A soldier baited a hook with a 
piece of bread and set his line to catch something. A fighting gander 
belonged to an old woman and swallowed the bait. The soldier, having the 
other end of the line tied to his leg, walked off, the goose following 
and flapping his wings in a vain struggle to escape. The old lady went to 
the door and, seeing her, the soldier began to run, the gander now 
flapping vehemently. "Oh, don't run, sir," she cried, "He won't hurt you. 
Don't run. He is not dangerous at all." But the soldier kept on until out 
of sight and the gander was bagged.
<p>
At the junction of the Waynesboro and Staunton road we halted. I would 
have preferred to see our column take the Waynesboro road to finish 
Imboden, but the General kept on-the Staunton. The people along our route 
were either much frightened or very glad to see us. They greeted us 
pleasantly, waved their handkerchiefs, such as had them, and brought 
buckets of water or milk to quench our thirsts. As we neared the town a 
dozen or more girls in their Sunday dresses stood by the roadside in 
front of a cottage and presented us with bouquets. Whether this 
compliment was sincere and loyal or meant as a propitiation of the demons 
I could not tell.
<p>
Sam Stockton and several others who with a squad of cavalry had been sent 
forward to occupy the town sent back to report that they had been fired 
on by several men from the hills adjoining. I got two bands with a large 
American flag to accompany the staff as we entered the town. We made a 
tour of the principal streets playing "Hail Columbia" and "Yankee Doodle" 
and other such airs as we thought might be useful and pleasing to the 
inhabitants. A few skinny, sallow women peeped from between the 
half-closed window blinds, but generally the houses were closed and the 
town looked frightened. The staff dismounted at the American Hotel kept 
by [John X.] Nadenbousche (late Colonel) of Martinsburg. Had a good 
dinner and afterward took a room with Halpine and slept.
<p>
I was awakened by a messenger from the General, who, having been waited 
on by the mayor and town council and leading citizens, desired me to 
receive and talk to them. The Honorable Alexander Stuart2 was the 
spokesman and introduced me to the mayor, the chief of the insane asylum, 
principal of a female seminary, and some others. He opened the 
conversation with some civil allusions to my literary fame and then 
turned in upon the present condition of the town. I told them that we 
were warring according to the rules of civilized nations, that all 
warlike stores, manufacturies, and buildings which appertained to the 
Confederacy would be destroyed but that private property and 
noncombatants would be respected. The schools and charitable institutions 
would be carefully protected. I warned them that disorders might take 
place such as were to be expected among an illdisciplined soldiery, but 
that no pains would be spared to keep peace and order in the town and I 
hoped these efforts would be successful. This discourse seemed to give 
satisfaction and allayed the evident "tremor" which our coming had 
produced....
<p>
Colonel Starr called the General's attention to the prison. He went there 
and released all its inmates, thieves, spies, forgers, deserters, 
Irishmen, Union men, Yankee soldiers, Confederate officers, murderers, 
and rioters generally. Irons were knocked off and there was a general 
rejoicing and jail delivery. One fellow got up tears for the occasion. A 
Confederate officer who was in for shooting a soldier refused to leave. 
The General ordered the jailor's family to move out their furniture 
immediately, as he intended to have the building burnt. He also 
threatened to iron the jailor with the same fetters he had taken from a 
so-called Union soldier. It was a wet and cloudy afternoon. T wandered 
about until dark and stumbled upon Sullivan's quarters. I was hospitably 
received here and got supper and stayed the night.
<hr>
JUNE 7, TUESDAY.<hr>
. . . In the morning I rode into town and found everything in shocking 
confusion. They were burning the railroad property and public stores and 
work shops. A mixed mob of Federal soldiers, Negroes, Secessionists, 
mulatto women, children, Jews, and camp followers and the riff raff of 
the town were engaged in plundering the stores and depots. Quantities of 
army goods were found, blankets, clothes, a thousand saddles, shoes, 
tobacco, etc., without end. These stores were distributed among our 
people ad libitum and plundered as freely by Negroes, Confederate 
bummers, and citizens. At the Virginia Hotel Hospital, the provost guard 
were knocking the heads out of numerous barrels of apple brandy. The 
precious stream was running over the curbstones in cascades and rushing 
down the gutters with floating chips, paper, horse dung, and dead rats. 
This luscious mixture was greedily drunk by dozens of soldiers and 
vagabonds on their hands and knees and their mouths in the gutter while 
the more nice were setting their canteens to catch it as it flowed over 
the curbs.
<p>
Columns of cavalry were moving toward Waynesboro. The General it seems 
has determined to move directly on Charlottesville. The staff and other 
officers are opposed to the move, and several have asked me to use my 
influence to dissuade him from it. I was not opposed to the move but 
thought it a good one. Yet perhaps it might be beKer not to move until we 
hear from Crook and Averell. I saw the General and told him I had seen 
some Negroes who said they had seen Averell's force near Buffalo Gap. On 
hearing this report the General suddenly determined to move on the Gap, 
hoping to take McCausland in the rear.
<p>
I met Alexander Stuart again and had some agreeable talk with him. He is 
high-toned and conservative, and had my position permitted I would have 
gladly had more intercourse with him. He had come to headquarters to ask 
that a certain carriage factory should not be burned, as it would 
endanger much private property. He proposed that it should be left to the 
citizens to destroy and guaranteed that it should be totally destroyed by 
them under his orders. This Lieutenant Meigs, who was charged with the 
destruction of the building, readily accorded upon my representations. 
Presently the work was done most thoroughly without the dangerous use of 
fire. At the request of Nadenbousche I also procured respite of a 
warehouse adjoining the hotel. From all other buildings and public 
storehouses the devouring flames were rolling upward. Nadenbousche was 
heartily sick of Secession and desired to return home. He asked me to 
assist him and I promised to do so....
<p>
An old Irishman whom we liberated from the prison yesterday came up to 
shake hands witb me with many grateful benedictions. His hands looked 
swelled and scabby and I looked hard at them. Then he remarked, "That 
looks pretty bad, Sir, don't it?" "Yes," I said. "What is it?" "They say, 
Sir, it's the calf itch." "The calf itch! And you dare to shake hands 
with me, you d d scoundrel!" I threatened to have him ducked and rode off 
washing my hands with applejack. In passing out of town the General saw 
the carriage factory which had just been the subject of arrangement 
between myself and Stuart. In spite of my explanations and remonstrances 
he ordered it to be burned forthwith, and before we got out of town the 
flames were ascending. No accidents occurred, however, as we afterward 
learned, our soldiers working zealously to save the adjoining houses.
<p>
After advancing with the whole army for five or six miles, we met a 
scouting party whose advance had passed Buffalo Gap and found it vacant. 
But what was singular and vexatious, they brought us no news of the enemy 
or of Crook. The command was halted to await further news. We sent out 
some scouting parties who returned with confirmed reports of the enemy to 
the southward of us. This was no doubt [John] McCausland or [William L.] 
Jackson passing around us from the Gap toward Waynesboro. Perceiving that 
we were marching away from the enemy, we faced about and returned to our 
encampment near Staunton the same day. During our absence some 
adventurous guerillas had entered the town and had captured some of our 
stragglers.... The two scouts sent out from Cedar Creek to communicate 
with Crook arrived and reported they had left CrooL advancing only ten 
miles distant. He had struck the Central Railroad at Goshen and was 
marching along the line burning and destroying the track effectively in 
his advance. Crook joins us tomorrow with twelve regiments of infantry, 
two batteries, and cavalry.
<p>
The General asked me to give my views on the future campaign. I proposed 
to follow up the Valley via Lexington and Buchanan and thence by the 
Peaks of Otter road to Liberty and Lynchburg, thus threatening the 
enemy's great depot of supplies and the whole central railroad 
communicating with the Confederacy. From this point too unless Lee could 
detach a predominating force to drive us out, we had all Western North 
Carolina at our mercy. In fact, we would have our grip upon the vitals of 
the Confederacy....
<hr>
JUNE 8, WEDNESDAY.<hr>
As I lay awake just about dawn I was disturbed with the crowd of 
prisoners and refugees we had with us, when the idea struck me suddenly 
that we should send them back to our lines by way of Buffalo Gap and 
Beverly. This solution of the diificulty was so facile and so great a 
relief that I spoke to the General, whose pallet was next to mine. He was 
also awake and I proposed the plan. He jumped at it and was hardly 
content to wait until he got up before giving the orders. Colonel Moor of 
the 28th Ohio, whose time of service had expired wanted to return home, 
and he with his veteran regiment would be detailed to convey the train 
and prisoners.... Crook is within one mile of us and Averell is in 
Staunton. I wrote a report of the campaign from Cedar Creek to Staunton 
for the adjutant general of the U. S. Army to be forwarded by Colonel 
Moor.... Averell called and proposed much the same plan of compaign as 
mine. The only drawback is that ammunition is scarce and we must send 
back for a supply (and here I may mention that this accounts for our 
delays here and at Lexington).
<hr>
JUNE 9, THURSDAY.<hr>
I was aroused in the night by the arrival of a Negro from near 
Waynesboro. He says Imboden and his men were badly frightened by the 
reconnoissance yesterday, and that many are deserting. He has been joined 
by McCausland and Jackson, and is expecting further reinforcements from 
Richmond.... Called to see General Crook and got his views. He was drier 
and less sanguine than either Averell or myself. He asked what we 
proposed by moving on Lynchhurg. I told him we hoped thereby to drive Lee 
out of Richmond by seizing and threatening all his Southern and Western 
communications and sources of supply. He asked if we thought we could 
accomplish it with our present force. I replied that we could easily beat 
all the force that the enemy had in the Valley and in West Virginia 
combined, that we hoped Lee would not be able to reinforce the Valley, 
being too closely pressed by Grant, that in the event of his detailing a 
division or two it would be cut ofl by Sheridan who was moving with his 
cavalry toward Gordonsville and would cooperate with us. Crook said we 
might take Lynchburg but, depend upon it, Lee would not permit us to hold 
it long, nor could we do so for want of supplies. If we expected to take 
Lynchhurg at all we must move upon it immediately and rapidly. I agreed 
with him that such be our proper and safe course but mentioned our lack 
of ammunition. Crook said he had plenty and if permitted would march on 
Lynchhurg with his division alone, saying that celerity was more 
~mportant than numbers or ammunition. This conversation I reported to the 
General, giving force to General Crook's views in regard to the danger of 
delay. He heard me approvingly but replied that a good deal of delay was 
unavoidable. I wrote the orders of march for the division commanders. We 
move tomorrow....
<p>
Some small arms having been found concealed near the town, A. K. Trout, 
mayor of Staunton, has been arrested and charged with ordering their 
concealment. Alex Stuart and two others wrote to me explaining the 
circumstances and asking his release. His wife with nine children waited 
on the General, who referred the case to me, saying my decision should 
control the matter and so I ordered his release....
<hr>
JUNE IO, FRIDAY.<hr>
. . . Starr caught a fellow trying to steal his X horse and, collaring 
him, brought him down to the General's tent. The General having abused 
him to the extent of his limited vocabulary (he does not swear), cuffed 
and kicked him around the tent and let him go. If the General's 
principles would have permitted him to have cursed the fellow heartily, 
he would probably have avoided a rather undignified scene.... In town I 
met Nadenbousche and by General Hunter's direction gave him a permit to 
return home to live as a loyal citizen and to claim the necessary 
protection from Federal and military authorities. He seemed very grateful 
for the favor.
<p>
To sum up what was accomplished at Staunton, we took five hundred wounded 
and invalid prisoners and paroled them. We destroyed one thousand stands 
of small arms and three guns, one thousand cavalry saddles, horse 
equipment and shoes and leather, several woolen factories and quantities 
of grey cloth and other stores, and some ammunition. The depot buildings 
and fifty miles of the Virginia Central railroad were destroyed. Public 
stores were found in the asylum concealed. Stribling, the superintendent, 
was frightened sadly. In fact, I remember now that he brought the 
information to me himself, fearing they might be discovered and the 
asylum made accountable. We were also told by some detectives that the 
banks had concealed their treasure in the sewers of their establishment. 
This I did not believe and advised the General frankly not to have a 
search as I was sure the banks with their usual timidity and forethought 
had got their cash boxes off by railway at the first alarm. The female 
schools
