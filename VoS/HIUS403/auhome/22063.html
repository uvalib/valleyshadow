Dear Emmet,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Your letter was received yesterday evening.  I had mailed one to you in the morning.  I have had very little opportunity to make the inquiries you wish.  I have been on road detail today(making corduroy road to Guinney's) and have to go again tomorrow; so yo usee it will be impossible to go to Guinney Station before Monday, if indeed I can go then.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I suppose you were led to believe that large profits could be made on skillets from having heard us speak of having to pay 12 or 15 dollars for one.  If you could get that price, it would pay very well, but I do not think you could get it; unless you could get them to the different brigades of the army and sell them there, in which case, I think they would bring 12 dols'.  The sutlers of the regiments do not buy them at all, so far as I can hear, unless they get orders for them.  As for the Sutlers at the Station, I can not speak positively, but think they act in the same way.  The day you went up, McKee failed to get one, but got the promise of one soon if he would leave 10 dol's, his name etc., which he would not do so.  You might sell them for 8 dollars a piece, in lots of 20 or 30, and it might be as many as 60.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I think there would be no risk in you staying a few days, at the Station.  But you know there is no accomodation there, and no place to keep them.  I got the box that night.  It was a treat, I tell you, but you will know that after the sight of it.  The coffee is delicious.  McKee got his furlough next day and started in about an hour.  John D. got his too, and went Monday.  I want you to send me a tin plate by him.  If you buy skillets, you ought to do it at once while the army is lying quiet.  A good many soldiers have been courtmartialed in the brigade.  Several were publicly whipped today and four others (not legible).
