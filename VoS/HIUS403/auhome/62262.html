Dear Emmet,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We continued our march on yesterday and reached this place about 3 o'clock.  The march was very disagreeable on account of the hear and dust.  Today we are resting in camp.  It may be we will go on tomorrow, if so I hope they will find us on the cars.  It is said that the troops have been getting off at Louisa Court House, that is near enough Richmond for me this warm weather.  I reckon they were a little disappointed at home that I did not return with you.  I hope Paydon will be more successful next time. 
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I suppose Gen. Jackson is still in Richmond.  No answer yet to Captain White's request to return to Staunton.  Write soon and often as I feel anxious to hear from moffet.  Love to all.
<br>
<div align="center">Your Brother, Charles</div>
<br>
P.S. We have orders to march tomorrow at 5 o'clock and will probably reach Louisa C.H. and it is reported that the front troops have gone on to Hanover Junction.  Gen Jackson's Staff are quartered at Rev Mr Elwings.
