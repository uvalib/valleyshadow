In 1860 approximately 20 percent of Augusta County residents were of African 
descent--nearly all of whom were slaves. (1860 Census: 27,765 total residents, 5,553 
slaves, & 587 free blacks)  Though Augusta did not have the large plantations which 
commonly associated with the South, many residents were dependent on slave labor
to harvest their crops.  This dependency only increased during the war because most 
of the adult white male workforce left Augusta for the army.<p>
<img src="images/block.gif" height="1" width="40">At the same time as demand for black labor increased, the actual number of blacks
in the county declined.  Slaves ran away throughout the entire war, and according
to local historian Nancy Sorrells, the number of runaway adds in the Staunton Spectator 
increaded noticeably after the Emancipation Proclamation. A significant number of slaves
were drafted by the Confederate Army and sent to Richmond as manual laborers. In 1864 
General U.S. Grant instructed General Philip Sheridan to "carry off all negroes" from the 
Valley he could.  Some African-Americans very well may have left Augusta as "contraband"
of the Union army.<p>
<img src="images/block.gif" height="1" width="40">The African-Americans who remained in Augusta were not all farm laborers.  Many African-American women 
worked as kitchen help.  Some African-Americans also worked at the Staunton hospital. <p>
<img src="images/block.gif" height="1" width="40">Because the African-Americans who lived in Augusta were largely illiterate,
 they left scant testimony of their personal experiences.  Examining the records left by whites
can give us some idea of what African-American life in Augusta was like--but these records cannot be taken at face value because of the racism which is intrinsic to most of them.
