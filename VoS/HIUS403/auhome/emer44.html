It is doubtful whether this irruption should be called a raid, when so many were consumed in it. The
number in S. was estimated at 15,000 or more. Some passed here, & some took other routes. It is
natural to inquire what became of this cloud of locusts from the bottomless pit. They told us, we
need not trouble ourselves about our wheat harvest, for they were coming back to reap it for us, but
the good Lord disappointed their expectation. It was reported that many of them suffered greatly, &
some even perished with hunger afterwards, in passing through some districts which they had
ravaged. Their violent dealing if so came down upon their own pate. They brought on quite a number
of reapers, which we captured. As we had the work to do, it was but fair that we should have the
wherewith to do it, especially as they broke up so many of our tools.
