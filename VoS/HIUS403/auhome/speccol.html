Dear Father,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I rec your kind letter a few days ago, and will now answer it. 
 I was sorry to hear that you was unwell, I hope you will soon recover 
as health is the greatest blessing which we can have.  I see by your 
letter that you have purchased a lot of cattle at 2.80, weighing 800 pounds.  
They must be nice cattle to weigh that in a hollow condition.  I think the price of cattle are pretty 
heigh, considering the price of the Baltimore market last summer.  Since I have been up here,  I have 
not heard anything about the Markets, but that is not what I came up here to do.  News is very 
scarce in this part of the country, we do not get about any to hear any thing.  I rode to Staunton the 
other day only to see the town and get the ride.  I did not get to see much of it then as the days 
are short and it is sixteen miles there, the ride consumed nearly all of my time.  I did not get to 
in the asylums, and that I would have liked to done very much.  I do not think Staunton is a pretty 
place at-all, it is all hills, but I had a very nice ride on Prof Turner's horse. he has a very fine horse, 
and he loans him to me, whenever I want him.  this evening I rode down to Bridgewater.  I saw Eph 
Neff.  he seems to be in fine spirits, and if report be true, is getting along very well.  I think I can get 
Prof. Turner's horse to come home.  if I can I will borrow a pair of saddle-pockets and there-by save all 
expenses.  if I make this arraingement I will let you know.  I do not know though what is your intention,
 wether to send after me or let me come down to New Market in the stages.  any way will suit me, so 
that I get home, for I would hate stay up here through the holidays, when the ballance are all gone.

<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>The State has went for Bell I suppose without a doubt, but the Whigs can not claim it as a 
victory.  There was a greater democratic vote polled than was ever known before in this state.  I 
suppose Doctor and Uncle Mason lays low about Douglas now.  They said he was the man to vote 
for to save the union.  I should like to know where his strength was.  he taken off about enough votes 
to sever the solid front of the South which should at this time more than all others, be shown undivided.  
I wrote to Mr Zirkly about my vest, and to Mr Robinson imme[diately] on receipt of your letter.

To Mother,
<br>

<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I rec your letter the same day I rec fathers, and was very glad to hear from you.  You say you have the turkey 
ready for me.  well I say just hold on to him., for I am coming down if I have got to walk.  Mother if I only had some of your 
good pudding and sausage.  I tasted some up here the other day, and I think I just found out what good sausage was.  you 
appear to have had plenty of company last Sunday.  I would like to have been there and enjoyed my-self with them.  if you see 
Jennie Bowman give her my best respects, also to all of them.  I do not know what is the matter with Mary.  she never writes 
to me any more.  tell her if she dont write soon I will pull her ears good, when I come down.  you must write soon, for I am 
always happy to hear from any of you.
