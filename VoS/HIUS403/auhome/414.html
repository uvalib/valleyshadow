My Dear Aunt,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We received a letter from home yesterday, one from Aunt Clem, one from Bet, so we had quite a reading, we had looked fro them for several days before they came to hand.  The one from home was quite a family one, the kind I like, only wish they would come a little oftener.  I was glad to hear you were all as well as usual.  There is no news in camp of importance.  The enemy is still quiet- and I hope they will stay so until we get our army better organized.  They are reported to have a large force between 20 and 25 thousand but I think that is too large for if they had that number they would not have any difficulty in making right on to Staunton, but I think they are afraid of Jackson.  I wish he could get a sufficient force to drive them back for it will never do for them to get possession of this rich and beautiful valley.  There is still a great deal of corn in the fields yet which we ought to have for will need it after while.  We are still at Parson Rudd's 5 miles below New Market on the fine Steinberger Farm.  I tell you it is the finest farm I ever saw, the land nearly as level as a floor.  We have two houses to stay in and plenty to eat-so you see we are getting along finely.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I do not know what our force is, not more than 6 or 8 thousand.  I am afraid we will have to fall back farther.  Our company was filled up yesterday with Rockbridge Militia 52 in number.  They are very nice men.  Charly McClung is among the number a very pleasant man.  We scraped up kin but I do no know how much.  I expect he is all you know anything about.  We had an election of officers this morning which resulted in the election of [illegible] White Captain Strickler First Lieut, Sam Lile 2nd and James Culton 3rd, one of the militia.  I think they will make very good officers but I am hopeful by June we will have our Captain back by that time if all reports are true about the late fighting in Mississippi but I am afraid there is some mistake about it.  I have no doubt we got a great many prisoners but I don't like the thought of falling back and I regret the loss of Gen Johnson for I think he was an excellent officer.  We get no papers and can not get the particulars but I am in the hopes we have defeated them badly though our loss is very heavy.  Now is the time for the South to act, if we delay now we are gone, but I will never give up hope as long as there is a ray of hope.  I don't believe there is any chance for them to whip us.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We are both well.  I like the service though it is right hard but I think every one that can go ought to.  Give my respects to Aunt Elvira and to everybody.  Write soon for it takes letters so long to come.  Love to you and all the rest.
