Dear Ma,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>After waiting and looking, a long time, for letters from home, Mary's reached us a day or two ago, and gladly was it received and read, telling us all the news and telling us you were getting so much better.  I hope you will be careful of yourself and will continue to improve until you are entirely well.  Mary said Father and Uncle John were talking of coming to see us.  I am very much afraid they will take it out in talk.  However, I hope not, but will look for them before long.  If they don't come, I hope Emmett will, as he spoke of doing.  I expect though he will not be so anxious to come here, as to Manassas.  I wish he could have gotten there, to see the whole army and its chief dignitaries.   There is only one brigade here and a few militia, so there is not much to be see, except a rich and very beautiful country.  The brigade except our regiment has moved about five miles below Winchester.  We go tomorrow.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>There is, not yet, a sufficient number of wagons to move all the regiments in  one day.  We havent been able to find out any thing of the policy or intentions of Genl. Jackson nor can you get any reliable information of the enemy.  One day we hear there is a large force at Romney and the next, that they have left and are concentrating near Williams Port; that Loring and Henry R Jackson will attack them in the rear, and we in front; but still we see nothing indicating a movement of any kind.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>General Jackson sent Major Reston (of the Institute) his Adjutant General, to Gen Lovings Headquarters, last week, but I don't know for what purpose.  That army is having a very hard time, and will suffer this winter if not carefully provided for.  We have very high winds and cold weather lately.  We burn a great deal of wood, build large fires at the doors of the tents, and manage to keep tolerably comfortable.  I[f] you can send us a comfort, a good wide one to cover us both.  Send the boots the first chance.  I'm most barefooted.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>How did [Tobbin?] ever have sense or courage enough to ask that girl to have him, or walk out on the floor?  Nobody [will] ever despair of marrying after that; the most despondent and most often rejected can take courage.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We expect to be paid off soon for July and August and probably for September and October too.  If we get all, it will be quite a pile, about $70.  The Government is too negligent about paying up.  Most of the Company are out of money.  Send us the cost of all our clothing, that of each piece.  An order has been issued to send for all absentees, who are able to come into service.  Will Uncle Andy continue his Business in Alleghany?  much love to him, Aunt Sallie, and Aunt Betsy, and all the rest.  Has he found a name for his by yet?  Mr. Reed sends his love to Aunt Betsy.  Why did Dr. Walker resign?  Is he tired of the service?  If you all dont write oftener, I think I can charge you all with carelessness as you have done us.  I hope the Yankees wont give us a cause to fight them this winter.  If they dont make any more raids into Virginia I think there is a chance of going into Winter Quarters, otherwise not very soon.
