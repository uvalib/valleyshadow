General Jackson moved from near Strasburg this morning toward 
Winchester.  The report that the enemy had abandoned Winchester, with 
the exception of two or three regiments was generally believed by the 
soldiers and it was thought there would be no engagement in 
reoccupying the town.
<p>
About ten o'clock the enemy commenced advancing and drove our 
skirmishes back a mile or two towards Newtown.
<p>
The troops having arrived soon after the middle of the day, the line   
of battle was immediately formed and the artillery of both armies 
commenced their fire which was kept up for several hours.  This did but little damage to
our side, wounding one or two and killing two or
three horses.
<p>
The regiments in crossing an open field to their positions were in 
full and easy range of the enemy guns.  A number of shots were fired 
at the 4th but all fell a short distance off, without doing any 
damage.
<p>
Late in the afternoon our skirmishers were driven in
and the fight became general along the whole line.  Our men were eager for the 
fight and advanced most impetuously, and poured their fire into the 
ranks of the enemy, driving them completely from the field.
<p>
Heavy reinforcement were immediately brought forward by the Federals 
so completely out-numbering us that we were compelled to retire and 
leave them masters of the field.
<p>
Our forces were sheltered by a skirting of woods and the nearby brow 
of a hill and a little in advance of the latter, a stone fence.
In this place the Fourth fought and the enemy say was most hardly 
contested, and the dead lay in heaps.  Our troops fought most 
gloriously and their deeds are the theme of admiration on every 
tongue.  The Liberty Hall Volunteers fully sustained the reputation 
they gained at Manassas:  no one quailed under the storm of bullets 
around him but fired upon them to the last.  They with the Pulaski 
Guards were the last to leave the stone fence, the regiment having 
gone without our knowing it -- and only left when the enemy gained 
the top of the hill to our right,and pouring a deadly fire down the 
wall and parallel with it.
<p>
Captain Morrison, finding the two companies left to themselves, 
ordered them to retire,  We found the whole army giving way rapidly 
and the enemy firing upon them as they went and everyone endeavoring 
to make good his own safety.
<p>
After having retreated half a mile beyond the branch, I saw the 
cavalry of the enemy rapidly dashing upon us; I immediately turned 
off to the right (left wing of the enemy) 
hoping they would not 
pursue a single man, but on they came and 4 or 5 calling on me to 
stop; not doing that they fired several shots but by this time they 
were so close on me I found further efforts useless and surrendered 
my gun and cartridge box and was marched back by two of them while 
the other still pursued the flying rebels.
<p>
I had gone a short distance only when I fell in with Captain Morrison 
and Lieut. Lyle, whom I had just left as the cavalry charged upon us.

It was the First Virginia Cavalry who took us and escorted us with 
over a hundred others to Winchester where we were confined in the 
basement of the Episcopal Church.  Others were lodged in the Court 
House, jail, etc.  The whole number of prisoners is about 230, 
besides the wounded who could not be removed from the field.
<p>
We reached Winchester about 9 o'clock.  The citizens sent us plenty 
of provisions for supper, having been furnished nothing by our 
captors.  The room being crowded, there was but little opportunity to 
sleep or rest in any way.
Breakfast was also provided by the citizens -- bread, meat, butter, 
coffee, milk, etc. were supplied to all.
<p>
Blankets and clothing were also being brought in, but soon 
prohibited.
<p>
Shortly after the middle of the day, we were ordered to "fall in" and 
were marched off -- we knew not where, but were soon relieved of any 
doubt as we went direct to the depot, where we were put on the cars 
(freight) as fast as the roll could be called, and started for 
"Yankee Land."  It was by no means a pleasing thought.
<p>
To go North, to be imprisoned in some prison or fort, to receive the 
contempt and supercilious treatment of Lincoln's tyrannical and 
despotic officers was humiliating and goading beyond expression.  To 
have a Yankee soldier, 

and most probably a foreigner at that, with a 
musket or drawn saber in hand, march one about at every call, was so 
offensive as to be borne with no sort of ease or compromise.
<p>
When performing the same offices for Federal prisoners in our hands, 
I had often wondered how I could bear it if I should ever fall into 
their hands.  And now it was to be realized.  I was to be put to the 
test.
<p>
I was to have them speak to me as peremptorily as to a negro, never 
once saying "will you do this" or "do that if you please," but always 
"stand over here", "get back there", "pull off your hats", etc.
<p>
The cars were so crowded that the men could hardly seat themselves.
<p>
Reaching Harpers Ferry after dark, we remained there until next 
morning.
