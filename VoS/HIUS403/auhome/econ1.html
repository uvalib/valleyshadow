<img src="images/block.gif" width="40" height="2">Before the Civil War began, Augusta County was well-established as a prosperous farming community.  The county's wealth was most apparent in the city of Staunton, where there were gas lights, a telegraph o
ffice, and other modern conveniences unusual for a Southern town of its size. 
<br> 
<img src="images/block.gif" width="40" height="2">Not surprisingly, the prolonged conflict of the Civil War was an immense economic burden for Augusta to bear.  The Confederate Army relied heavily on Augusta and other Shenandoah counties for food and esse
ntial supplies.  Often these supplies were impressed without advanced warning.  Augusta residents also had to deal with rising inflation and shortages of goods due to the war. 
<br> 
<img src="images/block.gif" width="40" height="2">The removal of approximately seventy percent of the white male labor force from Augusta placed a severe strain on the population that remained in the county.  Those left to plant and harvest crops not only
 had to grow enough food to feed themselves, but also had to send food to their loved ones fighting in the army, where rations were rarely adequate.  
<br> 
<img src="images/block.gif" width="40" height="2">Though a significant number of male farmers remained at home, both to harvest crops and as "home guards" to defend the county from Union invasion, soldiers on the front relied heavily on female relatives  
and African-Americans to keep their farms running at home.
<br>  
<img src="images/block.gif" width="40" height="2">As the war progressed, the labor shortage in Augusta grew more acute.  Runaway slaves were a problem throughout the war, but in the later years the Confederate army began to impress slaves for manual labor
, including a fair number from Augusta county.  
<br> 
<img src="images/block.gif" width="40" height="2">All of Augusta's economic problems were compounded in 1864 by  General Grant's orders to leave the Valley a "barren waste"--where Union soldiers were instructed to destroy railroads and crops, and to "carr
y off stock and negroes" they could.
