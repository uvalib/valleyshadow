Crowds of ladies and gentlemen daily assembled without the walls 
where a view could be had of the windows of the Jail and testified 
their sympathy and support by every demonstration in their power.  
Those known to sympathize with secessionists were prohibited 
admittance to the jail; but still they found many ways of ministering 
to our comfort and necessities, for which I (and I doubt not, all the 
prisoners) will ever feel most grateful.  It was a cheering thought 
that there many thousands of our friends in the city, ready and 
anxious to assist with their means and cheer us with their sympathy 
in our lonely confinement.  It was rumored that we would be 
transferred to Fort Delaware.
