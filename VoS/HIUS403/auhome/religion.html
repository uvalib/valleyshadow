<img src="images/block.gif" height="2" width="40">For the people of Augusta County religion functioned in two ways-- it helped to emotionally sustain them in a time of extreme uncertainty and personal loss, as well as to solidify their conviction in the moral righteousness of the Confederate cause.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height="2" width="40">Augustans on the home front attended church where they heard sermons from ministers like Francis McFarland, a Presbyterian, who asked his congregation repeatedly to pray for the government and the military.  Some Augustans collected bibles to send to troops in the field, and many participated in religious revivals that took place in Staunton in 1862 and 1863. 
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height="2" width="40">The reverence with which many Augustans regarded Stonewall Jackson illustrates the absolute interconnectedness of religion and the Southern cause in the county.  Jackson's presence in the Valley in the early years of the war protected Augusta County and the other "upper" counties from a Union invasion.  Jackson was known for his extreme piety, and this helped Augustans to feel both that God was on their side in the war and that Jackson himself was "protected".
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" height="2" width="40">Their conviction in the righteousness of the Southern cause was not necessarily diminished by the war's end.  Regarding the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward, Francis McFarland wrote, "They certainly deserved to die, but it is sad that death came in that form and that they should be plunged into eternity with so much blood on their souls."  It is clear that while McFarland, and those who shared his convictions, knew the South had suffered a military defeat, they knew equally well that the South was the clear victor in the contest for morality and godliness.
