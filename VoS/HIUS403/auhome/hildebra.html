Jacob Hildebrand was a Mennonite minister who lived on a farm several 
miles east of Staunton.  He was very religous, dedicated to his three 
sons (Benjamin, Gideon, and Michael) who served in the Confederate forces, 
and frequented Staunton for 
business and official purposes.  These selections from his wartime diary 
give particular insight into the personal nature of the constant military 
threat to the Valley, the demands of food impressment, and the pain of 
having loved ones away at war.

Today I have to Report in Staunton & from there to Winchester, as the 
enemy are said to be there in large numbers <br> God only knows whether I 
shall ever return again.  Yet one thing I know that I have commited all 
things to his hands knowing that he careth for us & that he is able to 
keep that which I have commited to him <br> now unto him that is able to 
keep us from falling be honor Dominion now & forever Amen.  This ends my 
journal for the present.

Went to Staunton, the three Regiments started down the valy.  understood 
that the Yankees Draft the malitia as fast as they get possesion of Va. & 
that they are to fight in the front Ranks against the south.  The malitia 
seem to slow in turning out as there were but a samll part of them went 
down today.
<p>[thoughts on CSA]<p>
[March] Wednes 19th.<br>
A certain wise man once said that fools put their confidence in dreams. 
Yet I will notice one which Cathrine told me she had last night, she 
thought or dreamt that some barn had caught fire, which caused great 
alarm, & that it burned many of the shingles off it when the fire 
was put out, & left some shingles on & all the Rafters stood upright 
not being damaged. Now I do not pretend to be Daniel to interpret 
dreams but will call the barn the Southern confederacy, the Rafters 
the States composing the confederacy, the shingles the People of the 
States. Rain this evening.
