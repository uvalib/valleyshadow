Having passed my first night in Baltimore and in Jail, I rose much 
refreshed, made my toilet and waited breakfast, in hopes of getting 
something palatable, but it was only a repetition of the supper, the 
same hard bread and detestable coffee.
<p>
There was no recourse left but to wander about the building or sit 
down in my cell and think over my condition, of how long I would be 
there, whether we would be exchanged or paroled, and other kindred 
thoughts.
<p>
The papers were filled with glaring falsehoods and gross exaggeration 
of the late battle.  The mind of the northern people would be so 
perverted by its first details that it would never know the real 
results of the engagement.
<p>
Kind friends in the city sent us numerous articles of clothing during 
the day, shirts, drawers, shoes, blankets, etc.  For dinner we had 
bread and soup with a chunk of beef in it.  Supper, nothing.  Neither 
knives, forks, plates or spoons were to be had.
<p>
The "Clipper", noticing the arrival of prisoners, said they were 
lodged in the Jail and "rations issued to them to which they were 
strangers."  We were indeed strangers to such rations as we received.
