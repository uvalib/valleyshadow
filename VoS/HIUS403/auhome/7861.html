Dear Sister:<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Knowing your anxiety to hear from us at this time, after receiving Andrew's letter, I write to inform you that we are both well, except that Andrew is somewhat worried and broken down from a march of about 11miles on yesterday, under a broiling sun and some dust and but a little water, we formong the rear of about ten or twelve thousand soldiers and consequently were crowded out from the wells, that being the principal source, until the middle of the evening when we fell back from the main body.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We, that is Jackson's brigade, Johnston having gone to Winchester, camped in the woods last night and this morning marched to this place about 3 ½ miles below Winchester.  At our last encampment we were placed in an open field, under a burning sun oders to be at your posts and had to stay there for 4 days.  The enemy were all the  (illegible)

<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>General Johnston sent to Gen. Patterson who is in command of the enemies forces to send away the women and children from Martinsburgh but he refused and sent back word that if he (Johnston) would lay down his arms and return home, then he (Patterson) would forgive all past offences.  Gen. Johnston offerred him battle for four days if he would come out of Martinsburgh but he would not do it and Johnston thinking his numbers too great being at leasr twenty five and perhaps thirty thousand and a reinforcement of 5 thousand at the Potomac at some point between Harpers Ferry and Shepherdstown and his position too strong, thought it advisable to fall back and so we have had no battle yet, but on Saturday evening a dispatch was brought to the General that our pickets had been driven in and that the enemy were advancing.  We were soon drawn up in battle away and advanced to a position.  After having been on the field about two hours, we were taken back to quarters, it having turned out to be simply a fight between the pickets: then enemy not coming.  Jackson on that morning received a letter from Gen. Lee congratulating him upon his promotion to brigadier General, the letter came in advance of the official announcement.  While on the field the two Generals made a review of the troops, Johnston of all of the forces and Jackson of the Virginia brigade.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I like Johnston's appearance very well; I think he is a very prudent commander: indeed the same is true of both; you know "prudence is the better part of valor."  What is going to be done I don't know; the soldiers never know the intentions of their commanders until it comes to execution; so we here in camp have a little idea of an intended action as you.I suppose the Yankee papers will glory over our falling back as an inglorious and precipitate retreat; but call it by what name you please I think that Johnston knows what he is about and am very willing to obey his orders, although it did pester me a good deal for a while and does yet somewhat, to go at things as if we're blindfolded.  Even supposing that we could have whipped them, it would have been at too great a loss of life and consequently it is more prudent to retire.  How soon we will have an engagement I can't tell you; but there must be one at some time or another.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>The result of the fight that took place on Tuesday the 2nd I suppose Andrew gave you very correctly; on our side three killed and four or five wounded.  The most reliable report we get in regard to the loss of the Federal forces comes from Mr. Boteler, a brother of Hon. Alex Boteler, who says he had it from the quartermaster of their army to this effect: that there were from three to five hundred in killed and wounded, however, ture this is I think that there is no doubt that their loss was considerable.  The number engaged on our ride was the whole (except one company) of Harper's regiment and one piece of canon; on the enemies there was supposed to be about 3000 a great many of them being regulars.  Since writing the above I hear through one of our company who has been at Winchester that they are throwing up a breastwork about one mile on this side of town; which looks very much like making a stand here' I didn't suppose however that we would retire beyond Winchester.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Billy Wilson received a letter from home a day or two ago, which brought the news that Edgar Wilson while capping his pistol (illegible)
and another  almost fell off.  I heard from Dalhoune a day or two , he was then improvingwith a prospt of getting well.  John D. Brooks all my acquaintances are very well.  We have just perused yours and Aunt Martha's letters.  On their way down McComb and Baskins heard at Bunkers Hill a village between Winchester and our camp, that we had sent back all the baggage, except so much as we could carry and accordingly left their knapsacks there and our letters with them and did not get them again until this evening.  Aunt Martha wrote that Mr. Lee was taken prisoner by the Georgians and our owntroops.  I didn't understand it at all; he has not turned traitor has he?
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We heard yesterday that Lincoln's message recommends calling for 400,000more men and 400,000,000 of dollars.  I don't know where he will get the money from.  Andrew joins in sending love to all at home and Uncle Ben's.  Remember us both especially to Mr. And Mrs. Murkland: we would like to be there to see them,but moreespecially the folks at home.  I was sorry to hear of Father's sickness I hope when this shall have reached you he will be restored to his wanted health.  I regretted very much [not] seeing Wilke and Eliek Murkland.  Tonight Andrew is finally well again.  I have nothing more to write.

Tuesday Morning
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We got our baggage last night and will send it off again.  Excuse the dirt.  Can't keep hands clean on all occasions.  Tell (illegible) that it is imposible to get a likeness taken here. Good bye, WB
