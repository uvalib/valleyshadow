In 1860 approximately 20 percent of Augusta County residents were of African 
descent, 
nearly all of which were slaves.  After a great portion of the white male 
workforce was away fighting the war, the economy was forced to be 
increasingly dependent on slave labor.  The institution of slavery, however, broke 
down as the war progressed.
<p>
The Staunton Spectator was the only local newspaper in operation during 
the war's beginning, but slavery was never more than a detail in the many 
articles about the South's right of secession.  Slavery became a hot 
topic in the media only after the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 
1863.  Subsequent to emancipation was the formation of the U.S. Colored 
Troops, which initially consisted of 150,000 negroes, many of whom were 
former slaves.  Articles in early 1863 were vehemently anti-Lincoln 
regarding these developments, and the popular opinion was that Negroes 
were an inferior race.  As the 
war progressed, some articles asserted that life as a slave was 
better than life as a member of the Federal army.
<p>
Following Gettysburg (July 4, 1863), the number of ads in the 
Staunton newspapers about runaways noticeably increased, according to war 
historian Nancy Sorrells.  Many Augusta slaves were already absent, 
however, having been impressed (as property) for labor at and around 
Richmond.
<p>
African-Americans received Emancipation from the Union forces, but not 
a much-improved station in life.  Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's order to "leave 
the  Valley a barren  waste" regarded slaves as property as well, 
refering to them more as agricultural machinery than as humans or 
citizens.  Also, there were frequent reports of companies of U.S. Colored Troops used on the front 
lines as expendable soldiers.
<p>
There were very vew documents pertaining to African-Americans, and most 
are from the Staunton newspapers.
