	<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>It is with pleasure i seat myself to try to rite a few lines in answer to yours although do not
no what to rite as regards healthe we are all in our usual health and hoping this may find you all
blest with the same blessing as health is the greatest pleasure we can have. I received you letter
yesterday evening and was glad to hear frolm] you all and Jesse in particular to hear that he was
not frozen nor laid up by the cold as it bin so verry cold. I think that we have had some of the
coldes washer that I ever fet lfeltl this last weak was too cold for any hones lhonestl folks to be out
mch [much].but the wether has mderated considerable. I have no thing good to to rite there is no
good it seams when we [dol good evil is present but one consolation I have is the good lord will
not forget those who do not forget him, there seems to be a great stir in our country at this time
since this last call has bin made. the substitute men are nearly all gone of [offl. there is some few
left that is trying to get of [offl as farmers. if they do not get of [offl they will be very apt to give
them the slip for they say they will not fite so that would brake up the war. I say go it seams
starvation will end it anyhow, ther is a number of farmes that there is not a man on. if the farmes
are stoped I think the war must stop. they cant fight without bread. I think the southern cfederacy
has gone nearly up the spout.

	<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>We have not hurd a word from rockingham since we was over at your house we do not see
nor hear anthing of my folks atall. I think rite hard of them i do not no when I will get down.if
nothing happens i try to get down some time this summer. you mst [mustl try and come. It isut
wethwile [worthwhile] to stay at home all the time.
 If Jesse comes home we would pDe] verry glad. If you would come over. I think I mus close.
please excuse this bad scribling. rite as soon as you can. yours truly until death
