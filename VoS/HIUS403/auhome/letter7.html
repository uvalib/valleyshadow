Dear Brother,<br>

<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I embrace the present to say to you that I am well and hope that you are enjoying the same
inestimable blessing I had intended to write you often since I went soldiering, but as you are
aware our accomodations for writing are not very inviting, and I have been called upon by the
sick in the hospital to do a considerable amount of writing. I have neglected to drop you a few lines
up to the present, arul as I have not kept up regular correspondence with you since I went into
service, I feel a loss to know where to commence. To afford you the most satisfaction I will just
say we have been moved from place to place more than we had any desire for.<br>

	We are now at Gettysburg the second time, and I have concluded to say something about the
hospital and the memorable battlefield. The hospital as well as our encampment is on the
battlefield one mile east of Gettysburg where Ewell first formed his line of battle. This hospital is
composed of large tents which cover eighty acres of ground. it is laid off in streets or avenues
which gives the appearance of a city.<br>
 <img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>	When we first came there were 5,000 sick and wounded, so the steward told us, as high as
17 die per day. It is heart rending to pass through the streets and hear the cries of agony that
burden the air. I have heard them when I was away from the hospital a half mile.<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	Those who die in the hospital are buried in the field south of the hospital; there is a large
graveyard there already. The dead are laid in rows with a rough board placed at the head of each
man . . they are nearly all Confederates. The name of each man is written on the board and also
the state and regiment to which he belonged. The amputated limbs are put in barrels and buried
and left in the ground until they decompose; then they are lifted and sent to the Medical College at
Washington. A great number of bodies are embalemed here and sent to their friends. Close to the
graveyard is a large tent called the dead-house, and another where they embalm.<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>

	I will here notice an incident: one morning while I was on guard duty between the hospital
and the graveyard, the Ward master and two nurses passed me with a Confederate soldier taking
him to the dead-house. After they had passed me a few steps the supposed dead man partly raised
himself on the stretcher and asked what they intended to do with him; they took a hearty laugh,
and turned around and carried him back to camp, and for aught I know he is living yet. Mr. John
Trilt was an eye-witness to the same fact, he was on guard duty on the next beat. You will no
doubt ask, "Why were you on duty?" To this I would say I was standing in a sick man's place;
this I often do.<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>

	But I must say something about the battlefields. In the first place it will be necessary to give
you the positions occupied by the armies: Gen. Meade occupied the range of hills south of
Gettysburg, his center resting on Cemetery Hill opposite the west end of town; his right wing
running southeast, his right wing ending on a hill known as Wolf Hill. - this hill is from base to
summit 300 feet high, very rocky and heavily timbered; his left wing lay in direct line from
Cemetery Hill to Round Top. You are aware that Gen. Meade occupied a range of hills that
formed a U. Upon the whole it was a strong natural position.<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>

	In order that the description be satisfactory to you, in imagination, to pass over the ground
with me. We will start on the ground occupied by the left wing of our army. We are now at the
base of Wolf Hill; here the timber is dead from the effects of the minie balls; it is impossible to
count the balls in any one tree; they
seem to be shot into the trees in clusters like wine grapes. The ground at the foot of the hill is like
a plowed field.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	About 300 yard from the hill is a small stream called Rock Creek; between the hill and this
stream the Rebels lost 2,300 men on less than two acres of ground.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	They are buried in holes capable of holding from 25 to 100 men, here they are well buried,
no bodies are exposed. We will now walk from Wolf Hill toward the center of our line to
Cemetery Hill. Along our whole line there are temporary works, put up in one hour at night, after
a hard day's fight. As we pass along we see graves in every direction over the field - the whole
way from our extreme right to center is a barren waste - unoccupied houses shattered with cannon
balls, no fences anywhere, all desolation and destruction.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	We are now on Cemetery Hill occupied by our center. From this point to Round Top the
battle raged beyond description. On Cemetery Hill and to our left a great number of our men are
buried.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	We start from Cemetery Hill towards Round Top; 400 yards brings us to Gen. Meade's
headquarters, a small one-story frame house. I counted eight holes made by cannon balls which
passed through the house. When I first visited the place the carcasses of eight of Gen. Meades's
Orderlies' horses were Iying about the yar .... fell just where they were hitched. At this point the
Rebels fought with desperation and were slaughtered by the scores 300 yards from our works. At
this point any part of the human frame can be picked up. It will be remembered that from this
point along the entire left the Rebel prisoners were made to bury their dead. They dug trenches
about ten inches deeh and lay from 50 to 100 men in each trench, they throw clay along the
middle of the rows leaving the heads and feet entirely exposed. When I was last there, the field
had the appearance of a vast bone yard. A few weeks ago the bodies became so decomposed that
the heads would drop off at the slightest touch Since then the heads have been kicked like
footballs over the field. The stench here is still intolerable. But we pass over the graves and dead
horses while the ground is almost carpeted with knapsacks, haversacks, canteens, hats, blankets,
in fact everything that goes to make up the horrors of a battlefield. The blankets that have been left
on the fields are used to bear off the wounded, and are clotted with blood; many of the hats and
caps are besmeared with brains.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	As we pass on towards Round Toh fields are tramped like the road, no fences anywhere.
We are now at Stony Ridge, called by some
as Little Round Top; we will call it Stony Ridge. It is 300 feet from base to top and is a mass of
rocks, so much so that nothing grows upon it. Our line of works crossed over the top of this
ridge.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	Opposite this ridge one fourth of a mile is a piece of woodland which was occupied by the
Rebels. A perfect hail of balls swept through these woods from our batteries which felled trees in
every direction. Between this woods and Stony Ridge is an open field, blue swamp mud, and
very rocky. This the Rebels had to cross in order to assault our works, which they did in spite of
all our grape and cannister our men could pour on them. They climbed the rugged steep to our
very works and were bayoneted and fell dead against our works. They fought as only men could
fight, but failed to carry the works.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	As you pass over this rocky swamp the sight is appalling. Along the middle of the swamp
there is a chain of the largest rocks I ever saw; it seems nature in some wild freak had forgotten
herself and piled great rocks in mad confusion together. This place is known as the Devil's Den.
The Rebels in passing over these rocks were shot ana fell down between the rocks into stagnant
water and blue mud. And many, I have no doubt, were wounded and fell into the water below
and were strangled to death
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	When I visited this place in the company with Wm. French, I clambered down among the
rocks, gathered up some bones, and clambered up from among these miserable looking beings. I
was almost strangled from the effects of the smell caused by the partly decomposed bodies. The
crevice is about 10 feet deep. It is dangerous to pass over these rocks. Some skeletons have of
late been hooked up with iron hooks attached to long poles. You will remember the Rebels buried
their own dead here. They dragged them to where they could throw them into some crevice and
tumbled them in and threw a few stones over them and thus left them. The visitor is shocked at
every step of this vast charnel house.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	As soon as the bodies started to decay, the stones began falling down and thus exposing all
the skeletons that each of the graves contained. It is not pleasant to the finer feelings of the human
breast to see the frames of men leven1 if they were enemies and in every position conceivable.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	Here all the arms and legs that were shot off were not gathered and buried, but are Iying
among the rocks. I saw in a circle on one rock four legs Iying with shoes and stockings on.
Whole hands lay
withering in the sun.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	But I have wearied you with this badly written letter, on account of the confusion that is
continually about us while in camp.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>
	No more. Write soon. Our battle line was eight miles long over the roughest ground I ever
saw.
