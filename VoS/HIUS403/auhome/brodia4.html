This day was passed in about the same way as the day before.  All 
were eager to get the papers for further details of the fight and to 
know the position of General Jackson.
<p>
The papers, throughout the North, hailed the event as a glorious 
victory for the Federal arms and illustrating the prowess of the 
Yankee mercenaries, but never mentioning the 23,000 men in their army 
which a Federal Captain boasted they had as soon as we were captured, 
and which all were very anxious to bring down to six or eight 
thousand when they found out the smallness of our force.
<P>
Correspondent of the press doubled and even trebled our force, boldly 
asserting the Shields had defeated Jackson's, Smith's and 
Longstreet's united forces.  This unmitigated lie has been circulated 
far and wide, throughout the North, and will doubtless be believed by 
the mass of the Northern people.
<p>
Marvelous stories were told of Banks' pursuit, and Jackson's 
disastrous retreat.  Banks was shelling them all the way, with 
immense slaughter, and capturing 700 army wagons (2 or 3 times the 
number Jackson had) and Jackson was throwing the wounded and dead 
from the ambulances and wagons, literally strewing the whole way with 
them, to facilitate his retreat.
<p>
The special correspondent of the "Herald" said that Jackson's forces 
was 16 regiments of infantry, numbering 11,000 men and three 
battalions of horse, under Ashby and Stuart; when in truth there were 
but 9 regiments and 1 battalion, less than 5,000 men and one regiment 
of horse (Ashby's).
<p>
Every effort was made to increase our force and diminish theirs.
