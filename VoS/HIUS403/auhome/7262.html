Dear Sir,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I reached this place on monday by Central RR, and though I have learned nothing with certainty of Charles and John am satisfied they are unhurt in the great struggle so far.  There is much difficulty in getting a pass and means of conveyance to the army and having procured the former should have gone to Jackson's division today, but for the heavy and constant rain that have been falling.  I shall go tomorrow if possible.  It is not possible to get a substitute in for Charles until something decisive has taken place betweeen the contending armies of the most thrilling and complicated character.  The enemy is still unbroken and formidable, and disputing every inch of our advance with the energy of despair.  Our loss in killed and wounded is frightful.  It is reported that Jackson was very severly cut up yesterday in an effort to storm the enemies batteries.  He finally succeeded but at great loss.  Our army commands the flank and rear of the enemy but the admirable order of the latter leaves it much to be feared that the crisis is yet to come.  There has been no Bull Run in this awful field.  It is quite a mistake to suppose McClelland yet whipped.  The bloody catastrophe has yet to come.  
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>You may expect to hear from me again as soon as I see the boys, and should it be necessary to telegraph you, I will do so.  Meanwhile write me by return mail if you wish me to remain until I can get a substitute  received in the place of Charles.  If I find  any misfortune has befallen him I will bring him home.  I have not heard anything of Mr. Read with certainty nor of Samuel Brooks.  I hope to be able tomorrow to give you certain information with regards to them.
<br>
