east of the Valley pike, and seven miles southwest of Port Republic
<p>
Campaign: Lynchburg Campaign (Hunter)
<p>
Principal Commanders: [c] Brig. Gen. William E.``Grumble'' Jones; [u] Maj. Gen.David Hunter
<p>
Forces Engaged: [c] Two infantry brigades (Jones and Browne), home guards, and cavalry under
Imboden and Vaughn, about 5,500; [u] Sullivan's division (two brigades under Moor and Thoburn),
Stahel's cavalry division, and artillery under DuPont, about 8,500

<p>
Significance: On 5 June 1864, the US army of General David Hunter crushed the smaller
Confederate army at Piedmont, killing the CS commander (General ``Grumble'' Jones) and taking
nearly 1,000 prisoners. Piedmont was an unmitigated disaster for CS arms in the Valley. The
disorganized Confederates could do nothing to delay Hunter's advance to Staunton, where he was
reinforced by Brig. Gen. George Crook's Army of West Virginia marching from the west. United,
the US forces moved on Lynchburg. Hearing of Jones' defeat, Gen. Robert E. Lee first rushed J. C.
Breckinridge's division back to Rockfish Gap (7 June) and then detached the Second Corps of the
Army of Northern Virginia under Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to confront Hunter at Lynchburg (12 June).
This detachment severely limited Lee's ability to undertake defensive-offensive operations on the
Richmond-Petersburg lines and served to open up the Shenandoah Valley as a second front in the
1864 fighting in Virginia.

Description of the Battle
<p>
Phase One. Cavalry Action at Mt. Meridian: Shortly after dawn, 5 June 1864, US cavalry
advanced on the Staunton Road and met CS cavalry under Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden at Mt.
Meridian. The US troopers were driven back until reinforced and again advanced to Mt. Meridian,
supporting their attack with ten field pieces. The Confederates responded with two guns. Imboden
continued to delay the US advance, while gradually retiring. US cavalry incurred about 100
casualties in the morning's action. Fighting occurred around Bonny Doon. In the wake of the cavalry,
US infantry marched south from Port Republic. 
<p>
Phase Two. CS Deployment at Piedmont: General ``Grumble'' Jones deployed his army in an
``L'' anchored on a bend of Middle River facing north and bending south along the ridge line. He
placed his two veteran brigades (under Col. Beuhring Jones and Col. William H. Browne) on the left
and center behind barricades of fence rails. His reserves, which consisted of home guards, were
drawn up in the woods just south and west of Piedmont. Vaughn's cavalry brigade was in position
along the Cross Road (present day rte. 778) east of Piedmont. His line was supported by artillery.
Jones made his headquarters in a tent in the yard of the modern McDonald House. (Imboden's
cavalry brigade after the morning's delaying action withdrew behind Polecat Draft near Round Hill.) 
<p>
Phase Three. US Advance to Piedmont: About 1000 hours, US cavalry drove the CS troopers
back to the main infantry line at Piedmont and then withdrew out of cannon range to await the arrival
of their infantry and artillery. Moor's brigade arrived first and deployed to the right of the road into
the river bend. They were fired on by CS skirmishers. Thoburn's brigade deployed to the left of the
road in the vicinity of the Shaver House. DuPont arrayed his artillery battalion on the heights
confronting the CS position. Hunter made his headquarters in the Shaver House. One brigade of US
cavalry was held in reserve. 
<p>
Phase Four. US Attacks on the Right: DuPont massed 22 guns against the angle in the CS line,
eventually forcing two batteries to retire and take up a position closer to Piedmont village. Shortly
after noon, elements of Moor's brigade (18CT) assaulted the hill to their right front, driving out the
CS skirmishers. Supported by a regiment of Thoburn's brigade, Moor's entire line advanced, driving
back the advanced CS line on the northern brow of the ridge. Jones withdrew his infantry to
barricades along Walker's Lane, reinforced his left to meet the US charges, and launched a
counterattack. Fighting swayed back and forth across the fields. Hunter now reinforced Moor with
Wynkoop's cavalry brigade, fighting dismounted, and renewed his attack. 
<p>
Phase Five. US Attack on the Left: While fighting raged on the right, Col. Thoburn led three
regiments through a ravine and woods on the left and attacked across the Givens Run Valley.
Mid-afternoon, he charged directly into a gap in the CS line that was opened when Jones reinforced
his left flank. CS reserves were advancing to fill the gap but Thoburn's regiment reached the crest
first, and a savage, hand-to-hand mel‚e erupted. About this time, Gen. Jones was killed, and the CS
defense came unraveled. Inexplicably, the CS cavalry (Vaughn) witnessed Thoburn's attack but did
not advance. 
<p>
Phase Six. CS Rout: Pressed on the front and rear, Confederate soldiers went streaming over the
steep bluffs behind to wade and swim the river. All order was lost. A nasty skirmish was fought over
possession of the ford to the rear of the Col. Crawford House. Stahel's US cavalry division
advanced on the far left to close in on the village by the Cross Road. They were met by Vaughn's
and Imboden's cavalry who at last came into play to act as rear guard. Some CS units attempted to
stand near the Middle River Church and at New Hope, and US pursuit gradually slackened. The CS
army lost about 900 captured.
