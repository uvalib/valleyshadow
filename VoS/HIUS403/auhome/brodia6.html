<P>
Received notice this morning that we would go to Fort Delaware at 10 
o'clock but the hours passed without any sign of movement, of which 
we were not sorry, for we preferred to remain in the city of our 
friends, rather than go to a fort, shut off from all the world by 
water as well as by its walls and be among our enemies.
<p>
Such sympathy was expressed and so much excitement stirred up through 
the city, that the authorities feared another outbreak of the 
populace (as on the 19th of April 1861) if they moved the prisoners 
through the streets in daylight.  The keepers of the prison expressed 
this opinion to our officers.
<p>
The morning was cloudy and soon commenced snowing.  In the afternoon 
we were again ordered to be ready to leave and started between 4 and 
5 o'clock, under the escort of the 111th Pa. regiment.
<p>
Stormy and cold as it was, a large crowd was assembled at the gate to 
witness our departure.  As soon as the prisoners appeared, the crowd 
commenced waving handkerchiefs, shouting and hurrahing for Jeff Davis 
and the South.  As we moved off, the crowd became perfectly 
uproarious, shouting, and hallooing at the top of their voices.  Many 
ladies were among the throng, some standing in the storm, others in 
carriages, from which they waved us a silent adieu, sometimes with a 
fervent "God bless you."
<p>
We marched up Calvert street, thence along the latter to the boat 
landing in which we were to take passage for the Fort.
<p>
The police (appointees of General Dix) were in attendance; some of 
whom were very nice men, but the most of them bear a cruel and 
malignant hate towards the Rebels and delighted to taunt and vex them 
in every way.
<p>
Some ladies were standing in the hall one day, asked the prisoners 
for a button; one was thrown out and fell at their feet, a policeman 
standing by grabbed it up and refused to let her have it.
<p>
We were soon aboard, all crowded into the lower part of the boat 
where nothing could be seen, and steamed down the bay to Fort 
Delaware.
