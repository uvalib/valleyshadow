But to return to our inquiry. From Lexington they went to take Lynchburg. Our men followed them,
but we had not enough to handle them, till we got reinforcements near L. Then they retreated before
us, & went on to Parkersburg & Wheeling. 

There is a report very current now, that Gen. Grant is killed, but there are so many rumors that I
never believe anything till confirmed beyond a doubt. It is too good news to be true. Perhaps,
however, his cause was the best for us that could have been pursued. He fought our men in their
fortifications, sacrificed them, & saved ours. Will he not have a heavy account to render, crimsoned
with the guilt of so many murders.

The Central Presbyterian contains an advertisement copied from the Boston Recorder of 10,000
