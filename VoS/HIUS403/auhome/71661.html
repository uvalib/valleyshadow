Dear Ma,<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Yesterday I wrote to Charles telling him of William's sickness and promised to write again today or tomorrow.  I don't think he is yet any better.  He didn't rest very well last night, not sleeping much, though not so restless as he has been.  His mind still wanders some but not so much as it did yesterday and day before.  The Dr. says he has an affection of the spine and through that affects his brain.  He just now advised me to try and get a private house to move him to, and promised to go with me to find one.  I think it will be a great deal better to move him if I can.  He is here in a room with 5 or six others making it too much crowded and too much noise, and with their bad breath.  He was at first so restless tossing from side to side and getting up, that I could scarcely keep him in bed at all.  He now lies quietly but doesn't sleep very much, has considerable fever, but does not complain of any pain.  The Dr.  has put a blister between his shoulder this morning.  All the medicine, he has given, is spirits of turpentine and dovers powder mixed with quinine and calomel.  I stay with him all the time and will, until he can be out.  The boys, of our company, are very kind in assisting me.

<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>Wm Wilson is this morning a good deal better.  His eyes were so swollen for a day or two, that he could not see at all.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>There are a great many sick here.
<br>
<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>A few regiments of the enemy were advancing this way yesterday, causing us to anticipate a battle here last night or today, but this morning it is supposed there will be no fight for some days.  I haven't time to write any more this morning.  I will write in a day or two again.
