Dear wife
<br>

	<img src="images/block.gif" width=50 height=1>I seat my self to in form am still injoying good health and wishing when this may reach you
it will find you injoying the same blessing that our god has bestowed upon me. I received your
letter yesterday eavening which was dated the 2nd. I was glad to heare that you all was well and
hearty but i was sorry to heare that you was disappointed in my [notl coming home but I thought
it best to tell you the truthe. I dont see any chance of a well man to get away from heare with out
runing off and I dont like to do that without a good cause but if sickness get in our family I will
strain all the nerves I have I will raise the blockades and come home let the consequences be what
it may or will try but if it is so that I dont get home you must trust in providence. I think you will
have some neighbours that will give you and you nead not be oneasy about me volunteering
before i see you and the children thats one thing certain. concerning the barger business I have
risen to you the first of October so I thought you new that we oad [owedl him. their has bin
severle letters I sent that I received no answers. I sent some money to you with J. Skeles [Skylesl
when he was heare last $21 it was. I sent 2 other letters one by mail one by F.J. Sheats. rite
whether you received them or not. we have had some too or three very coald wether snowing and
cleating raining as usual. Smith Jones wants some 20 bushels of corn. he said they would pay the
money down when they take it away but i think it best for to get the money first as you no him as
well as I da if you have the corn to spair rite me and if he pays me i will rite to you for he said he
would pay when we draw a gain. it is dew us now but its uncertain when we get it. So no more at
preasent but remain yours until seperated by death.
