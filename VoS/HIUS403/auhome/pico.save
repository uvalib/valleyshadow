After reading Catton's piece, we were especially concerned with using 
documents to indicate the mood and preparation of the home front in 
anticipation of Sheridan's advance.  Since Catton lacks many primary 
sources, we'd be interested in these, such as letters, newspapers, and 
diaries.  To account for the effects of Sheridan's destruction in the 
region, we'd like to see documents on hospital records and agricultural 
holdings, such as livestock and grain supply.
