<img src="images/block.gif" height=2 width=40>The letters below have been excerpted from "Until Separated by Death," the correspondence of Jesse Rolston Jr. and Mary Catharine Cromer Rolston.  The Rolstons and their five children lived in Mt. Solon, in the northern part of Augusta County.  Jesse joined the Confederate Army  in Staunton on July 16th, 1861, and did not return home permanently until June 3rd, 1865.  Most of the letters in "Until Separated by Death" are from Jesse to Mary Catharine, but it also contains the letters of friends and family.  Though few of Mary Catharine's letters to Jesse survive, the letters from Jesse and others give a unique perspective on her life at home, as well on on homefront life in general.
