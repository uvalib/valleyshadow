Started again this morning for Baltimore.  On account of there being 
no windows in the cars, the view of the beautiful scenery was almost 
entirely lost.
<p>
At Jefferson's Rock, I had a very imperfect sight from the door of 
the car, by looking over the top of it.  A temporary bridge has been 
thrown over the Potomac here, completing the connection of the 
Baltimore and Ohio railroad.
<p>
For several miles down the river the country is hilly and rough, but 
after leaving the river, it
becomes level and gently hilly and very beautiful and rich.
<p>
Arriving in Baltimore about the middle of the afternoon, we halted at 
the Camden Station; being unexpected visitors, but few people were 
abouts; but soon it became known that a lot of Rebel prisoners had 
come to town; and several thousands quickly assembled, eager to catch 
a glimpse of such deluded creatures and rebellious subjects.  However 
not a few among the throng came to look upon their friends and those 
who were battling for liberty and freedom.
<p>
All communication was prohibited, as 
far as possible, but questions 
would be asked and answered.  "Throw me a button" said one; "a 
postage stamp", another; a third, a "Confederate note", etc.
<p>
At length we were formed in line and marched down Howard to Madison 
street, and thence to the City Jail for lodgings.  All the way the 
crowd grew more dense and more boisterous, until we reached the Jail, 
where the ladies waved their handkerchiefs and the children hurrahed 
for Jeff Davis.
<p>
We were confined in the North end of the building.  It is very strong 
and most conveniently arranged.
<p>
Having had nothing to eat since breakfast at Winchester, our
appetites were proportionately craving.  The long wished for supper 
came at last -- and such a supper, bread and coffee -- at least what 
they called coffee.  A decoction of rye sweetened with molasses, a 
nauseating mixture, tasting as if there were something rotten in it.  
Next thing wanted was sleep, which was to be had by the two in each 
room, sleeping on a single cot.  Worn out by loss of sleep & travel, 
I had a tolerably comfortable night's rest.
