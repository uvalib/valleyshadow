<p>The last Sab. in May, <name>Jackson</name> was fighting in Winchester, 
the first
in Jn. was the battle of Seven Pines near Richmond, which commenced on
Sat.  A sacramental meeting was in progress in this place at the same
time.  Preaching by <name>Mr. Harris</name>.  The second Sab. in June,
<name>Jackson</name>, or
rather <name>Ewell</name> was fighting at Port Republic with
<name>Fremont</name>.  The firing
was heard here all day by many, a distance of 33 m.  The next day
firing was heard for some hours- an engagement between
<name>Jackson</name> & <name>Shields</name>.

<h3>Jn 8, Sab</h3>
<p>In the evening, <name>Br. L</name> was present at the funeral of
<name>Mr. Berry</name>'s son
who was killed the preceding Mon at Port R.  The first time the body
was sent for, it could not be obtained, because the infamous
<name>Fremont</name>
was,

<p>Sometime in May, <name>Cousin S.</name> & <name>Ellen</name> went
with <name>Mrs. Dickson</name> to the
camp to see her husband.

<h3>Jn. 23</h3>
<p>Went with <name>C- S.</name> to see <name>B. D.</name> a boy who was 
wounded at Port R.  His
brother brought him home after several days, but his wound was not
dressed until the tenth day.  It is thought he may recover

<h3>Sab Jn. 30</h3>
<p>Firing has been heard in the vicinity of R. for several days, &
intense anxiety had been felt to learn the result. Tidings were bro't to
church that our armies have been victorious thus far, that many
prisoners and cannons have been taken-heavy loss on both sides.
Public thanks were offered for their deliverance.  Our help is in God
& in him alone.  The battle [] & continues to do so for a []

<p>to pick strawberries.  Very heavy firing especially in the
evening.  <name>Br. L</name> started to C in the morning on business.

<h3>Tues.</h3>  
<p><name>Mr. Wright</name>, a neighbor who has four sons in the army, one 
of them now a
prisoner, passed by.  To the usual inquiry "What news?" he pulled out
of his pocket a copy of the telegrames he had copied in S. reaching to
Mon. midnight.  <name>McClellan</name> has been driven from his 
intrenchments [?],
is in so local across White Oak Swamp to James River.
<name>Stuart</name> took
3000 prisoners yesterday.  A S. J. brigade (2300) have laid down their
arms.  <name>McC</name> had destroyed vast quantities of stores, & the 
opinion is
that the whole army will be "demolished." This news afforded great
relief, as it had been feared that <name>Halleck</name> would come on 
with 100,000
men as [] said he would by Sab. eve while our men (By command) could
not get over till Tues.  [] enemy.  Being partially deaf,

times on this occasion.  <name>Sister C.</name> counted 25 reports in one 
minute by
the watch.

<h3>Wed.</h3>

<p>A steady rain.  A week today since the fighting commenced.
Battles inevitably bring rain.  We got a Whig of Fri. yes. & devoured
it eagerly, but got little about the battle as they are not permitted
to publish yet.  Heard that some Louisianians advanced to the charge
with the name of <name>Butler</name>, as their was any, fought
desperately.  <name>Butler</name>
& <name>Hunter</name> & <name>Wood</name>!  Noble triumvirate.
<name>Lincoln</name> & <name>Seward</name> & <name>Greely</name>,
triumvirate No 2.  <u><name>Greely</name></u> it may be, the most deeply 
stained of
the whole.  <name>Butler</name> is the best man for our cause within the 
limits of
the S. C. He has given a union to the Southern heart, and a name to
the Southern cause as one that none among ourselves could possibly
have done.  They thought they


<hr><h2><a href="/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson5.jpg">page 5</a></h2>
<p>were united & in earnest, before his reign came, but there's a
difference since.  <name>Lincoln</name> performed a similar operation for 
us at the
commencement of the struggle by his proclamation for 75,000 men,
insulted Va. almost to a man and drove them out of the Union as by a
thunderbolt.

<h3>Thurs.</h3>
<p>No prayer meeting yes.  Got a Whig this morning and
devoured it as usual.  News encouraging.  The Eng Par. are loud in
their denunciation of <name>Butler</name>.  A Montreal paper also speaks 
in terms
of unease and reprobation says N. O. will yet take frightful vengeance 
for these
bitter wrongs.

<h3>Fri. July 4.</h3>
<p>What are the people in Yankeedom thinking of today?  Perhaps
however they have not got the breath yet & are still hugging the
delusion that Richmond will soon be theirs.  Mac. will get up a battle
of falsehoods as usual, but truth will out sometime, & how astound


<hr><h2><a href="/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson6.jpg">page 6</a></h2>
<p>ing when it comes.  Pity, pity, that the Northern people should
have been made the dupes of such a set of knaves.  I seldom think of
it without remembering the lying spirit which was permitted to take
posession of Ahab's prophets that he might be persuaded to go to R- &
fall.  This judgement from God has fallen upon the North because of
their declension from him.  Its effects, it is true, have come upon
us, & more heavily thus far than upon them, but the end is not yet.
We too have cause for deep humiliation, but we shall achieve our
independence, & if guided aright, shall [] a high destiny & be far
more prosperous than ever yore.  Never for one moment since this
struggle commenced has my mind wavered as to the final result.


<hr><h2><a href="/staunton/e.images/va.au.emerson7.jpg">page 7</a></h2>
Never could I for one moment believe that a righteous God would
suffer us to be trodden down as the mud of the streets, overtaken as
cruel and insolent invaders might thereafter.  Too many prayers have
been ascending to heavens night & day for such an event to come to
pass.  Retribution may possibly be delayed a short time but it will
most assuredly come.  The violent dealing of the wicked will acrue
down upon his own head.  May heaven lighten the blow, & turn the
hearts of both nations to him & to one another.

<h3>Sab. July 6</h3>
<p>About this time the funeral of <name>Wm. H. Randolph</name> took 
place.  He lies
in the center of the grave yard by the side of his young wife.  Was
killed in the battles of Richmond. Not long after was the funeral of
<name>Mrs. Buchanan</name>.  And after was the funeral of <name>George
Baylor</name> killed at the
battle of Cedar Run in his 20th year, so young, & such a universal
favorite.

<h3>Dec. 29</h3>
<p>A long hiatus.  Couldn't help it. So many things to occupy the
attention.  It would be in vain to attempt to enumerate the multitudes
of events which have happened since the last date.  The 29th & 30th of
Aug. the second battle of Manassas took place.  At this battle <name>Col.
Wm. Baylor</name> was killed, leaving a heartbroken wife & mother & 
sister to
mourn his loss, but they have hope in his death.  <name>James
Gabert</name> was
also killed in this battle.  His brother <name>John</name> was wounded 
before but
died after, & was brought home to be buried.  <name>L Kerr</name> an
