  Brig. Gen. W. MERRITT,
  Cmdg. First Cavalry Division:

  GEN.: The major-general commanding directs that you leave a
  small force at Swift Run and Brown's Gaps, to watch said gaps, and
  with the balance of your own and Custer's division swing around
  through or near Piedmont, extending toward and as near Staunton as
  possible. Destroy all mills, all grain and forage, you can, drive off or
  kill all stock, and otherwise carry out the instructions of
  Lieut.-Gen. Grant, and extract of which is sent you, and which
  means, "leave the Valley a barren waste." In carrying out these
  instructions, no villages or private houses will be burned. Camp closet
  the left of the infantry at Mount Crawford to-morrow night. The Sixth
  and Nineteenth Army Corps will move to Mount Crawford to-morrow.

  Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
  JAS. W. FORSYTH,
  Lieut.-Col. and Chief of Staff.

  Maj.-Gen. SHERIDAN:

       *     *     *     *     *     *     *

  Do all the damage to railroads and crops you can. Carry off stock of all
  descriptions, and negroes, so as to prevent further planting. If the war
  is to last another year, we want the Shenandoah Valley to remain a
  barren waste.

  U. S. GRANT,
  Lieut.-Gen.
