<img src="images/block.gif" height=5 width=50>The web site you are entering is the culmination of a semester-long research project at the University of Virginia for "HIUS 403: Digital History and the Civil War," a new class which explores both the challenges and benefits of  presenting traditional historical research on the World Wide Web.  Our project is an examination of homefront issues and experiences particular to the residents of Augusta County, Virginia, during the American Civil War.  Where possible, we rely on primary documents--principally letters, diaries, newspaper articles--to let the residents of Staunton and Augusta County speak for themselves.  To organize the information we have collected, our site is divided into six separate categories of investigation: The Military, Women, Religion, African-Americans, The Economy, and Staunton.  In our examination of these separate issues, we hope to offer a coherent picture of the experiences of a single community.
