<h3>Augusta Home Units Team Starter Index</h3></center>


<p>
The Augusta Home Guard units were organized throughout the war to defend 
Staunton and the people of Augusta County.  The main unit designations 
for these men were the 3rd Btn. Valley Reserves, Capt. Avis' Co. Provost 
Guard Staunton, and the Marquis' Boys Battery.  These troops saw action 
at the Battle of Piedmont, where regular U.S. troops on June 5, 1864, routed 
the smaller, 
weaker Confederate forces.  The victory allowed the U.S. forces to occupy 
Staunton for the first time in the war.<p>

The Valley project has already researched and compiled their 
military dossier files.  The team put the information concerning the 3rd 
Btn. into a <A 
HREF="http://mrc.itc.virginia.edu/valley/search.cfm">searchable 
database</A>.  The team also has access 
to a searchable catalog of the two wartime Staunton newspapers, the <A 
HREF="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~ela/ssnews2.html">Spectator</A> and the 
<A HREF="http://cti.itc.virginia.edu/~ela/rvnews2.html">Vindicator</A>.<P>

The men of the 3rd Btn. were of two types: the teenaged boy or the man in 
his late-40s.  Most entered service for the first time on April 23, 
1864--meaning the vast majority of the battalion were soldiers for no 
more than 44 days.  If not soldiers, what were these men?  Most were 
farmers in Augusta County, serving the war effort by trying to meet the 
great demands of the food supply for the CS Army.  But more important 
and more widespread was the regional sense of impending danger, of the 
home front becoming the war front.  And it did.  We shall try to tell 
their story.
