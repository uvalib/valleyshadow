Slingluff gives a first-hand account of the burning of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and the subsequent capture of many of the Confederate soldiers who participated in the burning. Slingluff defends the decision to burn the town by describing the extensive destruction of farms, homes, and towns in the South by the Union army.
