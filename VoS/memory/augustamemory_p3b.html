<p><b>The Beginnings of the Band</b></p>
<p>By virtue of longevity, the Stonewall Brigade Band has served as
Augusta County's principal mode of public commemoration of the
Civil War. Its musicians initially called themselves "The Mountain
Sax Horn Band" and used the alternate title "Turner's Silver Cornet
Band" by 1859. The Civil War and its memory soon prompted the band
to adopt its current name, "The Stonewall Brigade
Band."<sup><font size="0">1</font></sup> By 1866, the band had
begun a long series of public, postwar performances to memorialize
Stonewall Jackson and other Confederate soldiers. Such
performances, alone, offered scant foundation for postwar
reconciliation between North and South.</p>

<p><b>The Stonewall Brigade Band during the Civil War</b></p>
<p>During the Civil War more than half of the Mountain Sax Horn
Band's founding members entered service with the Fifth Virginia
Infantry. The Fifth would serve as one of the two principal
infantry units from Augusta County in what became Confederate
General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. In April 1862,
eight of the bandsmen joined six other soldier-musicians in
receiving the official designation, "Fifth Regiment Band." A year
later its musicians, in turn, merged with those in the four other
Virginia regiments that, along with the Fifth, composed an infantry
brigade formerly under the direct command of General Thomas
Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson. In May 1863, the five regiments and
the newly consolidated band received the official designation
"Stonewall Brigade" in memory of Jackson, who was mortally wounded
at Chancellorsville that
month.<sup><font size="0">3</font></sup></p>
<p>The Staunton bandsmen returned periodically to their hometown,
most often while accompanying Confederate troops during the
campaigns waged for control of the Shenandoah Valley. In May 1862,
for instance, the musicians led fellow Confederate soldiers through
Staunton as part of maneuvering by Jackson that would spare
Staunton Union occupation that
year.<sup><font size="0">4</font></sup></p>
<p>In February and March 1863, the musicians returned (now
unaccompanied by other troops), paraded through Staunton, and
played concerts to raise funds for soldiers' families. One of the
town's newspapers noted proudly that the band's "sweet strains of
music" had "cheered the soul of 'Stonewall Jackson' and his brave
soldiers in the 'tented
field.'"<sup><font size="0">5</font></sup></p>
<p>Away from the tented field and during combat, the musicians
mainly served as litter (stretcher) bearers and as hospital
assistants. Such duty spared them many frontline hazards; only one
of the antebellum bandsmen from Staunton died while in Confederate
service. At Appomattox in April 1865, the Stonewall Brigade Band
numbered seven active members when it surrendered with the Army of
Northern Virginia's other remaining units. By August of that year,
the organization had resumed peacetime performances in
Staunton.<sup><font size="0">6</font></sup></p>
<hr />
<p><b>The Stonewall Band After the War</b></p>
<p>In 1864, the bandsmen visited "in silent reverence" the grave of
Stonewall Jackson in Lexington, Virginia, and they probably
provided the musical accompaniments to many battle-zone funerals of
Southern soldiers.<sup><font size="0">8</font></sup></p>

<p>In 1866, the Stonewall Brigade Band held a benefit concert to
help fund the Confederate section in Staunton's Thornrose Cemetery.
Thornrose contained the grave of William E. Woodward, the sole
Civil War fatality from among the ranks of the antebellum Staunton
bandsmen, as well as the graves of many other Southern soldiers,
local and non-local, known and unknown. Later that same year, the
musicians played in Staunton on the anniversary of Stonewall
Jackson's death, then led a parade of Confederate veterans to
Thornrose to decorate the graves of their fallen comrades. By
itself, this gesture of memorializing both their brigade's former
commander and his former troops buried in Staunton offered scant
foundation for postwar reconciliation between North and South.
Jackson had been ruthless towards the Union enemy, and the
inscription on Woodward's monument in Thornrose expressed a
similarly unyielding sentiment in quoting Woodward's dying words:
"I will never retreat. Victory or
death."<sup><font size="0">9</font></sup></p>

<p>During a railroad-stop by President and Mrs. Ulysses Grant in
1874, Staunton's mayor, N. K. Trout, informed the President that
the Stonewall Brigade Band was the "only remnant of war" memory in
the town.<sup><font size="0">7</font></sup> Trout would have been
more accurate in characterizing the band as Augusta County's most
visible remnant of Civil War expression, rather than its only such
expression. A charter drafted for the bandsmen in the 1870's
prescribed a generous array of venues: "fairs, commencement
exercises, and parades of every description." By the late 1890's,
their performing schedule would expand to an average of three
concerts weekly. Doubtless there existed ample wartime precedent
for their memorializing and commemorating the Confederacy in much
of this postwar activity.</p>

<p>In addition to these events, and postwar performances at
Jackson's grave in Lexington, the Stonewall Brigade Band
commemorated and celebrated the Confederacy at a dizzying variety
of functions after the Civil War. The bandsmen raised money for and
performed at monuments and burial grounds for Confederates outside
Staunton and entertained surviving Southern veterans of all ranks
and their families, both in Augusta County and at distant points.
During performances, the musicians often evoked the Southern war
effort by playing "Dixie."<sup><font size="0">10</font></sup></p>

the two tablets at right. The tablet, one of several erected in and

sometime after this photograph was taken in c. 1970. The west wing

<p>In 1877, the musicians began an intermittent, annual tradition
of joining the Virginia Military Institute cadet corps for
commemorative exercises at the New Market Battlefield, site of a
Confederate victory in nearby Rockingham County. When Stonewall
Jackson's only child, Julia, married less than a decade later, the
band presented her with a scroll that bore the rosters of both its
current and Civil War-era incarnations, thereby proclaiming the
close ties to Jackson of even those musicians too young to have
served in the war. In 1927, the band played at the dedication of
stone-mounted, bronze tablets erected by the United Daughters of
the Confederacy to mark the area of Stonewall Jackson's mortal
wounding and the troop-positions of Confederate forces on Civil War
battlefields in and around
Fredericksburg.<sup><font size="0">11</font></sup></p>
