                This section contains articles that appeared in the Augusta County newspapers in the years immediately following the end of the war.

              <blockquote>
                This section contains selected memoirs, essays and articles that were published in the years after the Civil War, all of which touch on the war and how it was remembered in Franklin. Some of these were first-hand accounts, written by participants in the war. Others were written by relatives, children, and friends of those who had lived through the war. <a href="../..//memory">You may also search the memory articles for Franklin and Augusta</a>.

              <blockquote>
                This section contains images and discussion of how the Civil War was remembered in popular culture in Franklin County. The burning of Chambersburg dominated physical memorials and representations of the war in county, although unflattering images of African Americans also became common in local culture in the decades after the war. This section surveys these images and monuments to the war's memory in Franklin, providing context for their development in the county.

              <blockquote>
                After the war Pennsylvania established a claims commission to review petitions for reimbursement for damages sustained during the war by communities along the border. A great majority of the claims came from Franklin County, largely because of the burning of Chamberburg. This database is a searchable set of the 594 Chambersburg claims.
