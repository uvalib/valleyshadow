                This section contains images and discussion of how the Civil War was remembered in popular culture in Augusta County.

              <blockquote>
                After the end of the war, the United States allowed Southerners who had remained loyal to the Union to petition to be reimbursed for losses they had sustained during the war while supporting the Union. From 1871 to 1879, 137 people from Augusta submitted applications for reimbursement, most of which were denied. This section contains all the surviving petitions and files, in which people from Augusta argued over what had constituted loyalty during the Civil War. <a href="../../soclaims">You may also search the Southern Claims Commission Papers</a>.

              <h3>The Augusta Archive: The First Version of the Valley Project</h3>

              <blockquote>
                The <i>Valley of the Shadow Project</i> began in 1993 with support from the University of Virginia, and later found another partner in the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace in Staunton, Augusta County. The Woodrow Wilson Birthplace supported the development of the "Augusta Archive," which was the first web version of the Valley Project. The Augusta Archive was first displayed publicly in the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace museum in Staunton, and served as the prototype for later versions of the Valley Project. The Augusta Archive is no longer a functional website. It has been archived here as a part of the history of the Valley Project.<br />
