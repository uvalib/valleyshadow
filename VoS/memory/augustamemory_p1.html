                This is a series of letters from Robert E. Lee to Hon. W. W. Corcoran. Lee discusses raising money for Washington College. He also mentions his own ill health during the winter of 1869-70. And in response to the Franco-Prussian War, Lee laments human nature and its tendency toward violence and war. Lee does, though, mention his own sympathies for a "warlike people" that seeks to "drive invaders from their land."

                This article provides a detailed account of William Sheridan at Cedar Creek, from the perspective of Crowninshield, who rode with Sheridan and who frames this battle account as part of the larger campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. Crowninshield praises Sheridan and disparages the opposing general, Jubal Early (though the article goes out of its way to praise the marching ability of Confederate troops). The article also offers generous praise to Mosby.

                The journal provides an introduction for and a transcription of Major H. B. McClellan's speech about General J. E. B. Stuart. General W. H. F. Lee preceded McClellan with introductory remarks about the spirit of the soldiers of the Civil War, who had fought nobly for their "country" (he does not specify which country). Ideas of reconciliation are evident in Lee's tone. McClellan's speech praised Virginia, J. E. B. Stuart, and Stuart's family.

                This is a lengthy and laudatory obituary for Alexander H. H. Stuart.

                This is an article about the upcoming unveiling of the Stonewall Jackson statue in Lexington, Virginia, full of praise for the general and his fellow Confederates and Virginians.

                This is a sentimental account of late antebellum wartime white southern female childhood, written by the daughter of Augusta County figure A. H. H. Stuart, but epitomizing "Lost Cause" ideas of an antebellum plantation ideal of exotic (even "happy") slaves and bucolic peacefulness: part of a vision that was dominant in the first decades of the twentieth century. This account also contains romanticized and dramatic images of the Civil War and the Confederacy--a part of the larger "Lost Cause" ideology that also put forth the glorified plantation images. And there is a romanticized passage about Robert E. Lee.
