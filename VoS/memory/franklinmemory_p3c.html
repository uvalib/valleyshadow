            A Franklin County sender mailed this souvenir viewfolder, containing 22 colorized photographs of Chambersburg scenes, to a California recipient in 1921. Revealing little about the Civil War at first glance, the number and subjects of the views in this folder, taken together, actually offer a unique estimate of the degree to which the war's collective memory composed Chambersburg's self-image in the early twentieth-century. This section presents the complete viewfolder, showing the proportion of photographs related to the Civil War to those unrelated to that conflict.

          <b>The Viewfolder</b>

          <p>Viewfolders opened accordion-style, like postcard folders, but were intended for mailing as a complete package of double-sided picture cards--with the address on the package's back cover--not as individual, single-picture postcards.</p>

          <p>Ruth Sollenberger of Franklin County mailed this souvenir viewfolder, containing 22 colorized photographs of Chambersburg, PA, to Paul K. Lyttle of Upland, California in 1921.</p>

          <p><b>"Ruins of East Market Street"</b></p>

          <p>The burned-out buildings represented in "Ruins of East Market Street" were, in fact, long gone by the 1920's. The picture from the viewfolder is actually an artist's adaptation of a photograph showing Chambersburg during the Civil War.</p>

          <p>Shortly after Southern troops had departed fire-ravaged Chambersburg in 1864, Northern photographers arrived and recorded its ruins on more than two dozen different negatives. From these, they soon manufactured and sold photographic prints. The editors of <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, an illustrated newspaper, were early purchasers of the images. The <i>Harper's</i> issue of August 20, 1864, carried engraved adaptations of three of the photographs, one of which was the "Ruins of East Market Street":</p>

          <p>Note the subtle differences, including the identification of the street name, between the <i>Harper's</i> version of the wartime photograph (left) and the viewfolder's version (right).</p>

          <p><b>"Lincoln Way Arch"</b></p>

          <p>Dedicated in 1914, the arch stood on one side of the Diamond in downtown Chambersburg. While the smaller lettering on the arch served lesser functions, such as commemorating the 100-year anniversary of Chambersburg's founding and helping publicize the Lincoln Highway, or "Lincoln Way," the arch's largest lettering denoted its principal function: marking the route that Confederate General Robert E. Lee and part of his Army of Northern Virginia followed towards Gettysburg.</p>

          <table border="0" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/bicentennialbooklet_arch2.gif" width="450" align="middle" border="0" hspace="16" alt="arch photograph" /> <!--R1C1--></td>

            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>The motivation for erecting the arch was probably more economic than commemorative. A year before its dedication, President Woodrow Wilson had presented a speech at Gettysburg and reinforced that battlefield's status as the nation's premiere Civil War attraction. The arch in Chambersburg claimed a piece of the mammoth tourism pie that was Gettysburg by subtly redefining the battle as a campaign whose participants passed through locales not limited to Gettysburg and its immediate environs. The arch no longer stands.</p>
