<br />
<p>At first glance, the Stonewall Jackson Hotel in Staunton appears
to embody vivid, explicit commemoration of the Confederacy. Named
for one of the South's most successful Civil War generals, General
Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson, the massive building opened in
1924. Today, it still dominates much of Staunton's skyline, an
enormous, rooftop sign proclaiming the name and presence of the
"STONEWALL JACKSON HOTEL." Yet a closer inspection--a review of
some of the key events and decorative features housed in the hotel
at one time or another--reveals approaches to Civil War history
that have been restrained and surprisingly flexible in contrast to
the structure's imposing physical presence.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Creating the Stonewall Jackson Hotel</b></p>
<p>In the 1920's, residents of Augusta County who commemorated the
Confederacy possessed ample cause to celebrate the memory of
Stonewall Jackson. During the war, Augusta County's Fifth Virginia
Infantry had fought under Jackson from 1861 until his mortal
wounding in 1863. During the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862,
Jackson's troops shielded Staunton against Union armies, driving
those from the Valley and prompting one of the town's wartime
diarists to exult
"<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-valley?id=AD1500&amp;data=/texts/english/civilwar/diaries&amp;tag=public&amp;part=226&amp;division=div3">
the whole country is ringing with the name of Jackson</a>." After
the war, another resident of Staunton summarized the marches and
combats of Jackson's men during the 35 days of events composing the
core of the Valley Campaign in 1862: "a total of 245 miles,
fighting in the meantime 4 desperate battles and winning them
all."<sup><font size="0">1</font></sup></p>
<p>Jackson gained renewed memorialization when A. T. Moore opened
the Stonewall Jackson Hotel in Staunton in May 1924. Built of
brick, the tall hotel contained 100 rooms. Sometime later in the
1920's, its management also began operating the Stonewall Jackson
Golf Club, a satellite facility situated a short distance north of
Staunton.<sup><font size="0">2</font></sup></p>
<p>Then and since, however, the hotel's role in Civil War
commemoration was ambiguous. Moore and his associates had selected
the hotel's name in an contest open to Augusta County residents
that drew nominations from many individuals. Of those, only three
people--a resident of Churchville and two residents of
Staunton--suggested "Stonewall Jackson." The top runner-up
nominations reflected either the region's scenic terrain or its
historical associations outside the Civil War era: "Woodrow
Wilson," "Fort Lewis," and
"Appalachian."<sup><font size="0">3</font></sup></p>

<p>Colorised postcards, marketed at about the same time, show four
areas of the hotel's interior that its management considered most
appealing to potential guests. All four areas lacked decorative

<p>High-profile advertisements appearing in two special,
commemorative editions of the Staunton <i>Leader</i>, the city's
principal newspaper, likewise ignored Jackson and the war. The
advertisements appeared more than a decade apart yet were identical
in listing the hotel's primary attributes: "Fire-Proof . . . modern
in every respect" (1929) and "fireproof and modern in every
respect" (1940). The advertisement published in 1940 mentioned a
secondary attribute vaguely: Staunton's "central" location amid the
Shenandoah Valley's internationally renowned "scenic and historical
points of interest."<sup><font size="0">4</font></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, it was not until the late 1940s that the owners added
the rooftop sign "STONEWALL JACKSON HOTEL," more than 20 years
after opening.<sup><font size="0">5</font></sup></p>

<p><b>The Gold Star Mothers and the Stonewall Jackson Hotel</b></p>
<p>In 1936, the Stonewall Jackson Hotel hosted a gathering of Gold
Star Mothers, women who had each lost at least one son during World
War I. On the first day of their three-day visit to Staunton, they
formally organized themselves as the Gold Star Mothers of North
America. Like the similarly named, preexisting American Gold Star
Mothers Association, the group founded in Staunton regarded their
organization as "patriotic" in nature and World War I as a noble
conflict. They viewed the late President Woodrow Wilson, Staunton's
most famous son, as a "hero" and their visit to his birthplace in
the city as a "pilgrimage."<sup><font size="0">6</font></sup></p>

<p>In September 1937, some 150 members of the Gold Star Mothers of
North America returned to Staunton for a four-day pilgrimage to
Wilson's birthplace. Stauntonians again showered the Mothers with
hospitality and placed a float publicizing their organization at
the head of what was later described as "the longest parade in
Staunton's history."<sup><font size="0">7</font></sup></p>
<br />
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">The Stonewall Jackson Hotel served as the Gold
Star Mothers' "headquarters," as it had in 1936, providing them
with lodgings and hosting a number of their indoor events. Midway
through the first full day of activities in 1937, they assembled in
the hotel's ballroom to hear Virginia Congressman A. Willis
Robertson deliver the keynote
address.<sup><font size="0">8</font></sup> In his speech, Robertson
equated the human cost of the Civil War with that of America's
participation in World War I, in 1917-1918, and of recent fighting
in China in 1937. "We know the heart-ache of pitting brother
against brother, and the anguish of sending sons to a foreign
battlefield," Robertson
noted.<sup><font size="0">9</font></sup></td>

<p>His concluding remarks quoted and drew authority from Stonewall
Jackson's dying last-words following the Civil War battle of
Chancellorsville: "Let us cross over the river and rest in the
shade of the trees." Similarly, Robertson argued, the United States
must show by example that "the dark rivers of fear and suspicion"
that sprang from "international greed" and that "separate the
nations of the world" could be crossed. World War I, according to
Robertson, had fulfilled Jackson's dream of a reconciled North and
South--reconciliation that needed extension across the globe in
1937--by fostering the blend of "Union blue and the Confederate
gray" into the American "unity" of Wilson's well-intentioned but
delusional military crusade. Yet such blending in the army that
Wilson sent off to war was the only redeeming aspect that Robertson
could find in the deaths of the Mothers' sons. (Robertson had
served as an army officer during World War
I.)<sup><font size="0">10</font></sup> Jackson had actually
expressed little if any reconciliationist sentiment during the
Civil War, but Robertson perhaps overlooked this historical silence
out of eagerness to provide the Mothers with a pacific message.</p>
<p>At the time Robertson spoke, the reconciliation between North
and South was primarily among white people. Lodgings at the
Stonewall Jackson Hotel were restricted to whites in 1937; and
Robertson was a segregationist who later, as a United States
Senator, would join the States' Rights Democratic ("Dixiecrat")
Party and its program of supporting the nation's Jim Crow laws. He
would also join 95 other Southern Congressmen in signing the
Southern Manifesto, which condemned the <i>Brown v Board of
Education</i> decision by the United States Supreme
Court.<sup><font size="0">11</font></sup>.</p>

<p><i>The lobby of the hotel after its renovation in
2005.</i></p></td></tr></table>
<p>The Stonewall Jackson Hotel today boasts characteristics altered
considerably since 1924, not the least of which is its patronage by
guests of all races. Unchanged, however, is the subdued connection
to Jackson, which remains limited largely to the rooftop sign.
During preparations, in 1995, for the hotel's renovation, planners
considered an option to create a "Living History" atmosphere by
giving the building prominent, "Civil War period
dcor."<sup><font size="0">12</font></sup> Yet this approach failed
to materialize by the time the hotel reopened for business in 2005;
if anything, its references to the general and the war are even
scarcer now because his portrait no longer ornaments the lobby.</p>
