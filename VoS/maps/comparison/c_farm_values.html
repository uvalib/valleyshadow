    <blockquote>
      These maps show the distribution of farm values throughout Augusta and Franklin in 1860. While land values were higher in Franklin, farm values fluctuated throughout each county with no one area dominated by the wealthy or poor.

    <blockquote>
      The maps are derived from a D. H. Davison map of Franklin County, published in 1858 and a Jedediah Hotchkiss map of Augusta County, published in 1870 and based on surveys completed "during the war." The maps have been georeferenced at the Virginia Center for Digital History, using ESRI Arc Info to produce a Geographic Information Systems map and database of households.
