<hr width="80%" />
<blockquote>This map set compares the churches and schools as
central places in both counties with one mile buffers around these
social institutions. Franklin's greater density of schools and
churches, especially along its perimeter, corresponded to its more
dense population and its greater commitment to free public
education.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The maps are derived from a D. H. Davison map of
Franklin County, published in 1858 and a Jedediah Hotchkiss map of
Augusta County, published in 1870 and based on surveys completed
"during the war." The maps have been georeferenced at the Virginia
Center for Digital History, using ESRI Arc Info to produce a
Geographic Information Systems map and database of
households.</blockquote>
