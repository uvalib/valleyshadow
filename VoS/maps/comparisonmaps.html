<h2><a name="geography" id="geography">Geography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_geographic.html">Geographic Location of
the Counties</a></h3>
<blockquote>This map locates Franklin and Augusta counties within
the Shenandoah Valley, 200 miles from one another. While similar in
their geography and agriculture, the counties were separated by
slavery.</blockquote></li>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_elevation.html">Elevation in the
Counties</a></h3>
<blockquote>This map set compares the elevations in both counties
with residences included. In both places residents lived at all
elevations, but settlement concentrated in the broad plains along
rivers and streams.</blockquote></li>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_rivers.html">Streams and Rivers in the
Counties</a></h3>
<blockquote>This map set compares the hydrology in both
counties.</blockquote></li></ul>
<br />
<h2><a name="infrastructure"
id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_rr_roads.html">Railroads and Roads,
1860</a></h3>
<blockquote>This map set compares the rail and road development in
both counties, showing a highly networked infrastructure in both
places. Franklin's greater density of major roads was offset by its
truncated Cumberland Valley Railroad, which made Chambersburg its
terminus in the late 1830s. Franklin's railroad effectively ended
at Chambersburg, since its southern extension was too old and light
to handle significant traffic. Augusta's line, The Virginia
Central, by contrast, extended through the county south to
Covington and there linked up with other roads connected to the
South.</blockquote></li>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_towns.html">Towns in the
Counties</a></h3>
<blockquote>These maps compare the distribution of towns in Augusta
and Franklin with a one mile buffer around them. No resident of
Augusta lived more than 5.5 miles from a town or village, and no
Franklin resident lived more than 6 miles from a town or
village.</blockquote></li></ul>
<br />
<h2><a name="agriculture" id="agriculture">Agriculture</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_soils.html">Soils in the
Counties</a></h3>
<blockquote>This map set compares the soil types in both counties
and includes residences. Residents of both counties concentrated
settlement on the best soils in the broad middle
plain.</blockquote></li>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_agriculture.html">Agricultural Production
by Precinct, 1860</a></h3>
<blockquote>Franklin's crop mix was more diverse than Augusta's and
more heavily concentrated on wheat. No precinct in Franklin County
averaged as much corn in its crop mix as the precincts in Augusta
with the least concentration of corn. In Franklin all precincts
except Warren and Dry Run produced more wheat in their crop mix
than even the even the most wheat intensive precincts in
Augusta.</blockquote></li>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_farm_values.html">Average Farm Values,
1860</a></h3>
<blockquote>These maps show the distribution of farm values
throughout Augusta and Franklin in 1860. While land values were
higher in Franklin, farm values fluctuated throughout each county
with no one area dominated by the wealthy or
poor.</blockquote></li></ul>
<br />
<h2><a name="politics" id="politics">Politics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_politics.html">Presidential Voting by
Precinct, 1860</a></h3>
<blockquote>These maps compare 1860 presidential voting by precinct
in Augusta and Franklin. Bell's overwhelming victory in Augusta
overshadows subtle electoral patterns in the
Douglas-Breckinridge-Bell split. The Democratic candidates together
captured significant votes in Staunton and in the eastern and
northern parts of the county, the broad middle part of the Valley
just east of Staunton. In Franklin, Lincoln's support came from the
broad middle of the county, centered in places with visible African
American populations, such as Southampton, Montgomery, and the
South Ward of Chambersburg.</blockquote></li></ul>
<br />
<h2><a name="religion" id="religion">Religion</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="comparison/c_churches_schools.html">Churches and
Schools, 1860</a></h3>
<blockquote>This map set compares the churches and schools as
central places in both counties with one mile buffers around these
social institutions. Franklin's greater density of schools and
churches, especially along its perimeter, corresponded to its more
dense population and its greater commitment to free public
education.</blockquote></li></ul>
