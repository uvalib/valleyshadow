transportation infrastructure, including railroads, major roads,
and minor roads. Nearly all residences clustered along major and
minor roads. Only a handful of residents lived off of a
road.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The map is based on GIS data and soil type data derived
from a 1978 U.S. Geological Survey soil map. The map is derived
from a D. H. Davison map of Franklin County, published in 1858. The
Davison map has been georeferenced at the Virginia Center for
Digital History, using ESRI Arc Info to produce a Geographic
Information Systems map and database of households.</blockquote>
