      <blockquote>
        In 1857 German artist Edward Beyer traveled throughout the Old Dominion. His paintings were published in 1858 as the Album of Virginia: Illustrations of the Old Dominion. We have included a selection of plates, showing sites in Augusta county, the Shenandoah Valley, and Harper's Ferry.

      <h3><a href="../porte.crayon/porte.html">Porte Crayon's Drawings</a></h3>

      <blockquote>
        During the 1850s, David Strother, otherwise known as Porte-Crayon, an illustrator for Harper's Weekly, traveled throughout the Shenandoah Valley. He described his journey in Virginia illustrated: containing a visit to the Virginian Canaan, and the adventures of Porte Crayon and his cousins. Strother's drawings are very much in the "local color" vein, but they are still interesting representations.
