      The maps are derived from a Jedediah Hotchkiss map of Augusta County, published in 1870 and based on surveys completed "during the war." The Hotchkiss map has been georeferenced at the Virginia Center for Digital History, using ESRI Arc Info to produce a Geographic Information Systems map and database of households.
