Hayden kept a livery stable in Staunton, Augusta Co., Va. His claim was disallowed in 1873.

Carwell appealed this decision to the Court of Claims in 1895. Of particular interest is Carwell's brother's testimony, which claims that Carwell also served in the Home Guards of a town near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.

                Isaac Ware was a black man living in Staunton during the war; presumably he was a slave, since his name is not listed in the Registry of Free Blacks for Staunton. The Commissioners were satisfied that he was loyal to the United States but did not see sufficient evidence proving that Union troops took his horse, and therefore disallowed the claim.

                Simon Stickley filed this claim in 1872 for $135, claiming the Union army under General Hunter's command took one horse in 1864. Stickley was a 32 year old farmer who was arrested once by Confederate authorities. He failed to answer questions 10 to 13 and only one neighbor testified to his loyalty. The claim was disallowed.

The claim includes the voucher Furr received when his horse was taken, signed by J. M. Wiggins of the 20th Ohio Cavalry. The Claims Commission did not find J. M. Wiggins in its records and thereby determined that the claimant was "imposed upon" by someone taking the horse for non-Army purposes; the claim was disallowed (in 1872?).

Flory further claimed that a third horse was confiscated from him while he was on his way to reclaim the other two horses. The claim was disallowed in 1871.

                Engleman's claim for more than a thousand dollars worth of livestock, produce, and household goods was disallowed by the Commissioners in 1872 on the grounds that he voted for the Ordinance of Secession. When appealing this decision to the Congressional Court of Claims between 1893 and 1897, Engleman and his heirs went to great lengths to prove that he had not, in fact, voted for secession. The Court of Claims ruled in 1896 that Engleman had been loyal to the United States, but it is not clear that his heirs ever received compensation.

                Sheets' claim for horses, livestock, and farm implements was disallowed by the Claims Commission in 1878, despite evidence of his loyalty to the United States, because they ruled that the Union Army had not taken Sheets' property for strictly military use. Sheets appealed this decision in 1901, when the Congressional Court of Claims ruled in his favor. Sheets' son George died while serving in the Union Army. In one of the briefs filed by Sheets' attorney, witness William Houff stated that Sheets' neighborhood, Mt. Sidney, was known as "the little United States" due to its high population of Unionists.

A witness, Humphrey Ware, testified that 2 horses were taken; one sheet within the claim includes a second horse in a varying claim of confiscated property: 2 large bay horses, both 5 years old, one valued at $250 and one at $200; also, 40 bushels of corn, valued at $40.00. Why the lists vary is unclear. The claim was disallowed December 9, 1872.

                Price placed his claim for horses and cattle in the fall of 1871, and the Commissioners disallowed it in 1872, citing his vote in favor of the ordinance of secession as evidence of disloyalty. Price's heirs appealed this decision to the Court of Claims in 1895, and the case appears to have continued until 1904 without reaching any real resolution.

The confiscation occurred during the burning of the Valley of Virginia in September 1864, and Samuel Garber's barn was burned as the cattle were confiscated. Despite the Claims Commission's satisfaction that Eli Garber was in fact loyal to the Union, the claim was disallowed on a technicality: many of the cattle taken during the Valley burning were sold and the money paid to the Treasury. Therefore, the cattle were not necessarily used as army supplies. The claim was disallowed around 1876.
