                            Special Commissioner asked of each claimant and witness. The questions
                            encompassed general personal information and then sought to establish
                            the claimant's loyalty to the United States during the war. There were
                            specific questions for white male claimants of voting age and others
                            designed specifically for African American claimants. The final eight
                            questions on the list concerned the property listed in the claim.</blockquote>
