  <p>I William S. Young of the County of Augusta and State of Virginia now in feeble health but of sound mind and disposing memory do make this my last will and testament in manner and form as follows to wit:</p>

  <p>1st It is my desire that my Executor herein after named shall as soon after my dealth as seems best to him sell all of my estate both real and personal on such terms as he may think best, hereby conferring on him full power and authority to convey the real estate, and the proceeds of my estate distributed in the following manner. I give to my brother Andrew Young one hundred dollars to be first paid out of my estate after my debts and funeral expenses, my reason for giving my brother so small a legacy is that he like myself has no children and his situation and circumstances do not require it.</p>

  <p>I give to my brother Robert one thousand dollars to be paid next to my brother Andrews legacy.</p>

  <p>I give to the children of my deceased Sister Mary Kich Five hundred dollars to be equally divided between them giving to grand child or grand children the portion that would fall to the parent if living.</p>

  <p>I give to the children of my deceased Sister Margaret Young, who married Wm. A. Young Twelve hundred dollars to be equally divided between them.</p>

  <p>I give to the children of my deceased brother Elisha Young Two thousand dollars to be equally divided between, I give to the children of my deceased Sister Jane Cunningham Two thousand dollars to be equally divided between them, to grand child or grand children living at my death the portion that would go to the parents if living.</p>

  <p>I give to my Executor herinafter named one hundred dollars to be by him paid to the trustees of Tinkling Spring congregation and by them loaned out at interest. Ten dollars to be by them collected at the end of each year for the support of the pastor of said congregation until the whole is exhausted I give to my nephew David S. Young of Staunton three hundred dollars to be used by him according to his discretion in the education of such of his children as remain uneducated at my death.</p>

  <p>If my estate shall not prove sufficient to pay all of the foregoing legacies they must be paid salably except the Legacies given to my brothers Andrew and Robert.</p>

  <p>If there should be a surplus over and above the payment of the foregoing legacies I direct it to be paid to the children of my deceased sister Margaret Young to the extent of Five hundred dollars, the residue over and above that to be paid to each of foregoing legatees saleably.</p>

  <p>I give to my Executor my Books to be by him distributed among my relations giving my family bible to my nephew John E. Young son of Wm. Young the life of Christ, to my neice Agnes B. Young to her also my silver spoons. I desire my Executor to place over my grave a suitable monument or head and foot stones as may seem to him suitable.</p>

  <p>I nominate and appoint my friend and nephew David S. Young executor of this my last will and testament hereby revoking any and all former wills by me made in testimony whereof I hereunto set my hand and seal this 17th day of September 1858.</p>

  <p>Wm. S. Young[signed]</p>

  <p>Acknowledged in our presence who at the request of the testator witness the same</p>
