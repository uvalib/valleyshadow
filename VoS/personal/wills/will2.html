            Kayser by executors or administrators a certain female slave George Anna aged about 15

            fee to the children of my said daughter then living, but should my said daughter L. W.
            Kayser be without children being at the time of her death, then and in that event the
            said L. W. Kayser shall have full power and authority to dispose of said Slave with her

            claims of all persons whatsoever. Witness my hand and seal this 20th day of August 1859.</p>
