        <p>May the 18th My last will and testament</p>
        <p>I leave and bequeath my boy James Richard to my nephew James W. and [?] C.C. all my neice
            (children of my sister Margaret S. Calhoon) for there unceasing kind feelings and
            respects to me from infancy. I wish the rest of my property to managed as follows. I
            wish my woman Margaret and her son Douglas Poterfield Tylus Emerline and all her
            increase and there increase to be kept hired out as long as they live and will bring any
            thing unless they should choose to be sold. The first three years hier I wish to be kept
            as a fund by adding the interest to the principle to be used as I shall name. If any of
            the negroes belonging to the fund be sick or usless, they are to be attended to and the
            expences taken out of this fund and if super [?] ated there board to be paid should it
            proove[sic] not enough then let it come out of the following funds. I wish Margaret and
            all her increase and decendantsto be hiered out and the proceeds to be divided as
            follows My Brother Wm. B. Calhoon's children to draw the three sevenths to be equally
            divided between them Two sevenths to my sister Margaret S. Calhoon as she has always
            helped me to clothe myself and negroes one seventh to my sister Eliza Edmondson and one
            seventh to my brother James W. Calhoon. This I wish don yearly so long as the generation
            of the negroes last unless they wish to be sold in that case let the value received for
            them be divided in like proportion as above as to my beds and beding and other little
            things let my sisters decide that between them selves. Should my Dear Parents survive
            me, I wish them to have the benefit of all I have as long as they live and after there
            death let my will have full force. This is my sinsere[sic] desire. Should any grumble or
            be dissatisfied let there portion be devided among the rest.</p>

        <p>I desire this as a draft for will to be drawn by for the spelling is so bad that it would
            be a shame to go to court for record and some friends must be gotten to draw it off and
            be qualified to the correctness of the coppy.</p>
