  <hr width="80%" />

  <blockquote>
    These two narratives are taken from <i>Weevils in the Wheat: Interviews with Virginia Ex-Slaves,</i> ed. Charles L. Perdue, Jr., Thomas E. Barden and Robert K. Phillips, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1980), 243-44 and 346. <i>Weevils</i> is one of the finest collections of the 1930s WPA interviews. Only two examples mention slavery in Augusta county.

  <p>While I was out at the home place where my mother belonged on the plantation I was looking in the book case and came across that book and I wouldn't take anything for finding it.</p>

  <p>Just think when they died (white folks) they didn't have dresses on back. Son in law gave them clothes.</p>

  <p>Yes they were good when you could work but when you got sick they sold you.</p>

  <p>I had an aunt took fever in war time--left her feeble-minded. She wandered off sometimes. They sold her. they knew at big house traders was coming--kept it from her. Answer was, when they broke news to her she said, she just as soon belong to one white man as another. Tole us all good by like she was going on a visit. We never saw her no more.</p><br />
