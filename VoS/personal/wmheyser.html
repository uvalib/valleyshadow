<h3>SEPTEMBER 29, 1862</h3>
<p>Clear and dry. Death of Matthew Gillan. One of the first
volunteers to meet the call to arms, but remained a short time.
Returned, in worse shape, and declined thereafter. He was a kind,
goodnatured man, and will be missed by his family.</p>
Death of Jacob Oyster, a pillar of the Methodist 
Church, and a
staunch citizen, much respected. One of our last citizens of the
older generation.
<hr/>

<h3>OCTOBER 1</h3>
<p>John Mull and I visited one of 
the hospitals of wounded soldiers
in the Academy Building. About 100 of them, mostly wounded in
their lower parts, but some with their arms and legs off. They
are well taken care of and plenty of supplies for their wants.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>OCTOBER 3</h3>
<p>Rain, which we need badly. We see untold thousands of dollars
drained from our Treasury by unscrupulous men using the war to
further their personal affairs. We have several cases in our town
that did not get their wealth honestly, but robbed by men in
official stations.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 4</h3>
<p>Our town has greatly changed by the events of the war--business
is so good, our small town is taking on a city appearance of
activity. We hear the Rebels plan a retreat from Staunton.
McClelland at present has control of Winchester. Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation denounced in Richmond. Some here do not
think wisely of it as many abolitionists are so wild they would
change our Constitution. Some of the wounded here are Masons. One
who died at the home of Burnet, I read the Masonic service for
his burial. He and several others then taken to the cars where
they will be transported home for interment. There was quite a
number already received, filling up a car. Quite a rush of
females to view the deceased, there being a glass opening in the
box.</p>
<p>The crowd at the depot very large, from there to the hospital,
near the jail which I visited to see some acquaintances, and
perhaps offer a little help some way. To view this brings the war
awfully near and deep sympathy for these poor suffering men.
To my farm, find it too dry to plant anything. It will be a loss
his year, for a good crop if there is no immediate rain. The
engines and cars are very busy taking supplies to McClelland on
the Potomac. They are running night and day.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 7</h3>
<p>Clear and pleasant. Every day we hear the sad strains of marshal
music as the hearses pass carrying the dead from some distant
battlefield to be buried at their home. The hearses are draped
with flags and the procession partly military. Every day the cars
bring from 20 to 30 dead thru our town.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 8</h3>
<p>Pleasant. Left to visit my mountain land. Saw many turkeys and
partridges, but didn't have my gun.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 10</h3>
<p>Rain today. A great saving for the farmers who were facing a
great drought. business is flourishing in town. The Rebels are in
Mercersburg, and on the way to Chambersburg from St. Thomas.
This evening they entered our town, demanding its surrender. Some
1500-2000 cavalry, with some artillery. They immediately took
possession of the bank and telegraph office. Also requisitioned
provisions, clothing, etc. as to their needs. It has all happened
so quickly, we all felt safe knowing the Union Army was in
Williamsport, MD. The Confederate troops all look well fed and
clothed, and so far, conducted themselves orderly. They will be
busy stripping our stores and gathering up horses. I have sent my
three off with Proctor, I hope they got away safely. I did not go
to bed until after one o'clock, watching what may happen after
all retire. So far, all quiet. Secreted some of my most valuable
papers and went to bed, slept soundly until morning.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 11</h3>
<p>Clear and pleasant. Rose early and to the square. Saw Major Gen.
Stewart and Gen. Hampden in conference. The stores were all
closed. Broke open Isaac Hutton's shoe store, helped themselves
freely. Then to the depot and confiscated a large shipment of
arms and clothes. Afterwards, set fire to all the buildings and
left town by the Baltimore Pike. They had fired the building of
Wanderlick and Nead Co. which was used as a storehouse for
government ammunition. The succeeding explosions of shells and
powder was tremendous. The loss must be very great. All the
machinery and present locomotives destroyed at the shops. This
was all the fault of A.H. Lule, Supt. of the railroad shops. He
should have sent the war supplies back to Carlisle, instead of
keeping them here, being warned as early as three o'clock the
past afternoon. However, this saved our stores from being
pillaged as they got enough at the depot. Everybody out on the
streets seeking news.</p>
<p>About mid-day, a large scouting party of our troops came thru
producing a great sensation. We hear of another group at
Waynesboro, marching towards Gettysburg hoping to head them off.
All in all the invasion was a very orderly one. The troops were
well disciplined and polite. Not a single house or person
injured. They were more orderly than troops of ours that have
passed this way. Outside of their plundering of Isaac
Hutton's
shoe store, nothing else occurred to criticize them. Many people
from the country came into town in search of news and carried
home relics of the Rebel Invasion, as shells, balls, saberparts,
parts of musquets, etc. Nearly every man and boy had some
souvenier.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 12</h3>
<p>Clear and pleasant, the Sabbath. All is calm, who would suspect
that so much excitement had prevailed yesterday. However, there
is much apprehension they will return. Some 2,000 troops from
Maryland came this morning and encampted outside of town on the
Baltimore Pike. I knew not of their coming and arrival until this
afternoon. At three, attending a religious service at the Hall
among the wounded soldiers. Rev.
Bausman conducted the services.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 13</h3>
<p>Cloudy, a little rain. The encamped Rebels have moved on to
Fayetteville, and across the mountain to Cashtown. There they
went South thru Emmittsburg and Monrovia to the mouth of the
Monocacy. Thus completely avoiding the searching Federal forces,
and disappeared into Virginia. Their mission accomplished.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 14</h3>
<p>Pleasant. Out to my farm to ascertain the damage done by the
soldiers. Much fencing gone for fuel, and what corn they didn't
use, tried to burn. Many farmers without horses and at a loss to
do any work. We find no buildings burned or occupants harmed.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 15</h3>
<p>Much apprehension about the Rebels returning as they have
camped along the Potomac. We can hear cannoning from the vicinity
of Hancock, perhaps some skirmishes.
The Rebels had found little at our bank of value, but did not
complain. They were looking mainly for horses. I had previously
sent mine with my man Proctor to Waynesboro, some 16 miles
distance, for safekeeping. Many others not as fortunate as they
delayed. They did take eight young colored men and boys along
with them, in spite of their parents pleading. I fear we will
never see them again, unless they can escape.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 24</h3>
<p>Our church has decided on the final adoption of the much
discussed Liturgy as a book to be used in our church and family
worship. I am glad this had been decided, we were much divided.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 25</h3>
<p>Pleasant. Business at the bank, rode to my farm to inspect the
new seeding. Home early in the evening to do some writing.
Agreeable to the solicitation of Doctor
Wilson, an artist, I sat
for my portrait. He noticed some of my landscape work, which he
commended. I suppose my work would improve with practice, but it
is now too late in life to hope for much proficiency.
Some cavalry here this evening, to secure horses for Gen. McClelland's 
command. They hope to find two hundred by tomorrow
evening.</p>
<p>I fear Lincoln is a tool in the hands of the Abolitionists. We
need a man of Jackson's iron will in our present emergency to
hold our National Government together.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 27</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Our town filling up with drafted men to be sent to camp
for training. Visited a wounded Mason (Captain Miller Moody from
Ohio) who lost one of his legs at Antietam. He is very low in
spirits and much emaciated, his wife and sons are visiting him.
Spent some time with Wilson, the artist.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 28</h3>
<p>Clear and pleasant. We had a sale of the Rebels worn-out horses,
left here by Stewart's cavalry. Spent some time with Mr.
Wilson,
the artist.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 29</h3>
<p>Beautiful weather. Out to my farm for inspection of the seeding.
Nearly opposite there is an encampment of the drafted militia
under Col. Geo. Wiestling, who is to get them in military trim.
They are a raw set of men. It is hoped to get at least 600,000
men for another army together to crush this rebellion. Meanwhile
our national debt is staggering, some 640,000,000 dollars. The
expenditure of a million and a quarter a day to keep this war
machine going.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>OCTOBER 30</h3>
<p>Beautiful weather. At the bank, called to see Captain Moody who
is improving, but very weak. Spent most of the afternoon with
Jeramy Wilson, the artist. In the evening, took Capt. Moody some
fruit. Rev. Bausman called and stayed until about ten. He feels
that I should do more visiting among the members of our
congregation.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 1, 1862</h3>
<p>Fine weather. Visited Captain Moody who would like some fresh
fish. He is improving. Called then on Barney
Minnich, an old
fisherman, to procure some for me. Attended to Sabbath school and
Bible class activities.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 3</h3>
<p>Weather cold and rough. There was quite a change last night. The
sky is overcast with dark clouds and the wind has a wintry feel.
It sighs around the corners as in mid-winter, and creates a
melancholy feeling-for me, it is music. I can sit for hours and
listen to it with pleasure.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 4</h3>
<p>Business good at the bank, we declared a 5% dividend on the past
6 months business. The stock is $10 above par. We have a surplus
of $42,000.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 5</h3>
<p>Cold and rough. At the farm to plant some grapes.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 6</h3>
<p>Captain Moody's condition turns for the worse. I called on him to
discuss the salvation of his soul. Asked Doctor
Richards and
Doctor Senseny to look in on him, but too late. Sent for the undertaker.
Wife and two small sons very distressed. I do my best to comfort
them.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 8</h3>
<p>Snowing hard, already 5 or 6 inches. Called on Mrs. Moody to
offer some comfort. Assisted her in making preparations for her
trip home with the body. We gave him the last Masonic Service.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 11</h3>
<p>Cold. A rumor that the Rebels were again in Mercersburg, and
marching upon us. Sent everyone into a stampede of activity, to
hide their goods. The rumor proved false. We all feel those at
Washington are doing little to protect its citizens. Too much in
activity by our military leaders. They seem to not know what to
do. The removal of Gen. McClelland of the Army of the Potomac
creates some despair.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 13</h3>
<p>Visited Col. Weistling at the camp outside of town. He was much
dispirited over contradictory orders and no equipment. Making
little headway in training his men.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 14</h3>
<p>Beautiful weather. (Heyser reflects on his love for the changing
of the seasons.) How human it seems. He once knew springtime of
his life, his autumn years are past, now I am in the winter of my
years. How all dies and decays, but to be reborn again.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 16</h3>
<p>Winter has now set in, and everyone changes his living habits.
This is the time of year that brings families closer together:
The great war raging now casts a pall of gloom over it all.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 20</h3>
<p>Cold and rough. Feel unwell, very depressed. I need something of
a change. At the bank until noon. Came home and gave some
directions to Mr. Wilson the artist, who is painting my deceased
daughter, Harriet's portrait from a photograph. The war news is
bad, mostly from the indecision at Washington. They must play
politics first, and then decide the course of their plottings.
Much controversy over McClelland being relieved of his command. We
feel Lincoln but a tool in his party's hand.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 22</h3>
<p>Rough weather. At the bank a few hours. Home to attend to the
painting of my daughter, Hattie, it grows with interest as he
paints it. A most striking likeness. This work affords me much
pleasure. To the farm this afternoon with Mr.
Forbes, a barn
builder, perhaps in the spring I will put up one.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 27</h3>
<p>Moderate weather. Decorated the church for Thanksgiving. The
gallery and pillars ornamented with spruce. The pulpit lamps and
walk behind the pulpit beautifully ornamented. Two flags
handsomely draped in the background. The whole effect enhanced
when the gas lights turned on. Our efforts were a huge success in
that all were surprised as well as delighted with our
arrangements.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>NOVEMBER 28</h3>
<p>Snowing. Spent an hour with Doctor
Wilson, the artist, who is
doing a piece for a lady in Harrisburg. My old creative feeling
came over me and though it is 40 years since I've painted, feel I
could paint again.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 1, 1862</h3>
<p>Cloudy and unpleasant. Visited a few sick friends.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 4</h3>
<p>Moderate. Rode out to the camp to see Col.
Mikibbon about
payment for straw I furnished. Visited my farm, find one tenant
back with his work. The other progressing well. The camp shall
move soon, it is not a good influence on our local boys. I
remember my associations with camp life in the War of 1812, so
know what these young men go thru. (Heyser was 16 years old
then.) Everybody feels McClelland's removal a great mistake, even
the English newspapers against it.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 5</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Army of Potomac resumes the battle, now before
Fredericksburg. Visited Wm. Jude, a stocking weaver, to have some
made, a very interesting shop and man.
"This afternoon I visited Mr. Jude, an Englishman who is a stocking
weaver by trade. I went for the purpose of having some stockings made.
The shop is quite a curiosity in its way. It is not more than six feet
square and about six feet high. The door of entrance is so small that
stooping is necessary to get in. On the right as you enter in the
corner, is his loom, about four feet wide, on the West is a small
counter to which is attached a small vise and some other weaving
tools, such as boards upon which to stretch and put in shape
his stockings. On the South side is his spinning wheel. On
the left is his reels and spools with a couple of small boxes,
which I observed were locked.</p>
<p>"On entering his shop, I could scarce refrain the laugh. On the seat
of his weaving loom lay his daily companion, a yellow striped cat
called Peter, who amused himself trying to catch the spool of yarn
while he was weaving.</p>
<p>"'How do you do Mr. Heyser. I was wondering if you do not want
some stockings. I weave many a pair for you. Come Peter, behave
yourself' speaking to the cat. 'I'm just weaving these for a
particular old lady, maybe you know her, Mrs. Hare in the Row.'
You mean Mrs. McElhare. 'Oh yes, that's her. She's stout.' Could
you fit you? 'Oh yes. told her to show me her foot--faith, said
she, will do that and my leg too--if you want to see it. I had no
trouble to get her measure.' I said to him you must be happy in
your palace here. 'Ah,' said he, 'wool is dreadful high, but if
you get me the yarn, I weave then at journeyman's wages, Just 31
cents.'</p>
<p>"The shop is a curiosity--truly it is not the size of the shop or
house that makes contentment, this man appears to be satisfied with
his lot, and he is in some respects, like his shop--he is small,
somewhere about five feet, old, and pretty near worn out. He sits the
picture of habit. An old white hat, with the crown knocked in, and
from its looks, might have seen twenty summers, adorns his head. His
coat and other garments are in keeping with his hat. His pipe would
seem to have consumed a vast amount of the weed, his spectacles too,
bear the stamp of age. While he stopped his loom to converse with me, his
companion, Peter, coiled himself up on his lap to take his rest.
A place doubtless much occupied when his master is at work. This
little shop has a latch outside and inside, and thus shuts
out the world. He is a widower, and although he has
children, seems to be alone.</p>
<p>"I feel well compensated for my visit; I have never seen business done
in so small a compass."</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 6</h3>
<p>Cold and stormy, with dashes of snow. Have just heard of the
death of John Goteman, a baker by trade and a retailer of ale.
After some years, commenced a small grocery establishment. After
some years of a successful run of business, amassed considerable
property. He  was vain of his possessions, having been nicknamed,
Rothchild. With his increase of property, he grew in dimensions
himself, for he was a great lover of ale. When I last saw him, he
was quite disfigured from its use, a perfect bloat. His wife is
equally defamed from the same cause. Her face wears the
appearance of the full moon, almost twice its usual size and full of
blotches. It would seem impossible that human beings could be so disfigured
by drink. I am told he is almost a petrified mass, and can scarcely
be handled. He is a Lutheran, but paid little attention to the
interests of his soul. His son is rapidly following in his foot
steps.</p>
<p>Sitting before my comfortable fire, I reflect on the miseries of
the world, and the less fortunate which causes me to think of
friendships, of which there are very few that are true ones. Let
a man become degraded by no fault of his own, and see how few
recognize him. But let his prosperity become evident, and he has
countless friends.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 7</h3>
<p>Cloudy and cold. Feel indisposed, a bad cold, can scarcely talk.
The cold penetrates everywhere. Sorry to miss my Bible class. I
shall remain at home-meditate and write.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 10</h3>
<p>Weather more pleasant. Slept badly last nite. My cold still
troubles me, cough much. Jeremy Wilson the artist called, we
walked up to Jude's establishment as he was anxious to see it. I hadn't
noticed before how precarious his chimney was built. Without
mortar, and the stove pipe just stuck in. The movements of his
loom made it all tremble. Wilson thought it quite a curiousity.
Came home feeling the worse for my outing.</p>
<p>The war news tells Fredericksburg has been taken. The Rebels
taking up positions behind it. A fearful battle is shaping up.
Reflection on the war and governments that control them, and that
all lose in the end. The poor victims killed, giving the most.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 15</h3>
<p>Beautiful weather. My cold still continues; my breast quite sore
from coughing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 22</h3>
<p>Cloudy and rough. Buried John Ligget
and James Kirby today. News
from Washington very perplexing, opinions so conflicting nothing
gets resolved. This war has opened up a system of speculation
never seen before. It has turned fine honest men into plunderers
of our government. It seems no one is immune from this greed. I
believe this war will continue as long as it is profitable for
these scavengers.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 23</h3>
<p>I notice the windows of our toy shops wear the appearance of
approaching Christmas. I leave for Lebanon, Pennsylvania,
tomorrow to attend to Church business. This will be the first
Christmas ever away from home.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 24</h3>
<p>At Lebanon, staying with Mr. Miley, a pleasant family. Conducted
family worship.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 25</h3>
<p>Pleasant weather. Attended Christmas festival at Rev. Harbaugh's
church. Called upon to conduct the services.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 26</h3>
<p>Our first day's work on the revision of the Heidleburg Catechism.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 28</h3>
<p>Much work on our project, which seems to be going very well. Rev.
Harbaugh has three colored boys in his class. Brought back from
Virginia as contraband by our volunteers. They came here totally
illiterate, now know their letters. Read well and cipher
satisfactorily. One has been admitted into the church and the
others promising. It was a pleasing sight to see these poor
outcasts, far from their native soil pursuing the light of
liberty. I hope they do not fall under the influence of many of the
debased Africans now filling up our towns.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>DECEMBER 31</h3>
<p>Snowing. We call a halt to our nearly finished work. I must leave
for home, arriving there without accident about five P.M.
Bodies of John Oaks and
Augustus Howser brought home for burial
from Fredericksburg. A large concourse of people present at the
depot.</p>
<p>The condition of our government more gloomy than ever. Nearly
70,000 of our soldiers slain, and we are in debt over 700
millions of dollars. We can see no end to this plundering of our
resources.</p>
<p>Already the contractors of this war have emptied the treasury.
Many of our soldiers going unpaid.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 1, 1863</h3>
<p>Pleasant weather. At the bank, then home to read and write. Town
crowded with country people keeping New Year's Day. This day
Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation. I think it will do
more harm than good. Little can be done with it, but to make
more enemies.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 2</h3>
<p>With increasing years I am losing my relish for society, and
becoming more domestic. My loss of hearing, and other infirmities
point to my approaching end. Attended prayer meeting at the
Methodist Church. The night was dark, cold, and stormy, but
services well attended.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 7</h3>
<p>Very cold. More reports of war. Death of Liet.
Col. Housom of
this place. He no doubt was a good soldier, but from my dealings
with him, did not admire his character or reliability. The war
years profitable to our bank, as our deposits growing. We have a
surplus to invest.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 8</h3>
<p>We visit the poor, sick, and aged of our congregation. Some very
glad to see us. One, a Mrs. Measy, 85 years of age, nearly
destitute but of sound mind. Requested that she be buried beside
her husband in the churchyard. (NOTE: The Measy house is still
standing at 559 South Main Street. A single brick house that at
one time had a public pump in front on the sidewalk. After the
death of her husband, she ran a boarding house there for an
income. Her husband had been a shoemaker.)</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 10</h3>
<p>Rapid rise in stocks, much speculation, fortunes will be made,
but many will be ruined. An unhappy time for our nation, for it
will never be the same again. Greed and power transcends all.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 13</h3>
<p>Weather mild. War news bad. Sold my farm to Solomon
Brake for
$90.00 an acre. A very sudden transaction, being only two hours
in the making. He gave me a $1,500.00 note of the County
Commissioners, $3,000.00 in gold, and $175.00 in silver, $25.00
in treasury notes, and $100.00 in other paper. I took a judgment
note for $5,200.00 on the balance. This was the quickest cash
transaction I ever made. I will invest most of it in the Bank of
Chambersburg. I feel somewhat sadden selling the family farm,
like an old friend departing, but I must relieve myself of some
of my burden.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 16</h3>
<p>Left home for Philadelphia to attend to Church business. Stayed
at the Merchants Hotel on Fourth Street. Large delegation there
from all parts of the United States. Next seven days of lengthy
discussions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 24</h3>
<p>Weather unsettled. After morning worship, stopped at the Barber's
Shop for a shave, there being only about my lips to do, a matter
of a few minutes, for I have a full beard. I was charged 60
cents, a rascally sum, the man was totally unashamed to demand
it.</p>
<p>Called on Maria Dunlap, living at 17th and Arch Streets. She was
an early resident of Chambersburg, coming to Philadelphia with
her husband many years ago. He was a lawyer given to drink and
bad habits, thus losing his livelihood and now blind. They live
with her son-in-law, a Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>We are bringing to a close, with essays by each of us, on the
occasion of this tercentennial of the Heidleburg Catechism. We
have our photos taken that I place in my diary at the proper
place with their names and city.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 24</h3>
<p>Clear. Left for home today. We see the Cumberland Valley locked
in the icy fastness of winter. Got home late and found all well.
Chatted until late, and to bed.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 25</h3>
A pleasant Sabbath. Attended all day to the various duties.
<hr/>

<h3>JANUARY 26</h3>
<p>Raining. At home all afternoon writing my diary.
Mrs. Geo. Wolff
called to have me speak to her husband about his dissipation. I
spoke with him, however, the effort must be made by him to end
his intemperate ways.</p>
<p>Talk of "winding" up our bank, now that we are in a position to
do so. I fear there are some greedy stockholders behind this,
more to set up for themselves.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JANUARY 28</h3>
<p>Snowing. The war is going badly. President Lincoln has a fearful
account to render to the country and posterity for his unfaithful
stewardship. R. Tolbert calls with an
old bill of my son, Jacob,
who failed in business some years ago. This was news to me, as to
why he had not presented it before this. He now demands back
interest on the account. He shall be paid, but I shamed him on
the unjustness of conducting his business this way.
More talk of our bank going out of business. It would be a sore
loss to our country. We are in good shape and have very competent
officers. These are times that the selfish try and hide their
money, which creates chaos in the business world. When public
confidence is gone, years of building has been torn down.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FEBRUARY 20</h3>
<p>Had Rev. Feete of Woodstock, Virginia, to dinner. He
somehow made his way North with his small son to escape the
terrible poverty rife in the valley. His wife had died and sold
all personal possessions to buy food and a little clothing. His
son wore an old stained army blanket for a coat. All the basic
items of living were far beyond his reach. He hopes to find
employment here, that he will never return to Virginia.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FEBRUARY 21</h3>
<p>Out to my farm, my tenant rather distressed that Lincoln's draft
plans will take all the men, leaving the females to run things.
They are convinced all the real criminals are in Washington,
and Lincoln-the ring leader.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FEBRUARY 23</h3>
<p>Snowing hard. Indoors all day, reading and writing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FEBRUARY 28</h3>
<p>Cloudy and damp. Mild evening. The ladies all out for a promenade
despite the muddy foot paths. They take their pleasure at the
cost of muddy skirts and heels. Some of the more careful lift the
outer garment and expose to public gaze every shade and stripe of
"Balmoral." They walk until darkness drives them indoors. This is
Saturday evening, and they seem to have enjoyed it.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FEBRUARY 29</h3>
<p>Cloudy. The Sabbath, a day of rest. I shut out all the cares of
the business world. Read until late into the nite, my family have
all retired.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 3, 1863</h3>
<p>Great sale of old coins in New York, bringing astounding prices.
An 1804 penny brought $36.00. I still have a five dollar gold
piece of 1796, the year I was born.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 5</h3>
<p>Very cold. Rumors of the draft disturbing everyone. A farm
belonging to the Bank was sold for $8,525.00. A valuable farm.
The new tax stamp cost $10.00. All the other notes, according to
their value, must have stamps.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 6</h3>
<p>Still cold. Rode to my farm, my tenant is taking advantage of me
in my absence. He cannot account for a fair division of our
produce.</p>
<p>Attended a meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Academy.
John
Shryock being its principal. Since the U.S. Government has taken
it over for a hospital, Shryock declared bankruptcy. They paid
him $800.00. The building is in bad condition.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 9</h3>
<p>Damp and unpleasant. Spent time at bank and then to gas works. 
Attempted to make some wine, but fear it is all ruined, at this
business I am not adept.</p>
<hr/>         
<h3>MARCH 12</h3>
<p>Very cold. Working on the Hollywell Mill accounts for a
settlement to its sale. Received some money from the sale of my
farm, a problem what to do with it in these times. There is
trouble without money, and trouble with it.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 17</h3>
<p>Moderate. Gave my note for 500 dollars to an endowment for
 Franklin &amp; Marshal College at Lancaster. </p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 18</h3>
<p>Very wet spring. Farmers back with their work, high prices of
everything affected by the war. How the poor survive is a mystery
to me.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 20</h3>
<p>Cloudy and cold. At the bank this morning. On the way was
accosted by an old woman in need of wood and flour. I gave her
something that made her eye sparkle. "God bless you,
Sir," she said as I passed on. How much suffering thought I, is
hidden from view.</p>
<p>Nearly all is pain in some form, joy is a fleeting thing and its
companion, contentment, just as illusive.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 21</h3>
<p>Snowing. This is a bad month so far, all work far behind. At the
bank, feel I need more to do. I was unhappy before with too much
to do--now I need to resume some responsibility to quiet my
active mind. It's too bad our bodies can't keep pace with one's
brain. Our farmers upset over the condition of our currency.
Whenever they can, exchange their paper for silver and gold.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 21</h3>
<p>Sabbath. Still cloudy and cool. Devoted the day to church work.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 22</h3>
<p>Cloudy. At the bank. Spent rest of day at home in partial
enjoyment. Perplexed why Lincoln keeps McClelland checked when
he could shorten the war with his fine talents for military
tactics.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 23</h3>
<p>At the bank, had a profitable conversation with my
son-in-law, J. Allison Eyster, in
regard to my son, Jacob's
affairs which are in a bad state. He feels, properly managed, the
mill shall be able to pay his debts and my advances, I hope so.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 25</h3>
<p>As the fortunes of this war ebb and flow, so do the manipulators
of our finances make and lose fortunes each day. No thought as to
the good of our country, but all for personal greed and
advancement.</p>
<p>Our poor soldiers are but dispensable pawns in the hands of
the fiends in Washington.</p>
<p>Visited Hollywell, the capacity has been increased, and the
price, of paper greatly advanced. All due to the demands of war.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 29</h3>
<p>Snowing all day. This has been a rough month, farm work behind.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 30</h3>
<p>Clear, but still rough. My tenant, Mrs.
Noel, giving me trouble.
I shall be rid of her soon.</p>
<p>At my farm to help my surveyor. I fear it was too much for me,
probably walked 6 miles, overheating my feet and bringing on
severe fatigue, showing my age is fast overcoming me.
Arriving home, found Mr. Feete's son there, who I promised to
board until he gets a charge. His daughter already here,in bed
with a serious pulmanary condition. She may not last long. Also,
Maggie in bed with a bad throat, at present, my wife has her
hands full.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MARCH 31</h3>
<p>Rain and snow again. Almost every day this month was such. This
holds up all commerce with agriculture. Tomorrow, the first of
April will be a busy day with the mornings and renewing of
contracts. Miss Feete, our visitor, is gravely ill.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 1, 1863</h3>
<p>Pleasant, but cold. Town filling up with people to do
business and make contracts for the new year. All is tied to
money--it is the real God that people truly worship. It takes
more people to hell than to heaven. It makes more miserable than
happy. Yet it is necessary to maintain the peace, without a
common denomoninator, all would be chaos.</p>
<p>Several of my tenants have left me, not paying their rent, and
leaving the property in a wretched state.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 2</h3>
<p>Pleasant. My sick people at home show no improvement.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 4</h3>
<p>Very cold. I spend too much time at the bank now that
my other duties are ended. Also, I can give better attention to
my properties.</p>
<p>The war seems to lag, nothing very decisive happening.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 6</h3>
<p>Sun shines brightly this morning. My colored man,
Proctor,
invited me into the yard to hear the sun shout, "Wm. Heyser."
These superstitious people believe this happens every Easter
Sunday and Monday.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 8</h3>
<p>Weather is better. The farmers can now get some crops in. I'm
planning on starting a small orchard at my farm. I need to get
out more to exercise. Rode out to my farm to see my new tenant.
Find my old one has cheated me of much, however, I am to blame
for not attending to my own. The weather is changing again, still
can't work in my garden.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 10</h3>
<p>Weather more agreeable. Had dinner at Doctor
Fisher's spent an
agreeable two hours. Mr. Bausman was there also. A poor wretch
was hung in Hagerstown for the crime of murder. Seems he was a
rejected suitor in a love affair, so kills the girl.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 11</h3>
<p>Beautiful spring day. Did some business at the bank, and about
noon out to my farm. Put in a large strawberry bed, not used to
this much exertion-to bed early.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 13</h3>
<p>Clear and pleasant. Feel very cheerful, and in tune with nature.
God and nature are the same. Spent the morning at the bank, rode
out to my farm, a very pleasant ride. Worked in my garden an hour
or two.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 15</h3>
<p>Raining. Do not feel well today. At home all afternoon reading
and writing. The war news still bad. All seems to be one blunder
after another. England makes matters worse by encouraging the
Rebels, our debt increases. Our leaders are accomplishing
nothing, and Lincoln seems paralized. We could get in a war with
England.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 17</h3>
<p>Met Col. McClure at the bank. He seems to be enjoying life and
surrounding himself with all its comforts. He is right,if he can
afford it.</p>
<p>Received a letter from Mr. Robert Spring of Baltimore,
containing a check with Geo Washington's signature, dated
November 17, 1795. I place it in this book as a curiosity of the
owner, and art of the engraver of that time. It is a relic and
worth preserving. I paid $_____ for this autograph. (NOTE: The
check had been removed from the diary many years ago.)</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 21</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Rev. Feete and I walked
out to son Jacob's place. There
in his garden and mill we spent a couple hours. My son-in-law,
Allison Eyster, is rapidly getting the place out of debt,
however, it may take a year or two before it shows a profit to
them. The straw board business is becoming more profitable.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 22</h3>
<p>Pleasant. Spent afternoon in the country. All the crops are doing
fine. It looks well for a good fall harvest so far. Put in some
strawberries, work does not go easy with me now. </p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 24</h3>
<p>On April 1, 1863, myself--Wm. Heyser, and my brother-in-law,
Barnard Wolf, presented a set of communion and baptismal
service to the church as a token of our deep love and devotion.
We do not think this gift out of place as we are the two oldest
members left.</p>
<p>The consistory acknowledged the reception of so costly
and elegantly finished service, with appropriate remarks for the
donors.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 25</h3>
<p>REFLECTIONS on my father and mother. She was the most kind and
affectionate person I've ever known. I was her only son, and of
course, held a special place in her life. We took pleasure in
small things to please each other. She was in delicate health the
last few years of her life. I'll always miss her. My father
thought I was the apple of his eye. He was always kind to me, and
looked after my interests. During the last years of his life,
lived on the farm with me. The last six months of his life was
confined to his room and bed. I spent much time with him, resting
in a large chair by his side, that I might attend him, I was all
he had and gave him all the comfort that I could. He loved to
gaze out the windows,in different directions, to drink in the
beauty of the world he was about to leave. I was extremely
fortunate to have been blessed with exceptional parents. They are
much in my thoughts today. </p>
<p>Attended prayer meeting in the home of Richard
Woods, who lives
out on New England Hill, as it is familiarly called. (This is
Lincold Way West, at what is now Federal and Garber Streets.)</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 27</h3>
<p>Beautiful day. Out to my farm with my colored
man,Proctor, to set
out some fruit trees. I am tired, doubt if I will see their
fruit, but others will.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 28</h3>
<p>Clear and bright. Went again to the farm, this morning, put in
some corn and potatoes. Also put up some bird boxes. I am fond of
their presence and music, and useful to keeping off insects. They
add charm to a country place.</p>
<p>At home in the evening, reading and writing. The war news is a
bit encouraging.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>APRIL 29</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Indications of rain. Won't go to the farm today. Had a
meeting at my house of the Board of Trustees of the Theological
Seminary with a view to investing some funds in their treasury.
Attended a lecture at the Church, where I was accosted by a man I
did not know. He proved to be Geo. Rawhauser, a young man who
left here years ago and now shows signs of age. I am rapidly
increasing in years, soon I will be among the past.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 1, 1863</h3>
<p>Beautiful day. To the farm where I spent a very pleasant day,
working and reflecting on the past when my Mother and Father
lived here. Several friends would visit us. Now all are gone.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 4</h3>
<p>Fine weather. Time for the election of our boro officers and
school directors. How indifferent are the interests of our more
sober and staid citizens. Not one applying for school director
could ask a simple intelligent question regarding education. And
those that would levy and expend our funds can't conduct their
own business.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 5</h3>
<p>Rain. Our bank declares a dividend of 5% on its profits these
past six months, leaving a surplus of $9,000.00. Most of this
came by interest on money we have loaned out.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 14</h3>
<p>Left home this morning with Rev.
Bausman and Fisher for
Martinsburg in Huntingdon County to attend a meeting of classes.
We traversed some beautiful mountain country with stately stands
of trees. The vegetation is lush, and as far as eye can see, an
unending verdant carpet and canopy of the forest. How simple a
life can people live here, free to many city temptations and
illnesses.</p>
<p>What a magnificent view we had from the top of the mountain. A
great panarama stretched out before us, McConnels Cove, and
turning, a view of the Cumberland Valley. Now it impresses the
heart and mind, we could scarce tear ourselves away.
Descending, we took dinner in McConnellsburg, and made our way to
Sideling Hill at McEvanes. A change in the temperature is greatly
noticed. People had large fires burning in their hearths, which
made it pleasant indoors. Our party consisted of Dr.
Schneck, Dr.
Fisher, Rev. Bausman,
J.J. Brown, John
Rebo, H. Detricks, and
T.J. Apple, Elder Wm
Heyser, Wm. Bopart,
Daniel Miller, James
Cook, and David Berger, making quite a company. The evening
passed pleasantly, before retiring, all assembled in the main
room with the landlord and his family, who took devotional
services with us.</p>
<p>After an excellent breakfast, we prepared to pursue our journey.
I was very much vexed that we did not have morning prayers before
departing. We passed Sideling Hill and approached Bloody Run,
where we briefly rested. Here the road runs parallel with the
Juniata River. The banks are covered with splendid hemlocks and
spruce.</p>
<p>Here we take the road to Pattonsville. The Yellow Creek takes its
course thru excellent scenery of rocks and trees, whose nature
have been unchanged these thousands of years. A most delightful
and romantic spot. I could dwell here some time on its beauties.
At Pattonsville, we could find no accommodations at the Inn,
being a small mean place. A worthy citizen, noting our plight,
invited us to dine with him. An enjoyable experience. He was a
Mr. Dietrick, a Methodist.</p>
<p>Leaving here, we passed thru Harrisonville, arriving about five
o'clock at Martinsburg. This section of Morrison's Cove is a most
fertile and beautiful section of the county, Martinsburg
occupying the center of it. The people here are very hospitable
and intelligent. Their houses are neat and well furnished.
Fashion is beginning to make inroads on the backward way of life,
among the Dunkard Sect, which is predominant. The younger
generation has set in motion ideas that will change these crude
notions about peculiar methods of life. Already we see much of
this in evidence. We welcomed the rest of our members as they
arrived, and started our exercises. Rev.
Bausman preached the
opening discourse.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 16</h3>
<p>Our exercises continue, all members contributing. The
Tereentenary is quite a success, all members do well. I was much
congratulated on my efforts by the resident Pastor here.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 18</h3>
<p>Morning is quite cool. Fire is agreeable. We meet to agree on
some debatable issues of our procedures the next few days. Isaac
Rhodes invited us to dinner at his place, a beautiful farm about
2 l/2 miles from Martinsburg. On the adjoining farm, the yearly
meeting of the Dunkards is to be held, some 8 to 10 thousand will
attend. Vast preparations are being made. They will come from all
sections of America and Canada.</p>
<p>A meeting in the evening of our missionary societies. Much
discussion of various view points as to how we administer our
decisions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 19</h3>
<p>Cool. We are bringing our classes to a close here, after electing
several groups for the different Synods to meet next year. Even
here, we have petty politics among religious groups to via for
honors to represent their views of ideas. I was much honored and
congratulated on my writings and method of conducting prayer
services, often mistaken for one of the clergy. Why did the Lord
choose the business world for me, when I was better fitted for
the church?</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 20</h3>
<p>Clear and warm. We leave for home by the same route. Stopped in
Pattonsville where we had dinner with our former friends.
Proceeded to Bloody Run, where we watered and then to
Mackelwanes, where we put up for the night, first having a good
meal, and then religious exercises before retiring.
Schneck and
myself fortunate in getting the same room.
Bausman and Apple
roomed together in the same bed. Had quite a cat accident about
midnight. A loud scratching and thumping awakened them,the noise
coming from a nearby cupboard. Opening it, a howling cat jumped
out, which ran under their bed where it discharged its bowels
creating a horrible stench. Apple could scarce retain his
stomach. Got up, lit a match, but no other place to sleep.
Finally turned the mouth of the chamber pot upon it, so got thru
till morning. The incident created a hearty laugh in the morning.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 21</h3>
<p>Clear and warm. Had breakfast and services, and so departed. On
Scrub Ridge, we came upon an old stager who had planted himself
in the center of the road, tying up some seven carriages. We all
finally got by, very fortunate there were no females in the
company.</p>
<p>The rest of the way was dusty and hot. Had dinner at Mullins, at
the foot of Parnells Knob. Rested awhile and proceeded home
arriving about six. Glad to find myself home again.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 23</h3>
<p>Warm and dry. Great preparations being made in town to receive
the 126th Regiment, the nine months men from this county.
Reception marred by the huge clouds of dust. Huge crowds of
people passing back and forth, until late in the evening.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 25</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Awakened by the pealing of all the bells in town. The
chimes were a blend of all the different tones, a most delightful
sound. It was occasioned by the fall of Vicksburg. The streets
filled with excited and anxious men. But this war is far from
over, our debt is increasing at the rate of 2 1/2 millions of
dollars a day. Where will we all end.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 26</h3>
<p>A young soldier, by the name of Henderson, one of our provost
guards, was thrown from his horse last night and dragged to his
death. It seems he and a friend were racing on the turnpike, he
attempted to jump over a cow that was laying in his way, but at
the critical moment rose up, throwing the young man's horse,
which dragged him a short distance. He never rallied, and thus
passed into eternity. He is of respectable parents living in
Baltimore, who will be called to mourn over the death of a
wayward son.</p>
<p>Talk of re-electing Lincoln for our next President. I do not feel
his re-election is possible, after all his failures so far. He
has not the ability of statesmanship to wield the destinies of
our government. When this conflict is over, we will need a most
able man to solve larger problems, than we have now--particularly
those of the African race.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 27</h3>
<p>Warm. Our house is very quiet today, with all the children away
visiting. Time for reflection and silent communion with those we
knew-gone forever. How much of our past life was good or
profitable, and how much was wasted. Have we done our best and
how wisely? How little influence does one life have on the great
stream of civilization, as it gushes onward. So it now is evident
in Washington. With all this attention on President making,
rather than the interests of the country. Stanton, Chase, and
Seward are busy laying the hopes for their chances of occupying
the White House. I think all three are destined for defeat.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MAY 30</h3>
<p>Decorating the church for Sunday's celebration of the Heidelberg
Catechism.</p>
<p>Death of Rev. Feete's daughter. She will be interred tomorrow at
six in the evening. Rev. Feete has lost his last remaining
comfort. </p>
<p>Without a charge, means, and dependent on friends, his situation
can well call forth all the sympathy of those that know him.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 1, 1863</h3>
<p>Clear but windy. I rise early, but feel drowsey. I overtaxed
myself yesterday. Age is laying its heavy hand on me, as my
increasing years tax my vigor. I find myself reflecting on the
past too much, this is not good, yet it affords me pleasure that
I made some small accomplishments in the various departments of
life.</p>
<p>Death of old Mrs. Caesman, a German, died milking her cow. She
was a vender of fruits in season, a cheerful woman, but poor. Was
quite a fixture in our town, and will be missed.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 2</h3>
<p>Clear but windy. To my farm to work in my garden, the weeds are
making rapid progress. Weeds are like sin, always giving trouble,
and hard to exterminate. Worked all day and now am stiff and
tired.</p>
<p>Work goes hard with me. This evening assisted Rev.
Dyson with a
selection of books, for his library; read the news, and then to
bed.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 3</h3>
<p>Cloudy, appearance of rain. A letter from A. B.
Wingerd of
Greencastle, that he may have a horse to my liking. 
I am somewhat annoyed with thoughts and feelings that were
unpleasant to me. I endeavor to banish them, the temptation came
in every form--this is a world of trial in its most favored
aspect. There is always something to trouble and annoy.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 5</h3>
<p>Pleasant. At the bank a few hours. Am preparing an article for
the Messinger. Rode with Messersmith into the country to see a
horse. We ate strawberries and cream, finished my article.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 6</h3>
<p>A visit to my mountain land. I never tire of going there, as each
visit presents a new picture. I can sit here for hours listening
to nature's symphony and watching the ever changing life on its
stage.</p>
<p>I return home late in the evening, stay in reading and writing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 8</h3>
<p>Cold the past few days. Made fire and it felt comfortable. To the
bank a few hours, spent the rest of the day at home reading and
writing.
Col. McClure received a dispatch that 
we might be subject to a
raid soon. The bank has sent its most valuable papers off to
Philadelphia for safe keeping. Nothing has been confirmed to the
Rebels positions south of us, but speculation is rife and
everyone uneasy.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 11</h3>
<p>Cloudy. B. Wolff and myself spent a couple hours in the Lutheran
graveyard where an interment was being made. This churchyard is
in much disarray and scattered about. Many of the graves are lost
thru negligence of friends and the church. Part of John
Maderia's
family is in one place, and part in another. A Mr.
Humphrie's lay
beside Mary Maderia, then
John Maderia. Then a stone with the
inscription, "Our Sister". This was Catherine
Maderia, one of
their daughters who was a little backward, and received little
attention from the family. She was kept out of society and led a
life with the servants. I knew her well in my boyhood days by the
name of Kit. I believe the sin of this injustice was visited upon
the rest of the family, for none of them prospered in life.
Reading her epitaph finds only the word Sister, someone who knew
her history wrote beneath in pencil, "When my Father and Mother
forsake me, the Lord will take me up" May she have that rest
beyond this life, which was denied in this.</p>
<p>This evening attended a meeting of the lodge where some degrees
were confirmed by strangers from New York. Remained until about
ten, then home.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 13</h3>
<p>To my mountain land. Found my man has done little work. The
ride is beautiful and enjoyed my walk up thru the glade,a most
delightful spot, full of nature's beauty. It is an hour and a
half ride home. Feel greatly relieved from my anxieties, taking
this little excursion. Rain all evening. More talk of an
impending invasion of our valley.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 14</h3>
<p>Clear and unpleasant. Reports of an engagement near Winchester.
Our town in an uproar. Government property being loaded up and
taken away. The drum calls for volunteers.</p>
<p>All the army stores have been packed up and sent to Philadelphia.
Little attendance at church and Sabbath School. Much of the news
is false we hear, but it serves to upset the people. We all feel
Pennsylvania will be invaded. Many families are hiding their
valuables, and preparing for the worst. Some preparing to leave
town. Tonight we have many sleepless eyes, the houses all shut up
tightly, but the inmates astir.</p>
<p>The stores are packing up their goods and sending them off,
people are running to and fro. Cashier
Messersmith is sent off
with the books of the bank and its valuables. The cars are
crowded to utmost capacity. The colored people are flying in all
directions. There is a complete state of confusion.</p>
<p>After twelve we got word the Rebels have entered Hagerstown. The
stores are all closed, and the streets crowded with those that
can't leave. I am urged to leave. As President of the bank, might
be held responsible for its assets, which I doubt, anyhow I shall
stay to defend my property best I can.</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock a number of contrabands entered our town, fleeing
from Martinsburg with the Rebels not far behind. These were
followed by a wagon train, many on three wheels, and less being
dragged and pushed as fast as possible. The street is crowded
with horses and wagons, all in the wildest state of confusion.
Upon asking one of them as to their plight, said the Rebels are
not far behind.</p>
<p>Suddenly about two hundred more wagons, horses, mules, and
contrabands all came pouring down the street in full flight. Some
of them holloring the Rebels are behind us. Such a sight I have
never seen, or will never see again. The whole town is on the
sidewalks screaming, crying, and running about. They know not
where.</p>
<p>The road into town is almost impassable by the teamsters cutting
loose their wagons and fleeing with their horses. This further
jammed up our town, some of the horses fall in the streets from
shere exhaustion. One soldier was killed by the fall. After the
panic subdues, the teamsters that had cut loose their wagons went
back for them. At twelve the excitement is beyond conception. I
am again urged to leave. Mr. T.B.
Kennedy sent me a message,
feeling it was a good idea. I have consented against my
will-packing up my valuable papers and at two, left with
Mrs.
Heyser in my buggy, for Carlisle, committing the house to
William, Proctor my colored man, and girl. After I left they did
not stay,but put off for the mountains. Had difficulty passing
the wagon jam on the road and answering questions, arriving at
Stoughs town about 6 in the evening, where I shall wait for news.
About midnight, awakened by the news that the Rebels were at
Shippensburg. Dressing, we immediately left for Carlisle at
midnight, being so dark and the roads jammed with wagons, made
dangerous situation that I regretted leaving home in the first
place. However, thanks to Almighty Providence, we arrived safely
in Carlisle about 4 o'clock in the morning. Tried to get more
sleep, but impossible, excitement here is mounting.</p>
<p>We got a bite to eat, the horse fed, and left for Harrisburg. All
along the way the news had preceded us, people out securing and
leaving with their goods. Driving away their horses, and all
shops shut up.</p>
<p>Stopped in Mechanicsburg, a prosperous, but now excited town, to
learn of fortifications being made for Harrisburg. We were
advised to stay here, but decided to press on. On approaching
Harrisburg, I could see the fortifications with a large number of
men working on them. The railroad cars were filled with troops on
their way to Chambersburg with artillary.
We crossed the river without difficulty and found Harrisburg, in
wildest confusion. Merchants shipping away their goods, families
their furniture, and people fleeing in all directions. Almost
laughable scenes some created.</p>
<p>Stopped at Harris's Hotel. See few females, mostly men moving
furniture and stores, the streets are almost impassable. The
excitement is greater than Chambersburg. All the records of the
state have been removed under the expectation that Harrisburg
will be burned. Our state is doing nothing to defend itself
against invasion. Gov. Curtain seems to be paralized and unable
to act. We need decisions badly, and can't expect them from
Washington.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 17</h3>
<p>Very warm. The city is filling with volunteers and delegates to
the Democratic Convention. Rumors from Chambersburg that our
ships and stores have all been plundered and that the public
building may be burned that houses army stores. Appeals made to
the Gov. for troops to protect the state, but unheeded.
My son-in-law, J.A. Eyster, came this afternoon from
Philadelphia. Reports my daughter, Elizabeth and the children
well. News that the Rebels have left for Hagerstown, after having
done a minimum of damage to the town.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 18</h3>
<p>Warm. The Rebels have left Chambersburg taking with
them about 250 colored people again into bondage. Gov.
Curtain is presently very unpopular. Left Harrisburg for home
about two o'clock, in the afternoon, by way of the turnpike.
Traveling thru very beautiful and fertile countryside. Had tea in
Carlisle, pressed on for Stoughs town to spend the night. Here we
encountered many colored people fleeing the Rebels, as not all
have left the area. These poor people are completely worn out,
carrying their families on their backs. Saw some twenty from
Chambersburg that I recognized. Some men from Shippensburg urged
us to turn back, that danger was not past, but we decided to
press on, even though the night was black, stormy, and the road
dangerous. We were glad to see the lamps of Carlisle. Little did
we know of the perils that had been in our way, Almighty
Providence led us thru safely. It will be a journey my wife and I
will never forget. I suggested she write a book about our
adventurous journey. Weary and tired, we went to bed.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 19</h3>
<p>Pleasant, heavy rain thru the night. Much rumor-one knows not
what to believe. All is still alarm. The stores are still all
closed and business at a standstill. Unexpectedly met my man,
Proctor, who had made for the mountains, worked his way to
Newville from where he got to Carlisle. Of Fanny, our colored
girl, he knew nothing.</p>
<p>The papers are now calling for McClelland's recall. Without him
we cannot succeed.</p>
<p>Troops are coming in from neighboring states to support our few
that we can bring some order to our situation. It is ridiculous
that 800 Rebel troops can paralize the Southern portion of our
state without opposition. This invasion had been expected for
months, and totally ignored by our government.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 20</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Left for Shippensburg where we found things much in panic
as before. Large stampedes of men and horses from all parts of
the country. Dreadful accounts that the Rebels are still active
about Chambersburg, and are robbing and stealing as before. How
much of this is true, I cannot say as in times as these,
exaggeration is rife. Each small episode is magnified a thousand
times.</p>
<p>Decided to stay overnite in Shippensburg. Rained very hard. The
town is packed with people. I luckily found a bed for my wife and
I. A New York regiment stopped here very disgusted as they had
yet to see a Pennsylvania Company on the job. One I talked with
said, "Dam your State, we came here to protect it, where are
your Pennsylvania soldiers!" If they don't soon appear, we shall
go home.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SABBATH, JUNE 21</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Rose early, about four, to get an early start. Road
almost deserted. The New York Regiment encamped a short
distance from Shippensburg, along the road. Arrived at home
little after six, found my house still, silent, and musty. I
never felt so lonely, sitting in my own house without anything to
eat and no one about. Mrs. Fisher invited us over to have
breakfast, a kindness we shall not forget. Never again, under any
circumstances, shall I leave my home again. Just about Sabbath
School time, the town thrown into another state of confusion,
that a column of Rebels were advancing. This proved to be just a
poor man leading a few horses in town from his farm. So it goes,
what is fact and fancey, we continued with our worship, the
excitement subsided.</p>
<p>In the evening, troops came in from New York for our protection.
Reports that the Rebels are in Greencastle. I feel certain that
Lee will bring his army into Pennsylvania.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 22</h3>
<p>Clear. Troops arriving from Harrisburg. Four Dalgreen pieces of
ordinance arrive and taken out to the end of town to be set up.
The citizens have formed a few companies for defense, but how
effective could they be?</p>
<p>More troops have arrived, perhaps a thousand here now. We breathe
a little easier.</p>
<p>Our hopes are short lived. The troops have all been recalled to
Shippensburg, the small battery is run out of town. Excitement is
again intense in town.</p>
<p>A meeting is held of prominent men, to face the enemy, if they
should come and surrender the town on the best terms we can get.
Again these is a general stampede to leave town with valuables.
The road to Shippensburg is again packed with fleeing citizens.
There is not a Negro to be seen in town. At 11 o'clock, the
streets are deserted. I did not go to bed till about one. All is
quiet, but it is a sleepless town.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 23</h3>
<p>Clear. Rose early. A small local cavalry force rode out, but soon
returned. Wagons were sent out to secure the tents and baggage
the New York volunteers left behind in their flight to
Shippensburg.</p>
<p>Our squads of cavalry are leaving, a bad sign. We soon find out
as we make our observations behind drawn shutters. A large
squad was seen advancing at the German Reformed Church, coming
down the street, filling the whole space, moving at a slow pace,
their guns in position, ready for instant firing in case of
attack. About 300 entered the town as cavalry, the others took up
positions in fields in sight of town. Those entering proceded to
the public square where they immediately cut down the telegraph
wires at all points. After this they placed pickets at all points
to prevent surprise.</p>
<p>Our Committee met them and given to understand private property
would be respected, but they were to furnish provisions for
1,500 men. The Rebels behave very well. Not a citizen molested or
a house visited. We complied very well with their demands. This
afternoon they opened the warehouse of J. Allison
Eyster, and
made off with $4,000.00 worth of bacon, salt, beans, coffee,
crackers, etc. They also opened the warehouse of Oaks &amp; Linn, and
took almost 300 barrels of flour belonging to Jacob
Stouffer.
They broke in the heads of 20 barrels of whiskey, which they
poured out. At Miller's Drug Store, they poured a barrel of
brandy into the gutter. Captain Fitzhugh gave orders that if any
of his men were caught molesting a citizen, they would be
severely punished. I must admit they were a thoroughly
disciplined lot of men.</p>
<p>About 4 o'clock they moved towards Shippensburg, leaving a guard
on the wagons behind. At 9 they returned with their artillery to
their camp at the South end of town. We don't understand their
plans. Neither do we understand why the State hoards all those
soldiers about Harrisburg, leaving the Southern portion to the
invaders.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 24</h3>
<p>Clear. The Rebels are active. They have closely kept plans,
something is afoot. I was notified that a meeting with the
principal citizens was requested to hear their demands.</p>

         </ul>
<p>We stated that they already had nearly all these things, there
being nothing left to do but strip us all of everything. About 9
o'clock Ewell's corps passed through, probably some 10,000 men
with an immense train of artillary and army wagons. Among them
many farm wagons and teams they acquired along the way.
The men looked well, but lacked uniforms, being an array of all shades
and colors. No two hats alike, and their shoes could hardly be
called that. It was hard to distinguish the officers from the
men, except those of high rank. They sang and cheered lustily
as they marched along. About two, the pillage of our stores
began. Not a place escaped, never in the history of our boro was
there such a scene. The merchants were compelled to pack up the
wagons with their goods, which is being sent to Richmond.
The streets are crowded with Rebels who try to interrogate our
lessor citizens as to where things are hidden or sent to, and
also as to the movements of the Federal troops that had left. By
now, all of our stores have been ransacked.</p>
<p>My neighbor, Widow Murphy, who kept a small store, dispensing
Queens Ware and shoes, nothing of value to the Rebels, did
succeed in having her place exempt from being robbed. Some of
the Rebel officers were very considerate.</p>
<p>My son's mill and warehouse has suffered much from confiscation
for which they gave him $800.00 in Confederate script.
I hear my tenant farmer, Thos. Miller, was shot at while plowing
his corn. I have felt much concern for him, but cannot get thru
the line.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 25</h3>
<p>Clear and warm. All quiet until about 9 o'clock when the locusts
begin to swarm again. On each side of the street, they stop and
make further requisitions. There isn't much left to take. All
businessmen suffer--Eyster brothers,
Myers and Brand,
Huber
and Tolbert, Sol.
Huber, Gelwix,
James Shaffer, D.S.
Fahnestock
Dittmann, Metcalf,
I. Hutton, James
Hutton, Feltman,
Croft and
Miller, W.
Heyser, Miller and
Hemsley, Nixon, these were the
principal losers.</p>
<p>This afternoon brings much activity among the Rebels. Evidently
new orders have been directed as they are packing up and securing
their stolen goods as fast as possible. Officers are riding off
in all directions.</p>
<p>At seven, we have reports of a skirmish near Carlisle driving
back the Rebels. Jenkins, Ewell, and Rhodes have returned to
Chambersburg with the intention of crossing over to Gettysburg
The drums beat-calling their men to camp and hunting the
stragglers. All indications point to readiness for a march.
Tonight there is not a Rebel to be seen. We are not sure what
caused the move, we do know large forces were now built up in
Harrisburg, ready to march South. McClelland is supposed to be
there, but so far Washington refuses to use him, politics being
behind this. With his skill and knowledge, the war could have
been ended but the power in Washington will not admit him.
The streets tonight are deserted and still. Not a soldier to be
seen except the posted sentinels. I remained up until one.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 26</h3>
<p>Cloudy and raining. All is quiet. Few soldiers seen on the
streets until after breakfast, when the advancing corps of Gen.
Johnston appears with waving flags and stirring music, as they
approach the public square. Three cheers went up for the Southern
Confederacy. They passed on column after column, for hours. Next
their batteries, army wagons, and ambulances, presenting a
fearful sight. I have mixed feelings of indignation and humility.
The passage of the army created a consternation among the people.
Many feel all is lost, after seeing this show of power in the
face of our inadequate defense.</p>
<p>At about three o'clock, the rear of Johnston's corps is passed,
making about 15,000 men, rank and file, 72 pieces of ordinance,
350 wagons, about a regiment is left to guard the town. The large
school building has been taken by them for a hospital.
Requisitions have been made on all the innkeepers for mattresses,
blankets, quilts, sheets, etc. for the Rebel sick and wounded. It
is expected the like orders will be given the citizens.
This evening a part of their army has advanced near the town on
the Baltimore Pike, and on the Western Pike, occupying the
fairground.</p>
<p>They say they have entered upon a desperate enterprise,and will
make Pennsylvania the battleground, instead of Virginia, that
they will conquer or die! All say the heaviest battle of the war
will be fought in this Valley. We all tremble as we have no news
from the outside, being completely cut off.</p>
<p>Portions of the Cumberland Valley and Franklin Railroads have
been torn up. The bridge at Scotland, just rebuilt, has again
been demolished.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SATURDAY, JUNE 27</h3>
<p>The Rebel troops commence their forward movement and continue
without interruption until dark. We estimate by actual count
nearly 35,000 men, officers and all, 165 pieces ordinance. I
notice many of the gun carriages had the U.S. mark upon them,
having been captured from our army.</p>
<p>About 11 o'clock Gen. Lee passed with his staff. He is fine
looking man, medium size, stoutly built, has the face of a good
liver, grey beard, and mustache, poorly dressed for an officer
of his grade. He wore a felt hat, black, and a heavy overcoat
with large cape. His horse appeared to be rather an indifferent
one, for a man who reputedly is fond of fine stock.
Hill is a tall red-headed man, not over thirty-five. Longstreet
and Ewell I did not see, nor Johnston. Many of the officers
were fine looking men, and rode fine horses. During their
passage, I noticed their ever watchfulness on every side. The
citizens were crowded along the sidewalks and doors, observing
their passage; the rest, inside, behind drawn blinds, watched
unobtrusively. There were many remarks and exclamations, but all
in a subdued tone of voice or whisper. All had one thought in
mind, "Were these soldiers to be our conquerors, and if so, what
will be our fate?"</p>
<p>Occasionally a German would stop me and complain in his native
tongue, as if I could help this situation, or was responsible for
it. (NOTE: Heyser was of German parents that kept and lived
by the old ways.)</p>
<p>Lee offered to place a guard for the protection of the town, but
the sheriff could not be found. Later in the day, Gen. Hill and
Longstreet passed through with part of their army. They were far
less respectable lot, and constantly shouting, singing, and
hooting at females that showed themselves at doors or windows.
They were loud in their denunciation of the Union, and insulting
to citizens on the sidewalks. Shouting, "Boys, this is
Pennsylvania. We should destroy her as they did in Virginia, dam
the Union. Harrisburg will be ours, Hurrah for the Southern
Confederacy, and Jeff Davis."</p>
<p>Every brigade as it passed sent a file of soldiers around to
examine the stores and places of business, requiring them to open
up. This continued all day. These men were called the Louisianna
Tigers, a forbidding-looking set of men that would take your hat
or remove your boots for their own use.</p>
<p>Rev. Schneck was relieved of his gold watch and $50.00. He
complained to get it back, but to no use. Robberies are now
common on the street, particularly where they are unguarded.
Decharts hat store was cleaned out today, not a single item left
in stock. They opened up my son, William's store today, and
started to help themselves. We are powerless to stop them, and
can do nothing but watch and complain to the commanding officers.
They refer to the same treatment our soldiers gave the
Confederacy in Virginia.</p>
<p>I finally found a Col. Greene that listened to some reason and
had the men removed and the door shut.</p>
<p>While the troops were passing today, I was sitting by my door,
the victim of many insulting remarks. One even attempted to take
my hat. He withdrew when I offered to resist, as I would have
struck him. Were it not for the rigid discipline they were under,
I shudder to think what our lot would have been. There are
exceptions, many of the Rebels are gentlemen, and act as such.
Mostly, those from Florida, Texas, and Louisianna, generally
speaking, are a band of cutthroats.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 28</h3>
<p>Cloudy. The troops are moving through town again, a continual
procession until evening. The drug store of J.
Spangler was
visited today by Lieut. Todd, President Lincoln's wife's brother.
He finally had to be ejected by the provost marshal as having no
business being there. Reports come in our neighboring farmers are
being robbed, one being shot. Many of these robberies are
committed by vagabonds or camp followers in search of booty.
The Rebels try to check them, but can't catch them all. One
farmer was shot and the body hid in the manure pile. These
robbers are mostly after money. The poor farmers are defenseless.
All of business places are pretty well stripped, all that is left
now are the private houses to be broken into.</p>
<p>Up to this evening, the whole number of troops passing thru
Chambersburg is about 43,000; 180 pieces artillary, 3,000 wagons
and ambulances. Indications seem to be they are about to leave
Chambersburg. It is now 11 o'clock, my mind is weary, sad, and
gloomy. So much I cannot even form an opinion.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 29</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Streets are clear until about eight. My son,
Jacob, meets
Robert Reynolds of Georgia. I knew his father well. Robert had
his own horse and servant along. He is a conscript, wish I could
have talked with him.</p>
<p>Fearful outrages in the country about us. I hear the Rebels mail
has been cut off from Richmond. They are apprehensive of trouble.
Stouffer's mill has been taken over by the Rebels and is running
for their use. There isn't much food left in town now. If the
Rebels remain much longer, I do not know what we shall do. The
country side is rapidly losing all its livestock. Much had
already been driven off and hidden in the mountains.</p>
<p>About 4 o'clock, about 5,000 men took up their line of march for
Greencastle with 18 pieces of ordinance. I think they are
clearing their lines to get their wagon trains back into
Virginia. They are now riding about our alleys looking for
harness and gear. I removed the wheel from my wagon and hid it,
making it unfit for use.</p>
<p>About the close of the evening, they are busy tearing up the
sills of the railroad and burning them to bend the rails over,
making them unfit to use.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JUNE 30</h3>
<p>Variable weather. Sunshine and rain. A large wagon train today
takes its course towards Gettysburg. Lee's headquarters are still
here. He keeps his troops in constant movement that it is hard to
say what he is planning for his principal move.</p>
<p>About 9 o'clock a large train of wagons are withdrawn from the
direction of Harrisburg, and put on the line of march for
Gettysburg. It took 4 hours for the line to pass here. The troops
are busy destroying the Franklin Railroad at both North and South
ends of the County. Along with sills of the road, they pile on
all the fence they can find to heat and twist the rails.
Another force of about 500 men have been sent to destroy the
railroad depot and buildings, starting with the large turntable.
It is so soundly built of iron castings, their fires had little
effect on it. The engine house was pulled down after an immense
amount of work. So they went from building to building, a
senseless thing to do, as the structures were of no importance to
us as we could not use them. I tried to reason with a nearby
officer about the wanton destruction. Their answers are always
the same, "This is in retaliation for your troops' work on the
South, particularly Fredericksburg."</p>
<p>Leaving this scene of destruction, which appears to be their last
act. I went up to the belfry of the German Reformed Church to see
if I could trace any damage to my farm, but could not, so much
timberland intervening. You could mark the line of the railroad
by the smoke of the burning ties. From what I can see, there is
little damage to crops and grassland.</p>
<p>This evening, there is much activity. Troops are withdrawn from
all parts to march to Gettysburg. Reports that all ready there
has been an engagement at Cashtown. Their cooks are busy
preparing rations for the next few days.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 2, 1863</h3>
<p>Cloudy and very hot. The Rebels are leaving Chambersburg for
Gettysburg. About 3 this morning, I was awakened by the rumbling
of heavy wagons. There were about 60 of them, followed by a large
body of troops, requiring about two hours to pass. They were
quite jubilant in their passage thru town, pulling my bell at
the door and hooting at me.</p>
<p>After their passage, all was quiet again, except squads of
calvary passing to unite with their companies, all in the
direction of Gettysburg. Somewhere near there is a heavy
engagement. About ten, the town is vacant. The Rebels leaving
their sick behind for us to nurse and care for. A few stragglers
are to be seen, but the worst is over. We congratulate ourselves
that we still have a roof over our heads. About 12, in the
company of two other men, I walked out to my farm to assess the
damage. Everywhere were holes cut in fences and grain trampled
down by the exercises of the cavalry. I sustained a great amount
of damage, nearly 4,000 men have encamped here. All of my fence
gone, about 40 acres of oats and much damage to all other crops.
My houses were all robbed of clothing and any kind of gear with
which to work. The report was circulated that I was a Colonel in
the Union Army and now made to pay greater than my neighbors. How
unjust even your supposed friends can be. In passing over the
fields and woods where they encamped, there is already a great
stench.</p>
<p>I found two Rebels hiding on my farm and would have taken them
back to town. They would have been willing prisoners to obtain
their parole, but a large body of Stewarts' cavalry was passing
near and I advised them to hide. One gave me his bayonet, which I
brought back to town. Back home, more reports come in of a battle
near Gettysburg. All night long, more troops pass thru town,
their yelling is terrific. I keep indoors.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 3</h3>
<p>Very hot. Our streets are deserted. An occasional Rebel is seen
just a few stragglers. A Rebel soldier riding up Market Street
was fired upon by Wm. Etter, one of our citizens. We feared a
reprisal for this sort of thing and put a stop to it. We see more
and more deserters. The town being clear of Rebels, the doors are
opening again to promenading females. Nothing can stop them, many
of them show little respect for their character and standing.
They expose themselves, as if intentional, to be out late at
night unprotected.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 4</h3>
<p>Showers of rain. Reports of terrible fighting at Gettysburg.
Captures are being made all around here of Rebel cavalry and
infantry which are sent to Harrisburg, their horses and guns
being confiscated. The country people are coming in now with
their marketing with terrible accounts of outrages that were
committed upon them. We were fortunate that the Rebel officers
were mostly gentlemen, and tried to hold their savage troops in
check, but many could not. I suppose we are fortunate to be
alive.</p>
<p>Ewell is at Carlisle and demands its surrender, throwing some 40
shells into town, which did little damage. They burned the gas
works where the Carlisle Deposit Bank had hidden its records,now
gone.</p>
<p>Gen Smith appeared and Ewell fell back towards Gettysburg. We
hear of a great battle at Gettysburg, but as yet no particulars,
except the Union forces were victorious. Some public spirited
citizens seized the mail (Rebel mail) going thru Fayetteville.
Soon a detachment of cavalry was back looking for it, and took
18 prisoners locally for some hours before releasing them; on
pain of death if it happens again.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 5</h3>
<p>Much rain. About three, 12 wagons of wounded from Gettysburg were
routed by mistake thru our town, leaving them here at our
hospital, a wonder they were alive, thrown in heaps in rough
wagons. The wagons were captured by John W. Taylor and sent to
Carlisle. This is the Sabbath, all is calm and still. Few persons
on the streets.</p>
<p>I notice that most of our birds have gone since the appearance of
the Rebels, and that flies and insects are more numerous. Only 5
persons attended prayer meeting. About 6, part of Gen. Milroy's
cavalry of about 300 passed thru town at full speed brandishing
their swords and responding to the cheers of many spectators.
They rode South in the direction of Greencastle. No word yet from
Gettysburg.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 6</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Gen. Milroy was dispatched to Greencastle to protect a
large wagon train. We hear a decisive battle was fought at
Gettysburg. That Lee is withdrawn towards the Potomac and that
enormous amounts of supplies and prisoners have been captured.
The news gave rise to the ringing of bells and general convivial
in the streets. It appears the contest raged for 3 days and was
the most desperate of the war. As Lee withdraws towards the
Potomac, we hear of skirmishes along the way. One over near
Waynesboro and Smithburg. Reports that the Pine Stump Road is
filled with broken Rebel wagons and caissons, filled with
ammunition much of which is thrown in the mud with a view of
destroying it. Also many dead and wounded lying by the roadside,
indicating a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>There is a report the Rebels are forming at Marion to meet
Pleasanter's calvary which is expected to attack them. Also it is
said a cannon was found buried by the Rebels near the place
on the roadside.</p>
<p>I met Doctor Gamble today. The Surgeon Rebel in charge of the
hospital here. He tells me most of the best men of the South were
in this battle, now most of them gone.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 7</h3>
<p>Much rain. The grain is in danger of spoiling. About 200 Rebel
prisoners were brought in today. Many are deserting, Lee is
making a desperate attempt to escape Mead's army. Our stores
are reopening and cleaning up.</p>
<p>Gen. Couch's division is following the end of Lee's army thru
Greenwood on what is called the Pine Stump Road. We are hoping
Lee's army will be captured. If Mead allows him to escape, it
will indeed be folly.</p>
<p>We hear the Rebel lose at Gettysburg 30,000 men, the Union
20,000. My sons, Jacob and
William, just returned from the
battlefield. It is a fearful sight. The fields full of dead, by
all the roadsides dead are hardly covered by a thin layer of mud.
Wreckage everywhere, the implements of war fast disappearing by
souvenir seekers. Soon the cultivators plow will cover it all and
put an end to military glory.</p>
<p>If Lee is allowed to escape this struggle will be prolonged. We
hear of only skirmishes all along his route to the Potomac.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 8</h3>
<p>Much rain. Gen. Couch is raising more men at Harrisburg with a
view to following Lee. We hear Lee's army is crossing at
Williamsport. Our town is quiet now, a few straggling soldiers to
be seen They now attract little attention. I feel very unwell
this evening.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 9</h3>
<p>Awoke with all the bells ringing, report confirmed that Vicksburg
has been taken. I have kept to my room most of the day. Some
companies of New York cavalry and infantry creating a disturbance
by their drunkenness. We saw none of this among the Rebels.
Reports that Lee is using the canal boats at Williamsport to ford
his sick and wounded. Our town is now stirring with activity
again. Many who left are returning and the stores re-opening
with what they have left. The night closes in quiet, and being
unwell, go to my bed.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>JULY 10</h3>
<p>Clear and warm. Still unwell today. The Rebel army busy crossing
at various points on the Potomac. Lee's headquarters still in
Hagerstown, but the troops going to Williamsport and
Shepherdstown. We hear much of Lee's equipment has crossed over
together with much livestock.</p>
<p>Some troops come in this morning and moved towards Greencastle.
About 3,000 passed thru Mercersburg. The town in confusion. Many
of our females show little self-respect. You see them bareheaded,
mingling with the crowd, and a number of them hanging on the arms
of strange soldiers. It is amazing that the parents allow this to
take place. Perhaps it is condoned under the guise of patriotism,
but this usually ends in the ruin of these daughters. Tonight,
Gen Couch arrived amid much cheering. The speeches they give are
politically slanted and do nothing toward ending the war and
healing our wounds.    END     William Heyser</p>

<p>BEGINS NEW VOLUME</p>
         
<h3>SATURDAY JULY 11,1863</h3>
<p>Many soldiers idle about town, laying on cellar doors and door
steps. About ten oclock nearly 7,000 troops passed thru town
towards Maryland.</p>
<p>Gen. Couch orders the academy and Franklin Hall to be fitted up 
for a hospital.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, JULY 13</h3>
<p>Raining all day. Mrs. Fisher's hired girl accosted by a soldier
in her room. Her screams brought help.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>WEDNESDAY, JULY 15th</h3>
<p>Clear. Lee has safely retreated over the Potomac.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, JULY 16th</h3>
<p>How ironic, now we have plenty of troops around and not needed,
before, in our hour of need, there were none.
Quite unwell, my eyes sore from cold.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, JULY 23rd</h3>
<p>To my farm, fences nearly all gone, will repair damage to farm.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SATURDAY, AUGUST 15th</h3>
<p>Geo. Dietz, a Dutchman, drove by with his family; a good example
of how a man profiteered from a small business in war time and
became very rich. He made $10,000 in the short space of two
months on the sale of corn and oats to the government.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, AUGUST 27th</h3>
<p>Death of Philip Berlin, an industrious and godly man.  We were in
business together at one time. His failure cost me $7,000. I have
forgiven him. He died in his 84th years. He had been born on the
ocean when his parents immigrated to this country from Germany.
He was put to the trade of wagonmaking for a number of years. At
the death of Jacob Whitmore he took over his store and continued
in the merchandising business for years. I entered into business
with him on several occasions. He was first married to a
Coover,
an ignorant and pernicious woman. His second wife, Mrs.
Suesserott, an excellent woman who died several years ago.</p>

<h3>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1st</h3>
<p>Feel oppressed. Took my colored boy fishing, feel better for the
exercise and change.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3rd</h3>
<p>To a sale of government horses.  All skin and bones, brought from
$1 to $60. None would I take as a gift.  Left in disgust.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 4th</h3>
<p>Labored in my garden. Became so fatigued could not eat dinner.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SABBATH, SEPTEMBER 6th</h3>
<p>Attended to all classes, met my Bible class and in even attended
Episcopal services.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 7th</h3>
<p>Proctor and I went fishing, caught nothing, but enjoyed the
outing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9th</h3>
<p>My wife and I to the farm. The weeds are unmanageable, the
insects have taken all over.</p>
 <p>(Here inserted) $20 in Continental Currency, issued by Hall &amp;
Sellers, 1779. Half Crown--25 shillings and six pence current
money of Va. 5/6/1776. (J. Dixon's signature affixed)</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18th</h3>
<p>Much needed rain. At the bank today, feel heavy and dull.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19th</h3>
<p>High price of everything due to war shortages. Wood $4-$5 cord,
coal $7 ton. Everybody speculating.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22nd</h3>
<p>Visited my mountain land. Find the excursion very relaxing and
exhilerating. Quite cool this morning.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24th</h3>
<p>Plague of caterpillars destroying my grapevines.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25th</h3>
<p>Loose females hanging on arms of soldiers. A disgusting display
of loose morals. No child of mine would even be out to commit
such indiscretions.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26th</h3>
<p>Quite cool. Morning at the bank, home all afternoon doing repairs
around the house.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28th</h3>
<p>Fine weather. Have looseness of the bowels which has become quite
chronic. At the bank, purchased my winter's coal. Called to see
my man Proctor who is ill, took him some medicine. When these
colored folk are ill, generally it is physical. Much of my
illness and grief comes from undue anxiety and melancholy that
produces indigestion. When my liver acts well, I seldom have the
blues.</p>
<p>Out of humor with Proctor's son who was to fill my coal bin. He
showed up when I had the job nearly done.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29th</h3>
<p>Weather beautiful. Quite unwell. The old frame is wearing out.
The vigors of youth cannot be restored.</p>
<p>Walked out to the Presbyterian Graveyard to get some ivy. It is a
beautiful spot, ancient, untouched by time. The tombs, trees, and
mosses attest to a dignified burial ground.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1st</h3>
<p>At the bank in the morning. Rev. Bausman voted out this day,
against my judgment. Much disappointment in the church.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SABBATH, OCTOBER 4th</h3>
<p>Beautiful day, but for the insane actions of the cavalry dashing
their worn-out horses up and down the streets. Morning prayer
meeting and services by Rev. Bausman. Sabbath school at one. At
five, met with my Bible Class.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, OCTOBER 5th</h3>
<p>Pleasant weather. Took Rev. Bausman along to my mountain land
to view some rails for fences. Met my tenant there and his son. I
had taken my gun along for some small game. We were all standing
in a half circle while I proceeded to load my gun. Upon pulling
back the cock to place the cap, the gun suddenly discharged, the
load narrowly missing my tenant. This clearly shows how accidents
can happen no matter how careful one acts. We found no game, so
back to the buggy for lunch of bread and wine. We visited another
mountain tract of mine, quite high and a clear view this day of
Chambersburg. The spire of German Reform Church visable, nine
miles away. Left for home as the sun was declining on an almost
perfect day. Brought the children some chestnuts in their burrs
which stirred them up a bit.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6th</h3>
<p>Pleasant weather. At home all day, much troubled with my bowels.
Meeting with cemetery board in evening. We declared a 6% dividend
on the Capital Stock of the company.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8th</h3>
<p>Raining all day, am quite unwell. To the bank this morning.
William Flory died this morning. For a number of years he
furnished coffins for others, and now will occupy one of his own.
He was a good man, affectionate father and husband, very retiring
and inoffensive man of a gentle disposition. He was a
cabinetmaker.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, OCTOBER 12th</h3>
<p>Pleasant weather. At bank until dinner. Rode to
Stouffers to see
them make syrup of sugar cane. Out to my farm, have some
difficulty with a tenant who is cutting down my trees, he said he
shall leave, I hope so. Remained at home and finished my writing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15th</h3>
<p>Fine weather. Morning at the bank; in the afternoon to Chalybeate
Spring, about mile from town, drank some of the water and
returned. Still unwell, fell very languid.</p>
<p>Henry Merkline died yesterday. He was a printer by profession,
and embraced other branches of his trade. Feel very unwell.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17th</h3>
<p>Beautiful weather. Feel so unwell could not leave the house.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SABBATH, OCTOBER 18th</h3>
<p>Beautiful weather. Feel a little better and attended Sabbath
School and met with my Bible Class.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22nd</h3>
<p>Pleasant. At bank awhile. This afternoon took my grandson
Geo. S.
Eyster and my gun and rode out to the slate hills for exercise.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23rd</h3>
<p>Cloudy. Left home for my mountain land, taking with me six little
girls, some my grandchildren. They were a merry lot and made me
feel better. I had taken an open spring wagon, filled it with hay
and  spread a buffalo robe over it. We left about three for home
and all had a fine time, except for the heavy shower of rain. We
were well provided with umbrellas and shawls. I think all will
remember that day of merriment. Those in our party were:
Betty
Eyster, Ellie Heyser,
Mary Eyster, Nellie
Eyster, Ellie Eyster,
Georgie Shuman.</p>
<p>Spent the evening reading and writing.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24th</h3>
<p>Have been suddenly taken ill with a violent pain in my right
breast, very acute.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>SABBATH, OCTOBER 25th</h3>
<p>Somewhat cold. Managed to attend church and my Bible Class. I go
to bed very sick.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>MONDAY, OCTOBER 26th</h3>
<p>Weather clear. Feel a little better, will attend the synod at
Carlisle. Took the first train arriving there about eleven. An
interesting visit, but felt very unwell. Disappointed to find
much politics and log rolling amoung the young aspirants. Other
speeches and complaints, many out of order.</p>
