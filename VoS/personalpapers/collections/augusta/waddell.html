                <td>The Waddell family lived in Staunton in Augusta County, Virginia. Joseph
                    Waddell, along with his uncle Lytletton Waddell and later his brother Legh,
                    purchased the <i>Staunton Spectator</i> in 1848, but Joseph sold his interest in
                    1860. Joseph married Virginia McClung in 1853 and soon after set up their
                    household on the farm of the widower William M. Tate. Tate's children, Jimmy,
                    Nanny, and Mattie, became the Waddell's adopted children and moved with them to
                    town when the Waddell's purchased a house in 1857 with Joseph's sister Kate. The
                    Waddell family owned a few slaves, including their cook Selena, her husband
                    Philip, and her daughter Jenny. Though several members of the Waddell family saw
                    battle in the Confederate military during the Civil War, Joseph remained in
                    Staunton, performing work for the Quartermaster Department. After the war,
                    Joseph Waddell became active in local politics, opposing black suffrage and
                    "negro domination." Selena and Philip Brown remained in the Waddell household as
                    domestic servants and Kate Waddell left to marry William M. Tate.<br/><br/></td>

                <blockquote>During the war years, Joseph A. Waddell recorded his views on slavery,
                    abolition, politics, secession, and the war in his diary with great detail and
                    clarity. His commentary ranged from perceptive political observation to
                    extensive battlefield rumors. Surrounded by hardship and tragedy, he expressed
                    anxiety for loved ones separated by war and gratitude for those close at home.
                    He bemoaned the institution of slavery, but feared for the fate of an inferior
                    people left to their own devices. Through the war, Waddell remained a believer
                    in the Confederate cause, but became increasingly depressed about its chances of
                    success.</blockquote>

                </h3>

                <blockquote>In the months after the end of the Civil War, Joseph A. Waddell
                    described the looting of Confederate property in Staunton, occupation by Union
                    military authority, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Waddell became
                    increasingly disturbed by the unruly behavior of ungrateful "negroes" emboldened
                    by the presence of the Yankee occupiers. Toward the end of his diary, Waddell
                    discussed early attempts to restore Virginia to the Union, an endeavor in which
                    he desperately wanted to participate. Waddell ended his diary in October 1865
                    when he ran out of writing paper.</blockquote>
