      > Diary of Harvey Bear, 1862-1863</a>
    </h3>
    <blockquote>Harvey Bear lived near Churchville in Augusta County during the war. In his diary
     from January 1862 to July 1863, Bear chronicled his transactions nearby in his community and
     surrounding towns and further away in Richmond, sometimes for cash and sometimes for exchange.
     Shorter entries reveal Bear's involvement in agricultural organizations, religious activities,
     and local politics. Though Bear primarily described the work of a wealthy farmer and his
     laborers during the war, he also provided glimpses into the lives of his own family members and
     those of his friends and neighbors. Brief references to the war include the movement of troops,
     interactions with military officers, supplying the Confederate army, and the actions of the
     local militia.</blockquote>
