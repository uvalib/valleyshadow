      <blockquote>
        According to the 1860 census, John Nadenbousch was 35 years old at the outbreak of the war and lived with his wife, Hester, in Berkeley County, Virginia (which became West Virginia during the war). John enlisted in the Confederate Army and in 1863 he rented a house for his family in Staunton and purchased a local hotel. John resigned his army commission in 1864 and remained in Staunton as late as 1866, while his wife remained in Berkeley County. In his correspondence with his wife, John discussed the conditions of wartime Staunton and Augusta County, wartime slavery, Lincoln's reelection in 1864, and the destruction of the infrastructure of the Valley during the later years of the war.

      <blockquote>
        John Nadenbousch wrote about the conditions in Augusta County immediately after the end of the war, including his distaste for the loyalty oath, postwar economic hardships, and the local political climate. John continued to live in Staunton and run the American Hotel as late as 1866, while his wife Hester remained in Berekley County, West Virginia.
