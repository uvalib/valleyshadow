      <td>Samuel Z. Maxwell lived with his family in Chambersburg in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Like Solomon Maxwell, who was probably his father, Maxwell was a plasterer. Maxwell enlisted in the 126th Pennsylvania on July 28, 1862, at the age of 21. During his time in the army, he contracted typhoid fever and was hospitalized at Point Lookout, Maryland. He was later transferred to the 21st Pennsylvania Cavalry. After his service, Maxwell returned to Chambersburg where he continued as a plasterer.<br />
