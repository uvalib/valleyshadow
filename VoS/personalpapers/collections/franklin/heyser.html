    <td>William Heyser was born in Chambersburg, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, in 1796. William
     went into coppersmithing with his father, Jacob. Several years after the death of his father,
     William sold the business. He then began manufacturing paper, eventually employing the aid of
     his son, Jacob. Through their prosperous ventures, the Heyser family accumulated enough money
     to purchase several farms outside of Chambersburg. William supervised some properties and
     rented others. In his sixties when the Civil War began, Heyser remained on the homefront with
     his family until his death in 1863.<br/>

     children, and grandchildren until his death on November 5, 1863, just after this diary
     concludes. In his twilight years when the war began, Heyser reflects upon his life and labor in
