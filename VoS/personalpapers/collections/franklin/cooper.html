    <td>Before the war, Jeremiah Cooper lived with his father Jeremiah and mother Catharan and his
     younger siblings in Waynesboro, Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Cooper worked as a shoemaker,
     following the craft of his father. Several months after the beginning of the war, in September
     1861, Cooper enlisted as a private in Company A of the 77th Pennsylvania. He served as fife
     major and principal musician until his capture at Chickamauga in September 1863. After his
     release from prison in April of the following year, he returned to the army. Cooper probably
     survived his term of service in the Union army, but by 1870 he had either died or moved away
     from Franklin County.<br/>
