    <a href="../../../../papers/F1109"> Franklin Rosenbery to
     John Abraham Rosenbery (father), October 28, 1863</a>
    <blockquote>Rosenbery provides updates about his movements and notes his satisfaction about
     joining the war effort. He proclaims his faith in God, describing the comfort that such faith
     provides him while he serves in the army.</blockquote>

   <li>
    <a href="../../../../papers/F1110"> Franklin Rosenbery to
     John Abraham Rosenbery (father), November 1, 1863</a>

    <a href="../../../../papers/F1111"> Franklin Rosenbery to
     John Abraham Rosenbery (father), November 15, 1863</a>
    <blockquote>Rosenbery responds to some news from home. He then takes time to disparage those
     whom he considers traitors: men avoiding military service for the nation. Rosenbery also
     mentions sending money home. He discusses the weather and planned troop movements. As in
     earlier letters, Rosenbery expresses his confidence that he does the "will of
    God."</blockquote>

    <a href="../../../../papers/F1115"> Franklin Rosenbery to
     John Abraham Rosenbery (father), December 25, 1863</a>
    <blockquote>As in earlier letters, Rosenbery writes that he does the will of God. He also hopes
     for peace, and he wishes that northerners would further devote themselves to the nation's
     cause. He then goes onto discuss religion as well as the value of tobacco in the soldiers'
     camp. Finally, he discusses Christmas dinner, the weather, the possibility of a furlough, his
     prospects for survival, the war's duration, and correspondence.</blockquote>

     get through army life, and describes in detail a soldier's food rations. He observes that the
     veteran soldiers receive provisions in the mail, in addition to their rations. Rosenbery sees
     the rations as part of his pay from "Uncle Sam."</blockquote>

    <a href="../../../../papers/F1118"> Franklin Rosenbery to
     John Abraham Rosenbery (father), December 31, 1863</a>

     John Abraham Rosenbery (father), January 15, 1864</a>
    <blockquote>Rosenbery expresses his desire for the North to crush slavery. He goes on to express
     his disgust for shirkers of military service, contrasting their behavior with his own
     willingness to sacrifice his life for the nation. Rosenbery also notes that he anticipates a
     big spring battle, and he requests supplies from home.</blockquote>

     attempt to implement that strategy. Rosenbery anticipates heavy fighting in the summer; he does

     letters, he still waits for his repaired watch from home, and he also is still waiting to get
     paid.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Rosenbery expects to be paid shortly. He mentions working on a new building, and he
     theorizes that he will not be able to come home until the war concludes. He discounts a rumor
     that troops will soon head to Tennessee; he still awaits his repaired watch from
    home.</blockquote>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="../../../../papers/F1126"> Franklin Rosenbery to
     Elemina Rosenbery, February 21, 1864</a>
