    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1105">A. J. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother (probably Hugh Gilkeson), July 31, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Gilkeson recounts the details of his father's death. He goes on to give further updates about his family's health. He also ponders the postwar conditions, as he discusses mail service and the status of banks.
      </blockquote>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1106">A. J. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother (probably Hugh Gilkeson), January 21, 1866</a>

      <blockquote>
        In this letter, Gilkeson updates his brother on the family's health. He goes on to deliver his impression of the attitudes of African-Americans toward contract labor. He closes by complaining about new postwar land taxes and a struggling economy.
      </blockquote>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1107">D. V. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother (probably Hugh Gilkeson), August 31, 1867</a>

      <blockquote>
        Gilkeson discusses the year's crops and resignedly mentions that labor is "all to hire." He delivers news about the family and suggests that his brother try the nursery business, to avoid the bad luck often attached to farming.
      </blockquote>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1108">D. V. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother (probably Hugh Gilkeson), September 27, 1867</a>

      <blockquote>
        Gilkeson delivers news about the crops and discusses the season's fruit. He provides updates about the children and mentions that several local women believe the boy Willie looks like his grandfather. Gilkeson also writes about an upcoming church election.
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1110">Willie Gilkeson to H W Gilkeson, October 31, probably 1867</a>

      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1109">D. V. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother (probably Hugh Gilkeson), November 4, 1867</a>

      <blockquote>
        Gilkeson briefly discusses the harvest, then goes on to write about his health, about the children, and about his faith in God to help him raise them. He mentions his election to church office; and he closes the letter by complaining that African-Americans have again voted "for the yankees." Gilkeson hopes that the tide is changing against the radical Republicans in the North.
