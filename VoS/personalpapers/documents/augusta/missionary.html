        John Scott begins his missive to Samuel Hunt by acknowledging that he is a bad speller. He apologizes for his imperfections, but he maintains that his frustrations with spelling make him even more eager to correct bad habits in his students' writing. Scott then transitions into a discussion of the condition of his school, arguing that the warm weather will certainly draw students out of the classroom and into the fields, making it necessary to reorganize classes. He adds that the teachers are tired and in need of a vacation, having worked diligently for many weeks.

He says he is concerned that leaving the matter unresolved over the summer might allow the "secesh negrohaters" in Staunton to take the schoolhouse from the AMA. He also mentions that local blacks helped raise money by putting on a concert in town, and that they had arranged to have a fair on the first of May.

        Scott announces the arrival of AMA teacher C. E. Dewey and comments on a native Virginian and "presiding Elder from the north" who "sympathizes with us in our work." Scott contends that this Elder "advises me to write concerning the importance of your work in the valley above other places. He says 'They have more energy and influence' in this valley than in any other part of Va. Even the whole South with which he is acquainted.'" [Article attached to page 3 of letter reads: For the "Valley Virginian." A Card of Thanks from the Colored People SIR:-- The members of the colored M. E. Church, through the columns of the Virginian would take occasion to thank the white citizens, of Staunton, for their valuable aid at a Fair recently held by them. We would take occasion to inform the citizens of Staunton, that we have in our midst, one Emily Rodney, of Pennsylvania, of the Bethel Church, soliciting subscriptions under a false misrepresentation of facts, and would say, that if the white citizens feel disposed to further aid us in paying for our Church, they will please be careful who they pay money to, as we have been informed several gentlemen have contributed, thinking it was for the benefit of the M. E. Church, Colored, when it was intended for the Bethel Church. They regret to learn that an impression seems to exist among the citizens that the colored people wish to "draw out from among the whites," and in church and business matters, become independent of them; thus acknowledging little obligation to them. We are sorry to hear that this doctrine is taught by some of our color from the North, who are endeavoring to form a sect, new to us, here, but so far as that is concerned we have no sympathy with them. We do not desire this foolish independence, but are very thankful for sympathy and aid from the whites, and respectfully acknowledge our obligations. Rev. E.

He notes that there "are Lutheran Churches scattered all along this Valley," and argues that a representative from that denomination might be best fit to begin work in Harrisonburg. Excited about the prospect of new schools in Staunton and surrounding communities, Coan exclaims, "I have seen no place where <u>Educational</u> influences are more needed and demanded than in this <u>Valley</u>. We owe it to the <u>Rebels</u> that we throw in the Northern "Yankee" Christian Element here." Though hopeful that Northern aid might quash the social injustice associated with "Rebel" rule in the Valley, Coan criticizes the "Bureau" and "Mr Beecher" for "doing much to encourage these Rebels in their course" and for "doing much which tends to discourage the real Unionists at the South."
