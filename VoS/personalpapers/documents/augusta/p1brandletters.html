        Lightner apologizes to Kate for not writing her more often; he then continues to discuss family, friends, and local social events. He mentions the formation of a "Union Prayer meeting" in Lexington as well as other cities and towns. It is not clear if this is a prayer meeting for the benefit of the United States government or one that involves several different religious denominations.
