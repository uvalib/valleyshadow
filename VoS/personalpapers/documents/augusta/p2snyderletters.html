      <a href="../../../../papers/A1403">D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, December 15, 1864</a>

      <blockquote>
        Snyder informs his wife that they are moving to a camp near Staunton and asks her to write him. He reports that he has been ill.

    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1404">D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, January 12, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Snyder admits to missing his family and informs his wife that he is trying to get a furlough. He reports that many of the men are on furlough and says that it is almost "desertion." He tells his wife to keep her faith in the southern cause and declares that they will keep fighting for if the Confederacy should lose, "all freedom of thought and speech is lost and we go back into the old monarchical forms of government."
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1405">D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, January 16, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Snyder describes the burning of a local's barn. Citing the cause as accidental, he notes the family's losses. He passes along news of a Confederate raid on a Union garrison.
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1408">D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, January 21, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Snyder discusses the harsh weather and attempts to arrange a visit with his wife. He observes that civilians have become too selfish and have turned against the army. Snyder also laments the fact that he cannot be closer to his family.
      </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1406">D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, March 15, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Snyder writes to his wife, telling her that they had to move camp suddenly due to a Union advance towards Staunton. He writes at length about how he is most concerned about her reputation and asks that she have a woman, rather than a man, accompany her if she wishes to travel to Richmond. He asks her to pray that he himself might overcome the disgraceful temptations of camplife. Snyder rants about undeserving officers in the army and suggests that a negative "revolution" in moral character is also afoot in the land. He discusses his children briefly and expresses his hope that they can see each other soon.
      </blockquote>

    <li>
      <a href="../../../../papers/A1407">D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, March 18, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Snyder tells his wife that he has no idea when his unit will return to the Staunton area but hopes that it will be soon.
