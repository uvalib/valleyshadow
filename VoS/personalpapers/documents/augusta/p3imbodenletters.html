        Imboden responds with scorn to McCue's suggestion that he put money into a venture to claim $50 million that the Confederacy supposedly stored in Europe.

Finally, he suggests that rational businessmen see plenty of economic opportunities in the natural resources of the southern states but would not be interested in searching the "vaults of a defunct, starved out, naked &amp; ragged psuedo nationality."
