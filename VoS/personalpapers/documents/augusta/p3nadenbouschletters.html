      <a href="../../../../papers/A7644">John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to Hester J. Nadenbousch, April 22, 1865</a>

      <blockquote>
        Nadenbousch writes his wife and describes his plans for his return home. He discusses efforts to settle people on the family land and hopes that Louise, once his slave, will stay on at the house. He states that many people have lost heavily on now-worthless Confederate money. He also has lost, but not as badly as some. He reports that Staunton is quiet and dull. The army is gone, but the railroad to Richmond is still destroyed, making communication beyond the city difficult.
