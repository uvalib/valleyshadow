      <blockquote>
        Pastor writes that the Governor has replaced many of the higher officers with appointments, hurting troop morale. Tony himself is sick, but only with a cold, and he is on the mend. He writes that he hopes a home guard has been organized to protect the women of Augusta.

He asks the ladies of his town to send him clothes, which in the postscript he says he received. Further, he mentions that he is doubtful that the conflict can end peacefully and says that he is ready to die for Virginia.
