        This collection contains <a href="../documents/augusta/p1cochranletters.html" shape="rect">prewar letters</a> (1860-1861) written by two brothers from Augusta County who would eventually enlist in Virginia regiments.

His brother, Benjamin Franklin Cochran, became a private in the 1st Virginia Cavalry, and he writes about the defense of Virginia in 1861. This collection also includes one letter from the Cochrans' cousin, A.G. Guskins, who writes from South Carolina about the secession crisis.
