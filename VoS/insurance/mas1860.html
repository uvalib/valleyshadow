    <h1>Staunton Fire Insurance Depositions<br />
    1850-1860</h1>
  </center>

  <p>The "Mutual Assurance Society Against Fire on Buildings of the State of Virginia" sold insurance policies from 1796 through 1861. In addition to collecting the information included below, company agents drew sketches of individual insured buildings, which will help us map them at a later date. Included below are building owners who took out (or, usually, renewed) policies on their homes and businesses between 1850 and 1860. These are linked to preliminary drawings of the buildings on their blocks.</p>

  <p>Search for a name by using the "find" function in your browser. Click on any highlighted name or policy number to see an image of the corresponding street block.<br />
  Numbers not highlighted are for policies taken out before 1850, and do not appear on the maps. In most cases, however, these are previous policies for those renewed in the 1850s. (You will see these previous policy numbers pencilled in next to many of the buildings in the maps.)<br />
  To find out about neighboring buildings, note the policy number inked in each building on the image. Return to the policyholder list and use "find" to retrieve the policy number you want.</p>

  <p>Please note: These are sketched drafts and were not originally intended for web use; please forgive the image quality.<br />
  North is always to the top of the maps. Names written in brackets are those of neighboring property-owners, and are indicated by an "N-&gt;" (for "next to").</p>
