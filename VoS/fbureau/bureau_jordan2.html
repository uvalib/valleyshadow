              <a href="../../papers/B1148">John A. McDonnell to Orlando Brown, July 1, 1868</a>

              <blockquote>
                McDonnell submits his quarterly inspection report for the 9th Sub-District, which include Augusta County. While his comments about Augusta County are neither as detailed, nor as elegant as those related to Frederick County, McDonnell makes observations about the education, economy, moral condition, and political attitudes of blacks in Augusta.

              <blockquote>
                Dews applies to Brown for employment in the Bureau or other branch of government. Dews was once a member of the Freedman's Court in Staunton, and claims that he is presently unable to find work in his profession because he remained loyal to the Union during the war.

              <a href="../../papers/B1058">John W. Jordan to Orlando Brown, July 31, 1868</a>

              <blockquote>
                Jordan remarks that he observes different opinions regarding the legal rights of blacks among different classes of people, but notes that "intelligence, integrity or moral courage" do not appear to be qualifications necessary to sit on a jury or preside as a Magistrate in Augusta County.

              <blockquote>
                Jordan reports that the distrust felt among blacks in Augusta County is a product of the fact that whites do not want to recognize their status as citizens, and because they continued to be taken advantage of in the labor market.
