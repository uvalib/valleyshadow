              <blockquote>
                Jordan spends the early part of this period coming up to speed on conditions in Augusta County. He reports on several cases of assault against blacks that are working through the courts, and reports the lack of confidence freedmen have in the local court system. Jordan himself is generally optimistic in his reports, comments that the schools seem to be flourishing, and is surprised by the lack of drunkeness in Augusta. Jordan also reports on a Ku Klux Klan rally held in Staunton and thinks that white hostility toward blacks is stronger in urban centers like Staunton than in the rural regions of the county.

              <a href="bureau_jordan2.html">Administration of John W. Jordan, July 1868-August 1868</a>

              <blockquote>
                Jordan describes the high level of demand in Augusta for laborers, as well as the political beliefs and attitudes of local whites. He explains that he has no faith in the Augusta courts because of white prejudice against blacks and argues that Augusta whites refuse to believe that their ex-slaves are now citizens. Jordan also asks to be relieved of his position with the Bureau.
