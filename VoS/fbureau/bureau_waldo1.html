                Manly recommends that Corliss (who is apparently interested in a teaching post) go to Staunton, which is currently without a teacher because the agency which supplied them last year is unable to do so again. Manly highly recommends Staunton as a pleasant place to live, and points to the relative prosperity of its African American community.

                Waldo's first monthly report as the Agent in Augusta and Highland Counties talks about the deceptive behavior of white employers when settling labor contracts, and he labels such practices "unmanly, ungenerous [and] outrageous." He also mentions that almost no preparations had been made to make schools ready to open at the beginning of the fall term because the local black communities lacked resources and outside help was rare.

                McDonnell submits yet another quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District. His assessment of the situation in Augusta County is largely positive, although on a more general note, he comments that the news of the Bureau's impending cessation of operation has been met with much regret among the black population. McDonnell expressed doubts about the ability of the law alone to protect recently bestowed rights from the influence of local prejudices with means of enforcement.

                Waldo reports the condition of schools in Staunton and Waynesboro to McDonnell. In this report, he clarifies some of the conflicts over school room use in both towns. He finds it unfortunate that the community "would sooner prefer that their children should remain uneducated rather than 'defile' their church by its use for Educational purposes." Waldo also describes a sectarian conflict between the black Methodist and Baptist congregations in Waynesboro over the use of a building.
