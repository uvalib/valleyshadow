<p><b>About the Bureau</b></p>
<p>The Bureau of Freedmen, Refugees, and Abandoned Lands, commonly
known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was created by an act of Congress
on March 3, 1865, just a few weeks before Abraham Lincoln's
assassination. The Bureau was initially chartered to operate for
just one year, but continued until 1868 under the care of
commissioner General Oliver O. Howard, who was aided by assistant
commissioners in every Southern state and by hundreds of local
agents.</p>
<p>As its full name suggests, the Bureau's work combined care for
millions of newly freed slaves and the administration of Southern
lands seized by Union forces during the war. The Bureau was
authorized to distribute much-needed food, fuel, clothing, and
medical supplies to the freedmen; to regulate labor and contracts;
to aid in the founding of schools and churches; to ensure justice
in all legal cases involving freedmen; and, perhaps most
promisingly for freedmen in 1865, to distribute abandoned and
confiscated Confederate lands among former slaves for rental and
eventual sale.</p>
<p>At the local level, the Bureau was usually bitterly opposed by
white Southerners and firmly supported by African-Americans. Its
work was hindered by local opposition, inadequate funding from the
federal government, and the politics of Reconstruction on the
national stage. The restoration of confiscated property to white
Southerners under Andrew Johnson in 1866 required the displacement
of tens of thousands of freedmen, undermined the work of the Bureau
by eliminating its primary source of funding, and doomed the
Bureau's initial policy of promoting black landownership.</p>
<p>W. Storer How arrived in Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia, in
July 1865 to open his headquarters for the Freedmen's Bureau in the
Shenandoah Valley. The office operated continuously until the
closing of the Bureau in December 1868, tending to the needs of
freedmen in Augusta and Highland Counties.</p>
<p>Initially, Staunton was the location of How's headquarters for
the Sixth District, which comprised most of the counties of the
central and northern Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. How, though,
found Staunton inconvenient and moved his headquarters to
Winchester in October 1865. Nevertheless, an agent (or Assistant
Superintendent--later named Assistant Sub Assistant Commissioner)
always remained in Staunton, answering to his Superintendent in the
District Headquarters.</p>
<p>Five men served as Bureau Agents for Augusta County. Frederick
Tukey, a civilian, served twice from August 1865 to May 1866, and
again from January to April 1867. Lt. George T. Cook then served as
the local agent from June to December 1866. Thomas P. Jackson, a
civilian originally from England, enjoyed the longest
administration, serving from April 1867 to March 1868. Jackson was
replaced by Colonel John W. Jordan, the former Sub Assistant
Commissioner in Farmville, Virginia, who served only a few months
in Staunton, from March to September 1868. The last man to serve as
an agent in Staunton was Roswell Waldo, another civilian who served
from September to December 1868</p>
<p>Little is known about the personal lives of these men who served
in Augusta County, but through the records left in the Bureau's
files they all showed a dedication to improving the economic
condition and social status of the newly freed African-American
population of Augusta County Virginia, no matter how they came to
Bureau service.</p>
<p>The Freedmen's Bureau in Augusta County faced the same problems
as other offices across the South. Its most pressing concerns
included serving as an advocate for the African-American population
of the county in matters of employment, contract settlement, legal
issues, education, and poor relief. In matters of employment,
agents strove to ensure that contracts between freedmen and their
former masters were fair and executed properly. Lack of legal
justice proved to a significant problem in post-bellum Augusta
County for former slaves, and often the Staunton agents found
themselves embroiled in the local court system on behalf of the
freedmen. The Bureau also tried to serve as a mediator between the
black and white communities of the area in an effort to diffuse
tempers and tensions that often arose. Knowing that an education
would be the most important part of ensuring the freedmen's
futures, Bureau agents spent much of their time setting up and
supporting local schools. Finally, the local agents worked
tirelessly to reunite freedmen's families torn apart during
slavery, locating family members who had been sold away years
before.</p>
<p>Throughout its short life, the work of the Staunton office was
hindered by its limited budget, the staggering administrative
burden shouldered by its agents, and the antagonism of local
whites. Both the local agents and the freedmen fought through
resentment and hardship to try and build a life for
African-Americans in an Augusta County without slavery.</p>

<p><b>About the Register of Complaints</b></p>
<p>The two bound volumes that made up the "Register of Complaints"
for the Augusta County Freedmen's Bureau is an invaluable resource
that records some of the rich detail of the lives of newly freed
blacks in the first years after the Civil War. The Assistant
Superintendents of the Bureau used the Register (which they
referred to as the Complaint Book) to record the complaints and
concerns that freedmen and whites brought to the office, and often
the subsequent actions taken. Unfortunately the two volumes are
water-stained, making it difficult to decipher many words and
phrases, but every effort has been made to make as complete a
transcription as possible.</p>
<p>The majority of complaints concerned employment contracts and
wages, as well as other financial transactions. Typical complaints
involved either the employer's failure to pay the agreed upon wage,
or the employee's failure to fulfill his or her side of the
contract. Such cases contain a wealth of information about wage
levels for men and women, and other forms of compensation such as
clothing, food and shelter. Bureau agents helped to mediate these
conflicts through the settlement of a monetary claim or the
re-negotiation of the terms of labor. The register also contains
entries related to property rental rates and terms, a source which
casts light on the movements of freedmen in and around the county
as they tried to settle down with their families and built stable
lives.</p>
<p>Another issue that frequently surfaces in the register is that
of crime. Bureau agents often served as legal advisors and
representatives to freedmen, and the register records many of the
details of crimes committed against, and by, freedmen. Such crimes
range from accusations of petty theft and larceny to disorderly
conduct, to serious violence. Agents usually evaluated the merits
of a complaint before passing it on to the proper authorities, and
their conclusions are sometimes preserved in the register. The
cases preserved in the register seem to demonstrate that crime
crossed racial boundaries just as often as it occurred within the
black community.</p>
<p>The register is also an excellent source for investigating
family life and personal relationships among freedmen. Assistant
Superintendents took down requests to search for missing family
members sold out of Augusta County before or during the war, and
once found, the efforts to bring them home. The Register of
Complaints contains many entries related to the formalization of
familial relationships, and some of the conflicts related to
marriage--such as spousal violence and infidelity</p>
<p>Aside from the three areas of employment, crime, and family, the
register also touches on many other aspects of post-bellum life in
Augusta County. These include efforts to relieve the poverty of the
sick and elderly and to supply newly-created freedmen's schools,
claims filed with the Federal government, and occasionally the
administrative minutiae of the Bureau office.</p>

<p><b>About the Cohabitation Records</b></p>
<p>The Cohabitation Records, officially titled, "Register of Colored
Persons, Augusta County, State of Virginia, Cohabiting Together as
Husband and Wife," are a record of free African American families
living in Augusta County immediately after the end of the Civil
War. The records were created by the Freedmen's Bureau in an effort
to document the marriages of formerly enslaved men and women that
were legally recognized by an act of the Virginia Assembly in
February 1866.</p>
<p>There are 896 couples listed in the register, paired with lists
of the children (and their ages) the couple had together. The most
important record in the register was that of a marriage between two
freedpeople, who had often entered into marriage during slavery and
therefore had lacked the legal recognition and protection of the
state. The register also lists when the couple reported their
marriage to the Freedmen's Bureau for inclusion in the register,
their ages at the time of registration, birthplace of both husband
and wife, their current residence, and the occupation of the
husband. Additional comments were occasionally added by the Bureau
agents who recorded the couple's information.</p>
<p>The Freedmen's Bureau agents in Augusta County registered these
marriages from May 1865 until September 1866. These records were
apparently copied and forwarded to state officials, while the
original was kept on file at the Augusta County courthouse, where
it remains today.</p>
