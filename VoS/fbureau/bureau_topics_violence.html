                Nelson Irwin writes a very poignant and wrenching letter to General Schofield, the head of the Potomac Military District, pleading for justice and protection for blacks. He refers to an upcoming trial in Staunton and claims that blacks live under a "reign of terror". Irwin asks Schofield to use military power to intervene on the side of the law, writing, "We gave to the rich white man our best years, our strength, our youth, our sweat, and now that we are free, we get in return meanness, tyranny and injustice." Judging from the papertrail, this letter was passed all the way to Orlando Brown.

                In his letter, James Paul of Augusta County describes how he helped capture a fugitive from Lexington. There appears, however, to be at least one page missing from the letter, as the story does not seem complete.
