                                    1866-August 1866</a>
                                <blockquote>George T. Cook takes some time adjusting to his post in
                                    the administration of the Freedmen's Bureau in Augusta County.
                                    In these letters, rations, marriages, the flourishing condition
                                    of schools, and taxes, especially those levied for the poor, are
                                    all discussed. Of particular note to Cook is the treatment of
                                    blacks in the court system. Early in his tenure, Cook notes that
                                    some cases "were conducted with impartiality and fairness," but
                                    as more cases are tried, Cook recognizes that blacks cannot
                                    receive justice. In the end, Cook believes that the local
                                    magistrates are responsible for the unfair treatment of blacks
                                    in the court system. He thinks that this is a reflection of the
                                    negative attitudes of whites concerning blacks in the
                                area.</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="bureau_cook2.html">Administration of George T. Cook,
                                    September 1866-December 1866</a>
                                <blockquote>In this collection of letters, Cook again focuses on the
                                    treatment of blacks in the local court system. As a result of
                                    the continued injustice, Cook requests military assistance in
                                    keeping the courts free of impartialities. Even though Cook
                                    notes improvement in the treatment of blacks in the civil court
                                    system, he suggests the return of the Freedmen's courts. Of
                                    particular note is a case involving the murder of an African
                                    American by a white law student; the student escapes but is
                                    eventually captured. Other issues addressed in these letters
                                    are: poll taxes for the poor, the construction of a school
                                    building, low wages for blacks, the frequent abuse of blacks by
                                    whites, and the struggle of Freedmen to provide for their
                                    children.</blockquote>
