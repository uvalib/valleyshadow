              <blockquote>
                McDonnell asks Jackson to report when he will be in Monterey, the seat of Highland County, and if its County Court meets at the same time as Augusta's.

              <a href="../../papers/B1146">John A. McDonnell to Orlando Brown, April 1, 1868</a>

              <blockquote>
                McDonnell submits the quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District including Augusta County. In relation to the condition of blacks in Augusta County, McDonnell bemoans what he considers to be the persistence of "immoral" behavior and "lewdness." He does note, though, that the schools in Augusta seem to be flourishing. His report concludes with more general observations about attitudes toward education and social mores. He also mentions the transfer of Thomas Jackson out of the 4th Division, remarking that "this Sub-District loses the services of a most valuable officer, which is as much regretted by the Freedpeople of his division as by myself."
