                                    levied a poll tax to support the poor, but does not know if it
                                    will take effect in time for the winter, and notes the

                                <blockquote>Nelson Irwin writes a very poignant and wrenching letter
                                    to General Schofield, the head of the Potomac Military District,
                                    pleading for justice and protection for blacks. He refers to an
                                    upcoming trial in Staunton and claims that blacks live under a
                                    "reign of terror". Irwin asks Schofield to use military power to
                                    intervene on the side of the law, writing, "We gave to the rich
                                    white man our best years, our strength, our youth, our sweat,
                                    and now that we are free, we get in return meanness, tyranny and
                                    injustice." Judging from the papertrail, this letter was passed
                                    all the way to Orlando Brown.</blockquote>

                                    how he helped capture a fugitive from Lexington. There appears,
                                    however, to be at least one page missing from the letter, as the
                                    story does not seem complete. Paul states that because of his
                                    part in capturing the fugitive, Fitzgerald, he is entitled to at
                                    least part of any reward.</blockquote>

                                    According the the October 16 Stauton Spectator, Johnson escaped
                                    from Lexington to Augusta County, where he was arrested in

                                    poorly constructed and would be an "embarrassment" to the

                                    encompasses the Shenandoah Valley. According to Brackett,
                                    Staunton has the most black students in the Valley, and
                                    Waynesboro still needs a place to hold classes.</blockquote>
