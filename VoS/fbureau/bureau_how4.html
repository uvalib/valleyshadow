                                    resignation from the Bureau. How proposes a reorganization of
                                    the Sixth District due to conflicts with General Terry, the
                                    Military Commissioner for the Valley. He suggests that two
                                    counties be placed under the jurisdiction of West Virginia,
                                    where much more progress has been made in terms of laws
                                    protecting the rights of free blacks, and further splitting the
                                    district into two parts, one of which would be commanded from
                                    Staunton. His letter constantly alludes to conflicts and
                                    misunderstandings between the Bureau and the Military
                                    Commissioners.</blockquote>

                                    caused him. Dews actual position in Staunton, was as magistrate
                                    on the Freedmen's Courts, but attached endorsements to his
                                    letter indicate that he received very little money in fees from
                                    the court, and was paid by the Bureau at a clerk's
