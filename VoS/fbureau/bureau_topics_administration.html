              <blockquote>
                In declining an offer of transfer to Southampton, Jackson launches into a personal political manifesto, expressing his views on the current political situation, the prospect of black suffrage, and the relations between whites and blacks. He writes, "I want the fullest equality for all men before the law but am opposed to attempting to mix oil and water, black and white in one homogenous social mass because it cannot be done." He also expresses his belief in the importance of widespread education for ensuring the stability of society.
