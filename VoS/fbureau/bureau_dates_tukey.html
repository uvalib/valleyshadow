              <blockquote>
                As soon as Frederick Tukey assumed his role in the Freedmen's Bureau administration, his character comes into question. N. C. Brackett questions Tukey's attitudes toward black schools, and Tukey's own servant alleges the consumption of government rations in the Tukey household. As a result of these accusations, many locals respond with letters of support for the appointment of Tukey. On the administrative front, Tukey leases a building in Staunton for the Bureau. In regard to Freedmen, Tukey notes the negative attitudes of whites towards blacks, except in the case of education.

              <blockquote>
                Garrick Mallery concludes that there is not firm evidence to prove Tukey's dishonesty or fraud, but Tukey's reputation was so damaged by the allegations that Mallery suggests Tukey resigns in order to preserve the standing of the Bureau. Meanwhile, Tukey reports on child abandonment, poor whites in need of assistance, Freedmen who attend schools, and the need for more rations. Tukey notes that no court cases involving blacks were tried. Lastly, Tukey urges the Bureau to hire a physician to care for the sick Freedmen in the district.
