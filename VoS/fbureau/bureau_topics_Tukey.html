          <td>Frederick Tukey was a Bureau agent in Augusta County from January-April 1867. After arriving he was quickly embroiled in a dispute where Tukey found himself accused of disloyalty, embezzlement, and improper behavior. While the Bureau ultimately decided that there was no real evidence of Tukey's alleged misdeeds, they felt his local reputation had been too damaged for him to continue serving as the Bureau agent in Staunton. These letters detail the Bureau's investigation and Tukey's self-defense during the controversy. <!--R1C1--></td>

                Mallery reviews and considers the available evidence pertaining to the various accusations against Frederick Tukey. He concludes that there is no firm evidence to point to fraud or dishonesty on Tukey's part, but recommends that due to his lack of organization, and the fact that his reputation has been damaged beyond repair, that to allow Tukey to continue on as Bureau agent would further damage the Bureau's standing in the community. Mallery also concludes that the counter accusations raised by Tukey against George Cook and several female school teachers merit further investigation.
