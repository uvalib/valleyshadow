Irwin asks Schofield to use military power to intervene on the side of the law, writing, "We gave to the rich white man our best years, our strength, our youth, our sweat, and now that we are free, we get in return meanness, tyranny and injustice."

                In his report, Waldo remarks that although he knows of no cases of actual discrimination in the legal system, he observes a "spirit" of injustice towards blacks and whites loyal to the Union government among Magistrates. Waldo also reports that he continue to settle civil matters outside of the courts.
