                        <td>One of the primary duties of the Bureau was to monitor and mediate
                            employment contracts and disputes between the freedmen and local whites.
                            The letters in this section cover labor contracts, various disputes that
                            erupted over the fulfillment of those contracts, and the often bitter
                            feelings Augusta's economy brought up in both blacks and whites. Some of
                            the letters deal with non-agricultural work, such as teaching and
                            masonry. This section provides insight into how both whites and blacks
                            sought to gain from the new post-war Southern economy, and touches
                            regularly on the state of black-white relations. <!--R1C1-->
