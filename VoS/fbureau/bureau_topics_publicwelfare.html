                Howard urges that steps be taken to stop intemperance among blacks in Virginia and South Carolina. In the view that certain temperance societies refuse to organize in black communities, he proposes the formation of new temperance societies, named for Lincoln.

              <blockquote>
                Frazier writes to Waldo for material assistance for the coming winter. Frazier notes that he requested help last year also, but did not receive the aid due to the "rascality of Henry Keys," although what he means by this is unclear. The letter appears to be written by Jacob Wissler, who also submitted a letter to the Bureau on Frazier's behalf.
