                                    sheds light on the early post-war situation of freed blacks. He
                                    writes that their new freedom seems tenuous as their former
                                    masters threaten to reestablish slavery once Union troops have
                                    left. How also notes that he has had trouble hiring military
                                    personnel to staff the office, and so has hired
                                civilians.</blockquote>

                                    to General Schofield, the head of the Potomac Military District,
                                    pleading for justice and protection for blacks. He refers to an
                                    upcoming trial in Staunton and claims that blacks live under a
                                    "reign of terror". Irwin asks Schofield to use military power to
                                    intervene on the side of the law, writing, "We gave to the rich
                                    white man our best years, our strength, our youth, our sweat,
                                    and now that we are free, we get in return meanness, tyranny and
                                    injustice." Judging from the papertrail, this letter was passed
                                    all the way to Orlando Brown.</blockquote>

                                    Cithrow describes the situation in the area around Waynesboro.
                                    He writes that although he taught a Sabbath school for blacks,
                                    his resources were stretched too thin to keep it going. He also
                                    comments on the level of interest in setting up a proper school
                                    for blacks among the black and white communities in the
