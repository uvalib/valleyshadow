          <td>Bureau Agents at the local and district levels were required to file reports on a monthly and quarterly basis which summarized the general condition of freedmen under their jurisdiction. These reports contain a wealth of information which spans all themes and topics. Topics of commentary included the condition of schools in the area, how many freedmen were able to find jobs and at what wages, how many people received material aid from the Bureau, and the state of the judicial system, as well as crime levels. But they also talked about the "moral development" of the black community in terms of marriage relations and temperance. Relations between blacks and whites also received considerable attention. <!--R1C1--></td>

                How's first report as Bureau Superintendent in Staunton sheds light on the early post-war situation of freed blacks. He writes that their new freedom seems tenuous as their former masters threaten to reestablish slavery once Union troops have left. How also notes that he has had trouble hiring military personnel to staff the office, and so has hired civilians.

                McDonnell submits the quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District including Augusta County. In relation to the condition of blacks in Augusta County, McDonnell bemoans what he considers to be the persistence of "immoral" behavior and "lewdness." He does note, though, that the schools in Augusta seem to be flourishing. His report concludes with more general observations about attitudes toward education and social mores. He also mentions the transfer of Thomas Jackson out of the 4th Division, remarking that "this Sub-District loses the services of a most valuable officer, which is as much regretted by the Freedpeople of his division as by myself."

              <blockquote>
                Jordan files his first report as the Bureau's agent in Augusta and Highland counties. His initial observations reflect much of what Jackson reported in earlier reports, including the reluctance of freedmen to use the courts to settle claims against their employers. Jordan notes that there is surprisingly little drunkeness in his Division, and that the schools appear to be flourishing.

                Jordan's monthly report is largely positive and optimistic about the state of affairs in Augusta County. He does, however, observe that while white farmers seem to possess "kind" feelings towards freedmen, townspeople possess an "intense hostility" toward the exercise of civil and political rights on the part of blacks.

                Jordan remarks that blacks in Augusta County have made enormous strides in improving their welfare considering the disadvantages arrayed against them. He believes that they can accomplish much if the obstacles are removed. In that respect, he concludes his report with the following statement: "the interests of the Freedmen, the Loyalists and the Federal Government demands the continuance of the Bureau with enlarged powers and more extended and substantial authority."

                Jordan reports that the distrust felt among blacks in Augusta County is a product of the fact that whites do not want to recognize their status as citizens, and because they continued to be taken advantage of in the labor market.

                Waldo's first monthly report as the Agent in Augusta and Highland Counties talks about the deceptive behavior of white employers when settling labor contracts, and he labels such practices "unmanly, ungenerous [and] outrageous." He also mentions that almost no preparations had been made to make schools ready to open at the beginning of the fall term because the local black communities lacked resources and outside help was rare.

                McDonnell submits yet another quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District. His assessment of the situation in Augusta County is largely positive, although on a more general note, he comments that the news of the Bureau's impending cessation of operation has been met with much regret among the black population. McDonnell expressed doubts about the ability of the law alone to protect recently bestowed rights from the influence of local prejudices with means of enforcement.

                Waldo's report comments on the rising need for Bureau aid as demand for labor decreases, as well as the prevalence of intemperance, which has largely gone unnoticed according to Waldo because of the efforts to keep alcohol consumption "clandestine."

                McDonnell submits his last quarterly report to Bureau headquarters in Richmond. In relation to Augusta County, he mentions the persistent problems with contracts and the efforts to defraud free blacks. But he also notes the progress made in education, and the decline in intemperance. McDonnell closes his report with some pessimistic observations about the fate of blacks once the Bureau is dissolved. He writes: "after restrictions are removed the colored people will be again reduced to servitude for a compensation of the coarsest food and clothing." He also commends General Brown for his work in the Bureau.
