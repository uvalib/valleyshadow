          <td>The Bureau often found itself playing the role of mediator between individuals in the black and white communities in Augusta County, as well as within the black community itself. Bureau Agents worked on contract negotiations, contract settlement, issues of debt and property claims, and more personal problems as well. In some cases, mediation provided a way of avoiding the court system, while in others, Bureau agents were called upon to help enforce some of the settlements issued in civil cases. <!--R1C1--></td>
