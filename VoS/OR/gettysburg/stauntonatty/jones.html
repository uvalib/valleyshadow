  <p>Reports of Lieut. Col. H. P. Jones, C. S. Army, commanding Artillery Battalion.</p>

  <p>August 18, 1863.</p>

  <p>Sir: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of this battalion from the time it was attached to Gen. Early's division until its return into Virginia:</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>After resting at York one day, we marched back in the direction of Gettysburg, before which place we arrived on Wednesday, July 1. Here, finding the enemy heavily engaging Gen. Rodes on our right, the major-general commanding ordered me to put the batteries in position, so as to open fire. Acting under his orders, I immediately placed twelve guns in position, and opened fire with considerable effect on the enemy's artillery, and upon the flank of a column of troops that were being massed upon our right.</p>

  <p>On the advance of Gen. Gordon's brigade from our right, we directed our fire farther to the left, on the disordered masses of the enemy that were rapidly retreating before our troops. This was continued until the advance of our men rendered it dangerous to continue firing from that position. I immediately, by order of Gen. Early, sent Capt. Carrington's battery across the creek to take position in front of Gettysburg, but, moving with all rapidity, as it did, before it could reach any position the enemy had been driven through the town by Hays' brigade. In the first position we occupied, three guns were temporarily disabled by having shots wedged in the bores, and one Napoleon permanently disabled by being struck on the face of the muzzle and bent by a solid shot from the enemy.</p>

  <p>We had 1 man killed of Capt. Green's, and 1 man of Capt. Garber's battery wounded. The guns that were temporarily disabled were soon rendered fit for service again, and I was enabled to replace the Napoleon gun permanently disabled by one of the two Napoleon guns captured by Gen. Hays' brigade. The disabled gun and the other captured Napoleon I had carried and turned over to the ordnance department, thereby securing them.</p>

  <p>In the other two days of the battle of Gettysburg, my battalion was not actively engaged, but was in position to guard against a reported flank movement of the enemy on our left, and afterward any advance the enemy might attempt to make from the hills in front of Gettysburg.</p>

  <p>On the 2d, I ordered two guns of Capt. Green's battery, at the request of Gen. Stuart, to report to Gen. Hampton at Hunterstown, where he engaged the enemy, with a loss of 1 man killed and 1 sergeant and 14 men wounded.</p>

  <p>Capt. Tanner having exhausted his ammunition, excepting a few</p>

  <p>PAGE 496-44 N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., PA., ETC. [CHAP. XXXIX. [Series I. Vol. 27. Part II. Reports. Serial No. 44.]</p>

  <p>rounds of canister, and it being impossible to supply him, I ordered him to go with the wagon train to the rear. When this was attacked in the mountains, he rendered very efficient service with his few rounds of canister, driving back the enemy's cavalry. Here he lost 2 men, missing. On reaching Williamsport, he received more ammunition, and rendered good service when the wagon train was attacked, with a loss of 1 man and 2 horses killed and 1 horse disabled.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 5th, we fell back from Gettysburg, the division bringing up the rear of the army, and continued our march to Hagerstown, where we remained in line of battle a few days; then recrossed the river. Two empty wagons, ordered to report to the surgeon at Gettysburg, to bring off the wounded, have never since been heard from. One forge sent over with the wagon train was lost at the river.</p>

  <p>In the expedition to and around Hedgesville, Capt. Tanner's battery was detached, and went to Johnsontown with Col. [Lawrence S.] Baker, commanding cavalry brigade, where it fired a few rounds at the enemy across the river. From Hagerstown to this point the horses suffered very much from long marches and want of proper food.</p>

  <p>My thanks are due to both officers and men for their conduct in presence of the enemy and the patience with which they endured the hardships of the campaign.</p>

  <p>I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>H. P. JONES,<br />
  Lieut.-Col., Comdg. Artillery Battalion.</p>

  <p>Maj. John W. Daniel, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>

  <p>-----</p>

  <p>August 4, 1863.<br />
  Sir: On the morning of July 1, while marching in rear of Early's division, I received an order from Gen. Early to bring the batteries at once to the front, for the purpose of engaging the enemy. This I did, and found on arriving at the front that the enemy were posted in front of Gettysburg, and engaging hotly what I afterward learned was Gen. Rodes' division. I immediately brought twelve guns into position, and opened a brisk fire upon the enemy's artillery and infantry, taking them in flank as they were being massed upon Rodes' left and Gen. Early's right.</p>

  <p>The batteries were very soon driven from the position and forced to retire, leaving one carriage disabled, which, however, they afterward succeeded in getting off. Our fire was very effective upon their infantry, presenting, as they did, large bodies in easy range of us.</p>

  <p>In this engagement, I had three guns temporarily disabled and one permanently so. One man of the Louisiana Guard Artillery was killed, and 1 of the Staunton Artillery wounded.</p>

  <p>For your better information, I have the honor herewith to inclose the reports of Capt.'s Tanner and Green, of the operations of their batteries at Wrightsville, Hunterstown, South Mountain, and Williamsport.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>H. P. JONES,<br />
  Lieut.-Col., Comdg. Artillery Battalion.</p>

  <p>Lieut. [S. V.] Southall,<br />
  Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
