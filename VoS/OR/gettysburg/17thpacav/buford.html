  <p>Reports of Brig. Gen. John Buford, U. S. Army, commanding First Division.</p>

  <p>Hdqrs. First Cavalry Division,</p>

  <p>Gettysburg, June 30, 1863.</p>

  <p>I entered this place to-day at 11 a. m. Found everybody in a terrible state of excitement on account of the enemy's advance upon this place. He had approached to within half a mile of the town when the head of my column entered. His force was terribly exaggerated by reasonable and truthful but inexperienced men. On pushing him back toward Cashtown, I learned from reliable men that [R. H.] Anderson's division was marching from Chambersburg by Mummasburg, Hunterstown, Abbottstown, on toward York. I have sent parties to the two first-named places, toward Cashtown, and a strong force toward Littlestown. Col. Gamble has just sent me word that Lee signed a pass for a citizen this morning at Chambersburg. I can't do much just now. My men and horses are fagged out. I have not been able to get any grain yet. It is all in the country, and the people talk instead of working. Facilities for shoeing are nothing. Early's people seized every shoe and nail they could find.</p>

  <p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JNO. BUFORD,<br />
  Brig.-Gen. of Volunteers.</p>

  <p>Gen. Pleasonton.</p>

  <p>[P. S.]--The troops that are coming here were the same I found early this morning at Millersburg or Fairfield. Gen. Reynolds has been advised of all that I know.</p>

  <p>[Indorsement.]</p>

  <p>This information contradicts Kilpatrick's, of Lee being in Berlin.*</p>

  <p>A. PLEASONTON,<br />
  Maj.-Gen., Comdg.</p>

  <p>-----</p>

  <p>Gettysburg, June 30, 1863--10.30 p. m. The Reserve Brigade, under Gen. Merritt, is at Mechanicstown with my trains. Gen. Pleasonton wrote he would inform me when he relieved it. To-day I received instructions saying it would picket toward Hagerstown and south. I am satisfied that A. P. Hill's corps is massed just back of Cashtown, about 9 miles from this place. Pender's division of this (Hill's) corps came up to-day--of which I advised you, saying, "The enemy in my front is increased." The enemy's pickets (infantry and artillery) are within 4 miles of this place, on the Cashtown road. My parties have returned that went north, northwest, and northeast, after crossing the road from Cashtown to Oxford in several places. They heard nothing of any force having passed over it lately. The road, however, is terribly infested with prowling cavalry parties. Near Heidlersburg today, one of my parties captured a courier of Lee's. Nothing was found on him. He says Ewell's corps is crossing the mountains from Carlisle, Rodes' division being at Petersburg in advance. Longstreet, from all I can learn, is still behind Hill. I have many rumors and reports of the enemy advancing upon me from toward York. I have to pay attention to some of them, which causes me to overwork my horses and men. I can get no forage nor rations; am out</p>

  <p>Respectfully,</p>

  <p>JNO. BUFORD.</p>

  <p>Maj.-Gen. Reynolds.</p>

  <p>-----</p>

  <p>Gettysburg, June 30--10.40 p. m. I have the honor to state the following facts: A. P. Hill's corps, composed of Anderson, Heth, and Pender, is massed back of Cashtown, 9 miles from this place. His pickets, composed of infantry and artillery, are in sight of mine. There is a road from Cashtown running through Mummasburg and Hunterstown on to York pike at Oxford, which is terribly infested with roving detachments of cavalry. Rumor says Ewell is coming over the mountains from Carlisle. One of his escort was captured to-day near Heidlersburg. He says Rodes, commanding a division of Ewell's, has already crossed the mountains from Carlisle. When will the reserve be relieved, and where are my wagons? I have no need of them, as I can find no forage. I have kept Gen. Reynolds informed of all that has transpired. The inclosed * is in reply to last dispatch.</p>

  <p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JNO. BUFORD,<br />
  Brig.-Gen. of Volunteers.</p>

  <p>Gen. Pleasonton.</p>

  <p>[Indorsement.]</p>

  <p>Respectfully forwarded. A report from Gen. Buford and one from Gen. Kilpatrick.+ Kilpatrick has done very well.</p>

  <p>Hdqrs. First Cavalry Division,</p>

  <p>Gettysburg, July 1, 1863--10.10 a. m.</p>

  <p>The enemy's force (A. P. Hill's) are advancing on me at this point, and driving my pickets and skirmishers very rapidly. There is also a large force at Heidlersburg that is driving my pickets at that point from that direction. Gen. Reynolds is advancing, and is within 3 miles of this point with his leading division. I am positive that the whole of A. P. Hill's force is advancing.</p>

  <p>Hdqrs. First Cavalry Division,</p>

  <p>&gt;July 1, 1863--3.20 p. m.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that Longstreet and Hill have made a junction. A tremendous battle has been raging since 9.30 a. m., with varying success. At the present moment the battle is raging on the road to Cashtown, and within short cannon-range of this town. The enemy's</p>

  <p>Hdqrs. First Cavalry Division,<br />
  August 27, 1863.</p>

  <p>Col.: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of the First Cavalry Division, from its crossing the Potomac at Edwards Ferry, on June 27, to its crossing of the Rappahannock on August 1:</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>CHAP. XXXIX.] THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN. PAGE 927-43 [Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43.]</p>

  <p>The night of the 30th was a busy night for the division. No reliable information of value could be obtained from the inhabitants, and but for the untiring exertions of many different scouting parties, information of the enemy's whereabouts and movements could not have been gained in time to prevent him from getting the town before our army could get up.</p>

  <p>By daylight on July 1, I had gained positive information of the enemy's position and movements, and my arrangements were made for entertaining him until Gen. Reynolds could reach the scene.</p>

  <p>On July 1, between 8 and 9 a. m., reports came in from the First Brigade (Col. Gamble's) that the enemy was coming down from toward Cashtown in force. Col. Gamble made an admirable line of battle, and moved off proudly to meet him. The two lines soon became hotly engaged, we having the advantage of position, he of numbers. The First Brigade held its own for more than two hours, and had to be literally dragged back a few hundred yards to a position more secure and better sheltered. Tidball's battery, commanded by Lieut. Calef, Second U. S. Artillery, fought on this occasion as is seldom witnessed. At one time the enemy had a concentric fire upon this battery from twelve guns, all at short range. Calef held his own gloriously, worked his guns deliberately with great judgment and skill, and with wonderful effect upon the enemy. The First Brigade maintained this unequal contest until the leading division of Gen. Reynolds' corps came up to its assistance, and then most reluctantly did it give up the front. A portion of the Third Indiana found horse-holders, borrowed muskets, and fought with the Wisconsin regiment that came to relieve them. While this left of my line was engaged, Devin's brigade, on the right, had its hands full. The enemy advanced upon Devin by four roads, and on each was checked and held until the leading division of the Eleventh Corps came to his relief.</p>

  <p>After the fall of Gen. Reynolds, whose advance troops partially drove back the enemy and made heavy captures of prisoners, the enemy brought up fresh troops, and engaged Gen. Doubleday's command, which fought bravely, but was greatly outnumbered and forced to fall back. Seeing our troops retiring, and their need of assistance, I immediately rushed Gamble's brigade to Doubleday's left, and dismounted it in time to render great assistance to our infantry, and to check and break the enemy's line. My troops at this place had partial shelter behind a low stone fence, and were in short carbine range. Their fire was perfectly terrific, causing the enemy to break and rally on their second line, which made no farther advance toward my position.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, I placed my command on our extreme left, to watch and fight the enemy should he make another attack, and went to Cemetery Hill for observation. While there, Gen. Hancock arrived, and in a few moments he made superb disposition to resist any attack that might be made.</p>

  <p>My division bivouacked that night on the left of our position, with pickets extending almost to Fairfield.</p>

  <p>The zeal, bravery, and good behavior of the officers and men on the night of June 30, and during July 1, was commendable in the extreme. A heavy task was before us; we were equal to it, and shall all remember with pride that at Gettysburg we did our country much service.</p>

  <p>July 2, the division became engaged with the enemy's sharpshooters</p>

  <p>PAGE 928-43 N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., PA., ETC. [CHAP. XXXIX. [Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43.]</p>

  <p>on our left, and held its own until relieved by Gen. Sickles' corps, after which it moved to Taneytown, and bivouacked for the night.</p>

  <p>The next day, July 3, it moved to Westminster, to guard the trains of the army at that point.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The First Brigade captured 854 head of beef-cattle and 602 sheep at Chester Gap, which were turned over to the subsistence department at Markham, July 24.</p>

  <p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  Brig.-Gen. of Volunteers, Comdg.</p>
