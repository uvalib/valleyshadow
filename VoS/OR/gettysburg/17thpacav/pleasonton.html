  Gen.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the
  operations of the Cavalry Corps in the late campaign, including the
  battle of Gettysburg, with accompanying reports of subordinate
  commanders:
</p><p>
  On June 28, the army being in the vicinity of Frederick City,
  Md., the Cavalry Corps was placed as follows: The First Division
  (Buford's) was posted near Middletown, covering the left, and watching
  the enemy in the direction of Hagerstown.  The Second Division
  (Gregg's) was stationed at different points from Frederick City to
  Ridgeville, on the Baltimore turnpike, covering the right of the

</p><p>
  army. The Third Division (Kilpatrick's) was at Frederick City, and
  was assigned to the corps on that day.
</p><p>
  Orders having been issued for the advance of the army toward
  Pennsylvania, on June 29, Buford's division moved as follows, to
  cover and protect the left flank of the line of march: The Reserve
  Brigade was detached under Brig.-Gen. Merritt, and moved
  to Mechanicstown and afterward to Emmitsburg.  The First and
  Second Brigades passed through Boonsborough, Cavetown, and Monterey
  Springs, and encamped near Fairfield, within a short distance
  of a considerable force of the enemy's infantry.
</p><p>
  On June 30, these two brigades moved toward Gettysburg; met
  two regiments of rebel infantry, with some artillery, and after some
  skirmishing, not wishing to use artillery, they turned off, and reached
  Gettysburg in the afternoon, just in time to meet the enemy entering
  the town, and to drive him back before he secured a position.  The
  enemy withdrew in the direction of Cashtown, leaving his pickets
  about 4 1/2 miles from Gettysburg.
</p><p>
  By daylight on July 1, Gen. Buford had obtained positive
  information of the enemy's position and movements, and made his
  dispositions to hold him in check until the First Corps, under Maj.-
  Gen. Reynolds, could arrive upon the field.
</p><p>
  Between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, the rebels advanced with
  superior numbers on Buford's position, but for more than two hours
  were gallantly checked in every attempt that was made, when the
  troops of the First and Eleventh Corps began to arrive and to relieve
  the cavalry from their perilous position.  This division continued in
  the fight throughout the day, displaying great obstinacy in holding
  all their positions, and splendid courage and skill in their treatment
  of the rebels.
</p><p>
  On July 2, Buford's division held a position on our left at Gettysburg
  until relieved by the Third Corps, when it was directed to take
  post at Westminster, to assist in guarding the army trains at that
  point.
</p><p>
  On June 29, Gregg's division moved by the right flank of the army
  on Westminster, covering the country toward York and Carlisle by
  reconnaissances and patrols.  Kilpatrick's division advanced from
  Frederick City, on June 29, direct to the front on Hanover by way
  of Littlestown.
</p><p>
  On the morning of the 30th, they were attacked by Stuart's cavalry
  in full force.  After a gallant fight, the enemy was repulsed, losing
  one battle-flag, and retreated in the direction of Carlisle.
</p><p>
  On July 1, they were pursued as far as Berlin, by the way of Abbottstown,
  a detachment under Lieut.-Col. Alexander, chief
  of staff, proceeding as far as Rosstown.
</p><p>
  Kilpatrick's division on July 2 moved toward Gettysburg from the
  direction of Heidlersburg, to prevent the enemy from concentrating
  his forces by that road, and to protect our right flank from being
  turned. Late in the afternoon, this division met the rebel cavalry
  near Hunterstown, and, after a spirited affair for two hours, the enemy
  was driven from his position.  The division was then ordered
  to Two Taverns, which it reached at daylight.
</p><p>
  It being now apparent that the rebel army intended making a vigorous
  attack on the left of the position held by our army on the
  heights of Gettysburg, Gen. Kilpatrick was directed to move to
  the right of the enemy's line, connect with Merritt's brigade, ordered
  up from Emmitsburg, and attack the enemy in flank and rear, as

</p><p>
 well as prevent our own flank from being turned, Custer's brigade,
  of this division, remaining on our right flank, in connection with
  Gen. Gregg.  Gen. Kilpatrick did valuable service with the
  First Brigade, under Gen. Farnsworth, in charging the enemy's
  infantry, and, with the assistance of Merritt's brigade and the good
  execution of their united batteries, caused him to detach largely from
  his main attack on the left of our line.
</p><p>
  It was in one of these brilliant engagements that the noble and
  gallant Farnsworth fell, heroically leading a charge of his brigade
  against the rebel infantry.  Gifted in a high degree with a quick
  perception and a correct judgment, and remarkable for his daring
  and coolness, his comprehensive grasp of the situation on the field
  of battle and the rapidity of his actions had already distinguished
  Gen. Farnsworth among his comrades in arms.  In his death
  was closed a career that must have won the highest honors of his
  profession.
</p><p>
  On June 30, immediately after the fight of Kilpatrick at Hanover,
  the enemy hastily withdrew his forces from York and Carlisle
  and began to concentrate on Gettysburg.  As soon as this was known,
  Gregg's division was directed to leave one brigade (Huey's) to cover
  the depot at Westminster, and move with the other two brigades
  toward Gettysburg, to take up a position on the right of our line
  of battle, and prevent the enemy from turning the flank and gaining
  the rear.  This position was established about noon of July 2, and
  was at the intersection of the Gettysburg and Hanover turnpike with
  the road which ran in rear of our line of battle.  The enemy attacked
  this point late in the evening with two regiments deployed,
  but were compelled to retire.
</p><p>
  On July 3, Custer's brigade, of Kilpatrick's division, having occupied
  the position of Gregg's division of the day before, the latter was
  posted three-quarters of a mile nearer the Baltimore and Gettysburg
  turnpike.
</p><p>
  About noon the enemy threw a heavy force of cavalry against this
  position, with the intention of gaining our rear.  This attack was
  met and handsomely defeated by Gen. Gregg, who reports several
  fine charges made by the First Michigan Cavalry, of Custer's brigade,
  and the First New Jersey and Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, of his
  own division.  The enemy withdrew from his position with heavy
  loss, and evacuated his lines that night.  Custer's brigade then proceeded
  to join its division on our left.
</p><p>
  The grand attack of Gen. Lee's army on July 3, on the left of
  our line at Gettysburg, having been successfully repulsed and defeated,
  orders were given for the cavalry to gain his rear and line of
  communication, and harass and annoy him as much as possible in
  his retreat.
