    <p> Reports of Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson, C. S. Army, commanding division. </p>
    <p> Hdqrs. Johnson's Division, </p>
    <p> September 30, 1863. </p>
    <p> Maj.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my division from
      June 15 to July 31, embracing the campaign in Pennsylvania and battle of Gettysburg: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> PAGE 504-44 N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., PA., ETC. [CHAP. XXXIX. [Series I. Vol. 27. Part II.
      Reports. Serial No. 44.] </p>
    <p> The last day's march was 25 miles, rendered the more fatiguing because of obstructions
      caused by wagons of Longstreet's corps. </p>
    <p> Late on the night of July 1, I moved along the Gettysburg and York Railroad to the northeast
      of the town, and formed line of battle in a ravine in an open field, Nicholls' brigade on the
      right, next Jones'; Steuart's and Walker's on the left. Pickets were thrown well to the front,
      and the troops slept on their arms. </p>
    <p> Early next morning, skirmishers from Walker's and Jones' brigades were advanced for the
      purpose of feeling the enemy, and desultory firing was maintained with their skirmishers until
      4 p. m., at which hour I ordered Maj. Latimer to open fire with all of his pieces from the
      only eligible hill within range, Jones' brigade being properly disposed as a support. The hill
      was directly in front of the wooded mountain and a little to the left of the Cemetery Hill;
      consequently exposed to the concentrated fire from both, and also to an enfilade fire from a
      battery near the Baltimore road. The unequal contest was maintained for two hours with
      considerable damage to the enemy, as will appear from the accompanying report of Lieut.-Col.
      Andrews. Maj. Latimer having reported to me that the exhausted condition of his horses and
      men, together with the terrible fire of the enemy's artillery, rendered his position
      untenable, he was ordered to cease firing and withdraw all of his pieces excepting four, which
      were left in position to cover the advance of my infantry. </p>
    <p> In obedience to an order from the lieutenant-general commanding, I then advanced my infantry
      to the assault of the enemy's strong position--a rugged and rocky mountain, heavily timbered
      and difficult of ascent; a natural fortification, rendered more formidable by deep
      intrenchments and thick abatis--Jones' brigade in advance, followed by Nicholls' and
      Steuart's. Gen. Walker was directed to follow, but reporting to me that the enemy were
      advancing upon him from their right, he was ordered to repulse them and follow on as soon as
      possible. </p>
    <p> The opposing force was larger and the time consumed longer than was anticipated, in
      consequence of which Gen. Walker did not arrive in time to participate in the assault that
      night. </p>
    <p> By the time my other brigades had crossed Rock Creek and reached the base of the mountain,
      it was dark. His skirmishers were driven in, and the attack made with great vigor and spirit.
      It was as successful as could have been expected, considering the superiority of the enemy's
      force and position. Steuart's brigade, on the left, carried a line of breastworks which ran
      perpendicular to the enemy's main line, captured a number of prisoners and a stand of colors,
      and the whole line advanced to within short range, and kept up a heavy fire until late in the
      night. Brig.-Gen. Jones and Col. Higginbotham, Twenty-fifth Virginia, were wounded in this
      assault, and the command of Jones' brigade devolved upon Lieut.-Col. Dungan. </p>
    <p> Early next morning, the Stonewall Brigade was ordered to the support of the others, and the
      assault was renewed with great determination. Shortly after, the enemy moved forward to
      recapture the line of breastworks which had been taken the night previous, but was repulsed
      with great slaughter. Daniel's and Rodes' brigades (Col. [E. A.] O'Neal commanding), of Rodes'
      division, having reported to me, two other assaults were made; both failed. The enemy were too
      securely intrenched and in too great numbers to be dislodged by the force at my command. </p>

      Serial No. 44.] </p>
    <p> In the meantime, a demonstration in force was made upon my left and rear. The Second
      Virginia Regt., Stonewall Brigade, and Smith's brigade, of Early's division, were disposed to
      meet and check it, which was accomplished to my entire satisfaction. No further assault was
      made; all had been done that it was possible to do. </p>
    <p> I held my original position until 10 o'clock of the night of the 3d, when, in accordance
      with orders, I withdrew to the hill north and west of Gettysburg, where we remained until the
      following day, in the hope that the enemy would give us battle on ground of our own selection. </p>
    <p> My loss in this terrible battle was heavy, including some of the most valuable officers of
      the command. </p>
    <p> Maj. J. W. Latimer, of Andrews' battalion, the "boy major," whose chivalrous bearing on so
      many fields had won for him a reputation to be envied by his seniors, received a severe wound
      on the evening of the 2d, from the effects of which he has since died. </p>
    <p> Maj. B. W. Leigh, my chief of staff, whose conscientious discharge of duty, superior
      attainments, and noble bearing made him invaluable to me, was killed within a short distance
      of the enemy's line. </p>
    <p> Maj. H. K. Douglas, assistant adjutant-general, was severely wounded while in the discharge
      of his duties, and is still a prisoner. </p>
    <p> My orderly, W. H. Webb, remained with me after being severely wounded. His conduct entitles
      him to a commission. </p>
    <p> Fewer wounded from my division were left in the hands of the enemy than from any other
      division of the army; for which I am indebted to the active exertions of Chief Surg. R. T.
      Coleman. </p>
    <p> Mr. E. J. Martin, my volunteer aide-de-camp, rendered valuable service by his prompt
      transmission of orders, and Maj. E. L. Moore faithfully performed his duties as assistant
      inspector-general. </p>
    <p> The troops are much indebted to Majs. T. E. Ballard and G. H. Kyle, of the commissary
      department, for supplies during the trying period covered by this report. Cattle and flour
      were frequently procured within the enemy's lines. </p>
    <p> All of the officers and men of the division who came under my observation during their three
      days' exposure to the enemy's incessant fire of musketry and artillery from the front and
      artillery from the left and rear behaved as brave men. </p>
    <p> For particular instances of gallantry, I have the honor to refer you to the reports of
      brigade and regimental commanders, herewith transmitted. </p>
    <p> I take pleasure in bearing testimony to the gallantry of Brig.-Gen. Daniel and Col. O'Neal,
      and to Brig.-Gen. [William] Smith, and their brigades, while under my command. </p>
    <p> We marched on the 5th across the mountain, by Waynesborough, toward Hagerstown, and remained
      for a few days within 3 miles of the latter place. Thence the division moved 2 1/2 miles from
      Hagerstown, and formed line of battle on both sides of and perpendicular to the Hagerstown and
      Williamsport pike. </p>
    <p> On the night of the 13th, I recrossed the Potomac 1 mile above Williamsport, and continued
      the march next day to within 4 miles of Martinsburg; thence to Darkesville on the 15th, where
      we remained until ordered to return to Martinsburg, to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio
      Railroad, and repel an advance of the enemy. This done, the division by steady marches
      recrossed the Blue Ridge at Front Royal, and went into camp near Orange Court-House about
      August 1. </p>
