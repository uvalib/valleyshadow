    <p> Report of Col. J. H. S. Funk, Fifth Virginia Infantry. </p>
    <p>August 18, 1863. </p>
    <p> In conformity to a circular from brigade headquarters, I have the honor of submitting the
      following report of the engagement at Gettysburg: </p>
    <p> On the morning of July 1, my regiment left camp near Fayetteville with the brigade. We
      crossed South Mountain, and marched in the direction of Gettysburg, where Gen. Heth's division
      had engaged the enemy. Reached Gettysburg near dark, passing through a portion of the town,
      and following the York and Gettysburg Railroad nearly 2 miles, then filing to the right, where
      we were thrown in line of battle with the brigade on the extreme left of the division,
      northeast of the town, my regiment being in the center of the brigade. </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 2d, we were aroused early by our skirmishers firing. We remained in
      this position until late in the afternoon, when, after changing our position several times,
      moved in direction of Wolf's Mountain (or Red Hill), where the enemy had taken refuge. </p>
    <p> About 2 a. m. of the 3d, we were placed in position in rear of Steuart's brigade. At dawn we
      moved up to some breastworks, behind which lay Steuart's brigade, who were then skirmishing
      with the enemy. Remained here an hour or more; then ordered by Gen. Walker to the right, to
      relieve the Fourth Virginia, which had exhausted their ammunition. Advancing to the top of the
      hill in front of the enemy's works, we were engaged for over two hours. After having exhausted
      our ammunition, and used the cartridges of the killed and wounded, were relieved by Daniel's
      brigade. The brigade was then reformed. Moving to the right some 400 yards, relieved Gen.
      Nicholls' brigade, where we were hotly engaged for some three-quarters of an hour, under a
      murderous and enfilading fire. </p>
    <p> The line on the left began to give way, which was soon followed by the whole line. Falling
      back some 300 yards, reformed, and took position on the right of Jones' brigade, where we
      remained skirmishing with the enemy until 1 a. m. the 4th, when we fell back, and took
      position on the hills 1 mile westward of the town, the enemy being in too crippled a condition
      to follow. </p>
    <p> It is gratifying to state that the coolness, bravery, and determination displayed by both
      officers and men during this engagement have not been equaled by them on any of the
      hard-fought fields which have been marked by their dead. Their efforts not being crowned with </p>

    <p> the usual success, they retired stubbornly from the field, manifesting a willingness to hurl
      themselves upon the foe again, if so ordered. </p>
    <p> I regret the loss of Lieut. Jacob [H.] Keifer, who fell, mortally wounded. He was a gallant
      and efficient officer. His loss is felt throughout the command. </p>
    <p> Color-Sergeant Speck deserves mentioning for his gallantry throughout the engagement. </p>
    <p> The casualties were 3 killed, 42 wounded, and 11 missing.* </p>
    <p> Respectfully submitted. </p>
    <p> J. H. S. FUNK, <br/>Col. Fifth Virginia Infantry. </p>
    <p> Lieut. C. S. Arnall, <br/>Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
