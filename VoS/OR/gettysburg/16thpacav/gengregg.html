    <p> Reports of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division. </p>
    <p>Hdqrs. Second Division, Cavalry Corps, </p>
    <p>July 25, 1863. </p>
    <p> Col.: The First and Third Brigades, of the Second Division, Cavalry Corps, arrived on the
      battle-field at Gettysburg, July 2, about noon, the Second Brigade having been sent to
      Westminster. </p>
    <p> In compliance with orders from Maj.-Gen. Pleasonton, commanding the corps, I placed these
      brigades on the extreme right of our line of battle, and at the point of intersection of the
      Gettysburg and Hanover turnpike with the road which ran in rear of the right of our line of
      battle. A line of pickets was established in front, connecting with the right of the infantry
      line and extending well to the right of the turnpike. An attempt made to dislodge some of the
      enemy's sharpshooters posted in front of the center of my line caused the enemy to throw out
      two regiments deployed. This force advanced against my line, but was soon compelled to
      withdraw under the admonition of a half dozen well-directed shells and a telling carbine fire
      from behind a line of stone fence. </p>
    <p> On the morning of July 3, I was again ordered to take a position on the right of our line,
      and make a demonstration against the enemy. The First and Third Brigades were again posted on
      the right of the infantry, but about three-fourths of a mile nearer the Baltimore and
      Gettysburg turnpike. This position was taken because I learned that the First [Second]
      Brigade, of the Third Division, was occupying my position of the day before. A regiment was
      dismounted and put in the woods as skirmishers, but the enemy was not found in any
      considerable force. </p>
    <p> At 12 a.m. I received a copy of a dispatch from the commander of the Eleventh Army Corps to
      the major-general commanding the Army of the Potomac, that large columns of the enemy's
      cavalry were moving toward the right of our line. At the same time I received an order from
      Maj.-Gen. Pleasonton, through an aide-de-camp, to send the First [Second] Brigade, of the
      Third Division, to join Gen. Kilpatrick on the left. The First Brigade of my division was sent
      to relieve the brigade of the Third Division. This change having been made, a strong line of
      skirmishers displayed by the enemy was evidence that the enemy's cavalry had gained our right,
      and were about to attack, with the view of gaining the rear of our line of battle. The
      importance of successfully resisting an attack at this point, which, if succeeded in by the
      enemy, would have been productive of the most serious consequences, determined me to retain
      the brigade of the Third Division until the enemy were driven back. Gen. Custer, commanding
      the brigade, fully satisfied of the intended attack, was well pleased to remain with his
      brigade. The First New Jersey Cavalry was posted as mounted skirmishers to the right and front
      in a wood, the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry deployed as dismounted skirmishers to the left and
      front in open fields, and </p>

      Serial No. 43.] </p>
    <p> the First Maryland on the Hanover turnpike, in position to protect the right of my line. </p>
    <p> The very superior force of dismounted skirmishers of the enemy advanced on our left and
      front required the line to be re-enforced by one of Gen. Custer's regiments. At this time the
      skirmishing became very brisk on both sides, and an artillery fire was begun by the enemy and
      ourselves. During the skirmish of the dismounted men, the enemy brought upon the field a
      column for a charge. The charge of this column was met by the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, of the
      First [Second] Brigade, Third Division, but not successfully. The advantage gained in this
      charge was soon wrested from the enemy by the gallant charge of the First Michigan, of the
      same brigade. This regiment drove the enemy back to his starting point. Other charges were
      made by the enemy's columns, but in every instance were they driven back. Defeated at every
      point, the enemy withdrew to his left, and on passing the wood in which the First New Jersey
      Cavalry was posted, that regiment gallantly and successfully charged the flank of his column.
      Heavy skirmishing was still maintained by the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry with the enemy, and
      was continued until nightfall. During the engagement, a portion of this regiment made a very
      handsome and successful charge upon one of the enemy's regiments. The enemy retired his column
      behind his artillery, and at dark withdrew from his former position. At this time I was at
      liberty to relieve the First [Second] Brigade of the Third Division, which was directed to
      join its division. </p>
    <p> Our own and the enemy's loss during this engagement was severe. Our loss: Offcers, 1 killed,
      17 wounded, and 1 missing; enlisted men, 33 killed, 140 wounded, and 103 missing.* </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 4th, I advanced to the enemy's position, but found him gone. Following
      toward Hunterstown, I found many of his wounded abandoned. From these we learned that the
      enemy had been severely punished and his loss heavy. One general officer was severely wounded </p>
    <p> Brig.-Gen. Custer, commanding First [Second] Brigade, Third Division, very ably assisted me
      in the duties of my command. Col. J. B. McIntosh, commanding First Brigade of my division,
      handled his brigade with great skill, and deserves particular mention for his gallantry and
      untiring energy throughout the day. The Third Brigade, Second Division, Col. J. Irvin Gregg
      commanding, was held in reserve upon the field. The batteries commanded by Capt. A. M. Randor
      and Lieut. A. C. M. Pennington, jr., rendered most effective service. The fire of the
      artillery during this engagement was the most accurate that I have ever seen. </p>
    <p> It gives me great pleasure to bring to the notice of the major- general commanding the
      efficiency and gallantry exhibited by my entire staff on this occasion. </p>
    <p> A list of casualties of this engagement has heretofore been forwarded, and will again be
      found in a consolidated list.+ </p>
    <p> I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> D. McM. GREGG, <br/>Brig. Gen. of Volunteers, Comdg. Second Division. </p>
    <p> Lieut. Col. A. J. Alexander, A. A. G., Cavalry Corps. </p>
