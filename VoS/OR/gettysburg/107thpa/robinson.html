    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division. </p>
    <p> Hdqrs. Second Division, First Army Corps, </p>
    <p>July 18, 1863. </p>
    <p> Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this division in
      the engagements of the 1st, 2d, and 3d instant: </p>
    <p> On the morning of Wednesday, the 1st, the division marched from Emmitsburg, bringing up the
      rear of the column, and when about 3 miles from Gettysburg, hearing firing in front, it was
      pushed rapidly forward, and, arriving on the field, was placed, by order of the major- general
      commanding First Corps, in reserve, near the seminary. Almost immediately after taking this
      position, I received notice that the enemy was advancing a heavy column of infantry on the
      right of our line of battle, when I sent the Second Brigade, under Brig.-Gen. Baxter, to meet
      it. Orders being received at this time to hold the seminary, the First Brigade, under
      Brig.-Gen. Paul, was set at work to intrench the ridge on which it is situated. I then rode to
      the right of the line, to superintend the operations there. On my arrival, I found my Second
      Brigade so placed as to cover our right flank, but with too great an interval between it and
      the line of the First Division. I at once directed Gen. Baxter to change front forward on his
      left battalion, and to close this interval, toward which the enemy was making his way. By the
      time this change was effected, the whole front of the brigade became hotly engaged, but
      succeeded in repulsing the attack. The enemy, however, soon after brought up fresh forces in
      increased masses, when, finding the position so seriously threatened, I sent for and brought
      up the First Brigade, and placed part of it in the position first occupied by Baxter's
      brigade, and the remaining battalions as a support to his second position. The enemy now made
      repeated attacks on the division, in all of which he was handsomely repulsed, with the loss of
      three flags and about 1,000 prisoners. </p>

      Reports. Serial No. 43.] </p>
    <p> In one of these attacks I was deprived of the services of the veteran commander of the First
      Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Paul, who fell, severely wounded, while gallantly directing and
      encouraging his command. </p>
    <p> The division held this position on the right--receiving and repelling the fierce attacks of
      a greatly superior force, not only in front, but on the flank, and, when the enemy's ranks
      were broken, charging upon him and capturing his colors and men--from about noon until nearly
      5 p. m., when I received orders to withdraw. These orders not being received until all other
      troops (except Stewart's battery) had commenced moving to the rear, the division held its
      ground until outflanked right and left, and retired fighting. </p>
    <p> From the nature of the enemy's attacks, frequent changes were rendered necessary, and they
      were made promptly under a galling fire. No soldiers ever fought better, or inflicted severer
      blows upon the enemy. When out of ammunition, their boxes were replenished from those of their
      killed and wounded comrades. </p>
    <p> The instances of distinguished gallantry are too numerous to be embodied in this report, and
      I leave it to the brigade and regimental commanders to do justice to those under their
      immediate command. Where all did so well, it is difficult to discriminate. As, however, they
      came under my personal observation, I cheerfully indorse the remarks of Gen. Baxter in
      commendation of Col. Coulter, Eleventh Pennsylvania; Col. Wheelock, Ninety-seventh New York;
      Col. Lyle, Ninetieth Pennsylvania; Col. Bates and Lieut.-Col. Allen, Twelfth Massachusetts;
      Lieut.-Col. Moesch, Eighty-third New York, and Maj. Foust, Eighty-eighth Pennsylvania. </p>
    <p> After the fall of Gen. Paul, the command of the First Brigade devolved successively upon
      Col. Leonard, Thirteenth Massachusetts, Col. Root, Ninety-fourth New York, and Col. Coulter,
      Eleventh Pennsylvania, all of whom were wounded while exercising the command. </p>
    <p> After withdrawing from this contest, I took up a position on a ridge to the left of the
      cemetery, facing the Emmitsburg road, and remained there until afternoon of the next day, when
      I was relieved by a division of the Second Corps, and ordered to the support of the Eleventh
      Corps. In the evening, I was ordered to the left of our line, but was soon after directed to
      return. </p>
    <p> On Friday morning, 3d instant, the division was massed, and held ready to push forward to
      the support of the Twelfth Corps, then engaged with the enemy on our right. </p>
    <p> About noon, I was informed by the major-general commanding the army that he anticipated an
      attack on the cemetery by the enemy's forces massed in the town, and was directed to so place
      my command that if our line gave way I could attack the enemy on his flank. I proceeded to
      make this change of position at the moment the enemy commenced the terrific artillery fire of
      that day. Never before were troops so exposed to such a fire of shot and shell, and yet the
      movement was made in perfect order and with little loss. </p>
    <p> Later in the day, the enemy having made his attack on our left instead of the center, I was
      ordered to the right of the Second Corps, which position I held until Sunday, when the line
      was withdrawn. </p>
    <p> My thanks are due to Brig.-Gen.'s Baxter and Paul for the able and zealous manner in which
      they handled their brigades. The </p>

    <p> officers of my staff were actively engaged during the whole of the three days' engagements.
      Lieut. [Samuel M.] Morgan, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieut. [Frederick M.] Hallock,
      aide-de-camp, and Lieut.'s Bratton and Mead, acting aides, were at all times distinguished for
      their gallantry and good conduct. Capt. [John G.] Hovey, acting assistant inspector-general,
      was wounded and taken from the field early in the fight. Lieut. Smith, ordnance officer, was
      diligent in the performance of his duty, and collected and turned in 2,251 muskets and a large
      number of equipments. </p>
    <p> It affords me pleasure to call special attention to the gallant conduct of one of my
      orderlies, Sergt. Ebenezer S. Johnson, First Maine Cavalry, whose chevrons should be exchanged
      for the epaulette. When we make officers of such men, the soldier receives his true reward and
      the service great benefit. </p>
    <p> This division went into battle with less than 2,500 officers and men, and sustained a loss
      of 1,667, of which 124 were commissioned officers. </p>
    <p> I transmit herewith a nominal and tabular statement of casualties, showing the loss of each
      regiment.* </p>
    <p> Very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> JNO. C. ROBINSON, <br/> Brig.-Gen., Comdg. Division. </p>
    <p> The Assistant Adjutant-Gen., <br/>First Army Corps. </p>
    <p> ADDENDA. </p>
    <p> Hdqrs. Second Division, First Army Corps, <br/> November 15, 1863. <br/>Maj. Gen. George G.
      Meade, <br/>Comdg. Army of the Potomac: </p>
    <p> Gen.: I feel it is my duty to inform you of the intense mortification and disappointment
      felt by my division in reading your report of the battle of Gettysburg. </p>
    <p> For nearly four hours on July 1 we were hotly engaged against overwhelming numbers, repulsed
      repeated attacks of the enemy, captured three flags and a very large number of prisoners, and
      were the last to leave the field. </p>
    <p> The division formed the right of the line of battle of the First Corps, and during the whole
      time had to fight the enemy in front and protect our right flank (the division of the Eleventh
      Corps being at no time less than half a mile in rear). We went into action with less than
      2,500 men and lost considerably more than half our number. </p>
    <p> We have been proud of our efforts on that day, and hoped that they would be recognized. It
      is but natural we should feel disappointed that we are not once referred to in the report of
      the commanding general. </p>
    <p> Trusting that you will investigate this matter and give us due credit, I am, general, very
      respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p>JNO. C. ROBINSON, <br/>Brig.-Gen., Comdg. Division. </p>
