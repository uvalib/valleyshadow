  <p>Reports of Maj. Gen. John Newton, U. S. Army, commanding First Army Corps.</p>

  <p>Hdqrs. First Army Corps,</p>

  <p>September 30, 1863.</p>

  <p>Gen.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this corps at the battle of Gettysburg and subsequently, until its arrival at Warrenton Junction:</p>

  <p>July 1.--The operations of this day are fully set forth in Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's report, who commanded the corps in the bloody and important battle which inaugurated the three days' fighting at Gettysburg.</p>

  <p>CHAP. XXXIX.] THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN. PAGE 261-43 [Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43.]</p>

  <p>July 2.--In obedience to an order from Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac, dated July 1, I reported in person to the general commanding, at the cemetery gate, early in the morning of this day, and assumed command of the First Corps. I found the First Division (Brig.- Gen. Wadsworth) occupying the high wooded hill and slopes immediately on the right of Gen. Howard's position on Cemetery Hill, an important position, from which it was not detached during the subsequent operations at Gettysburg. Maj.-Gen. Doubleday's (Third) division was in reserve behind the Eleventh Corps on Cemetery Hill. Brig.-Gen. Robinson's (Second) division was likewise posted on the Cemetery Hill, but on the left of the Eleventh Corps, and facing to the left in the position afterward occupied by the Second Corps. The artillery of the corps, except one battery with the First Division, was posted on Cemetery Hill, and was not detached from this position during all the subsequent fighting. Beyond an occasional shot at the moving columns of the enemy, everything remained quiet until the afternoon, when the enemy opened a brisk cannonade on my position, which was vigorously and effectively returned.</p>

  <p>Near sundown I was summoned to move my troops in haste to fill a gap in the line on the left of the Second Corps, into which the enemy was on the point of entering. Notwithstanding the inconvenient positions of the Second and Third Divisions, these were quickly filed into the new position in time to stay the progress of the enemy, who relinquished their attempt on our appearance. I was deeply gratified at the promptitude with which these divisions moved at this critical period, their movement not consuming one-half the time it would have taken on drill. During this movement, the right wing of the Thirteenth Vermont, under Col. Randall, charged upon the enemy, retook four of our guns, and captured two guns and 80 prisoners from them. Two more of our guns were retaken by the Second Brigade, Third Division.</p>

  <p>Night coming on, and active operations closing here for the day, parties were sent to the front to bring in such guns as had been left. They were successful to some extent, but the number thus reclaimed has never been reported. The Second Division was sent back to Cemetery Hill, to support the Eleventh Corps, which was threatened by the enemy. The First Division was vigorously attacked about sundown by the enemy, who were handsomely repulsed. One brigade of the Twelfth Corps, on their right, participated in this action. The position of the Eleventh Corps was attacked about the same time, the enemy succeeding in some instances in getting into the batteries, from which they were driven by the cannoneers themselves.</p>

  <p>July 3.--The dawn of day found the position of the First Corps as follows: The First Division as before reported; the Second Division on Cemetery Hill, ready to support the Eleventh Corps or the Second Corps; the Third Division on the left center and adjoining the left of Gen. Hancock's position. Between the left of the Third Division and Gen. Sykes' position on the left (an interval by my estimate of over half a mile), there were no troops in position. I reported this fact immediately to the general commanding, who authorized me to go to Gen. Sedgwick, on the extreme left, and obtain troops from him to fill this gap. While proceeding on this mission, I encountered Caldwell's division, of the Second Corps, not then forming part of Gen. Hancock's line of battle, and with this officer's consent I put it in position on the left of the Third Division,</p>

  <p>PAGE 262-43 N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., PA., ETC. [CHAP. XXXIX. [Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43.]</p>

  <p>First Corps. Gen. Sedgwick could only spare me the First New Jersey brigade (Gen. Torbert), which was placed in position on the left of Gen. Caldwell. My own batteries, occupying important positions in the center and right center, might not with propriety be removed, and I therefore applied and obtained permission to call upon the Artillery Reserve for batteries.</p>

  <p>By about 12 o'clock I considered my line between the left of Gen. Hancock's and the right of Gen. Sykes' as very secure, having in position the infantry above mentioned, batteries from the Artillery Reserve, from the Third Corps, and one battery from the Sixth Corps.</p>

  <p>I must mention that the Third Corps, under Maj.-Gen. Birney, which had suffered severely in the previous day's fight, I found posted directly in rear of my line of battle, and I made arrangements with Gen. Birney to draw upon him for such support as might be needed; and I take advantage of this opportunity to express my obligations for the cheerful and handsome manner in which he responded to every call made upon him.</p>

  <p>Near 1 p. m. the enemy opened with about one hundred and twenty guns upon the position of the army, and kept up an incessant fire for a long period. This was intended to demoralize our troops and to cover the onset of their assaulting columns. They failed in their first object, our troops sustaining this terrific fire with admirable equanimity. At length their columns of attack began to move; one heavy column, a division, by Gen. Stannard's report, marching by battalion front, directed itself upon the front of the Third (Doubleday's) Division, First Corps, but meeting with a warm fire from his front line of battle, composed of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth Vermont Regt.'s, the Twentieth New York State Militia, and the One hundred and fifty-first Pennsylvania Volunteers, swerved to the right to attack Gen. Hancock. Gen. Stannard immediately changed front forward, and, falling upon their flank, routed them, ttaking a large number of prisoners. This had hardly been done, when another column, attempting the left of Gen. Doubleday's front, was attacked in flank in a similar way and nearly the whole column killed, wounded, or captured. For these brilliant episodes of the battle, I respectfully call the attention of the general commanding to the reports of Maj.-Gen. Doubleday and Brig.-Gen. Stannard.</p>

  <p>I wish to call particular attention to the conduct of the regiments above mentioned, and to the skillful manner in which they were handled on this day, as being greatly instrumental in overthrowing the enemy's grand attack and in gaining for us a glorious victory. Brig.-Gen. Stannard, who was wounded the day before, refused to quit the field, and highly distinguished himself by his coolness and skill. Maj.-Gen. Doubleday narrowly escaped with his life, having suffered a severe contusion from a fragment of a shell.</p>

  <p>With the first movement of the assaulting column of the enemy, I called upon Gen. Birney for troops to form a reserve, first for one and subsequently for another division, which were promptly sent. With a portion of these troops I re-enforced Gen. Hancock, who was severely pressed by heavy masses of the enemy, holding the remainder in readiness to fall upon the enemy should they succeed in penetrating our lines--a contingency which fortunately did not occur. The Second Division, under Gen. Robinson, was moved to sustain Gen. Hancock's right, but did not become engaged. The First Division was also not engaged. The batteries of the corps, in</p>

  <p>CHAP. XXXIX.] THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN. PAGE 263-43 [Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43.]</p>

  <p>common with the other batteries in position, vigorously and effectively replied to the enemy's cannonading on this day. After the repulse of the enemy's attack (Gen. Hancock having been wounded), I was placed in command of the line connecting Gen. Sykes with Gen. Howard.</p>

  <p>I conclude this report of the battle of Gettysburg by paying my tribute to the gallant and efficient conduct of the staff: Capt. Craig W. Wadsworth, additional aide-de-camp; Capt. John S. Bliss, Sixty-seventh New York Volunteers, aide-de-camp, severely wounded; Lieut. H. W. Jackson, Fourth New Jersey Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Lieut. Col. H. C. Bankhead, assistant inspector-general; Lieut.-Col. Sanderson, commissary of subsistence, and First Lieut. H. C. Egbert, Twelfth U. S. Infantry, commissary of musters. Col. Wainwright, the chief of artillery of the corps; Capt. Stevens, Fifth Maine Battery; Capt. Reynolds, Battery L, First New York Artillery; Capt. Cooper, Battery B, First Pennsylvania; Capt. Hall, Second Maine Battery, and Lieut. Stewart, Battery B, Fourth U. S. Artillery, all displayed the greatest gallantry throughout the engagements of the three days.</p>

  <p>Surg. J. Theodore Heard, medical director, and Surg. T. H. Bache, medical inspector, remained in the town of Gettysburg during its occupation by the enemy, and deserve the highest praise for their zealous and unremitting attention to the wounded.</p>

  <p>July 4, the troops maintained the same position. The day was devoted to collecting and caring for the wounded.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JOHN NEWTON,<br />
  Maj.-Gen., Comdg.</p>

  <p>Brig. Gen. S. Williams, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
