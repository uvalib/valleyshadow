  <p>Report of Lieut. Col. James MacThomson, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Infantry. </p>
  <p>Hdqrs. 107th Pennsylvania Volunteers, </p>
  <p>July 10, 1863. </p>
  <p>Lieut.: I have the honor to submit the following necessarily short report of the part the
   regiment under my command took in the engagement of July 1: </p>
  <p>Went into the fight at about 1 p. m., with 230 guns and 25 commissioned officers, the men
   loading as they walked. Were in action about two hours. Captured more prisoners than the regiment
   numbered. I regret to report the loss of large numbers of most excellent soldiers. </p>
  <p>The casualties are, as far as ascertained, as follows: Field officers, lieutenant-colonel
   slightly, major severely, wounded; 3 commissioned officers known to be wounded, and 6
   commissioned officers missing; 11 enlisted men known to be killed, 48 known to be wounded, and 93
   missing. </p>
  <p>Men could not have fought better than these men, and I am gratified to say that not a single
   exhibition of cowardice of either officers or men was observed during the whole engagement. </p>
  <p>Respectfully submitted. </p>
  <p>With much respect, I am, lieutenant, your most obedient servant, </p>
  <p>JAMES MacTHOMSON, </p>
  <p>Lieut.-Col., Comdg. 107th Pennsylvania Volunteers. </p>
  <p>Lieut. Small, A. A. A. G., First Brig., Second Div., First Army Corps. <br/>&nbsp;
