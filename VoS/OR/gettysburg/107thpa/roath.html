  <p>No. 51.</p>

  <p>Report of Capt. Emanuel D. Roath, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Infantry.</p>

  <p>Rappahannock, Va.,</p>

  <p>August 15, 1863.</p>

  <p>Capt.: I have the honor to submit the following report, as per orders from brigade headquarters, from June 28 to July 22, inclusive, viz:</p>

  <p>... CHAP. XXXIX.] THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN. PAGE 305-43 [Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43.]</p>

  <p>The following is the report of Lieut. Col. J. MacThomson, of the One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, during the action of July 1, at Gettysburg, he being in command up to that time, viz:*</p>

  <p>July 1.--After the engagement, we fell back to the left of Cemetery Hill, and threw up strong breastworks, which we occupied until next morning.</p>

  <p>July 2.--During the forenoon we were relieved by the Third Division, Second Corps, and taken a few hundred yards in the rear to support a battery. We lay on our arms until about 6.30 p. m., when we were marched to the left, toward the Round Top, under a heavy and effective fire, to assist in driving the rebel hordes back in the famous charge of the second day of the fight. After the charge, we marched back to near the cemetery, and were ordered to lay in rear of a stone fence, being a protection for the men from the enemy's sharpshooters in our front.</p>

  <p>Our casualties during the second day were 1 commissioned officer and several men wounded. Our strength was about 78 guns and 12 commissioned officers.</p>

  <p>July 3.--At 4.30 a. m. we were posted in the rear of Cemetery Hill, in support of the batteries stationed on that point, remaining in that position until 1.30 p. m., when the enemy opened upon us with a heavy and furious artillery fire. Our division was moved to the right of Cemetery Hill, at the same time lying under two direct fires of the enemy's sharpshooters and one battery. The strife became terrific and the artillery firing terrible. At this crisis our services were required to support the batteries, when the regiment was marched with others along the crest or brow of the hill in rear of the batteries, through the most deadly fire ever man passed through, it appearing as though every portion of the atmosphere contained a deadly missile.</p>

  <p>After our services were no longer needed to support the batteries, the division to which my regiment was attached was moved to the left of Cemetery Hill, to participate in crowning our arms with the glorious victory achieved that day.</p>

  <p>My strength was about 72 guns and 11 commissioned officers. Casualties, 2 commissioned officers wounded; 1 private killed and several slightly wounded. The day being very hot, 3 of my men were carried insensible from the field on account of the intense heat.</p>

  <p>After resting a few hours, we sent out a line of skirmishers to the front, and threw up breastworks to protect the men in our position, where we remained for the night.</p>

  <p>July 4.--We lay all day in the position of the previous night and strengthened it; did some skirmishing with the enemy's sharpshooters; had no casualties.</p>

  <p>It is proper here for me to state that the officers and men displayed great gallantry and determination throughout all the engagements of the previous days, and are entitled to the praise and gratitude of a free and loyal people.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

  <p>I am, captain, with much respect, your most obedient servant,</p>

  <p>E. D. ROATH,</p>

  <p>Capt., Comdg. One hundred and seventh Pa. Vols.</p>

  <p>Capt. Byron Porter,</p>

  <p>Asst. Adjt. Gen., First Brig., Second Div., First Army Corps.</p>
