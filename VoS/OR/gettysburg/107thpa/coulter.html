    <p> Reports of Col. Richard Coulter, Eleventh Pennsylvania Infantry, commanding regiment and
      First Brigade. </p>
    <p> Baltimore, Md., </p>
    <p>July 9, 1863. </p>
    <p> Sir: The following is a report of the part taken by the First Brigade in the engagements
      with the enemy, from the 1st to the 4th instant, at Gettysburg, Pa.: </p>
    <p> My regiment was transferred from the Second to the First Brigade about 5 p. m. on the 1st
      instant, when the division was formed in the cemetery. I was directed to assume command on
      account of the disability of Gen. Paul and loss of other field officers. I can, therefore,
      state but little of the part taken in the engagement of the earlier part of the day on the
      west side of the town, excepting what is contained in the reports of the several regimental
      commanders, which accompany and are made part of this report. </p>
    <p> In the action, this brigade was formed on the left of the Second Brigade and right of the
      First Division, and was engaged until 3 p. m., when a part was moved to the right, to relieve
      the Second Brigade, their ammunition being exhausted. Both flanks of the corps in the meantime
      having been turned by the enemy, this brigade retired, with the residue of the division, under
      a very destructive fire, along the railroad embankment and through the town to the cemetery,
      where the division was reformed about 5 p. m. Here, as before stated, I assumed command. </p>
    <p> Later in the evening, moved toward the left, and took position on the left of the Eleventh
      Corps, and, having built breastworks of such materials as were at hand, remained there in
      support of the batteries at that point until relieved by the Third Division, Second Corps,
      about noon next day. </p>
    <p> _________ <br/>* See revised statement, p. 173. </p>

      Reports. Serial No. 43.] </p>
    <p> About 7 o'clock in the evening were moved farther to the left, to support the operations of
      the Third Corps, in which we were subjected to a considerable artillery fire, with some loss;
      which duty being accomplished, we returned. </p>
    <p> About 10 p. m. were placed in position on the Emmitsburg and Gettysburg road and in front of
      the cemetery, to support a portion of the Eleventh Corps, from which duty we were relieved at
      daylight on the 3d. </p>
    <p> About 2 p. m. of the 3d, the artillery fire becoming heavy and general along the line, the
      brigade was moved quickly to the right, to the support of Capt. Ricketts' and other batteries
      operating on the right of the cemetery. Here we remained about an hour, and were exposed to
      both the front and rear fire of artillery and the enemy's skirmishers. When about to move on
      return to the left, I was wounded and temporarily disabled, and the command was transferred to
      Col. Lyle, of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteer Regt. I remained with the brigade, however,
      and soon after resumed the command. </p>
    <p> About 3 p. m. moved rapidly to the left, under a severe fire, to the support of the Second
      Corps, upon which the enemy appeared to have concentrated their attack, and took position in
      support of a battery on the right of the Third Division, Second Corps. Brisk skirmishing was
      kept up with considerable loss on both sides until 9 p. m. About 11 p. m., it being
      ascertained that the enemy were removing the fences within reach, either for the purpose of
      making defense against attack or of opening the way, the breastworks in our front were much
      strengthened by the addition of stone and timber, the brigade working almost the entire night. </p>
    <p> No change was made on the 4th. The skirmishing was continued with some loss. </p>
    <p>The following table gives the loss each day:</p>

    <p> This table does not include the loss of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers on the 1st
      instant, it being then attached to the Second Brigade, and its loss being accounted for with
      that brigade. Many reported missing, it has been since ascertained, were killed or wounded.
      Some were recovered on re-entering the town, and the residue are in the hands of the enemy. </p>
    <p> The conduct of officers and men, so far as they came under my observation, was in every way
      creditable. </p>
    <p> Three officers of Gen. Paul's staff being reported among the missing, I selected Adjt. A. R.
