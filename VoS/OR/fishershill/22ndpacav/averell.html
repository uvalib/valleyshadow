  <p>At 5 o'clock on the morning of the 20th, pursuant to instructions received from the chief of cavalry, I marched my division by the Middle</p>

  <p>road to Cedar Creek, the advance driving the enemy's pickets four miles beyond and forming a junction with the pickets of Torbert's cavalry on the Strasburg pike. Rations and forage were brought up and issued. On the 21st moved, at 5 a.m., to Lebanon Church, where I awaited orders until 7.45 a.m. Merritt's division was withdrawn from my left, and I was left alone, with instructions to move on the Middle and Back roads until stopped by a superior force of the enemy, keeping up my connection with the right of the infantry line. As there is but one road besides the pike leading by Fisher's Hill, with the exception of some blind lanes, I moved along the Back road and across the country, driving the enemy's outposts until a line of rail and earth breast-works was reached, behind which the enemy had a strong line of infantry or dismounted men. I informed the major-general commanding that cavalry could not carry the position without co-operative movements of infantry, and that an infantry corps, by hugging the base of the North Mountain, might break around the enemy's left and render his position untenable. The major-general commanding inspected the line in person and directed me to keep up a strong show of cavalry before it, which was done until the ensuing morning, when I pressed it as closely as possible with dismounted men. About 3 p.m. of the 22d a division of the Sixth Corps attacked on the left of my immediate front, enabling me to carry the line, after which the enemy was driven by my division about a mile into his main works. Gen. Crook's command passed along my rear through a ravine to my right and assaulted the enemy's extreme left in conjunction with one of my brigades, which leaped the works and scattered the enemy in wild confusion, pursuing the fugitives seven miles up the Valley, while Crook's command passed toward the center. The country was only practicable for cavalry along the Back road; toward the center of the enemy's position it is broken and wooded. The guerrillas were busy with Crook's rear, picking up his stragglers, and my remaining brigade protected it, pursuant to a request from Maj.-Gen. Crook, to whom I had been directed to report, and guarded our own and the captured artillery, collecting prisoners and property. The Second Brigade captured 110 prisoners, 175 horses, 14 wagons, 8 ambulances, 4 guns, 4 caissons, and 2 battle-flags. This report is made from the verbal reports received at the time. The division was not entirely assembled at midnight. The sounds of battle had died away on my left and rear with daylight, and a darkness succeeded through which it was difficult to find the way. Trains of ambulances, ammunition wagons, with guards and stragglers, were constantly coming up, requiring directions as to their destination. No information was received from the left and no instructions came from the major-general commanding or any one else. A staff officer, who had been sent to obtain information, returned and reported the operations on the left concluded and the army at a halt.</p>

  <p>At daylight the ensuing morning I pushed on over a rough country road, sending scouting parties out to the left to communicate with the troops on the pike. Lieut. Wakefield returned with one of these parties when I was within six miles of Woodstock, and reported the army was four miles behind. A staff officer sent to Maj.-Gen. Crook returned with the message that I "had done exactly right," and if no orders had yet been received by me to move on. The road was so hilly and indirect that I was delayed, so that upon my arrival at Woodstock I found the major-general commanding already there. Calling upon him, he informed me that I had made a mistake in not</p>

  <p>pursuing the enemy the night before. He did not ask if I had pursued him or seem to care about knowing what had occupied me. I replied that I had received no information or instructions from him. He stated that he could not find me. I asked him if he had tried, to which he made no reply, but stated that the rebel army was a perfect mob, which would run away upon the firing of a single gun, and that he desired me to go and put in my cavalry. I assured him that I had never hesitated to put it in when there was any chance for success. The tone, manner, and words of the major-general, commanding indicated and implied dissatisfaction. I did not entertain the opinion that the rebel army was a mob. The loss of his guns at Fisher's Hill had been the result of the flank movement, but his loss in men had been inconsiderable, and his troops had been too well handled and his stragglers too few to justify in my mind an opinion that he was totally demoralized. I proceeded along the pike as rapidly as possible to within two miles of Mount Jackson, where I found the brigade of Gen. Devin engaged with a superior force of the enemy. Putting my division in action, the enemy was driven beyond the town. Maj. Lady and several prisoners were captured. On the heights beyond the village the army of the enemy could be plainly seen in bivouac, while a division of his infantry marched down and engaged me, opening five pieces of artillery. The position, naturally strong, had been strengthened by article defenses. The enemy was fully on the alert and perfectly able to hold the position against five times my force, and a signal officer reported to me that the enemy was moving a brigade or division around my right. My left rested on the river, and in my rear was an almost impassable creek, across which a detail from my division built a bridge, used by the army the next morning. I held my position until dark, reporting the strength and position of the enemy to the major-general commanding. Placing a strong picket-line close to the enemy, I moved my command across the creek in rear, where water and forage, could be obtained, and where the command could rest securely until morning, as they had had but little forage for two days. At 11 p.m. I received the note marked I from the major-general commanding; shortly after the order marked K, relieving me from duty with my division.</p>

  <p>I have in the above report introduced some details which would have been excluded were it not for the peculiar circumstances under which it is written. An officer who has served the Government nine years, who was suffered from wounds in battle, cannot without any assigned cause or pretext be suddenly relieved from the command of a division whose record tells of nothing but success and victories without having his sensibilities outraged and his reputation jeopardized. It is natural that the War Department should ask the wherefore for such action, and it is proper that I should state as explicitly as possible the reasons so far as known to me. I have evidence that it was determined to relieve me in order to make Brig.-Gen. Torbert chief of cavalry before Maj.-Gen. Sheridan assumed command of the Middle Military Division. My success at Moorefield, achieved with an exhausted division against twice its numbers, probably caused a hesitation in my removal. The note of Maj.-Gen. Sheridan, dated August 20, exhibits readiness to avail himself of any pretext to censure me, and his reply to my explanation shows how completely his purpose was battled. Maj.-Gen. Sheridan illegally assumed the prerogative of the President of the United States and ordered me to report to a</p>

  <p>junior officer on the 23d of August without any just cause. While I had the entire country on the right flank of the army to guard up to the 19th September and had the orders of the major-general commanding to attack the enemy whenever I had an opportunity, my successes were barely mentioned, my activity was covertly censured and an unjust impression was permitted to rest in the mind of the Gen.-in-Chief to the extent of causing him to send an optional order for my relief. It was, I believe, admitted on the 19th of September, on both sides, that our cavalry attack was the key to the victory which we won, and I think it was obvious that the success of that attack, as to time and place, was mainly attributable to the exertions of my division, yet although I was the ranking officer of cavalry making the attack the mention of my name in the dispatches was studiously avoided. Finally, the angry and discourteous note of the 23d was addressed to me to give the pretext implied therein a quasi establishment in history, and before time was given me to reply the order was issued which, trampling upon my record and upon all military courtesy and justice, consigned me to the ignominy of idleness.</p>

  <p>I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
