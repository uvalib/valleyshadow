  <p>the day the Third Division (Brig.-Gen. Wilson) fought gallantly, doing wonders, driving a division of rebel infantry from different positions, and clearing he way for our infantry to form. On this occasion Brig.-Gen. McIntosh, commanding Second [First] Brigade, Third Division, suffered the loss of a leg, and Brig.-Gen. Chapman, commanding First [Second] Brigade of same division, was slightly wounded. No one could have acted with more coolness and gallantry than did Brig.-Gen. Merritt, Wilson, Custer, McIntosh, Chapman, and Brevet Brig.-Gen. Devin and Col. Lowell. Too much praise cannot be given the cavalry for the active part they played on this memorable occasion. At daylight on the 20th the army started in pursuit of the rebel army, Brig.-Gen. Averell's division of Merritt on the Valley pike to Cedra Creek, and Brig.-Gen. Wilson, via Stephensburg and Cedarville, on the Front Royal pike. The enemy were overtaken posted in a strong position at Fisher's Hill above Straburg, Va. The infantry coming up relieved the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt), in front of the enemy, and this division was then placed on the right of the infantry near Strasburg. Brig.-Gen. Averell's division was moved across Cedar Creek, and placed on the right of Brig.-Gen. Merritt's division on the Back road.</p>
