    <p> Reports of Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright, U. S. Army, commanding Sixth Army Corps, of
      operations. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. SIXTH ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> October 18, 1864. </p>
    <p>COL.: I have the honor to present the following report of the part taken by this corps in the
      battle at Fisher's Hill on the 22d of September, including the operations of the preceding
      day, which wee preliminary thereto: </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 20th of September the Sixth Corps moved about daylight from Winchester
      for Strasburg, taking the left of the pike, the Nineteenth Corps, Maj.-Gen. Emory commanding,
      taking the right. Following the line of the pike, this corps crossed Cedar Creek, taking
      position on the right overlooking Strasburg, while the Nineteenth was posted on the left,
      extending nearly to the road from Strasburg to Front Royal, which was covered by a detached
      force from Gen. Emory's command. Early on the 21st, the Nineteenth Corps having been thrown
      forward with its left at the old fort near Strasbrug, I move the Sixth Corps to the right,
      and, passing the Nineteenth, drove off the enemy's skirmishers and took position in front of
      the rebel entrenchments of Fisher's Hill. Soon after establishing the line--which was formed
      in the order from left to right of the First, Second, and part of the Third Divisions, the
      remainder of the latter being in reserve--I went to the right in company with Maj.-Gen.
      Sheridan, and found the enemy in possession of a position to the right and front which it was
      desirable to obtain, and which was strongly held by him. Three regiments, two from the Third
      and one from the Second Division, were sent to take it, but without success, when the
      remainder of the First Brigade, Second Division--to which one of these regiments belonged--was
      ordered to carry it. It was done in the most gallant manner, Col. J. M. Warner, Eleventh
      Vermont (First Vermont Heavy Artillery), commanding the attacking force. This movement was of
      the greatest importance to the operations of the next day, as it gave us a view of the enemy's
      line and afforded excellent positions for artillery, of which we availed ourselves in the more
      important struggle of the 22d. Having secured this commanding point, the corps was at once
      moved forward and to the right to occupy it, a movement which, in the darkness, and owing to
      the intricacies of the ground, cut up by ravines and covered by dense woods, took nearly all
      night to accomplish. This movement of the Sixth Corps occasioned a corresponding one on the
      part of the Nineteenth, which was accomplished early the next morning. In the meanwhile the
      troops had intrench themselves and the position was secure and the artillery had been brought
      forward. </p>
    <p> CHAP. LV.] THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY CAMPAIGN. PAGE 153-90 [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports,
      Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] </p>
    <p> The plan of attack upon the enemy's line on the 22d was, that while the Army of West
      Virginia, acting as a movable force, was to advance far to our right to turn the enemy's left,
      t he two other corps should engage him in front, and to secure the success of this movement
      the enemy's skirmishers and sharpshooters, which almost turned our right, were to be driven
      back and the artillery on his left silenced. To effect this Ricketts' division was sent to the
      right with orders to drive off the skirmishers already spoken of, and then to advance to a
      designated position in front. In this movement Ricketts was to be accompanied by the cavalry
      command of Averell so as to permit Crook's infantry to advance around the right and turn the
      enemy's left unperceived. Ricketts' movement was an entire success. The three rifle batteries
      of the Sixth Corps were put in position and by their effective fire aided much in the success
      of the whole movement, firing not only on the enemy's batteries bearing upon Ricketts, but
      upon a battery farther to our right which was being used with much effect on Crook's advancing
      column. Soon after Ricketts had gained the designated position the other two divisions of the
      corps were advanced to within some 700 or 800 yards of the enemy's works. Orders were sent to
      Ricketts to assault as soon as Crook gained his flank, which he did in the most gallant and
      successful manner, while almost simultaneously the Second and First Divisions were moved on
      the enemy's works. The result was a complete success. The enemy was driven from his almost
      impregnable line in perfect disorder, prisoners and artillery falling into our hands, while
      his forces fled in the greatest disorder. Nothing but night saved his army from utter
      annihilation. Some of the positions assaulted by the corps were almost unassailable, the
      approaches being difficult to climb, and the works covered by abatis of no mean strength. Yet
      our men, flushed with the victory of the Opequon, disregarding all obstacles, and under a
      heavy fire of artillery and infantry, moved gallantly forward, carried the works, and pursued
      the enemy till after dark, when they were halted to adjust their lines broken up in the attack
      over ground almost impassable. After the deadly necessary to this formation of the lines the
      troops, though much exhausted, were pushed forward in pursuit, the Nineteenth Corps leading,
      and soon after daylight were halted beyond Woodstock for rest and refreshment. </p>
    <p> The annals of the war present, perhaps, no more glorious victory than this. The enemy's
      lines, chosen in an almost impregnable position, and fortified with much care, had been most
      gallantly carried by assault, capturing most of his artillery, a large number of prisoners,
      and sending his army "on the run," in the most disorderly manner; and all this from the
      impetuosity of the attack, with an absurdly small loss on our part. </p>
    <p> As at the battle of the Opequon three days before, all, both officers and men, behaved
      splendidly, and it is scarcely just to discriminate. As then, the division commanders, Gen.'s
      Ricketts, Getty, and Wheaton, distinguished themselves for the gallantry with which they
      fought their commands, and are entitled to the acknowledgments of the Government, as are the
      commanders of brigades and regiments, with numerous individual officers, for whose conduct on
      that day I refer with pleasure to the reports herewith. </p>
    <p> To my own staff I desire to express my acknowledgments, as heretofore, on many a well-fought
      field, they one and all did their duty gallantly and well regardless of danger. </p>
    <p> To the noble corps of the American army which I have the honor to command I desire to
      express my acknowledgments for their gallant </p>

    <p> conduct, both officers and men, in the battles of the 19th and 22d of September. As in the
      many fiercely contested struggles from the Rapidan to Petersburg, they have earned by their
      bravery, their successes, and their losses the gratitude of their country and the cause for
      which they have battled, and the approval of their fellow soldiers, side by side with whom
      they have fought. And their crowning achievements in the battles of the Valley will be looked
      upon with pride by each and every one of them, whose greatest glory will be the claim to have
      belonged to the Army of the Shenandoah. </p>
