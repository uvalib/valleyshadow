    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, U. S. Army, commanding Third Division. </p>
    <p> last mentioned the whole line advanced. As soon as we commenced to advance we were exposed
      to a heavy artillery fire from the enemy. Maj. Vredenburgh, commanding Fourteenth New Jersey
      Volunteers, who was charged with the direction of the line, and while bravely urging his
      troops onward was struck by a shell and instantly killed, his last words being, "Guide on me,
      boys; I will do the best I can." The division moved quickly forward for about one mile,
      passing Mr. Dinkle's house on the right of the pike and capturing almost all of the enemy in
      our immediate front. The Nineteenth Corps did not move and keep connection with my right, and
      the turnpike upon which the division was dressing bore to the left, causing a wide interval
      between the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps. As the lines advanced the interval became greater. The
      enemy discovering this fact, hurled a large body of men toward the interval and threatened to
      take my right in flank. Col. Keifer at once caused the One hundred and thirty-eighth and
      Sixth-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers and One hundred and tenth Ohio Regt. to break their
      connection with the right of the remainder of his brigade and move toward the advancing
      columns of the enemy. Those three regiments most gallantly met the overwhelming masses of the
      enemy and held them in check. As soon as the Nineteenth Corps engaged the enemy the force in
      my front commenced slowly retiring. The three regiments named were pushed forward until they
      came upon two batteries (eight guns), silencing them and compelling the enemy to abandon them.
      The three regiments had arrived within less than 200 yards of the two batteries when the
      Nineteenth Corps, after a most gallant resistance, gave way. These guns would have been taken
      by our troops had our flanks been properly protected. The enemy at once came upon my right
      flank in large force; successful resistance was no longer possible; the order was given for
      our men to fall back on the second line, but the enemy advancing at the time in force threw us
      temporarily into confusion. The line was soon reformed and the enemy again driven from the
      house above mentioned and our line formed about 100 yards in advance, the men protecting
      themselves with rails, &amp;c. Heavy firing on both sides was kept up. While holding this
      line the enemy charged twice, but was repulsed, with heavy loss, both times. About 4 p. m. a
      general advance took place, the enemy gave way before the impetuosity of our troops and were
      soon completely routed. This division pressed forward with the advanced line to and through
      the streets of Winchester to the heights beyond. Night came on and the pursuit of the enemy
      was stopped. The troops of my division encamped with the corps on the Strasburg and Front
      Royal roads south of Winchester. </p>
    <p> This division took in this engagement 149 prisoners. </p>
    <p> This division lost in the battle of Opequon some valiant and superior officers. Among
      others, the division mourns the loss of the gallant Maj. Dillingham, of the Tenth Vermont
      Volunteers. Maj. Vredenburgh, commanding Fourteenth New Jersey Volunteers, was killed
      instantly early in the action. He was a brave and skillful officer. Col. J. W. Horn, Sixth
      Maryland Volunteers, than whom none excelled for distinguished bravery, was severely if not
      mortally wounded. Lieut. Col. A. W. Ebright, commanding One hundred and twenty-sixth Ohio, was
      killed instantly early in the action. He was uniformly brave and skillful. </p>
    <p> The enemy was pursued on the 20th to Fisher's Hill about one mile and a half south of
      Strasburg, Va., on the Staunton pike, where he was found strongly fortified in an apparently
      impregnable position. About </p>

      Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] </p>
    <p> 12 m. on the 21st, the division, except the Ninth New York [Heavy Artillery] Volunteers,
      which was detailed as wagon guard, moved with the corps to the right of Strasburg, Va., and
      was formed again upon the extreme right of the corps. In compliance with an order from
      Maj.-Gen. Wright, I ordered forward the One hundred and twenty-sixth Ohio, commanded by Capt.
      Hoge, to aid in driving the enemy from a hill in our front. This regiment soon became engaged
      with the enemy. The Sixth Maryland, commanded by Capt. C. K. Prentiss, was soon after ordered
      forward to its support. After a brisk fight the two regiments charged with the line of battle,
      under Col. Horn [Keifer], and took the heights, thereby gaining a very important position,
      upon which the troops bivouacked for the night. Capt. Prentiss displayed great gallantry in
      this action. </p>
    <p> The division remained in the position occupied on the night of the 21st instant until about
      12 m. of the 22d instant. The Sixth Maryland being on the skirmish line was constantly engaged
      with the enemy's skirmishers. At the hour last named, as directed by Maj.-Gen. Wright, the
      division moved off to the right and upon the enemy's left. The Second Brigade, Col. Keifer,
      forming the first line, with the First Brigade, Col. Emerson, as a support, attacked and drove
      the enemy from two hills, which he held in considerable force. So rapid was their flight that
      they abandoned shelter-tents, blankets, and a considerable amount of infantry ammunition.
      During this advance the Sixth Maryland was ordered to push forward upon the extreme left of my
      skirmish line to resist an attack from the enemy in that direction, which it was successful in
      doing. In this attack portions of the One hundred and tenth and One hundred and twenty-second
      Ohio were thrown forward as a strong line of skirmishers, under the command of Lieut. Col. M.
      M. Granger, One hundred and twenty-second Ohio, Maj. A. Spangler, commanding the One hundred
      and tenth Ohio. Col. Granger and Maj. Spangler exhibited their usual skill and good judgment
      in the successful management of troops. The skirmishers were pushed over the crest of the hill
      and to within long rifle range of the enemy's main works, in which were mounted heavy guns.
      The division was formed behind the crest of the hill confronting the enemy. Although near the
      enemy he was not able to do us much injury with his artillery. Sharp skirmishing continued
      until about 4 p.m., when the Eighth Corps commenced and advanced some distance farther to the
      right and upon the left flank and rear of the enemy. A heavy fire had been opened upon the
      enemy's works by artillery to my rear and left. My skirmishers were pushed forward with orders
      to halt near the enemy's works and open fire upon his gunners. The whole line soon after
      advanced and charged the works, capturing many prisoners and guns and dispersing the rebel
      infantry in all directions. As we charged a battery opened upon us still farther to our left.
      The Eighth Corps came up on our immediate right, and with them we moved forward without delay
      and charged the second battery, capturing it also. At about this time the whole army commenced
      advancing. The Eighth Corps and my division, being fully upon the enemy's left flank and rear,
      pushed forward with wild and victorious shouts along the entire line of the enemy, from his
      left to extreme right, capturing all his artillery in position and capturing and dispersing
      his troops. Not a regiment or company of the enemy left the field in anything like order. Of
      the number of pieces of artillery captured, this division is entitled to the credit of
      capturing four at least, and 219 prisoners. The division pursued the enemy with the corps all </p>

    <p> night. The pursuit of the fugitive enemy was continued by the infantry to Harrisonburg, Va.,
      at which place the army arrived on the 25th instant. </p>
    <p> The loss in my division was very light on the 22d, considering the results attained. </p>
    <p> Throughout the two engagements Col. William Emerson, commanding First Brigade, and Col. J.
      Warren Keifer, commanding Second Brigade, displayed great bravery and energy in the discharge
      of their important duties, maintaining their usual reputation for cool courage important
