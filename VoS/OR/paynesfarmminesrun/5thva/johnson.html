  <p>Report of Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson, C. S. Army, commanding division.</p>

  <p>headQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,</p>

  <p>February 2, 1864.</p>

  <p>MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report and the accompanying sub-reports of the part borne by my division in the action of Payne's Farm, on November 27, 1863, and the succeeding operations on Mine Run:</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 26th, the enemy having been reported as crossing the Rapidan in force at Jacobs' Ford, the command was ordered into the breastworks in our front, extending from Mountain to Walnut Run, on a line at right angles with the general course of the river. Stafford's brigade was ordered to Zoar Church to watch the movements of the enemy.</p>

  <p>At an early hour next morning, Stafford's brigade having rejoined the command, the troops, in pursuance of an order from the major general commanding the corps, were moved out of the works and down the road by Bartlett's Mill, with a view to forming a junction with Rodes' division at Locust Grove. In obedience to orders from corps headquarters, the ordnance and baggage wagons were sent by way of Zoar Church. The command moved in the following order: First, Jones' brigade; second, Stafford's brigade; third, the "Stonewall" Brigade, followed by Andrews' battalion of artillery and the ambulances. Steuart's brigade was ordered to bring up the rear, to guard against any sudden dash upon the artillery. Skirmishers were thrown out to the front and on the left of the head of the column. They encountered a few of the enemy's vedettes at the junction of an obscure road leading in the direction of Jacobs' Ford with that along which the column was advancing. These being quickly driven off, the command was moved rapidly forward until the head of the column reached Rodes' left at a point about 3 miles from Bartlett's Mill.</p>

  <p>Soon after the column had been halted Brigadier-General Steuart sent forward to the division commander, and apprised him of the fact that the ambulance train in his front had been attacked by the enemy's skirmishers, supposed to be dismounted cavalry. Riding to the rear, he found General Steuart's skirmishers briskly engaged with those of the enemy, who were endeavoring to turn his left. To prevent this, General Steuart was ordered to throw back his left and form his brigade at right angles to the road. The other three brigades were ordered to about-face, close up upon General Steuart's right, and throw out skirmishers.</p>

  <p>It was now evident that the enemy's infantry was in our front, heavy bodies of them in line of battle having been discovered. The brigade commanders on the right of Steuart were ordered to feel the enemy, and he was found to cover the front of our entire command with the exception of two regiments on our extreme right. His right extended beyond Steuart's left, so that the opposing forces presented about equal fronts. We, however, had only one line, while the enemy had two or more.</p>

  <p>There was heavy skirmishing now along the entire line, and it was in repelling the enemy--who twice in line of battle attempted, and unsuccessfully, to drive back his regiment, deployed as</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLI.] MINE RUN, VIRGINIA, CAMPAIGN. PAGE 847-48 [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>skirmishers--that the chivalric Col. Raleigh T. Colston, commanding the Second Virginia Infantry, fell desperately wounded. This brave officer has since died. Here, too, the gallant Lieutenant-Colonel Walton, commanding the Twenty-third Virginia Infantry, fell while leading on his men. Though wounded, he had refused to leave the field, when he was shot through the heart and instantly killed. The loss of such men as these, who were at once good citizens, brave soldiers, and cultivated gentlemen, is one equally to be deplored by their country and their comrades.</p>

  <p>At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the position of the enemy having been as well ascertained as the nature of the ground permitted, a general advance was ordered, Steuart being directed to wheel his brigade gradually to the right as he advanced, and the command went forward with loud cheers to drive the enemy out of the tangled wilderness in which he had sheltered himself. The resistance of the enemy was stubborn, but he was steadily driven back for a considerable distance through the woods and pursued across an open field. The density of the thicket through which our men advanced was such, however, that it was found impossible to maintain an unbroken line, and each brigade commander in turn, finding himself unsupported either on the right or the left, and in an open field, ordered back his brigade to the fence skirting the field. By this time our ammunition was well-nigh exhausted, and all efforts to obtain a supply having failed, it was impossible to push our success further. The men, however (many of whom had used all their cartridges), maintained a resolute front along the fence, and a dropping fire was kept up on both sides. Though night was rapidly falling and the fire gradually slackening on the part of the enemy, it was deemed prudent, in view of the exhausted cartridge-boxes of the men, to send to General Rodes, with the request that he should order a brigade to our support. This request was promptly acceded to, and Brigadier-General Doles, having reported, was directed to move to the front. It being now night, my division was ordered back to the road.</p>

  <p>During the advance of our troops, a section of Carpenter's battery behaved with great gallantry and efficiency in replying to a battery of four pieces of the enemy, who were pouring grape into the ranks of Steuart's brigade, and dispersed also a column of infantry who were endeavoring to turn our left. A section of Dement's battery, placed in front of our center, though under a galling fire of musketry, played with telling effect upon the ranks of the enemy. The officers and men of these commands (composing part of Andrews' battalion) exhibited on this as on every previous occasion when they have served under me in action, a courage and efficiency of the highest order.</p>

  <p>About 12 p. m. the command was marched across Mine Run, by direction of Major-General Early, commanding the corps, and took up its position on the hills along the western bank. We brought off all of our wounded except 2 and some of our dead. The enemy, in retiring before us, had left many of his dead and wounded upon the field. We captured also a few prisoners.</p>

  <p>Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing was 545, of which 69 were killed, 429 wounded, and 47 missing. That of the enemy was probably not far from 1,000 men.</p>

  <p>My warmest acknowledgments are due the brave officers and men of this division who, attacked while on the march by a greatly</p>

  <p>PAGE 848-48 OPERATIONS IN N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. XLI. [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>superior force of the enemy from an admirable position, turned upon him and drove him from the field, which he left strewn with arms, with artillery and infantry ammunition, his dead and dying. Opposed by French's and part of Sedgwick's corps, they gained so decided a success that General French was relieved from command by his Government on account of the result of the action, a sufficiently high encomium upon the soldiers whose valor overcame him.</p>

  <p>To Brigadier-General Steuart, Brigadier-General Walker, Brigadier General Jones, and Brigadier-General Stafford, the highest praise is due for the gallantry and skill with which they led their commands.</p>

  <p>General Steuart was slightly wounded in the arm; General Jones more seriously in the head early in the action, and was carried from the field, when Colonel Witcher, of the Twenty-first Virginia Infantry, a most gallant officer, assumed command. General Jones reported for duty a few days afterward, before he had sufficiently recovered to justify his doing so, on hearing that a general engagement was imminent.</p>

  <p>General Walker, when during the engagement one of his regiments staggered under a terrific fire, seized the colors, leaped his horse over a fence into an open field in front of his command, and waved his men on, while the lines of the enemy, 80 yards distant, directed a fearful converging fire upon him. General Stafford acted with similar daring, but, fortunately, neither was wounded.</p>

  <p>I beg leave to call your attention to the accompanying brigade and regimental reports, where special mention is made of acts of gallantry and merit, which would too greatly swell the proportions of this report were they mentioned here.</p>

  <p>My thanks are due to the officers of my staff--Maj. R. W. Hunter, assistant adjutant-general; Maj. Edwin L. Moore, inspector; Capt. V. Dabney, assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut. Oscar Hinrichs, engineer officer, who was wounded under a heavy fire--for their efficient services and the gallantry they displayed during the engagement.</p>

  <p>Dr. R. T. Coleman, chief surgeon of the division, deserves much credit for the promptness with which the wounded were removed from the field and their wants supplied.</p>

  <p>Sergt. Skipwith Wilmer, chief of signal corps, acted as my aide, and deserves mention for his gallantry and intelligence.</p>

  <p>OPERATIONS ON MINE RUN SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACTION.</p>

  <p>My division, which was posted on the left of Rodes' division and formed the extreme left of the army, having constructed strong fieldworks along the western bank of Mine Run, remained in line of battle for several days awaiting the expected assault of the enemy.</p>

  <p>He opened a heavy artillery fire on our lines on November 29, about sunrise, to which Andrews' battalion gallantly replied. During this artillery combat, which lasted but a short time, the service and the country lost a most gallant officer and valuable citizen in the death of Capt. Charles I. Raine, of Andrews' battalion, who was killed by a solid shot while fearlessly and ably discharging his duty. There were a few other casualties also in this battalion.</p>

  <p>The enemy having retreated during the night of December 1, my division was ordered across Mine Run in pursuit, but on its being ascertained that he had recrossed the river we were ordered back to</p>

  <p>our works between Mountain and Walnut Run, where we remained until ordered into our present quarters.</p>

  <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>Report of Brig. Gen. James A. Walker, C. S. Army, commanding brigade.</p>

  <p>headQUARTERS "STONEWALL" BRIGADE,</p>

  <p>December 8, 1863.</p>

  <p>MAJOR: In obedience to circular from division headquarters, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the "Stonewall" Brigade, on the 27th ultimo, in the affair at Payne's Farm:</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 27th, this brigade moved from the rifle-pits near Rhodes' house, on the road leading by Bartlett's Mill to Locust Grove, following Stafford's brigade, with the ambulances of the division, Andrews' artillery, and Steuart's brigade in our rear. When about 2 miles from Bartlett's Mill, I was informed by Major Moore, division inspector, that the enemy's skirmishers were firing into General Steuart's column from the woods on our left. Halting my brigade and facing it to the front in line of battle, I ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Colston, commanding Second Virginia, to deploy his regiment in my front and advance his skirmishers through the woods, which he did, and his regiment remained in front, gallantly holding the enemy in check until the brigade advanced to its support.</p>

  <p>I regret very much that Lieutenant-Colonel Colston lost his leg while commanding this line of skirmishers, as he is a gallant and efficient officer, and his services are very much needed with his regiment at this time.</p>

  <p>After remaining in line of battle along the road for two hours, I received orders to advance with the rest of the division, and moved forward, with Stafford on my right and Steuart on my left. The ground in my front for about 500 yards was thickly wooded and brushy, and beyond that was a cleared farm owned by a man named Payne. The brigade advanced rapidly through the woods and encountered the enemy at the edge of the open ground, who soon gave way in confusion, and was followed by my men some distance into the open field, when, finding that they were unsupported on our left, and being exposed to a fire from the enemy on that flank posted in the woods, which extended farther on our left than in our front, they fell back to the edge of the woods, where we maintained our ground until dark, when we fell back to the road, bringing off all our wounded and a portion of our dead.</p>

  <p>The total loss of the brigade in this action was 20 killed and 124 wounded.</p>

  <p>About 10 o'clock that night the brigade moved off with the rest of the division unmolested by the enemy. The subsequent operations</p>

  <p>of the brigade during the rest of the campaign were unimportant, and no special report is deemed necessary.</p>

  <p>To my personal staff, and especially to Captain Barton, assistant adjutant-general, I am indebted for valuable assistance on the field.</p>

  <p>I am, major, very respectfully,</p>
