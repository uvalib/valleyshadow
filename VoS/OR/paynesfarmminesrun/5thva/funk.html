    <p> Report of Col. J. H. S. Funk, Fifth Virginia Infantry. </p>
    <p>JANUARY 22, 1864. </p>
    <p> CAPTAIN: In obedience to circular, I have the honor to submit the following report of the
      part taken by my regiment in the engagement at Payne's Farm, November 27, 1863: </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 26, I was ordered, in company with the brigade, down the Germanna Ford
      road, which runs through our fortifications, behind which we lay the previous night, and
      keeping this road for near a mile, we turned off abruptly to the right, crossing Mine Run at
      Bartlett's Mill. Continuing on the old Culpeper and Fredericksburg road 2 miles, we halted,
      hearing heavy skirmishing in front. In a few minutes, to my surprise, I heard skirmishing in
      our rear along the road which we had traveled. We faced about and marched back some 200 yards.
      Skirmishers were deployed and soon became engaged. We then fronted and moved in advance of the
      road some 50 paces, when we received orders to erect temporary fortifications. </p>
    <p> In a few minutes an order was received from the brigade commander to prepare to move
      forward, it having been ascertained that there was nothing but the enemy's cavalry in our
      front. The regiment was immediately put in motion. A charge was commenced on the left of the
      brigade, which was immediately taken up by my regiment. After proceeding about 200 yards, and
      arriving at the edge of the field, I found that my regiment was very much scattered, owing to
      the denseness of the undergrowth. I halted and reformed </p>

    <p> it. By this time the left of the brigade became engaged with the enemy's infantry, posted
      behind a fence at the skirt of a woods which run at right angles with our line of battle.
      Finding no enemy in my front, I wheeled my regiment to the left and took position in a lane
      leading to and some 300 yards from the residence of Mr. Madison Payne, which threw me within
      some 200 yards of the enemy's lines, when we soon became hotly engaged, which was about 4
      o'clock. General Stafford's brigade came up on our right and continued the line along the
      lane. </p>
    <p> About sunset Captain Dement's battery was placed in position immediately in my rear, opened
      fire, but was soon silenced by the enemy's infantry. We were engaged until dark, when I
      received an order from General Walker to fall back to our fortifications along the old
      Culpeper and Fredericksburg road, carrying our dead and wounded with us. Owing to a number of
      horses in the battery being disabled, I sent Captain Hall and a squad of men, who assisted in
      bringing off the piece. About 1 o'clock, we took up the line of march, moving toward Zoar
      Church, and took position along Mine Run. </p>
    <p> It only remains for me to say that the officers and men displayed their usual gallantry and
      determination. There was a greater exhibition of personal courage than I have witnessed upon
      any of the many fields upon which they have fought. </p>
    <p> Capt. William T. Hall, Lieut. John M. Brown, Color Sergt. W. Grimm, Sergeant Thompson
      (Company G), and Sergeant Fauber (Company H), are mentioned for behaving with marked gallantry
      on this occasion. </p>
    <p> I am indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, Major Newton, and Adjt. Charles S. Arnall for
      their valuable assistance and untiring energy in keeping the men to the post of duty. </p>
    <p> My casualties were as follows: Six killed, 24 wounded, and 1 missing; total, 31. </p>
    <p> With deep regret at the loss of so many noble and brave men of my command, </p>
    <p> I am, most respectfully, </p>
    <p> J. H. S. FUNK, <br/> Colonel Fifth Virginia Infantry. </p>
    <p> Capt. R. J. BARTON, <br/>Assistant Adjutant-General. </p>
