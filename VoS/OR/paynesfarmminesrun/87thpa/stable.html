  <p>Report of Lieut. Col. James A. Stable, Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Infantry.</p>

  <p>HEADQUARTERS 87TH PENNSYLVANIA INFANTRY,</p>

  <p>Brandy Station, Va., December 3, 1863.</p>

  <p>SIR: In compliance with circular from headquarters Third Brigade, Third Division, Third Army Corps, bearing date December 3, 1863, I have the honor to report the following as the part taken by my command in the recent movements and operations of the Third Brigade:</p>

  <p>Marched from camp at Brandy Station, Va., November 26, at 8 a.m., marching on the left of the brigade, left in front; arrived at Rapidan River, crossing over the river on pontoon bridge, marched about 3 miles, then marched back to the river, and bivouacked. November 27, 7 a.m., marched with Third Brigade on the left center of the brigade, left in front, about 2 miles, rested in the woods till 3 p. m., marched forward, met the rebels, and had a very brisk fight, losing 1 man killed and 11 men wounded. Marched with Third Brigade to a new position; lay on arms during the night. November 28, 3 a. m., marched with Third Brigade on the right center of the brigade, left in front: bivouacked in the field. November 29, brigade formed line at 3 p.m. for the purpose of storming rebel fortifications, my regiment on the right center of the brigade; remained in line till night, then bivouacked.</p>

  <p>November 30, marched at 3 a.m. on the right of Third Brigade,</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLI.] MINE RUN, VIRGINIA, CAMPAIGN. PAGE 789-48 [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>left in front; formed line of battle by brigade, my regiment on the right; deployed one company of 60 men in advance of regiment as skirmishers. The company advanced about 500 yards into a very thick under growth of pine woods, when they were fired upon by the rebels lying in ambush, killing 3 enlisted men and wounding 4 enlisted men. The company returned the fire, and held their position. I immediately sent one company of 40 men to support the skirmishers. The two companies remained in position till relieved by the Second Corps, and then rejoined the regiment, which had marched to the ground from where it had marched in the morning; bivouacked in the woods.</p>

  <p>December 1, 1 p.m., marched on the right center of the Third Brigade, right in front; bivouacked in the woods. December 2, marched at 6 a.m. on the right of the brigade, right in front, crossing the Rapidan River on pontoon bridge; took position in line of battle on a hill in the woods close by the river to guard the ford; remained in position for three hours, then marched on the right of brigade; bivouacked in the woods.</p>

  <p>December 3, marched at 1 a.m. on the left of brigade, right in front, arriving at Brandy Station 8 a.m.; encamped in the woods near Brandy Station.</p>

  <p>Hoping this will prove satisfactory and correct, I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JAMES A. STABLE,<br />
  Lieutenant-Colonel, Comdg. 87th Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>

  <p>Lieut. S. C. JUDSON,<br />
