  <p>Report of Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Carr, U. S. Army, commanding Third Division.</p>

  <p>NEAR BRANDY STATION, VA.,</p>

  <p>December 4, 1863.</p>

  <p>SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my division during the recent operations of the Third Corps, from November 23 to this date:</p>

  <p>On November 23, orders were received from headquarters Third Army Corps, directing the command to move next morning, November 24, at daylight, the Second Division to be in advance, Third Division in the center, and First Division in rear, the column to march left in front. At 6.30 a.m., November 24, a copy of a telegram from headquarters Army of the Potomac was received, through headquarters Third Corps, directing that, owing to the unfavorable state of the weather, the troops should not leave their camps until further orders. At 6 a.m., November 26, orders were received from</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLI.] MINE RUN, VIRGINIA, CAMPAIGN. PAGE 777-48 [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>headquarters Third Corps directing the command to move as directed in circular from the same headquarters dated November 23.</p>

  <p>The command moved shortly after 7 a.m. Just before starting a detail of 200 men was made from the division, to serve as a guard for the corps train. The division crossed Mountain Run at Ross' Mills at 9.45 a.m., and reached the Rapidan, near Jacobs' Mills, at 2 p.m. Crossed the river at 4 p.m., and was directed by Major General French to follow the Second Division, and bivouac for the night between it and the First Division, and to picket the front strongly. The march was continued after crossing the river for about 3 miles, when it was discovered that the Second Division had taken the wrong road. The command was countermarched, returning to within a mile of the river, and bivouacking for the night.</p>

  <p>At 7 a.m., November 27, the march was resumed on the road to Robertson's Tavern, the orders from corps headquarters being to follow the Second Division closely and to throw out strong flanking parties on the right flank. The column moved slowly forward, making frequent halts. At 9.10 a.m. a few musket shots were heard in front. At 11.25 halted on the edge of a field on the left of the road, and about 3 miles from Jacobs' Mills. At 12.30 the firing in front became quite brisk. About 2.30 p.m. the division was ordered up to take position on the left of the Second Division, and to connect, if possible, with the right of the Second Corps. The division, marching left in front, filed into the woods on the left of the road. I directed General Morris, commanding First Brigade, to connect with the left of the Second Division; Colonel Keifer, with the Second Brigade, to form on the left of the First, and Colonel Smith, with the Third Brigade, to continue the line on the left of the Second. General Morris, on moving up to connect with the Second Division, found the enemy posted behind a fence on the crest of a hill in his front. I ordered him to charge and drive them from it, which he did, driving the enemy through the fields beyond. This position was held by our troops until the close of the engagement. The troops had barely time to take the positions assigned them when the engagement became general along the entire line. The enemy made repeated attempts to advance in front of the brigades of General Morris and Colonel Keifer, but were repulsed each time with heavy loss.</p>

  <p>Colonel Smith, commanding Third Brigade, failed to retain his position on the left of the Second Brigade, assigning as a reason the difficult nature of the ground on which he had to move his troops and the severity of the enemy's fire, though his report of casualties shows his loss to be trifling. Shortly before sundown, the ammunition of the men being nearly exhausted, I requested General Birney, commanding First Division, who had moved up to my support, to relieve my line to enable my men to refill their cartridge boxes. The brigades of General Morris and Colonel Keifer were then withdrawn, the First Division taking their place. I massed the two brigades above named about 200 yards in rear of the line of battle; they were supplied with ammunition and held in readiness for another advance. Darkness coming on, however, the firing entirely ceased. The enemy withdrew from our front, leaving their dead on the field.</p>

  <p>At 3.15 a.m., November 28, I received orders from headquarters Third Corps to withdraw my command to the position they occupied before the advance was made on the afternoon of the 27th; also to</p>

  <p>PAGE 778-48 OPERATIONS IN N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. XLI. [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>report, on my way back, to the major-general commanding the corps. On reporting as directed, General French ordered me to follow with my command in rear of the Sixth Corps. I found the narrow road on which they were moving filled with their artillery, and ammunition and ambulance trains, and was delayed over an hour waiting for them to pass.</p>

  <p>I moved on, in rear of the trains of the Sixth Corps, at 6.30 a.m., halting at 8 a.m. on the edge of a large field in which part of the Sixth Corps was massed. Moved on again at 1 p.m., following the Second Division, the First Division being in advance. Halted again about a mile southwest of Robertson's Tavern. Moved again at 4.10 p.m., taking position at sundown on the left of the First Division on the east side of Mine Run, threw out pickets, and bivouacked for the night. My command remained in the above position all next day, November 29. In the early part of the day, I was ordered by General French to hold my command in readiness to make an assault on the enemy's works in my front. I made the necessary disposition of the troops, but the day passed without the assault being made.</p>

  <p>At 12.30 a.m., November 30, I received orders from headquarters of the corps to move with my division at 2 a.m. and report to Major General Warren on the plank road. I reported as directed, and was conducted by a staff officer to the position assigned me, on the right of the Second Division, Third Corps, on the west side of Mine Run, my right resting on the plank road. I was told by General Warren that in the attack about to be made I should begin the movement by pushing through the thick wood in my front, my arrival on the other side of it to be the signal for the advance of the rest of the line over the comparatively clear ground on my left. I deployed a sufficient number of skirmishers and made every preparation for the intended attack. About this time the pickets of the Second Corps were withdrawn from my front, no notice having been given me of the fact.</p>

  <p>In advancing the skirmishers to take the line just vacated by them a sharp skirmish ensued, resulting in a loss to us of 3 men killed and 4 wounded. My division remained in position until 12.30 p.m., when I was ordered by General Warren to report back to General French. I returned, and took my former position at 3 p.m.</p>

  <p>At 10.45 a.m., December 1, received orders to hold my command in readiness to move at a moment's notice. The division marched at 6 p.m., but was delayed nearly three hours waiting for the passage of the trains and artillery. I crossed the Rapidan with my command at Culpeper Ford at 3.30 a.m., December 2, and halted about 1 mile from the river.</p>

  <p>At noon on the 1st, I was ordered to send a strong brigade to report to General Gregg at the old Wilderness Tavern, at the intersection of the turnpike and Germanna plank road. The Third Brigade, Colonel Smith commanding, was detailed for that purpose. Colonel Smith reported as directed, and rejoined the division on the afternoon of the 2d.</p>

  <p>My command moved from its bivouac near Culpeper Ford at 2 p. m., December 2, halted again at 4.30 p.m., resumed the march at 1 a.m., December 3, and reached its present position near Brandy Station at 6 a.m.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I would say that it affords me great pleasure to make honorable mention of the following officers who came under</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLI.] MINE RUN, VIRGINIA, CAMPAIGN. PAGE 779-48 [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>my immediate notice for their cool, intrepid, and gallant conduct on the field during the engagement on the 27th of November, namely: Brigadier-General Morris, commanding First Brigade; Colonel Keifer, commanding Second Brigade; Colonel Horn, Sixth Maryland Volunteers; Colonel Truex, Fourteenth New Jersey Volunteers, and Col. M, R. McClennan, commanding One hundred and thirty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, the latter of whom was wounded.</p>

  <p>I was much gratified with the conduct of my division; both officers and men performed their duty manfully, and the States they represent may justly feel proud of their bearing on the occasion.</p>

  <p>I am under many obligations to the members of my staff for their assistance both in the field and on the march, and would particularly mention Lieut. James Johnson, acting assistant adjutant-general; Maj. P. Vredenburgh, jr., acting assistant inspector-general, and Lieut. C. C. Jones, aide-de-camp.</p>

  <p>I inclose herewith the reports of brigade commanders and list of casualties.</p>

  <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JOS. B. CARR,<br />
  Brigadier-General.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Col. O. H. HART,<br />
  Assistant Adjutant-General.</p>
