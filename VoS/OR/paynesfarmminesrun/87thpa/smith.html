    <p>Report of Col. Benjamin F. Smith, One hundred and twenty-sixth Ohio Infantry, commanding
      Third Brigade. </p>
    <p> BRANDY STATION, VA., </p>
    <p>December 3, 1863.</p>
    <p> LIEUTENANT: In compliance with circular of this date from headquarters Third Division, I
      have respectfully to report the recent operations of this brigade, giving, as directed, any
      delays or obstacles; also a revised report of casualties* at the close of the report. </p>
    <p> On the 26th of November, the brigade marched at 8 a.m. from Brandy Station, Va., with the
      division and corps, to Jacobs' Mills Ford, on the Rapidan River, and crossed, without
      resistance, at about 5 p.m., and marched some 3 miles along a road through the Wilderness and
      returned to near the ford and bivouacked for the night. </p>
    <p> November 27, in accordance with circular from headquarters of the division, the brigade
      marched with the corps soon after sunrise over same road for the greater part of the distance
      of the day before. The Second Division of the corps, being in the advance, came upon the enemy
      about noon. This brigade, being in rear of its division, moved slowly along, closed up, with
      flankers well thrown out, as directed by the general commanding division. At about 4 p.m. the
      rapidity of the firing and the number of the wounded brought to the rear indicated the enemy
      in force. I received verbal orders to move forward with the brigade, and met the general
      commanding division behind and near the line of battle in the woods, and was directed by </p>
    <p> _____________ <br/> * Omitted: but see revised statement, p. 682. </p>
    <p> PAGE 784-48 OPERATIONS IN N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. XLI. [Series I. Vol. 29.

    <p> him to move quickly and take position in line, my right joining the left of General Morris'
      brigade. In moving through the thick woods I sent two staff officers in different directions
      to find the brigade of General Morris, as I had no time to reconnoiter the ground over which I
      was passing. Finding the Second Brigade taking the position indicated for mine, I halted and
      sent a staff officer to report the general commanding division. I was then ordered, through
      the assistant adjutant-general of the division, to join my right on the Second Brigade, and
      connect with the Second Army Corps on my left. </p>
    <p> In marching to this last-mentioned position I came to a clearing of low ground, through
      which ran a miry creek, on the opposite of which was a matted thicket of considerable extent
      and depth. As all this ground was covered by the enemy's fire, in order to protect my men as
      well as possible until I could place them in the position indicated, I filed the left in front
      of the line under the cover of some irregularly shaped small hills. This done, I directed the
      left to move back to the line proper, the right having joined with the left of the Second
      Brigade. In doing this the most of the brigade was thrown in the tangled timber around which
      on the left flank the enemy was moving in heavy columns, being under a severe fire without
      being able to accomplish or see anything. The left being in some confusion on account of the
      character of the country, I found it necessary to reform the brigade in the clearing a short
      distance in the rear. It then moved to a new line along the crest of the hill a little farther
      to the left and rear, a good position. After consulting with General Howe, of the Sixth Corps,
      whom I met there and who was of opinion that the hill should be held at all hazards, I
      accordingly occupied it and remained there, thus holding the extreme left. A brigade of the
      Sixth Corps closed the gap on my right. By this movement I prevented the rebels from turning
      our flank. The Second Corps, with which I was ordered to connect, must have been some miles on
      our left, as I could not find or communicate with it. During these movements the sun went down
      and the battle ceased. </p>
    <p> My brigade was not fairly engaged; there was some desultory firing from it, but nothing
      more. I used every effort to make the best of circumstances. I did not know the ground, and
      there was no one to give me information. One of my aides is missing, either killed or a
      prisoner. Another aide did not rejoin me again after I sent him with an order. He reports that
      he could not find the brigade again. One of my orderlies had his horse disabled by a gunshot
      wound, therefore I lost his services, and I found myself almost alone most of the time, with
      but one orderly, who carried the brigade flag. My acting assistant adjutant-general did not
      fail me, but it became necessary to give my personal attention to all parts of the line, which
      was extremely difficult, owing to the broken and tangled state of the country. The brigade
      remained in its position at night on the hill, under arms, with strong pickets thrown out in
      front and on the left flank. During the movements described the brigade lost slightly in
      killed, wounded, and missing. </p>
    <p> November 28, at about half past 4 a.m., a staff officer from division headquarters brought
      me an order to rejoin the division, which I did, with the brigade to the rear, near corps
      headquarters. At about 8 o'clock marched with corps toward Robertson's Tavern. Passing
      Robertson's Tavern the command halted about 3:30 p.m., and about 5 o'clock moved forward, and,
      after a tedious night march </p>

    <p> of some 2 miles, bivouacked, for the night in the immediate presence of the enemy. </p>
    <p> November 29, before noon, the general commanding division sent for me, and informed me that
      it was the intention to assault the works of the enemy in our front, and that my brigade was
      to lead the attack of our division, and gave me directions accordingly. The division was
      formed for this purpose in the afternoon, but, for some reason unknown to me, the assault was
      abandoned, and we bivouacked for the night. </p>
    <p> Monday, November 30, the brigade, with the division, marched at 2 a.m. some 2 miles and
      joined the Second Corps, and at daylight was in line of battle for the purpose of assaulting
      the rebel works, this brigade again in the advance, two regiments in the front line, the One
      hundred and twenty-sixth Ohio and Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, with a company from
      each deployed as skirmishers about 300 yards in advance. During the morning, the pickets being
      drawn in, the rebels closed up in the vacuum and came upon the skirmishers of the
      Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, when, for a few moments, there was some sharp firing,
      killing 3 and wounding 4 men, the rebels falling immediately back. For some reason the assault
      was given up, and at l p. m. the division marched back to its camp of the night before, and
      bivouacked. </p>
    <p> December 1, at noon, the brigade marched, in accordance with orders, back some 6 miles, to
      the junction of the Orange and Fredericksburg pike and the plank road to Germanna Ford, to
      support the cavalry and cover the flank while the army moved to the rear. This was done
      without event, and at 7 a.m., December 2, the brigade moved, with Colonel Taylor's brigade of
      cavalry and one battery of artillery (myself in command of the whole, by order of General
      Gregg), and covered the rear of the troops crossing at Culpeper Ford. A few of the rebel
      cavalry followed and skirmished with the rear cavalry regiments, picking up some few
      stragglers, but doing no other damage. After seeing all the troops, &amp;c., cross
      Culpeper Ford, I crossed and placed the brigade in position, until the pontoon bridge was
      taken up and taken away, when I received orders from General Gregg to rejoin my corps, which I
      did near the ford about 2 p. m., and marched with it until sunset, when the division
      bivouacked in the woods. </p>
    <p> Thursday, December 3, at 1 a.m., resumed the march, and reached Brandy Station at sunrise,
      and re-occupied the old camp of just one week ago. </p>
