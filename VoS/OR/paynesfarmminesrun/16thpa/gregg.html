    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg, U. S. Army, commanding Second Cavalry Division. </p>
    <p> headQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, </p>
    <p> December 4, 1863.</p>
    <p> CAPTAIN: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of this division
      since the 24th of November, 1863: </p>
    <p> On the morning of November 24, the Second Division, which had camped the previous night at
      Morrisville, crossed the Rappahannock at Ellis' Ford, and proceeded to Ely's Ford to cross the
      Rapidan. The advance guard having crossed the river and taken possession of the heights
      beyond, [the river?] was recrossed. In pursuance of an order from the major-general commanding
      Cavalry Corps, the division was withdrawn to Richardsville and Ellis' Ford, and the brigade
      camped at these points for the night and until the morning of the 26th, when the entire
      division crossed the Rapidan and advanced upon the left of the army and in the direction of
      the headwaters of the Po River. Communicating from time to time with the general commanding
      the advance of the army corps on my right, I endeavored to regulate my march by his. Getting
      somewhat in advance, about 8 p. m. I halted the division on the head of the Po River, near the
      road leading from Parker's Store to Spotsylvania. During the day only small parties of the
      enemy were seen, and these retiring in different directions. </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 27th, pursuant to orders from the major general commanding Cavalry
      Corps, the division moved to Parker's Store, passing on to the Orange plank road in advance of
      the Fifth Army Corps. At New Hope Meeting House the First Brigade, Col. J. P. Taylor
      commanding, met the pickets and first line of skirmishers of the enemy's cavalry. Two
      squadrons of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry and one of the First Massachusetts Cavalry,
      dismounted, soon drove back this line. The enemy endeavored to check the advance by discharges
      of canister and shell from a piece </p>
    <p> CHAP. XLI.] MINE RUN, VIRGINIA, CAMPAIGN. PAGE 807-48 [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports.
      Serial No. 48.] </p>
    <p> of artillery, but uselessly. A section of Martin's (Sixth New York) battery placed at the
      meeting house compelled the withdrawal of this piece. Additional squadrons of dismounted men
      were now moved upon the skirmish line, and the enemy rapidly driven a mile beyond the meeting
      house. At this point the enemy's cavalry disappeared behind a line of infantry, which advanced
      to meet the line of the division; a battery of artillery opened from the enemy's right. To
      check this advance, four regiments, the Third Pennsylvania, First Massachusetts, First
      Pennsylvania, and First New Jersey, were dismounted and moved to the front, and two sections
      of Martin's battery placed in position close upon our line. This strong line of dismounted
      cavalry rushed upon the enemy, firing volleys from their carbines, and drove the infantry line
      to the cover of a dense woods and there held it at bay. Thirty-four prisoners were brought out
      and reported themselves as belonging to Hill's corps. </p>
    <p> Major-General Sykes, having joined me at this time, moved forward one of his divisions, and
      late in the evening my division retired within his lines. In this action, the regiments and
      battery of the First Brigade behaved most handsomely. </p>
    <p> The entire loss of the First Brigade was 2 officers killed and 5 wounded; 17 enlisted men
      killed and 59 enlisted men wounded, and 1 enlisted man missing. </p>
    <p> On the 28th, the First Brigade was posted at the Wilderness with two regiments at Parker's
      Store, the Second Brigade at New Hope Meeting House. </p>
    <p> On the 29th, Hampton's division of rebel cavalry made a strong attack at Parker's Store with
      the view of falling upon the wagon trains of the army. The pickets of the regiments at
      Parker's Store were rapidly driven in. The regiments engaged in distributing rations were
      attacked on all sides and compelled to retire toward the Wilderness. But sooner than they
      expected I moved three regiments of the Second Brigade, with a section of King's battery,
      Fourth U. S. Artillery, toward Parker's Store. The Second and Sixteenth Pennsylvania, in
      advance, met the enemy, charged him, releasing prisoners, and compelled the retirement of the
      enemy. The two regiments at Parker's Store lost a portion of their rations, and 1 wagon was
      burned to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy. </p>
    <p> On this day, the loss of the division was 4 officers wounded (one since died), 7 enlisted
      men killed and 40 enlisted men wounded, and 1 officer and 54 enlisted men missing. The loss of
      the enemy in killed and wounded was as great as our own. </p>
    <p> On the 30th, Devin's brigade, of the First Division, having reported to me, it was posted at
      the Wilderness, and the whole of the First Brigade moved to Parker's Store. The movement of
      the army across the Rapidan on the night of the 1st of December was covered by the Second
      Division and Devin's brigade, of the First Division, and two brigades of infantry from the
      Third Army Corps, all under my command. </p>
    <p> The Second Brigade of the Second Division and Blaisdell's brigade of infantry covered the
      movement on the road to Ely's Ford, the First Brigade, Second Division, and Smith's brigade of
      infantry that on the road to Culpeper Ford, and Devin's brigade on the road to Germanna Ford.
      These commands did the duty assigned to them in a very creditable manner. </p>
    <p> The gallantry and good conduct of my entire command on the </p>
