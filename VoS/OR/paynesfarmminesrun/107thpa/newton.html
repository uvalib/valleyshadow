  <p>Reports of Maj. Gen. John Newton, U. S. Army, commanding First Army Corps.</p>

  <p>headQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,</p>

  <p>December 3, 1863.</p>

  <p>GENERAL: On Thursday, November 26, in accordance with orders from headquarters Army of the Potomac, I advanced my First and Second Divisions, leaving the Third Division guarding the railroad from Rappahannock Station to Manassas. My orders were to follow General Sykes' corps, crossing the Rapidan at Culpeper Ford. On arriving there found General Sykes halted under orders from headquarters Army of the Potomac to await the advance of other columns over the bridges at Germanna Ford and Jacobs' Mills. When General Sykes received orders to advance, the day being far spent, I was only enabled to get one of my divisions across by 7 p.m. I conceived it proper to halt here, knowing I could overtake General Sykes by an early march.</p>

  <p>Friday, November 27.--Started at 3.30 a.m., came up with General Sykes still in camp at the point where the old turnpike crosses the Germanna plank road. Nothing of note occurred except an attack of the enemy's cavalry on General Sykes' train, which, however, was quickly driven off by the advance of my troops. Before the head of my column had arrived at Parker's Store, I received orders from headquarters Army of the Potomac, through General Sykes, to hold my command in readiness to advance to the support of General Warren, at Robertson's Tavern, and to seek for cross-roads connecting with that point. I sent several staff officers on this duty, who, reporting to headquarters Army of the Potomac, received orders to move at once. I arrived in rear of Robertson's Tavern a little after 7 p.m.</p>

  <p>Saturday, November 28.--The corps was aroused at 3 a.m. and put in position on the left of General Warren and Robertson's Tavern. Subsequently in the morning (about 7 o'clock) received orders to advance, still keeping to the left of General Warren. My troops marched in two lines through the woods to near Mine Run, where the enemy were discovered in line of battle ready to receive us. I established a picket line, with a little firing of the enemy, and remained in position there for the balance of the day.</p>

  <p>Sunday, November 29.--An attack on the enemy being contemplated on the left and right, I was left in charge of the center with my own troops and a few who had been left of the Fifth and Sixth Corps. At 8 a.m., according to orders, cannonading was commenced along my front on the enemy. It was continued for a short time only. Subsequently, I advanced a light picket across Mine Run to feel the enemy and to reconnoiter the ground more thoroughly. The skirmishers very gallantly effected a lodgment on the other side, under a sharp fire of the enemy, losing in killed and wounded about 40 men. Under cover of this lodgment, I directed four bridges to be constructed, not knowing but what they might be of some ulterior use. After night, feeling that my picket line must be maintained very strongly or be withdrawn, I directed the latter to be done at 3 o'clock the next morning, first submitting my proposal to headquarters Army of the Potomac, which was approved, and the</p>

  <p>PAGE 688-48 OPERATIONS IN N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. XLI. [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>pickets were withdrawn at that hour to their former position on the north side of the run, the bridges being destroyed. The position of the enemy in my proper front was very strong, the approach to it being visible to the enemy for 2,500 yards, according to my estimate, and flanked on both sides by heavy belts of timber. There was, besides Mine Run, a ravine, difficult of passage (not visible from our side), raked by their artillery. The only possible chance of success in attacking it seemed to me to be to mass the troops under cover of the night and have their flanks strongly supported by the adjacent corps. Success at the best was only probable, and must have been attended with heavy sacrifice of life. This concludes the active operations of the First Corps. During the advance of the army, my column was never impeded. The column to which I belonged was always up in reasonable time.</p>

  <p>Monday, November 30.--At 4 p.m. I left, pursuant to orders, for Germanna bridge, to cover the crossing of the Fifth and Sixth Corps.</p>

  <p>Tuesday, December 1.--The recrossing of the army was effected.</p>

  <p>Wednesday, December 2.--I was ordered to leave a brigade at Germanna Ford and to send another brigade to Mitchell's Ford, and afterward proceed with the rest of my troops to Stevensburg. The brigade left at Germanna Ford was afterward relieved by a brigade of the Sixth Corps.</p>

  <p>Thursday, December 3.--Was ordered to take post at Paoli Mills, where I arrived at about noon, sending one brigade to Kelly's Ford, leaving two brigades here.</p>

  <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JOHN NEWTON,<br />
  Major-General, Commanding.</p>

  <p>Brig. Gen. S. WILLIAMS,<br />
  Asst. Adjt. Gen., headquarters Army of the Potomac.</p>

  <p>I omitted to mention in my report that the troops of my corps which were thrown across Mine Run carried the first line of the enemy's rifle-pits.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully,</p>

  Major-General, Commanding First Army Corps.</p>

  <p>HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,<br />
  December 4, 1863.</p>

  <p>SIR: In answer to yours of this day,* I have the honor to report that the rifle-pits of the enemy carried by my troops were these occupied by their pickets of battle and not by main line. Could not ascertain their exact force, but know it to have been at least a regiment. A detachment of New York sharpshooters, with 200 men of the Seventh Indiana, did the principal work, aided by the Ninety-fourth</p>

  * See addenda following.</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLI.] MINE RUN, VIRGINIA, CAMPAIGN. PAGE 689-48 [Series I. Vol. 29. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.]</p>

  <p>New York Volunteers. Enemy's loss not known. We took some 14 or 15 prisoners.</p>

  <p>Our loss was over 40 killed and wounded. Our pickets found on arriving at the crest there was another deep ravine in their front flooded with water, rendering the position already gained nearly an island.</p>

  <p>Mine Run, in our immediate front, for men singly on foot, was passable. They sank in water and mud nearly to their shoulders in crossing.</p>

  Major-General.</p>

  <p>ADDENDA.</p>

  <p>headQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,<br />
  December 4, 1863--2.15 p.m.<br />
  Commanding Officer First Corps:</p>

  <p>SIR: The major-general commanding desires to know whether the rifle-pits which your troops carried were not the small separate pits of the enemy's pickets and not those of his line of battle. Also, where these rifle-pits were, relative to Mine Run and the line of battle of the enemy as displayed the first day of our arrival at Mine Run. Also, what force of the enemy held them when your troops carried them, what loss you suffered in carrying them, and what loss the enemy suffered.</p>

  <p>If you desire to make any corrections or additions to your report, please submit them and they will be added.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully,</p>

  <p>A. A. HUMPHREYS,<br />
  Major-General, and Chief of Staff.</p>
