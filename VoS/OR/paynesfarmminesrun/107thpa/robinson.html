    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIRST ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> December 3, 1863.</p>
    <p> COLONEL: On the 22d of November, this division was posted at Bealeton, Liberty, and Licking
      Run, and on the 23d it was concentrated near Rappahannock Station. At daylight on the 26th, it
      started on the march, crossed the Rapidan at Culpeper Ford after dark, and bivouacked until 3
      o'clock next morning, when the march was resumed. About midnight I took up a position about a
      mile and a half to the left of Robertson's Tavern, and picketed one of the roads leading to
      the front. </p>
    <p> At daylight I moved the division about 1 mile to the right, and formed on the left of the
      First Division in two lines, with a reserve of four regiments and a double line of
      skirmishers. In this order the division advanced to the line afterward occupied by the army in
      front of the enemy's works on Mine Run. At this time there were no troops on my left, but the
      Third Corps, coming into position toward night, relieved my pickets on that flank. The enemy's
      works in my front appeared to be strong, and between us was a wide open space, with ravines,
      through which ran two streams, Mine Run and one of its branches. On the 30th, I was directed
      by the major-general commanding First Corps to advance my pickets across the stream in front,
      and build two bridges suitable for the passage of artillery and troops in column. The enemy's
      pickets occupied the crest of the hill immediately in front, and it became necessary to
      dislodge them. This was handsomely done by the Ninety-fourth Regiment of New York Volunteers,
      under Major Moffett, which advanced to the stream, exposed to severe musketry fire, crossed
      it, and, charging up the hill, drove away the rebel pickets, and took possession of the crest.
      Working parties were immediately set at work, who by night had completed two bridges, and were
      proceeding to build others, when I received orders to suspend the work, and, during the night,
      to withdraw my pickets to the position they occupied in the morning. The only casualties in
      the division are a few men wounded. </p>
    <p> At 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 1st of December, the division </p>
    <p> PAGE 694-48 OPERATIONS IN N. C., VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. XLI. [Series I. Vol. 29.
      Part I, Reports. Serial No. 48.] </p>
    <p> was relieved by a brigade of the Third Division, Fifth Corps, and marched to Germanna Ford,
      where I took position, and covered the crossing of the Fifth and Sixth Corps, and the picket
      details of the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Corps. The division was then withdrawn, with the
      exception of 100 men, who remained until the bridges were taken up, and then came over in
      boats. About noon on the 2d of December, I left the river and bivouacked near Stevensburg. The
      division left Stevensburg this morning and is now encamped, one brigade at Paoli Mills and one
      at Kelly's Ford. </p>
    <p> Very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> JNO. C. ROBINSON, <br/>Brigadier-General, Commanding Division. </p>
    <p> Lieut. Col. C. KINGSBURY, Jr., <br/>Assistant Adjutant-General, First Army Corps. </p>
