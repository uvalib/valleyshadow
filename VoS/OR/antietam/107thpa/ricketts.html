  <p>[CHAP. XXXI.] THE MARYLAND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 258-27 [Series I. Vol. 19. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 27.]</p>

  <p>No. 27.</p>

  <p>Report of Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division, of the battles of South Mountain and Antietam.</p>

  <p>HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, THIRD CORPS,</p>

  <p>Near Sharpsburg, September 21, 1862.</p>

  <p>GEN.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my division:</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 14th instant the division was under arms to march at daylight from its encampment near the Monocacy, and arrived at the east side of South Mountain, about a mile north of the turnpike, at 5 p. m., forming line of battle, First Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Duryea, on the extreme right; Third Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Hartsuff, in the center, and Second Brigade, Col. Christian, on the left. The route of the First and Third Brigades extended over very rough ground to the crest of the mountain, which was gallantly won. On the left the Second Brigade was sent to the relief of Gen. Doubleday's, which was hard pressed and nearly out of ammunition. It engaged the enemy with terrible effect, and drove him down the west side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>It being now too dark to advance, and the men much exhausted, operations ceased for the night. The next morning, the enemy having fled during the night, the division moved forward and encamped near Keedysville. The artillery was not engaged.</p>

  <p>The list of casualties is annexed: First Brigade, 5 killed, 16 wounded; Second Brigade, 2 killed, 6 wounded; Third Brigade, 2 killed, 4 wounded. Total killed and wounded, 35.</p>

  <p>From Keedysville on the afternoon of the 16th the division crossed</p>

  <p>__________</p>

  <p>* But see revised statement, p. 189</p>

  <p>the Antietam River and moved toward Sharpsburg, in direction of the enemy's left flank. Third Brigade was formed in line of battle while under from the enemy's artillery; Second Brigade toward the left of the Third, and First Brigade in reserve. The artillery, though within range, was placed as much under shelter as possible for the night.</p>

  <p>The morning of the 17th your order to advance and occupy the woods in front was being carried out, when Gen. Hartsuff, who was examining the ground, was severely wounded, and the services of this valuable officer were lost. The brigade moved forward, supported by Second Brigade on the left and First Brigade on the right, all advancing with the artillery, Battery F, First Pennsylvania, under Capt. Matthews, and Capt. Thompson's Independent Pennsylvania Battery, each consisting of four 3-inch rifled guns. Taking advantage of the ground, both batteries opened with destructive effect, officers and men displaying great coolness while exposed to a severe fire of artillery and infantry.</p>

  <p>The division gained the outer edge of the wood, and kept up a fearful fire for four hours, until the ammunition being exhausted and the supports coming up, it was compelled to retire to refill boxes, after which the division joined the rest of the corps on the right, near the turnpike, and, with the exception of a brisk fire from the enemy's artillery, under which they stood, was not employed again during the day only to hold that position.</p>

  <p>I commend the general good conduct of the division, and would mention particularly Brig.-Gen. Duryea; Col. Coulte, Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers; Col. Lyle, Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers; Capt. E. W. Matthews, First Pennsylvania artillery, and Capt. James Thompson, Independent Pennsylvania Artillery; also the names in the subjoined list, marked B. Indeed, both officers and men displayed courage under a severe fire.</p>

  <p>Casualties as per annexed list, marked C*: Out of 3,158 taken into action 1,051 were killed and wounded--153 killed and 898 wounded.</p>

  <p>Of my staff I take pleasure in mentioning the distinguished gallantry of Capt. John W. Williams, assistant adjutant-general; also Capt. Benjamin W. Richards, aide-de-camp, and Capt. F. Gerker, commissary of subsistence.</p>

  <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

  <p>JAMES B. RICKETTS,</p>

  <p>Brig.-Gen., Commanding Division.</p>

  <p>Maj. Gen. JOSEPH HOOKER.</p>
