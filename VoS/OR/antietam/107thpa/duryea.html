    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. Abram Duryea, U. S. Army, of operations September 17. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIRST Brig., SECOND DIV., FIRST CORPS, </p>
    <p> Near Sharpsburg, September 20, 1862. </p>
    <p> SIR: I have the honor to report, for the information of the general commanding the division,
      that on the morning of the 17th, at early dawn, we took the position assigned us on the field
      of battle as a reserve in support of Gen. Hartsuff for the engagements of the day. The action
      opened at daylight, but, owing to the early fall of Gen. Hartsuff, we quickly gained the right
      of the division and immediately became hotly engaged with the enemy. The position of the enemy
      was in a corn-field slightly oblique with the center lines, forming an acute angle with the
      left of the first line. There were two batteries on our right, which opened with terrible
      effect upon the enemy. Our infantry, maintaining their ground, poured in a flank fire with
      great execution. The conflict continued until there were only about 100 men of the One hundred
      and fourth and One hundred and fifth New York Regiments left on the right of the brigade. At
      this point the cannoneers of one of the batteries were compelled to abandon their guns. The
      remnants of the two regiments above named rallied behind a large rock and continued to pour in
      a deadly fire until re-enforcements came up and covered the guns. The enemy's dead upon the
      field were almost in as perfect line as if on dress parade. It gives me pleasure to say that
      the men could not have fought with more determination and gallantry. </p>
    <p> Yours, most respectfully, </p>
    <p> A. DURYEA, </p>
    <p> Brig.-Gen. </p>
    <p> Capt. JOHN W. WILLIAMS, </p>
    <p> Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
