    <p> Report of Capt. James MacThompson, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Infantry, First
      Brigade, of the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTH PENNSYLVANIA VOLS., </p>
    <p> Camp near Mercerville, Md., October 7, 1862. </p>
    <p> SIR: I have the honor to make the following report respecting the One hundred and seventh
      Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers in the two actions, September 14 and 17, at South Mountain
      and Antietam: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> The coveted ground gained by our force, and night coming on, no farther advance was made,
      and both armies lay on their arms, ready for the fierce fight of tomorrow, our brigade having
      reached a point less than half a mile in rear of the outer pickets. </p>
    <p> At early dawn, agreeably to orders, I moved the One hundred and seventh Regiment by the
      flank to the field on the right. Here, forming column by divisions, we moved forward through a
      narrow strip of timber, gained the night previous, into a plowed field, in which, opposite
      side, Thompson's Pennsylvania battery had just gotten into position. Advancing half way across
      the field to within easy supporting distance of the battery, we halted for about five minutes,
      the enemy's shell and round shot haying about us like hail, killing and wounding some of our
      poor fellows, but not injuring the morale of the regiment in the least. Shortly we were again
      advancing and passing the battery, and over a clover field reached the spot so frequently
      mentioned in the reports of this battle--the corn filed. Deploying into line, we entered the
      field and pushed rapidly through to the other side. Here we found, in different positions,
      three full brigades of the enemy. We opened fire immediately upon those in front, and in
      fifteen minutes compelled them to fall back. Receiving re-enforcements, however, he soon
      regained his position, and an unequal conflict of nearly three-quarters of an hour resulted in
      forcing us back through the corn-field. Our brigade had, however, done its work. We had held
      at bay a force of the enemy numerically five times our superior for considerably more than an
      hour, and at one time driving them. We were now relieved by re-enforcements coming up, and
      retired to the rear. During the balance of the day we were constantly on the qui vive, but
      were not again called into action save to support batteries. </p>
    <p> In the battle of Antietam the One hundred and seventh Regiment had 190 men engaged, and lost
      19 men killed and 45 wounded, a total loss of 85 killed and wounded in both engagements. Too
      much cannot be said of the dashing bravery of both officers and men at South Mountain or of
      their heroic firmness and cool bearing when standing still in line of battle at Antietam.
      They, for more than an four, received [and returned] the fire of a force infinitely superior. </p>
    <p> With much respect, I am, sir, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> JAMES MacTHOMSON, </p>
    <p> Capt., Comdg. One hundred and seventh Regt. Pennsylvania Vols., in the engagements of
      September 14 and 17, 1862. </p>
    <p> Lieut. KENNY, </p>
    <p> Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
