    <p> HEADQUARTERS JONES' BRIGADE, </p>
    <p> January 21, 1863. </p>
    <p> Maj.: In obedience to orders received from corps headquarters, I respectfully submit the
      following report of the operations of Jackson's division during the period which I had the
      honor to command it, being from September &amp; to December 12, 1862: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> BATTLE OF SHARPSBURG. </p>
    <p> Resting for two hours in a grove a mile from Sharpsburg, the division was again put in
      motion, and took up its position on the extreme left, its right resting on the Sharpsburg and
      Hagerstown turnpike. A double line was formed, the front, composed of Jones and Winder's
      brigades, placed in an open field, under the immediate command of Col. Grigsby; Taliaferro's
      and Starke's brigades, forming the reserve, places at the edge of a wood, under the immediate
      command of Brig.-Gen. Starke; the whole under the command of Brig. Gen. J. R. Jones. This
      disposition was placed in the road on the right. A battery of the enemy, about 500 yards in
      front and to the right, was playing upon the troops of Hood's division, which was on my right.
      Poague opened briskly upon it and silenced it in twenty minutes. The skirmishers were warmly
      engaged until night. The troops lay on their arms all night, the silence of which was broken
      by occasional firing by the skirmishers. </p>
    <p> At the dawn of day on the 17th the battle opened fiercely. A storm of shell and grape fell
      upon the division from several batteries in front, and at very short range, and from batteries
      of heavy guns on the extreme right, which enfiladed the position of the division and took it
      in reverse. These batteries were gallantly replied to by the batteries of the division,
      Poague's, Carpenter's, Brockenbrough's, Raine's, Caxke's, and Wooding's. It was during this
      almost unprecedented iron storm that a shell exploded a little above my head, and so stunned
      and injured me that I was rendered unfit for duty, and retired from the field, turning over
      the command to Brig.-Gen. Starke, who a half an hour afterward advanced his lines to meet the
      infantry of the enemy, which was approaching. The infantry became at once engaged, and the
      gallant and generous Starke fell, pierced by three balls, and survived but a few moments. His
      fall cast a gloom over the troops. They never for a moment faltered, but rushed upon the enemy
      and drove him back. The struggle continued for several hours, the enemy all the while
      receiving re-enforcements, and the division, not numbering over 1,600 men at the beginning of
      the fight, having no support, was finally compelled to tune moment, Col. Grigsby, commanding
      the division, rallied its shattered columns and joined Gen. Early, and drove the enemy half a
      mile from the field, capturing many prisoners and covering the field with the dead and wounded
      of the enemy. After this repulse, the division was ordered back to a grove to rest and get
      ammunition, when in the evening it again advanced to the support of a battery, but did not
      again become engaged with the enemy. </p>
    <p> In this bloody conflict the "Old Stonewall Division" lost nothing of its fair name and fame.
      Having won a world-wide fame by its valor and endurance in the splendid campaign in the
      valley, it entered upon another series of fights, commencing at Richmond and going through
      Ceder Run, Manassa, Harper's Ferry, and Sharpsburg, entering the last weary and worn, and
      reduced to the numbers of a small brigade, with its officers stricken down in its many fierce
      engagements, closing with a colonel commanding the division, captains commanding brigades, and
      lieutenants commanding regiments. In this fight every officer and man was a hero, and it would
      be invidious to mention particular names. </p>
    <p> Winder's brigade was commanded successively by Col. Grigsby and Major (now Lieut.-Col.)
      Williams, Fifth Virginia Regiment; Jones' brigade by Capts. [John E.] Penn, [A. C.] PAGE, and
      [R. W.] Withers, the first two losing a leg; Taliaferro's brigade by Col. J. W. Jackson and
      Col. Sheffield; Starke's brigade by Gen. Starke, Col. L. A. Stafford, Ninth Louisiana
      Regiment, and Col. Edmund Pendleton, Fifteenth Louisiana Regiment. </p>
    <p> Inclosed are reports of the various brigade commanders, which give more particularly the
      parts take by their brigades. </p>
    <p> The list of casualties has already been furnished, amounting to about 700, killed and
      wounded. </p>
    <p> This brief report is respectfully submitted. </p>
    <p> J. R. JONES, </p>
    <p> Brig.-Gen., Commanding. </p>
    <p> Maj. PENDLETON, </p>
