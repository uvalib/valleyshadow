  <p>This artillery, which had wintered near Frederickshall, on the Virginia Central Railroad, and subsequently, as the spring opened, distributed in grazing camps near Liberty Mills, Orange County, received orders to march on May 4, and was early on the 5th all concentrated at Locust Grove, on the old turnpike between Orange Court-House and Fredericksburg, near the infantry of the Second Corps. Nelson's battalion was pushed forward with Gen. Edward Johnson's infantry division, which was then deployed across the turnpike, the enemy, who had crossed, at Germanna Ford, being in front. Milledge's battery was posted on the right of the road in front of Jone's brigade, but as the movement of the enemy required the brigade to change position, the battery was withdrawn.</p>

  <p>The enemy being repulsed with loss in an attack then made, Gen. Ewell established his line without further difficulty. The dense growth of the Wilderness left few openings for the use of artillery. Some of Nelson's guns were, however, posted on the right on a commanding ridge, with a small field, in front, about a mile from the Lacy house. Two of his guns were also placed on the road leading to the Germanna plank road to operate with the troops of the left wing of the corps. The artillery thus posted was used several times during the day with good effect in repelling partial attacks of the enemy.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>W. N. PENDLETON,<br />
  Brig. Gen. and Chief of Arty., Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

  <p>Lieut. Col. W. H. TAYLOR,<br />
  Asst. Adjt. Gen., Army of Northern Virginia.</p>
