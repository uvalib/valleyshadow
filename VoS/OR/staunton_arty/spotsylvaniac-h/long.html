    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. Armistead L. Long, C.S. Army, Chief of Artillery, Second Army Corps, of
      operations May 4-31. </p>
    <p> STAUNTON, November 25, 1864. </p>
    <p> MAJ.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the artillery of
      the Second Corps from May 4 to 31, 1864: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> The opposing forces were during the 7th only occupied in light skirmishing. I was directed
      by Gen. Ewell to make a reconnaissance in the direction of Germanna Ford. Taking one brigade
      of infantry and two battalions of artillery. I advanced to the Germanna plank road, striking
      it about a mile from the ford. Two or three regiments of cavalry were occupying the road at
      this point. These were soon driven away by a few well-directed shots, a small number
      retreating toward the ford, and the rest in the direction of the main body of Grant's army. It
      was discovered that the enemy had almost entirely abandoned the ford and road. It was evident
      that they were leaving our front. Late in the afternoon I was ordered by Gen. Ewell to hold
      myself in readiness to move. Nelson, Hardaway, and Cutshaw were directed to encamp at
      Verdierville. Braxton and Page were ordered to remain with the infantry and move with it. </p>
    <p> PAGE 1086-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I,
      Reports. Serial No. 67.] </p>
    <p> The enemy was found on the morning of the 8th to be shifting his position toward
      Spotsylvania Court-House. Our whole army also moved in that direction, and arrived at that
      place on the same evening. A few guns were put in position near the Court-House. The infantry
      of Gen. Ewell's corps bivouacked on the position it was to occupy in line of battle. On the
      9th Gen. Ewell's line was accurately established and fortified. Braxton's and Page's
      battalions were put in position along the line of infantry. This position, like the one at the
      Wilderness, was not well adapted to the effective use of artillery, the view being obstructed
      by forest and old field pine. Gen. Hill's position to the right of Gen. Ewell afforded a
      better field. The artillery was, however, carefully posted, with the view of rendering the
      most effective support to the infantry. On the morning of the 10th Braxton and Page were
      relieved by Nelson and Hardaway, the former occupying the position on Johnson's front, and the
      latter those on Rodes' front. In the afternoon the enemy, having massed heavily in front of
      Doles' brigade, under cover of a dense pine thicket, made a sudden attack upon this brigade,
      broke it, and entered our works, overrunning and capturing Smith's battery, of Hardaway's
      battalion. Our infantry was soon rallied, and being re-enforced repulsed the enemy and
      recaptured the battery. The captain and some of his men were made prisoners and carried off.
      Hardaway's guns were principally engaged in this attack and were served with gallantry and
      effect. Smith's guns being without cannoneers were manned by Capt. Garber and his men, of
      Cutshaw's battalion. In this attack the gallant Maj. Watson, of Hardaway's battalion, was
      mortally wounded. Lieut.-Col. Hardaway was also wounded, but did not leave the field. </p>
    <p> On the 11th Cutshaw's and Page's battalions were brought up and put in position, and a
      portion of Hardaway's battalion was relieved. The enemy made no decided attack upon any part
      of our line during the day. Late in the afternoon I received orders to have all the artillery
      which was difficult of access removed from the lines before dark, and was informed that it was
      desirable that everything should be in readiness to move during the night; that the enemy was
      believed to be moving from our front. I immediately ordered all the artillery on Johnson's
      front, except two batteries of Cutshaw's battalion, to be withdrawn, as it had to pass through
      a wood by a narrow and difficult road, and the night bid fair to be very dark. The withdrawal
      of the artillery proved to be very unfortunate, as the enemy instead of retreating massed
      heavily on Johnson's front during the night for the purpose of attacking. </p>
    <p> At 3.30 a.m. on the 12th I received a note from Gen. Johnson, indorsed by Gen. Ewell,
      directing me to replace immediately the artillery that had been withdrawn the evening before;
      that the enemy was preparing to attack. I immediately ordered Page's battalion to proceed with
      all haste to the assistance of Gen. Johnson. He moved his battalion with great rapidity, but
      just as he reached the point to be occupied the enemy broke Johnson's line and enveloped and
      captured all of Page's guns except two, which were brought off by Capt. Montgomery. At the
      same time two batteries twenty guns-twelve from Page and eight from Cutshaw. Had the artillery
      been in position the result might have been different, or had the weather been favorable this
      disaster might have been </p>

      Serial No. 67.] </p>
    <p> avoided; but the morning was so dark and foggy that it was with difficulty that we could
      distinguish friend from foe. Every effort was made to drive the enemy from our lines, but
      stimulated by a successful assault, and by the desire to hold the large number of guns he had
      taken, he most stubbornly opposed every effort to dislodge him. He was, however, so hotly
      pressed that he was forced to abandon most of our works, and was prevented from carrying of
      during the day the guns he had captured. </p>
    <p> The enemy threw his whole force in this attack and kept it up till late in the afternoon.
      Every gun that we could bring to bear was put in position, and officers and men displayed
      great coolness and skill in the service of them. Maj. Cutshaw and Capt. Garber, with the men
      who escaped on the capture of the batteries, succeeded in reaching some of the guns which the
      enemy could not remove, and turning them upon the enemy, used them with great effect. Capt.
      Montgomery was put in position with one gun in a ravine to the right of the Harris house,
      where he remained all day actively engaged at short range. He exhausted the ammunition from
      three caissons, which was used with effect. The conspicuous gallantry of these officers called
      forth general admiration. About 12 m., on account of the heavy pressure the enemy was making
      on our lines and the loss we had sustained in artillery in the early part of the action, I
      found it necessary to ask for re-enforcements of artillery. Col. Cabell and Lieut.-Col.
      McIntosh, with parts of their battalions, were sent to me. I am much obliged to these officers
      for the valuable service they rendered on this occasion. Col. Cabell was put in position on
      the left of Hardaway's battalion (this battalion was now commanded by Capt. Dance, Hardaway
      having been wounded in the early part of the day), McIntosh was held in position at the Harris
      house, with the exception of two guns, which were posted on the hill above the McCool house.
      Col. Carter commanded in the morning the artillery posted on the hill above the Court-House,
      but later in the day he joined me in front of the main attack. He rendered valuable
      assistance; his coolness and judgment everywhere had their effect. I was also ably assisted by
      Lieut. S. V. Southall, assistant adjutant-general, and by Lieut.-Col. Braxton, whose battalion
      was engaged throughout the day. Lieut.-Col. Nelson occupied a position on the Court-House hill
      and handsomely assisted in repelling an attack on that portion of the line. At night a new
      line was established, and all the artillery was withdrawn from the positions occupied during
      the day and put upon it. </p>
    <p> The next day was occupied in reorganizing. Maj. Cutshaw was assigned to the command of
      Hardaway's battalion; Maj. Stribling was also assigned to this command. Maj. Page was put in
      command of the remnants of his own and Cutshaw's battalions. </p>
    <p> Everything remained quiet along the lines till the morning of the 18th. The enemy, about 9
      a.m., advanced a heavy force against our new line. He was allowed to come within good canister
      range of our breast-works. Carter's division of artillery then opened a most murderous fire of
      canister and spherical case-shot, which at once arrested his advance, threw his columns into
      confusion, and forced him to a disorderly retreat. His loss was very heavy; ours was nothing.
      This attack fairly illustrates the immense power of artillery well handled. A select force of
      10,000 or 12,000 infantry was broken and driven from the field in less than thirty minutes by
      twenty-nine pieces </p>
    <p> PAGE 1088-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I,
      Reports. Serial No. 67.] </p>
    <p> of artillery alone. In the afternoon [19th], Gen. Ewell having determined to make a flank
      movement, Lieut.-Col. Braxton was directed to accompany him with six guns of select caliber.
      After proceeding 2 or 3 miles the road were found to be impracticable for artillery, and
      Braxton was ordered to return to his former position. The Second Corps, on the 21st, moved to
      the right to Mud Tavern, there taking the Telegraph road to Hanover Junction. Arrived at that
      place on the 22d. </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> Being absent from my command, I am unable to append a list of casualties. The chief loss was
      upon the capture of Custhaw's and Page's battalions on May 12. </p>
    <p> This report would have been submitted at a much earlier period had it not been for the
      difficulties incident to an active campaign in getting sub-reports, and my own lines. </p>
    <p> I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> A. L. LONG, <br/>Brig.-Gen., Chief of Artillery. </p>
