    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. Jubal A. Early, C. S. Army, commanding Ewell's division, with abstract
      from field return. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. EWELL'S DIVISION, </p>
    <p> December 27, 1862. </p>
    <p> CAPT.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this division in
      the action of the 13th instant, near Fredericksburg: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> Being posted at first in the second line, I did not have any immediate use for the batteries
      of the division, and therefore, after placing them under the charge of Capt. Latimer, as
      stated, I requested Col. Crutchfield, chief of artillery for the corps, to make such use of
      them as the emergencies of the day might require. In a short time he detached two batteries to
      a position on the left of Gen. [A. P.] Hill's line; these were Capt. Latimer's own battery and
      Capt. [William D.] Brown's battery, both being under charge of Capt. Latimer, who accompanied
      them. These batteries did not operate in my view, but I am informed that they did excellent
      service, Capt. Latimer having repulsed the </p>

    <p> enemy with canister after a regiment of infantry sent to support him had retired. Capt.
      D'Aquin's and Capt. Garber's batteries were also detached to the right of the railroad, and
      placed under charge of Gen. Stuart's chief of artillery, Maj. Pelham, and likewise did
      excellent service, as I am informed. Late in the evening, Capt. [J. McD.] Carrington, with his
      battery, relieved the two which had been sent to the left under Capt. Latimer, and next
      morning did good service. </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> The reports of brigade commanders and also of Capt. Latimer, acting chief of artillery, are
      herewith submitted. A list of killed, wounded, and missing has been heretofore forwarded, from
      which it will be seen that the total killed was 102; wounded, 726; missing, 105.* Most of the
      wounded are but slightly injured, and about 50 of the missing, being entirely from Lawton's
      brigade, fell into the hands of the enemy, the greater part being, in all probability,
      wounded. </p>
    <p> I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> J. A. EARLY, </p>
    <p> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Division. </p>
    <p> Capt. A. S. PENDLETON, </p>
    <p> Asst. Adjt. Gen. Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. </p>
