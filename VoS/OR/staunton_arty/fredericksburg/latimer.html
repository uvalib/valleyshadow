  <p>No. 322.</p>

  <p>Report of Capt. J. W. Latimer, Acting Chief of Artillery.</p>

  <p>December 25, 1862.</p>

  <p>CAMP NEAR PORT ROYAL, VA.,</p>

  <p>MAJ.: In obedience to orders, I would most respectfully beg leave to submit the following report of the operations of the batteries of Ewell's division in the engagements with the enemy, near Fredericksburg, on the 13th and 14th of the present month:</p>

  <p>Early on the morning of the 13th, I was ordered by Gen. Early to take command of the batteries of the division as acting chief of artillery, and I immediately reported to Col. Crutchfield, chief of artillery Second Corps, for instructions. He ordered me to park the batteries in a sheltered spot behind a range of hills about half a mile behind our line of battle and there await orders. He shortly after returned and directed me to take my own battery, under command of Lieut. [W. A.] Tanner, and Capt. Brown's, under command of Lieut. [John E.] Plater, to the relief of some batteries occupying a position near the extreme left of the line formed by the Second Corps, and to report to Brig.-Gen. Pender, whose brigade then occupied this position. Only five guns were required, and by direction of Gen. Pender I relieved five of the guns at that point by the two rifles belonging to my battery, and the three rifles composing Capt. Brown's. The position on which these guns were posted was not a very advantageous one, but the best that could be selected. It was a small rising in an open field, with a wood to the right, in which a portion of Gen. A. P. Hill's division was posted, and on the left was a ditch and bank running parallel with the railroad, behind which a portion of Gen. Hood's division was posted. In front, at the distance of about a mile, were four of the enemy's batteries, with lines of skirmishers considerably advanced in</p>

  <p>CHAP. XXXIII.] BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG, VA. PAGE 669-31 [Series I. Vol. 21. Serial No. 31.]</p>

  <p>front of said batteries. We were exposed to quite a heavy fire from these batteries, but gained the position without loss. My orders were to fire only at infantry unless the batteries advanced, which orders I obeyed, firing only once at them, an then only to cover the advance of Gen. Law's brigade, which was made late in the day. I was kept constantly engaged at this point from 11 a.m. [when I gained it] until night, repelling repeated advanced of the enemy by the use of canister. I relieved these batteries that night by Capt. Carrington's battery, which engaged the enemy next morning upon the advance of their skirmishers, successfully driving them back.</p>

  <p>Shortly after moving to the left with the batteries spoken of above, Capt. D'Aquin's and the Staunton Artillery, Lieut. [A. W.] Garber, were ordered by Col. Crutchfield to the right of our lines, to report to Maj. [John] Pelham, where they were engaged most of the day. Not having personally superintend their movements during the day, I am unable to describe them minutely. Capt. Dement's battery was ordered to the front on 14th, where it remained in battery until we marched to this point, without, however, becoming engaged at any time.</p>

  <p>We have to lament the loss of Capt. L. E. D'Aquin, of the Louisiana Guard Artillery. A more gallant officer or more worthy man never fell upon the field of battle. Also Lieut. [James] Grayson, Capt. Brown's battery. He fell nobly, at his post.</p>

  <p>The losses in the different batteries are as follows:</p>

  <p>Louisiana Guard Artillery [Capt. D'Aquin]: Capt. D'Aquin killed, 1 private wounded, 2 horses disabled, 1 gun disabled.</p>

  <p>Capt. Brown's battery [Lieut. Plater]: Killed, Lieut. Grayson and 1 private; wounded, 9; 16 horses disabled; also 1 gun and 1 caisson.</p>

  <p>Staunton Artillery [Lieut. Garber]: None killed or wounded; 1 horse disabled, and 1 gun carriage, afterward repaired.</p>

  <p>Courtney Artillery [Lieut. Tanner]: Killed, 1 private; wounded, Lieut. Tanner and 6 privates; 8 horses disabled.</p>

  <p>Capt. Carrington's battery: Wounded,4; horses disabled, 7.</p>

  <p>Capt. Dement's battery: None killed or wounded; horses disabled, 4. I am pleased to be able to say that all the officers and men under my command acted in a highly creditable manner, promptly and cheerfully obeying all orders and standing up well to their posts.</p>

  <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>

  <p>J. W. LATIMER,</p>

  <p>Capt. and Acting Chief of Artillery, Ewell's Division.</p>

  <p>Maj. S. HALE,</p>

  <p>Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Ewell's Division.</p>
