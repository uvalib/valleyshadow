  <p>Report of Lieut. Col. George W. Frederick, Two hundred and ninth Pennsylvania Infantry, of operations March 25.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. 209TH REGT. PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS,</p>

  <p>March 28, 1865.</p>

  <p>LIEUT.: In compliance with circular from headquarters Third Division, dated March 27, 1865, I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my regiment in the action of the 25th instant:</p>

  <p>About -- o'clock I was requested by an aide of Gen. Willcox to form my regiment and move it to a point near the signal station, a short distance in rear of the Dunn House Battery. I was then conducted by the same aide to the front and right of the Dunn House Battery. I had scarcely got my regiment into position when the same aide informed me that it was Gen. Hartranft's order that I should immediately, with the Two hundredth Pennsylvania Volunteers, charge the hill in my front, which was then held by the enemy. I at once gave the order to charge, and the regiment moved forward, under a very heavy fire of musketry and artillery, gaining a line of works running across the open field over which we were advancing. Halting for a moment, we again advanced, gaining a ditch near the hill occupied</p>

  <p>23 R R--VOL XLVI, PT I</p>

  <p>PAGE 354-95 N. AND SE. VA., N. C., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LVIII. [Series I. Vol. 46. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 95.]</p>

  <p>by the enemy. Here we were shelled from both front and rear. It was here also that the gallant Lieut. Hugh Jones, commanding Company C, fell, pierced through the heart by a musket-ball. We remained in the ditch for some time, when, noticing the enemy retreating, we poured into them a murderous fire, which was continued until I saw the Two hundredth Pennsylvania Volunteers, which was on my left, preparing, as I supposed, to move forward. I immediately ordered my regiment forward, and forward we went, not an officer or man halting or faltering until our advance line was gained and our colors planted on the works, and I am satisfied that they were the first colors planted on the works.</p>

  <p>My officers and men all did their duty so well that it would seem invidious to make any distinction; yet I feel it my duty to make honorable mention of Sergeants Stiles and Humphreys, color bearers, who were always to be seen in advance.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of prisoners were sent to the rear, estimated at 350.</p>

  <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>G. W. FREDERICK,<br />
  Lieut.-Col., Cmdg. Regt.</p>

  <p>[Lieut. BUFFINGTON, Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.]</p>
