    <p> Report of Col. Charles W. Diven, Two hundredth Pennsylvania Infantry, commanding First
      Brigade, of operations March 25. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIRST Brig., THIRD DIV., NINTH ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> March 30, 1865. </p>
    <p> MAJ.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by my brigade in the
      operations of the 25th instant, near Fort Stedman: </p>
    <p> The Two hundredth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, Lieut. Col. W. H. H. McCall commanding, and
      the Two hundred and ninth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, Lieut. Col. George W. Frederick
      commanding, were engaged on the right of the line, under the personal direction of the general
      commanding the division, and I respectfully refer to the reports of these regiments, giving
      detailed accounts of the movements of each. At about 5 a.m. the Two hundred and eighth Regt.
      Pennsylvania Volunteers, Lieut.-Col. Heintzelman commanding, was moved into position on the
      right of Gen. McLaughlen's headquarters, left resting within about 100 yards of Fort Haskell,
      facing northward. There were a number of squads from the Third Brigade, First Division,
      numbering some 200 in all, under command of several captains and lieutenants, which I placed
      on the left of the Two hundred and eight Pennsylvania Volunteers, and which acted under my
      orders. The Two hundred and eighth Regiment, upon arriving on the ground, discovered the
      enemy, and immediately fired two or three well-directed volleys on him, causing him to fall
      back in some confusion to the cover of a ravine. The regiment then advanced and drove him out
      of the ravine to the cover of Battery No. 12 and the lines of works connecting it with Fort
      Stedman, capturing about 100 prisoners. In this position it remained until about 7.30 a.m.,
      when orders were received, through an orderly from your headquarters, that Gen. Hartranft
      would charge in fifteen minutes, and before the order could be sent to Lieut.-Col. Heintzelman
      the other troops of the division moved forward in the charge. Col. Heintzelman seeing this,
      also moved forward in handsome style, retaking Battery No. 12, and the main line on the right
      of it, capturing-battle-flags, about-prisoners, and-small-arms. </p>

    <p> While this charge was made I was wounded by the explosion of a shell, after which the
      command of the brigade devolved upon Lieut. Col. W. H. H. McCall, Two hundredth Pennsylvania
      Volunteers, the senior officer present. </p>
    <p> I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> C. W. DIVEN, <br/>Col. Two hundredth Pennsylvania Volunteers, Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
    <p> Maj. JOHN D. BERTOLETTE, <br/>Asst. Adjt. Gen., Third Division, Ninth Army Corps. </p>
