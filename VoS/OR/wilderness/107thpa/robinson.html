  <i>Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson commanded the Second Division of the Army of the Potomac which included the 107th Pa. Inf.</i> CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 592-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.] No. 119. Report of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division, of operations May 3-8. WASHINGTON, D. C., April 25, 1866. GEN.: In compliance with your request I have the honor to submit the following memorandum of the operations of the Second Division, Fifth Army Corps, from Culpeper Court-House to Spotsylvania Court-House in May, 1864: The division left its encampment near Culpeper Court-House and Mitchell's Station at midnight on the 3d of May; crossed the Rapidan at Germanna Ford on the 4th, and encamped that night near the Old Wilderness Tavern. On the morning of the 5th it started again on the march, taking the dirt road to Parker's Store, preceded by the Third and Fourth Division of the Fifth Corps. The advance of the column having encountered the enemy, my division was halted and formed in column near Lacy's house and held in reserve. The Fourth (Wadsworth's) Division, having been ordered to attack the enemy, I sent my Third Brigade to support it. In this movement the brigade met with considerable loss. Soon after Griffin's (First) division became heavily engaged on the road leading to Robertson's Tavern, and I was directed to go to his support. I moved my First and Second Brigade rapidly out on the road, and at the close of the engagement relieved Griffin's division, which was withdrawn to the rear after suffering heavy loss. My First Brigade, under command of Col. Lyle, Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, occupied the line, having the Sixth Corps on our right. In the afternoon, Gen. Wadsworth having been directed to take part in the heavy engagement going on our left, with your permission I accompanied him, taking with me my second Brigade, commanded by Brig.-Gen. Baxter. Soon after entering the woods we became engaged with the enemy and drove him steadily before us until dark put an end to the affair, and I returned to the main body of my division. In this engagement my assistant inspector-general, Lieut.-Col. Allen, Twelfth Massachusetts Volunteers, a most worthy and meritorious officer, fell mortally wounded while riding at my side. The command became engaged again the next morning and suffered severely. Gen. Wadsworth was killed and Gen. Baxter wounded. On the evening of the 5th, while my Second Brigade was engaged on the left, the First Brigade on the turnpike road was ordered to advance against the enemy, and the Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers having to cross an open field, was exposed to a terrific fire of musketry and artillery, which nearly destroyed the regiment. For some reason, never explained, the troops on the right of this brigade, although protected by the woods, failed to advance with it. On the afternoon of the 6th I was ordered to send one brigade to the support of Maj.-Gen. Hancock on the Brock road. Soon after I was directed to send another, and went with it myself. I formed these brigades in two lines on the right of the Second Corps, and remained there until the afternoon of the next day. After seeing my division well established in this position, and having ordered rifle-pits constructed, I rode to Gen. Hancock's headquarters. He informed me that he had received orders to attack the enemy, and desired me to get ready to assault. I immediately returned to my command, made the necessary dispositions for the movement, and awaited orders. About two hours after I heard sharp musketry on my left, and Maj.-Gen. Birney came to me in great haste, stating that the enemy had broken through our lines and Gen. Hancock was cut off. I asked him what force had broken through, and he replied three or four divisions. I at once faced my second line about and made proper dispositions to received an attack on my left and rear. Gen. Birney then asked my opinion as to the propriety of changing the position of the whole line. I replied, "Before doing that you had better report what has occurred to Gen. Meade." He said he had already done so. While we were conversing on the subject a staff officer came up and informed Gen. Birney that Gen. Hancock desired to see him. I learned soon after that instead of breaking through our lines the enemy had been repulsed, but not until after one division of the Second Corps had been driven from the breast-works. At 9 p.m. on the 7th the army commenced the flank movement to the left, the Fifth Corps leading, with my division in advance. Our march was impeded by darkness, bad roads, small streams, and fallen timber; yet, knowing the importance of reaching Spotsylvania Court-House before the enemy, the troops were urged forward as rapidly as possible. At daylight on the morning of the 8th I overtook the advance guard of cavalry, which was engaged with the enemy. I immediately deployed two brigades, holding the third in reserve, pushed by the cavalry (commanded by Brig.-Gen. Merritt), and drove the light troops and artillery of the enemy from one position to another, through woods and across open fields for about 3 miles. Coming to another field I could plainly see the enemy's line in the edge of timber beyond. I here halted and reformed the division, and again advanced to the attack. The division was soon checked and it became evident that here was the enemy's main line, but his strength was undeveloped. Knowing that my brave men would followed wherever I led the way, I placed myself at their head and led them forward to the attack. At this moment a part of Griffin's division advanced out of the woods on my right. Cheering my men on, we had arrived within 50 yards of the works when I received a musket-ball in the left knee, resulting in amputation of my left. This unfortunate wound caused the result I feared, for as I was borne off the field I saw that our troops were repulsed and the attack had failed. Our loss this day was heavy, but I have never been able to learn the number of killed and wounded. It was my intention to have made a full report of these operations, but having failed to receive the reports of my brigade commanders, I have been unable to do so. This brief statement, made at this late day, is necessarily imperfect, but is correct so far as it goes. I regret exceedingly that I am not able to do full justice to the brave officers and men who served so long and faithfully under my command, and whose gallantry has been conspicuous on many hard-fought fields. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, JNO. C. ROBINSON, Brevet Maj.-Gen. Maj. Gen. G. K. WARREN, Late Commander Fifth Army Corps.
