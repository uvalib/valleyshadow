  <i>Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg commanded the Second Division of the Army of the Potomac which included the 16th Pa. Cav.</i> CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 853-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.] No. 200. Report of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg, U.S. Army, commanding Second Division, of operations May 4--July 7. HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, July 7, 1864. COL.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Second Division, Cavalry Corps, since crossing the Rapidan, in the general movement of the Army of the Potomac, on the 4th of May until the present date: Extending as these operations do over a space of two months, in which time the division accomplished in various directions a march of over 700 miles, and distinctively engaged the enemy ten times, they can only be reported in the most general terms. This division at the time of crossing the Rapidan had an aggregate strength of 4,793 commissioned officers and enlisted men. Crossing the Rapidan on May 4, at Ely's Ford, the division marched in front of the Second Corps to Chancellorsville, and thence to Alrich's, on the Fredericksburg plank road. On the 5th marched to Todd's Tavern. At this point found the Third Division, the rear of which was being pressed by a force of the enemy's cavalry. A [two] regiments (First New Jersey and First Massachusetts Cavalry) of the First Brigade, Brig. Gen. H. E. Davies, jr., commanding, engaged the pursuing enemy, and, after a sharp skirmish, drove them a distance of 3 miles, and beyond Corbin's Bridge. The loss of the First New Jersey and First Massachusetts Cavalry in this skirmish was a total of 91 killed and wounded. On the 6th, at Todd's Tavern, the division was engaged skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry during the entire day. The whole force of the enemy appeared to be dismounted, and studiously kept under the cover of the dense woods surrounding the tavern. Their long extended lines were everywhere protected by hastily constructed defenses. The 6th closed without any decisive result. On the 7th the First Division of Cavalry, Brig.-Gen. Merritt commanding, having arrived at Todd's Tavern, the two divisions (First and Second) engaged the enemy. The brigades of the Second Division were disposed as follows: The Second Brigade, Col. J. I. Gregg commanding, on the extreme right, and covering the road leading to Shady Grove; the First Brigade, Brig. Gen. H. E. Davies, jr., commanding, on the extreme left. Both of the brigades were hotly engaged, and both defeated the enemy in their front. The regiments engaged were all dismounted and fought on foot. On the 8th, at Todd's Tavern, the Second Brigade was engaged during the day in a skirmish with the enemy on the road leading to Shady Grove. On the evening of the 8th the Second Division moved to Silver's, and camped with the other divisions of the corps. On the 9th the Cavalry Corps marched to the North Anna, the Second Division being the rear division in the column. At New Market the First Brigade, marching in rear, was attacked by the enemy's cavalry following in pursuit. The attack was spirited, and kept up until night, the regiments in rear. Sixth Ohio and First Pennsylvania Regiments of cavalry, successfully resisted and repelled the repeated attacks. On the morning of the 10th the division not having crossed the North Anna, was again attacked by the enemy, dismounted, aided by artillery. The enemy was again repulsed, and the crossing easily effected. On the same morning, moving out in the advance, the enemy was met about 2 miles from Beaver Meadow, and dispersed by the leading regiment of the Second Brigade. On the 11th, near Ground Squirrel Church, the division, marching in rear, was attacked by Gordon's brigade of rebel cavalry. The attacks of the enemy were repeated during the entire day, thus forming a part of the general engagement with the enemy at Yellow Tavern. The Second Brigade of this division alone was engaged, and without difficulty, in every attack, was more than able to drive the enemy at all points, inflicting upon him severe loss. On the 12th the Cavalry Corps, having marched down the Brook turnpike to within 3 miles of Richmond, turned to the left, and passed within the outer lines of the fortifications; the advance of the corps directing its march upon the Meadow Bridges found them held by the enemy in force. The attack made by the leading division (the First) upon the enemy at the bridge, detained the Second Division, marching in rear, near the Brook turnpike and in front of the second line of the enemy's defenses. In this position the Second Brigade, on the right, was attacked by a large force of cavalry in the direction of the Brook road. On the left of the Second Brigade and in front of the First Brigade, formed on the left, the enemy attacked with infantry. Not doubting the success of their attack, the enemy moved boldly against our lines despite the well-directed fire of two of our batteries. When, however, they had approached sufficiently near to come under the fire of our carbineers, the contest was of short duration, and terminated in the enemy being routed along the whole line. So complete was their defeat that they offered no further opposition to the passage of the division over the Chickahominy. In this action the aggregate loss of the division was 157 commissioned officers and enlisted men killed and wounded. On the 13th marched to Bottom's Bridge, and on the 14th to Haxall's, on James River. On the 18th marched to Baltimore Cross-Roads; on the 20th to Cold Harbor, and on the 22d to White House, and on the 25th reached Chesterfield Station. On the 26th marched to Hanover Ferry. On the 27th crossed the Mattapony. On the 28th the division moved out from Hanovertown on the road leading to Hanover Court-House, and, by the direction of the major-general commanding corps, took position at Haw's Shop, about 3 miles from the river. In this position the division engaged the cavalry corps of the enemy. The enemy dismounted, were strongly posted in a dense woods, and, in addition to defensive works, were still further protected in their position by swamps. Having chosen their ground advantageous positions had been selected for batteries. The First Brigade of this division first engaged the enemy, and with such spirited determination as to develop the entire strength of the enemy. This necessitated the employment of two regiments of the Second Brigade. The contest became exceedingly stubborn. The enemy largely outnumbering the force which I had to engage, was yet unable to do more than hold his position, and from this he was driven at different points. For some hours the contest was thus maintained under a heavy and destructive fire, the lines of the contending forces being closely drawn up on each other. The arrival of Brig.-Gen. Custer's brigade, of the First Division, sent to re-enforce the Second Division by the major-general commanding, was but the prelude to a decisive victory. Four regiments of this brigade dismounted, and taking position in the center of the line of the Second Division the entire line rapidly advanced, driving the enemy in confusion. The rebel dead and many wounded were left on the field. A large number of prisoners and arms were captured. The aggregate loss of the Second Division in this engagement was 256 commissioned officers and enlisted men killed and wounded. On the 31st the Second Brigade was detached to report to Maj.-Gen. Smith, at the White House. The brigade reported back to the division on the 1st of June. On the 31st First Brigade was sent to the support of the First Division at Cold Harbor. June 2, by direction of the major-general commanding, the Second Division made a reconnaissance to Sumner's (upper) Bridge on the Chickahominy. Near the bridge found the enemy's cavalry, infantry, and artillery strongly posted. With both brigades of the division attacked the enemy and took from them their advanced positions, which were held until the arrival of the Second Corps. June 3, 4, and 5, division remained in camp at Bottom's Bridge, picketing the lower Chickahominy. On the 6th marched to New Castle Ferry and joined the First Division of the corps, and on the 7th the two divisions, under Maj.-Gen. Sheridan, started on an expedition to Gordonsville. On the 10th crossed the North Anna at Carpenter's Ford. On the 11th the First Division, being engaged with the enemy at Trevilian Station, on the Central railroad the Second Brigade, of the Second Division, was ordered forward to its support. Placed on the left of the line of battle, it advanced against the enemy, driving him back rapidly, capturing a large number of prisoners. On the evening of the same day the Second Brigade, with two regiments of the First, all dismounted, were directed against a position held by the enemy in force on the extreme left of our line. After a severe contest of about twenty minutes' duration, the enemy (Fitz. Lee's division) were routed and the position was ours. A number of the enemy's wounded fell into our hands, as also other prisoners. Aggregate loss of the division 109 commissioned officers and enlisted men killed and wounded. June 12, First Brigade sent to support the First Division in an attack made upon the enemy. Brigade not engaged. On the 13th the command began its return march, and on the 20th reached the Pamunkey at the White House. On the 21st, at 3 a. m., the entire division dismounted, crossed the Pamunkey, and moved out against the enemy's cavalry on the road leading to Tunstall's Station. Hampton's cavalry was found in position on the west side of Black Creek. This force advanced with the view of retaking the position held by it on the preceding day, but in this it failed, and during the night retired to the Chickahominy. On the 23d the division, acting with the First Division as escort to a large wagon train belonging to the corps and other troops, crossed the Chickahominy at Jones' Bridge. On the 24th, in compliance with the orders of the major-general commanding the corps, the Second Division moved from its camp to Saint Mary's Church and there took position. When within a mile of the church the advance of the Second Brigade found a small mounted force of the enemy. This was driven away and the lines of the division established. The batteries of the division were placed in commanding positions. During the morning and until after 3 p. m. there was irregular skirmishing at different points of our line. A large force of the enemy was known to have passed Saint Mary's Church, moving in the direction of Haxall's, on the evening before. Having received information from the major-general commanding that circumstances compelled an alteration of the disposition previously ordered of the troops under his command, this alteration placing the Second Division beyond any immediate support, every disposition was made to resist an attack of the enemy should it be made. Between 3 and 4 p. m. the enemy made an attack in great force on the Second Brigade, occupying the right of our line. The attack thus began extended along the front of the First Brigade on the left. It was very soon evident that the force of the enemy was largely superior to ours, and that they were supported by infantry, but nothing daunted by the display of strong lines of an overconfident enemy, our men fell upon them and held them in check. The strife was in earnest now; there were no disengaged men on our side. Randol's and Dennison's batteries pitched load after load of canister into the staggering lines of the enemy. After about two hours, in which this contest was so heroically maintained by our men, it became evident that the contest was too unequal to maintain it longer. The led horses, the wounded for whom there was transportation, and caissons, were started on the road leading to Charles City Court-House, 8 miles distant. These fairly under way the division began to retire by the right. Our men continued fighting on foot, but were mounted from time to time. The movement toward Charles City Court-House was made in the best possible order, without confusion or disorder. The enemy pressed hard upon the rear of the command, but without advantage. A final stand made by mounted regiments at Hopewell Church on open ground determined the enemy to make no farther advance. For want of sufficient ambulances some of our wounded fell into the hands of the enemy. A portion of these have since been recovered. The intense heat prostrated many of our men and produced some deaths. The division reached Charles City Court-House about 8 p. m., and then encamped near the First Division. The aggregate loss of the division in this engagement was 357 commissioned officers and enlisted men killed, wounded, and missing. Having thus briefly recounted the operations of this division, it is fit that in closing my report I should mention, as I can with pride, the good conduct of all the officers and enlisted men of my command during these operations. When engaged in battle their gallantry and soldierly determination to win made their successes certain. Instances of particular gallantry are far too numerous to be recounted in this report. Brig. Gen. H. E. Davies, jr., U. S. Volunteers, and Col. J. Irvin Gregg, Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, commanding, respectively, the First and Second Brigades, are deserving of my highest commendation for the great ability and untiring energy displayed by them as commanders; skillful in handling their brigades they accomplished handsomely whatever they undertook. The successes of the division were not secured without the loss of many valuable lives. Lieut. Col. George H. Covode, Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry; Lieut. Col. Stephen Boothby, First Maine Cavalry, died of wounds received in action; the former where he fell. To these might be added a long list of officers of inferior grade who gallantly fell in the various actions in which their regiments were engaged. To my own staff my thanks are especially due for their valuable services in the transmission of my orders, and performing all the varied and arduous duties of staff officers to a cavalry command in the field. Capt. W. Phillips, First Maine Cavalry, assistant commissary of musters on my staff, was killed at Saint Mary's Church on the 24th. To say of this officer that he was a true gentleman and excellent soldier is but a slight tribute to his memory. The Independent Sixth New York Battery, Capt. J. W. Martin, and Light Battery A, Fourth U. S. Artillery, were on duty with this division until May 31; Light Batteries H and I, First U. S. Artillery, Capt. A. M. Randol and Lieut. Dennison commanding, from that date until the present. Accompanying this report will be found a nominal list* of casualties and the reports of the brigade commanders. D. MCM.
