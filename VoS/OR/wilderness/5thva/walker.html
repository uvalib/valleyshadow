    <br/> CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 1089-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports.
    Serial No. 67.] <p/> No. 292.<p/> This indorsement is not dated, but from the handwriting and
    the ink used I take it to have been made about 1865, before the evacuation of Richmond. The fact
    is as clear in my memory to-day as ever. The order was given at the Harris house shortly before
    sunset of the 11th. The above is a true copy. <p/> CAMPBELL BROWN. <p/> MAY 6, 1874. <p/>
    ----------- <p/> Itinerary of Hardaway Light Artillery Battalion. <p/> Since last must (April
    30, 1864) this battalion (formerly known as First Regt. Virginia Artillery) has marched from
    camp near Barboursville, Orange County, Va., via Verdierville, Mine Run, and Locust Grove, to
    the Wilderness, and encamped near the line of battle, but was not engaged. <p/> May 7.--Received
    orders to move toward Spotsylvania Court-House via Shady Grove Church. Reached Spotsylvania
    Court-House morning of <p/> May 9, and encamped near what is known as the New Court-House. Put
    Smith's battery into position on Brig.-Gen. Walker's (Third Corps) line at night. The battery
    was afterward withdrawn. Next morning put Jones' and Smith's guns in position on Gen. Rodes'
    line and Capt. Dance's battery on Gen. Johnson's line. Capt. Dance's guns were afterward
    relieved by Capt. Milldge, of Nelson's battalion, and he remained in reserve just in rear of the
    line the balance of the day. Smith's battery was engaged in shelling the enemy's skirmishers,
    who were very troublesome, and in replying to one of his batteries nearly all day. Jones'
    battery fired a few shot. About 6 p.m. the enemy charged and succeeded in breaking our line to
    Smith's right. Maj. David Watson was with this battery and Lieut.-Col. Hardaway with Jones'.
    Smith's guns were worked until the enemy was entirely in rear of the battery and when its fire
    would have been more fatal to friend than foe. The guns were then abandoned by Maj. Watson's
    order, and the majority of officers and men succeeded in making their escape. Capt. Smith and 24
    of his men were captured, 3 killed, and 12 wounded. The enemy never succeeded in getting as far
    to the left of our line as Jones' position, and they were soon charged by Ramseur's and other
    brigades of Rodes' and Johnson's divisions and driven back beyond Smith's guns. As soon as the
    enemy were driven from the guns Col. Hardaway and Maj. Watson, with what men could be gotten
    together, commenced working two of them upon the enemy with good effect. After about an hour or
    two the enemy were finally dislodged and driven back to his own line. Maj. Watson was wounded
    while working one of Smith's guns and died of his wounds some four or five days after. </body>
