    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade. </p>
    <p> CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 10, 1863. </p>
    <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to transmit herewith a list of casualties of my command in the action
      of the 3d instant,* and also to submit the following report of the part taken by my brigade in
      that engagement: </p>
    <p> About 9 a.m. I received an order from Maj.-Gen. Meade to put my command in motion, and go to
      the support of Gen. French, Lieut.-Col. Webb to indicate the position we were to occupy. That
      officer in person out the line we were to take possession of, directly in the face of the
      enemy, and on the right of Gen. French's command, in the woods. </p>
    <p> The regiments were scarcely in position before the enemy opened fire upon us, which was
      promptly and effectively returned by our men. I at once saw the enemy outnumbered us, as they
      were in double line, and extended beyond our right. I immediately asked for re-enforcements,
      but was informed they could not be furnished. Col. Webb, who had remained in front for same
      moments, started back promising to bring up re-enforcements if he could obtain them, but he
      returned in a short time without them. The rapid and incessant fire of our men prevented the
      enemy form advancing, although they made several efforts to do so. </p>
    <p> After holding our position for nearly or perhaps quite and hour, reports reached me that our
      ammunition was being exhausted, many of the men supplying themselves from the dead and
      wounded. About this time, I discovered that the enemy was receiving re-enforcements; another
      double line was plainly seen advancing and extending farther to our right. I sent for
      ammunition twice without being able to obtain it, as, I afterward understood, it had not come
      up from the rear. I reported the fact to Gen. French, with the further information that the
      enemy were pressing us, and asked for orders. He replied that he could not furnish me with
      ammunition, and that we should retire in as good order as we could when we had exhausted what
      we had. The moment our fire slackened the enemy pushed forward with at least twice our number. </p>
    <p> As near as I can tell, we were in position from an hour to an hour and three-quarters before
      we were forced to retire. During this time the whole line was under my eye, and I to say that
      I never saw officers and men behave with more bravery and coolness than did the entire
      command. The officers were very active, and I saw many of them aiding the men by preparing
      their cartridges for the guns. The field officers were passing up and down the line,
      encouraging their men with great spirit and coolness. </p>
    <p> The Ninety-first Pennsylvania Volunteers was on the right, and received the first fire of
      the enemy. They are entitled to great credit for their conduct during the action. Col. Gregory
      received a slight would early in the engagement, and left the field, yet the men kept well at
      their work, under Lieut.-Col. Sinex. </p>
    <p> The One hundred and thirty-fourth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, Col. O'Brien, was second in
      line, and no set of men could have behaved better. The officers, one and all, following the
      example of their colonel (who was constantly on the alert), were very active, and not a man
      shirked his duty. </p>
    <p> The One hundred and twenty-sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, Lieut. Col. D. W. Rowe, was third
      in line, and for earnest, spirited work it could not be excelled. Col. Rowe exhibited the true
      characteristics of the soldier-brave, cool, and determined-and this spirit was infused into
      every officer and soldier of his command. </p>
    <p> The One hundred and twenty-ninth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers was on our left, and no man
      ever saw cooler work on field drill than was done by this regiment. Their firing was grand-by
      rank, by company, and by wings, in perfect order. Col. Frick's stentorian voice was heard
      above the roar of the musketry, and, with the aid of his lieutenant-colonel and major, his
      regiment was splendidly handled, doing its duty well. </p>
    <p> Too much credit cannot be given the officers and men of this brigade; not a single neglect
      came under my notice during the engagement. The colors of the different regiments show that
      they were carried well to the front, and I saw them repeatedly waved in the face of the enemy.
      The officers of my staff, Capt.'s [Henry C.] Ranney and [William H.] Davidson, and Lieut.'s
      [James B.] Diehl and [Stearns E.] Tyler, rendered me every assistance in their power, under an
      incessant fire. </p>
    <p> Among the officers seriously wounded, I have with regret to mention Maj. Anthony, of the One
      hundred and I went-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, a true soldier and dutiful officer.
      Lieut.-Col.'s Rowe and Shaw were slightly wounded, as was also Lieut. Diehl, aide-de-camp. </p>
    <p>I am, very respectfully, &amp;c., </p>
    <p> E. B. TYLER, </p>
    <p>Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
    <p> Capt. CARSWELL McCLELLAN, A. A. G., Third Division,</p>
