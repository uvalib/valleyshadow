    <p> Report of Col. J. H. S. Funk, Fifth Virginia Infantry, commanding Paxton's brigade. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. PAXTON'S BRIGADE, </p>
    <p>May 26, 1863. </p>
    <p>CAPT.: I have the honor of submitting the following report of </p>
    <p>Paxton's brigade in the late operations around Chancellorsville: </p>
    <p> The brigade, under the command of Brig. Gen. E. Frank Paxton, composed of the Second,
      Fourth, Fifth, Twenty-seventh, and Thirty-third Virginia Infantry Regiments, left Camp Moss
      Neck on the morning of April 28, marching to Hamilton's Crossing, where we bivouacked. </p>
    <p> We remained at this place until daylight on May 1, when we took up the line of march in the
      direction of Chancellorsville, in Spotsylvania County, and reaching the Plank road leading
      from Orange Court-House to Fredericksburg, about 6 miles from the latter point, we halted
      until near sunset. </p>
    <p> At this time the firing on our front became quite heavy and rapid, and the brigade was
      ordered forward. We pushed forward some distance, to within a mile of our advance line, where
      we bivouacked for the night. As night approached, everything became once more quiet in the
      front. </p>
    <p> On the following day, at dawn, we continued the march down the Plank road, and, arriving at
      the point at which Gen.'s Anderson's and McLaws' division were in position awaiting the
      approach of the enemy, we turned abruptly to the left by a road but apparently little used,
      leading by Catharine Furnace to the Brock road, and from thence to the Orange and
      Fredericksburg Plank road. We marched down this road to the Germanna Junction, where Gen.
      Paxton was detached from the division and ordered to report to Brig.-Gen. Lee, of the cavalry,
      who placed the brigade in position at this point, extending across the road. I have not been
      able to learn the nature of the instructions received by Gen. Paxton. We remained here until
      unmasked by the troops in our front, when we moved forward in line of battle through the
      woods, perhaps a quarter of a mile, and then by the flank on the Orange road until within 1
      1/2 miles of Chancellorsville, where we again formed in line of battle along the enemy's
      breastworks, our right resting on and the line at right angles with said road. </p>
    <p> At 11 p.m. the brigade was ordered to take position on the right of the road and about 200
      yards in advance of our former position. We remained here two hours, when we were directed to
      take another position on the left of the Plank road a half mile in advance, our left resting
      on said road and in second line of battle. As soon as the lines were connected, the men,
      worried and worn out by the rapid detour made that day and by a want of rations, were
      permitted to rest for a few brief hours. </p>
    <p> On the morning of May 3 (Sunday), we were aroused at daylight by the firing of our
      skirmishers, who had thus early engaged the enemy. At sunrise the engagement had become
      general, and though not engaged, and occupying the second line, the brigade suffered some loss
      from the terrific shelling to which it was exposed. </p>
    <p> At 6 a. m. we were ordered to move across the Plank road by the right flank about 300 yards,
      and then by the left flank until we reached a hastily constructed breastwork thrown up by the
      enemy. At this point we found a large number of men of whom fear had taken the most absolute
      possession. We endeavored to persuade them to go forward, but all we could say was of but
      little avail. As soon as the line was formed once more, having been somewhat deranged by the
      interminable mass of undergrowth in the woods through which we passed, we moved forward. Here
      Gen. Paxton fell, while gallantly leading his troops to victory and glory. </p>
    <p> Being informed of the death of the general, I moved forward with my regiment, conforming my
      movements to those of the regiment on my right, as previously instructed. We advanced to high
      ground about the center of the woods, where we were hotly engaged about three-fourths of an
      hour. </p>
    <p> In the meantime the enemy received heavy re-enforcements, which were bearing down against us
      without support and exposed to a heavy enfilading fire, the Second Virginia Regt. having been
      separated from the brigade on the right. The brigade, unable longer to sustain a conflict so
      unequal, or to maintain the position without support, fell back in admirable order to the
      breastworks, where the shattered line was reformed. </p>
    <p> At this point I first learned of the fall of our gallant general. Four of the regiments had
      advanced without a command or a commander. The Second Virginia had been directed to the right
      by Maj. [W. D.] McKim. The remainder of the brigade, not having received the order, was thus
      separated from it. (See Col. Nadenbousch's report, accompanying this.) While reforming the
      line, Col. [J. Q. A.] Nadenbousch informed me of the general's death, and also of the fact
      that his regiment (Second Virginia) had been separated from the brigade. Having no assistance,
      I requested him to help from the troops on the left. His coolness and judgment proved
      valuable. </p>
    <p> At this juncture of affairs, Maj. [A. S.] Pendleton, assistant adjutant-general, told me it
      was Gen. Stuart's order for the brigade to be put in motion to relieve, as I understood, Gen.
      Ramseur's brigade, whose ammunition had been exhausted. We again advanced over the
      fortifications, behind which the demoralized troops formerly mentioned were still crouched,
      and relieved the troops in our front, who were nobly maintaining their ground with thinned
      ranks and empty cartridge-boxes. The Twelfth Georgia Regt. formed on my right. Seeing some
      confusion among the enemy who occupied the embrasures on the crest of the hill, I ordered the
      brigade to charge, which order they obeyed with the utmost enthusiasm, driving the enemy from
      his works and before them for three quarters of a mile. We took their works. The enemy were
      driven pell-mell around the Chancellor house, when I discovered a column of the enemy moving
      down in the rear of the Chancellor house in order to gain our flank. I thereupon sent an
      officer to urge up all the support within reach. Several small regiments came up on our left,
      and, strange to say, they retired before some had fired a volley. I instituted proper
      inquiries, but could not learn what troops these were. </p>
    <p> Our ranks having been greatly reduced by the severe conflict of the day, one-third of their
      number having fallen, entirely out of ammunition and unsupported, the brigade was of necessity
      forced to retire, which they did like veterans. The enemy dared not follow. Once more we
      formed behind the breastworks. The men were supplied with rations and ammunition. While here,
      the Second Virginia rejoined us, taking position on the right of the brigade. </p>
    <p> At 3 p.m. the brigade was put in motion on the road leading to the United States Ford. We
      had advanced but a short distance when the enemy opened upon the head of the column a terrible
      fire of grape and shell. Gen. Colston ordered the brigade to form on the right of the road,
      covering my front with skirmishers. We then advanced to within 200 yards of the enemy's
      fortifications, under a severe fire of artillery. Owing to some confusion among the troops on
      our left, we were ordered to form behind some fortifications, where we remained until
      midnight. We were then formed parallel with the road. We here remained until the morning of
      the 4th, when, after several changes, we took position three quarters of a mile east of the
      road leading to the United States Ford, in front of the enemy's works, where we remained
      uninterruptedly until the morning of May 6. </p>
    <p> The brigade on this occasion has maintained unimpaired its reputation. Too much cannot be
      said of the gallantry and bravery of both officers and men during these brilliant operations.
      All alike seemed to be impelled by honor and duty, and sought the front and not the rear. We
      greatly deplore the loss of many gallant spirits, and sympathize with the wounded. </p>
    <p> I would mention the names of Capt. Henry K. Douglas, assistant inspector of the brigade, and
      Lieut. Charles S. Arnall, acting assistant adjutant-general, for their gallant behavior and
      valuable assistance on this occasion. The former by his daring example caused the greatest
      enthusiasm among the men. </p>

    <p>Maj. Gen. J. E. B. STUART, </p>
    <p>Cmdg. Cavalry Corps, Army Northern Virginia: </p>
    <p> DEAR GEN.: I have noticed several communications in North Carolina papers from men in
      Ramseur's brigade charging the "Stonewall" with misbehavior at Chancellorsville on the 3d of
      May. As I was in command of the brigade during most of the day, Gen. Paxton having fallen
      before we were actually engaged, I feel it my duty to notice the charge. Gen. Ramseur asserted
      on the field, as I have heard, "that his brigade had run over this one," but has since
      addressed me a communication in which he says he was mistaken. Being aware that the action of
      the brigade was under your eye during a greater part of the engagement, I am desirous, should
      it meet with your approval, of having your opinion as to its action, and, with your
      permission, to publish it in conjunction with Gen. Ramseur's letter. </p>
    <p> Early on the morning of the 3d, Gen. Paxton advanced toward the works on the right of the
      Plank roads, but fell before reaching them; a fact of which I was not aware. The brigade moved
      on over the works, behind which lay a line of troops, became hotly engaged upon reaching the
      brow of the hill about 100 yards in front of them, the enemy occupying the works near the
      frame house, and extending into the woods on our right, which enabled them to enfilade our
      whole line. As we had no support on our right, we were formed to retire to the works, when,
      while reforming my regiment, I was informed of Gen. Paxton's death, </p>
    <p> __________ </p>
    <p>* But see Guild's report, p. 808. </p>
    <p> and placed in command of the brigade, with orders to move forward. This order was delivered
      by Col. [A. S.] Pendleton. I at once put the brigade in motion, the Twelfth Georgia on my
      right, and carried the works near the frame house. The troops on our left gave way, when we
      were subjected again to an enfilade fire, and forced to retire. This is but a brief statement
      of facts. I know the brigade performed its part well, and regret that its conduct has been
      brought into question. </p>
    <p> I hope you will pardon this trespass upon your time, and will favor me with an answer. I
      make this request at the suggestion of the officers of the brigade. </p>
    <p> I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> J. H. S. FUNK, </p>
    <p>Col. Fifth Virginia Infantry. </p>
