  <p>Report of Col. Thomas F. McCoy, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Infantry.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. 107TH REGT. PENNSYLVANIA VOLS.,</p>

  <p>May 9, 1863.</p>

  <p>LIEUT.: In accordance with orders just issued from Col. A. R. Root, commanding First Brigade, I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my regiment, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, in the late operations of the Army of the Potomac:</p>

  <p>At 12 o'clock noon on the 28th day of April, 1863, we broke up our camp near Fletcher Chapel, where we had been in winter quarters since early in January last. The line was soon formed, and our march directed toward Gen. Hooker's headquarters, by way of the White Oak Church. My men started out on this march each provided with eight days' rations and 60 rounds of cartridges, all of which they were required to carry on their person. We encamped this evening, after having marched about 8 miles (greater part of the time in a rain-storm), in a wood near the Rappahannock, some 3 miles below the city of Fredericksburg.</p>

  <p>At 2.30 o'clock on the morning of the 29th, we were aroused from our bivouac for the march, but did not move until daylight, and by this time the firing had commenced at the river, and the First Division of the corps was pressing over, and had already taken the rifle-pits of the enemy, with over 100 prisoners. We, with the other division of the corps, marched to support the movement of the First Division, and were massed near the river, in full view of all the operations, ready to cross when it might be necessary. Here we bivouacked for the night. On the 30th, we remained in the same position, while more or less fighting was going on in our front. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the regiment, with the others composing the brigade, was drawn up in square, in order to have appropriate religious observance of this day, in compliance with the proclamation of the President of the United States. These services were appropriate, interesting, and deeply impressive. About 5 o'clock, the enemy opened his batteries on us, and continued to throw shot and shell at and into our massed troops until after night, during which, for better protection, we were placed along the road, farther in the rear. During this warm artillery fire, quite a number were killed and wounded in other regiments, but I have the pleasure, thanks to a kind Providence, of having it in my power to report no serious casualties, as only 1 soldier was slightly wounded in my regiment.</p>

  <p>During May 1, we remained in the same position, being in constant readiness to move at a moment's notice.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 2d, the enemy again opened his batteries opposite, and about the same time, our division being relieved by part of the Sixth Corps, we took up the line of march toward and beyond Fredericksburg, and continued in this direction until we reached the United States Ford, where the greater part of the army had crossed to attack the enemy on their left flank. Having crossed the river, and in the act of preparing to encamp for the night, it being after dark, and our men excessively wearied, having already marched about 20 miles, we were ordered under arms immediately, to move to the front, to take position occupied by the Eleventh Army Corps, it having been defeated and driven by the enemy. The march was, therefore, continued for 3 or 4 miles to the front of the line, where the battle had then been raging for several days. The First Army Corps, of which we form a part, was placed on the right of the army, and on the road leading from Fredericksburg to Gordonsville. At the time we were taking up our position, a most terrific battle was raging on our immediate left and front, then near 12 o'clock at night, but moonlight. An attack was hourly expected on the position we occupied, and our wearied men at once began to fortify, and continued to labor during the night and the next day.</p>

  <p>At the dawn of the 3d (Sunday), the battle again opened on our left, and raged with terrible fury until nearly noon. Desultory firing was continued during the day and night, we being held ready for the conflict momentarily expected on our part of the line. During this time we continued to strengthen our works, in doing which we were frequently directed personally by Brig. Gen. J. C. Robinson, commanding the division, and Col. A. R. Root, commanding the brigade. This day (May 4), at 2 p.m., my regiment was ordered out to the front and left, to relieve the One hundred and fourth Regt. New York Volunteers on the picket line. This was the most dangerous and arduous picket duty that we had ever been called upon to perform, and it taxed the powers of endurance of officers and men to the utmost degree, and the exigency was such that the regiment was continued on this duty for two nights and the greater part of two days, one half of the sentinels having no relief, and the last night a drenching rain fell, adding to its horrors. We were occasionally fired on by the enemy's pickets and scouts during the second evening and night. The many incidents and movements, and everything of any moment that occurred, were at once reported by telegraph to the general commanding the division, who returned such instructions and advice as were deemed necessary.</p>

  <p>At the dawn of day on the morning of the 6th, Maj. Lee, of the division staff, came out to the lines, and communicated to me the fact that our army had evacuated our works three hours before, and were now recrossing the Rappahannock, and that I was immediately to withdraw the pickets, fall back quietly to the fortifications, and aid in covering the movement by deploying my men to the rear and right flank. I fully realized the danger involved in this movement, and at once proceeded to carry out the instructions received. Arriving at the fortifications, I was joined by Col. R. Coulter, with his regiment, the Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, who had been on similar duty, connecting with the One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers on the left. We lost no time in moving toward the ford, reached it safely, crossed the river on the upper pontoon bridge, and continued our march toward Falmouth, without finding any part of the division, and until the men becoming much exhausted, we encamped for the night. The men could not have refreshing rest on account of the heavy rains in the night. The next morning we continued the march in direction of Gen. Hooker's headquarters, near where we found the other regiments of the brigade and the division. After a short rest, and during the same afternoon, we marched to and encamped in our present position. I am happy to have it in my power to say that, during these nine days' arduous services, the officers and men of my regiment conducted themselves with their usual zeal and courage. The commanders of the division and the brigade know from personal observation how well and faithfully they served the good cause of our country in this important crisis, and, I feel assured, will do them full justice.</p>

  <p>I would embrace the occasion of this report to express my appreciation of the services of Capt.'s Whitman, of Twelfth Massachusetts Volunteers; Parsons and Whiteside, Ninety-fourth New York Volunteers, and their respective companies, the first two of which performed outpost and vedette duty in front of the center of the picket line on the road, while the latter performed good service on the picket reserve. I would also express my sense of the faithful and efficient services rendered, while on this duty, by Lieut. James B. Thomas, the acting adjutant of my regiment, to whom I feel much indebted for the prompt assistance he rendered in the varied and responsible duties devolving upon me during the operations of which the foregoing is but a very brief account.</p>

  <p>I am, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>T. F. MCCOY,</p>

  <p>Col., Cmdg. One hundred and seventh Regt. Pennsylvania Vols.</p>Lieut. E. CHARLES PARKER, Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.
