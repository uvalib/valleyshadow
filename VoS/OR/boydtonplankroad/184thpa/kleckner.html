  <p>CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 315-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>No. 61.</p>

  <p>Report of Lieut. Col. Charles Kleckner, One hundred and eighty-fourth Pennsylvania Infantry, of operations October 26-28.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. 184TH REGT. PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS,</p>

  <p>October 29, 1864.</p>

  <p>SIR: I have the honor to forward the following report of the operations of this regiment since the 26th instant:</p>

  <p>Breaking camp on the afternoon of the 26th instant, we marched in connection with the brigade, bivouacking late same night a mile or two beyond the Gurley house. Resumed the march about 4 a.m. next morning (27th instant). Came in contact with the enemy at noon, and during the engagement which followed were merely engaged in shifting position, losing 6 men killed, 10 wounded; missing, as yet uncertain, as they are coming in at intervals, the last report being 35. Withdrawing at 1 or 2 a.m. on the 28th instant, we returned to present camp, arriving at 5 p.m. or thereabouts.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully,</p>

  <p>CHAS. KLECKNER,<br />
  Lieut.-Col., Cmdg.</p>

  <p>[Capt. RYERSON,]<br />
  Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen., First Brigade.</p>
