  <p>Reports of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, U. S. Army, commanding Second Army Corps, of operations August 12-October 28.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. SECOND ARMY CORPS,</p>

  <p>Camp near Petersburg, November 10, 1864.</p>

  <p>GEN.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command on the 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th ultimo:</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 25th Gibbon's division (under the command of Gen. Egan, during the absence of Gen. Gibbon) and Mott's division assumed the entire line, from near Redoubt Converse on the Appomattox to Battery 24 on the left. At 2 p. m. on the 26th Egan and Mott moved along the rear line of intrenchments to the vicinity of Fort Dushane on the Weldon railroad, where they went into bivouac. I was expected to bivouac on the Vaughan road near the Davis house, though it was not so stated in the order, but there was some difficulty in fixing the road to that point, and it was found that we could move with equal facility from Fort Dushane, taking a cross-road from Wyatt's house, on the Church road, over to the Vaughan road. The order for the movement on the 27th was further modified by changing the hour for starting from 2 a. m. to 3.30 a. m. The order of movement prescribed that I should move down the Vaughan road with my two divisions, cross Hatcher's Run; thence by Dabney's Mill to the Boydton plank road; thence by the White Oak road, recrossing Hatcher's</p>

  <p>CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 231-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>Run, and, finally, that I should strike the South Side Railroad. Gregg's division of cavalry was placed under my orders, and was to move on my left flank by way of Rowanty Post-Office and the Quaker road. The operations of the Ninth and Fifth Corps were intended, I presume, to occupy the enemy to an extent that would forbid their concentration against me.</p>

  <p>The cavalry bivouacked near me on the night of the 26th. At 3.30 a. m. it moved out by the Halifax road, while the infantry (Egan's division in advance) moved over to the Vaughan road, where the enemy's vedettes were first encountered. The march was somewhat delayed by obstructions in the road, but the head of Egan's column reached Hatcher's Run very soon after daylight; and Egan at once made his arrangements to force the crossing. The enemy were posted in a rifle-pit on the opposite bank. They were in small force, but the approaches were difficult, trees having been felled in the stream, which was waist deep, above and below the ford. Smyth's brigade was deployed in the first line, and went forward in gallant style, carrying the works, with a loss of about 50 men. Lieut.-Col. Spalter, Fourth Ohio, commanding the skirmish line, was killed here. As soon as the command was in hand on the opposite bank, Egan moved by the nearest road to Dabney's Mill, while Mott's division followed the Vaughan road for a mile, and then struck over to the mill by a cross-road. About the time we arrived at the mill I received a dispatch from Gen. Gregg, telling me he had crossed the run, and the sound of his guns could be heard on our left. I should have stated that at the ford I sent a dispatch to the major-general commanding stating that I had effected a crossing, and expressing some uneasiness at not hearing the firing of the Ninth Corps. As soon as Mott reached Dabeny's Mill Egan moved on toward the Boydton road. The sound of Gregg's guns became more distinct, and it was hoped that we might strike the plank road in time to inflict some damage to the enemy, but we arrived in season only to hurry up their rear guard. A small party of good cavalry might perhaps have captured a part of their train, then passing over Hatcher's Run, but nothing could be accomplished with the cavalry I had in my advance. As soon as we emerged into the clearing at the plank road the enemy opened fire on us from near Burgess' Tavern and from our left, having apparently a section of artillery at each place. Beck's battery, of the Fifth Artillery, soon silenced the fire of the section by the tavern. Soon after my arrival at the Boydton road Gen. Gregg came in by the Quaker road, and preparations were at once made for continuing the march by the White Oak road. Gen. Egan's division moved down the Boydton road toward the bridge, for the purpose of driving the enemy across the run. Mott's division was put in motion for the White Oak road, and a brigade of cavalry sent down to relieve Egan, in order that he might follow Mott.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, about 1 p. m., I received instructions from the major-general commanding to halt at the plank road. Gen. Mott formed one brigade in line, looking toward the upper bridge, while Gen. Egan continued to press the enemy's dismounted cavalry, who held their ground with tenacity, but were finally derived over the run by a charge from a part of Smyth's brigade. Very soon after the order to halt was received, Gen. Meade came on the field, accompanied by Lieut.-Gen. Grant. Gen. Meade informed me that Crawford's division, of the Fifth Corps, was feeling its way up along the south bank of the run, and desired me to assist in making the connection by extending to the right. The same information substantially</p>

  <p>PAGE 232-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>and a caution concerning the vacant space between the Fifth Corps and my right, had been received from Gen. Humpreys, chief of staff, but a few minutes before Gen. Meade's arrival. Under instructions from me, Gen. Egan deployed two of his brigades to the right of the plank road, and subsequently deployed two regiments as far as they would reach to the right, and it was at one time reported that the connection with Gen. Crawford was made, but the report was erroneous. Maj. Bingham, of my staff, was sent to communicate with Gen. Crawford, and states that he found him about one mile from my headquarters, and a short three-fourths of a mile from my right. The enemy meanwhile were not idle. They placed nine guns in position in front of Egan on the north bank of the run, and five more about 800 yards from Egan's left, on the White Oak road, from which they opened a very annoying artillery fire. Beck, with four guns of his battery, replied gallantly. Gen. Gregg was directed to send one of his brigades to drive away or capture the battery on our left, but on making a reconnaissance of the position thought he discovered infantry protected by hastily constructed works, and did not advance against the battery. More important events diverted my attention from this point, though Granger's battery, Tenth Massachusetts, was sent forward to relieve Beck, that the latter might replenish his ammunition. As soon as Maj. Bingham returned from Gen. Crawford and reported his (Gen. Crawford's) whereabouts, Lieut.-Gen. Grant and Gen. Meade left the field, giving me verbal orders to hold my position until the following morning, when I was to fall back by the same road I had come.</p>

  <p>For a better understanding of the events of the day reference is made to the accompanying sketch,* which shows the position of my command between 3 and 4 p. m.</p>

  <p>Knowing the views of my superiors, I had determined to assault the bridge and gain possession of the high ground beyond. Gen. Egan, whose division occupied the crest of the ridge near Burgess' Tavern, had been intrusted with the necessary preparations, and McAllister's brigade, of Mott's division, had gone forward to support him. De Trobriand's, of Mott's division, was still in line of battle, facing the approaches from the upper bridge. The remaining brigade of Mott's division (Gen. Pierce's) had been moved up to support a section of Beck's artillery, under Lieut. Metcalf, which was in position on a secondary ridge about midway between Mott and Egan. Constant firing had been heard on my right, which was attributed to Crawford's advance. Becoming uneasy, I ordered two regiments of Pierce's brigade to advance well into the wood and ascertain what was there. Lieut. Stacey, of my staff, was sent to Gen. Crawford to inform him that I was about to assault the bridge, for which preparations were complete. A section of Granger's battery had been advanced to cover the bridge; the artillery had already opened, and a small party of the One hundred and sixty-fourth New York, the advance of the storming party, had pushed across the bridge, capturing a 10-pounder Parrott gun. Just at this time, about 4 p. m., a volley of musketry immediately on my right, which was followed by a continuous fire, left no doubt that the enemy were advancing. The small force of Pierce's brigade in the woods were overrun by weight of numbers, and the enemy broke out of the woods just where Metcalf's section was placed. Metcalf changed front, and fired a few rounds, and the part of Pierce's brigade in support endeavored to change front, but were unable to do</p>

  <p>PAGE 234-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>so successfully, and most of the brigade was driven back in confusion, rallying at the plank road, the section falling into the hands of the enemy. At the first sound of this attack I sent Maj. Mitchell, my senior aide, to Gen. Egan, with orders for Gen. Egan to desist from his assault on the bridge and to face his command to the rear and attack the enemy with his whole command. When Maj. Mitchell reached Gen. Egan he found that the general, with the instinct of the true soldier, was already in motion to attack the force in his rear. I do not think the enemy comprehended the situation precisely. They pushed rapidly across the ridge, resting their right across the Boydton road, and facing south, commenced firing. De Trobriand's brigade was quietly formed just in front of the Dabney's Mill road, with Kerwin's brigade of dismounted cavalry on its left. Roder's and Beck's batteries were opened on the enemy. Maj. Mitchell in returning from Gen. Egan found the enemy in possession of the road, and taking the First Minnesota, of Rugg's brigade, Second Division, opened fire on them. This was perhaps the earliest intimation they had of the presence of any considerable force in their rear; and they immediately directed a part of their fire in that direction. Gen. Egan swept down upon the flank of the enemy with Smyth's and Willet's brigades, of his own division, and McAllister's brigade was largely composed, faltered but were speedily reformed. The general advance of Egan was, however, irresistible, and the enemy were swept from the field, with a loss of two colors and several hundred prisoners. The Thirty-sixth Wisconsin Volunteers are particularly mentioned for good conduct, capturing more prisoners than the regiment had men. The captured guns were recaptured by us, and were soon afterward drawn off the field by a party of volunteers, under the direction of Lieut. Col. J. S. Smith, chief commissary of the corps.</p>

  <p>Rugg's brigade, of Egan's division, did not advance with the division as was expected and desired. As the matter is now being investigated by a general court-martial,* I forbear commenting upon it further than to say that had the brigade advanced the rout of the enemy would have been greater, and a larger number of prisoners would have fallen into our hands. The enemy were driven into the woods in complete confusion, and another brigade advanced the rout of the enemy by advancing upon them through the wood from my extreme right. Almost instantaneously with this attack the enemy commenced pressing my left and rear heavily. Mott's skirmishers in the direction of the upper bridge were sharply engaged, and several valuable officers were lost on this line. The enemy in front had hardly been repulsed when the firing in rear became so brisk that I was obliged to send to Gen. Gregg all of his force I had used to meet the attack in front as well as another of his brigades, which I was about putting in on my right to cover the Dabney's Mill road, constantly threatened by the enemy.</p>

  <p>__________<br />
  * Rugg was found guilty of neglect of duty and disobedience of orders, and by Gen. Court-Martial Orders. No. 45, headquarters Army of the Potomac, November 17, 1864, was dismissed from the service. The disability arising from this dismissal was removed by letter from the Adjutant-Gen.'s Office January 26, 1865, on report of the Judge-Advocate-Gen., and the Governor of New York was authorized to re-commission the officer.</p>

  <p>CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 235-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>The attack on Gregg was made by five brigades of Hampton's cavalry, and was persevered in until some time after dark. I desired to send infantry to Gregg's assistance, seeing that he was being pressed very vigorously, but I feared a renewal of the attack in my front, and I therefore trusted to Gen. Gregg to hold his own, and I was not disappointed. About 5 p. m. I sent Maj. Bingham, of my staff, to communicate with Gen. Warren or Crawford, to state what had occurred, and to say that unless the Fifth Corps moved up and connected with me, I could not answer for the result, as I was pressed by the enemy in heavy force. Unfortunately, Maj. Bingham was captured by the enemy in attempting to execute my order, and though he subsequently escaped saw neither Gen. Warren nor Crawford.</p>

  <p>At 5.20 p. m. I received a dispatch from Maj.-Gen. Humphreys, chief of staff, telling me that our signal officers had discovered the enemy moving down the Boydton plank road, undoubtedly concentrating against me. The dispatch further stated that my orders to withdraw the following morning were unchanged. I gave to Capt. Mason, the staff officer who brought me this report, full information as to my position, and he left me shortly before dark. Soon after I sent two of my staff to represent to the major-general commanding the exact condition of affairs as follows: Having moved in the morning, by order, without any reserve ammunition, I found myself seriously crippled for lack of it. This was particularly the case with the batteries, only on of which had a fair supply of ammunition, and this battery had lost both officers, and had but three men left per gun. The other batteries had expended nearly every round of ammunition. My command had been moving and fighting till after dark, and as a consequence was in considerable disorder. Quite a heavy rain was falling, and the wood road to Dabney's Mill, my only communication with the rest of the army, was seriously threatened by the enemy, and was becoming very bad. It was a question with me whether ammunition could be brought up and issued during the night, and I did not think my command could make a strong fight in the morning without it. Between 6 and 7 p. m. I received a dispatch from Maj.-Gen. Humphreys stating that immediately on the return of Capt. Mason, Ayres' division, of the Fifth Corps, had been ordered to my support, but had halted at Armstrong's Mill, which was as far as it would be able to get. The dispatch also authorized me to withdraw that night if I thought proper, but stated that if I could attack successfully in the morning with the aid of Ayres' and Crawford's divisions, the major-general commanding desired me to do so.</p>

  <p>Though these re-enforcements were offered to me, the question of their getting to me in time, and of getting ammunition up in time to have my own command effective in the morning was left for me to decide, and I understood that if the principal part of the fighting in the morning would be thrown upon these re-enforcements it was not desired that they should be ordered up. They would at least have been called upon to do the fighting until my own command could have replenished their ammunition, which I was quite certain would not be in time to resist an attack at an early hour in the morning. The cavalry, a considerable proportion being armed with repeating rifles, had almost wholly exhausted their ammunition; and Gen. Gregg did not think it practicable to get ammunition up and issued to the men during the night. I was of the opinion that the necessary preparations to meet successfully the enemy's attack in the morning could not be made, and I understood from Maj. Mitchell that the major-general</p>

  <p>PAGE 236-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>commanding took the same view. Reluctant as I was to leave the field, and by so doing lose some of the fruits of my victory, I felt compelled to order a withdrawal rather than risk disaster by awaiting and attack in the morning only partly prepared. The hour for the movement to commence was fixed at 10 p. m., giving time for my staff officers to return from headquarters of the army. They got back about 8.30, bringing me a dispatch substantially the same as the one just mentioned. The wounded were transported to the rear to the extant of my transportation, 155 being removed. The Dabney's Mill road was impassable in more than one direction at the same time. I was therefore under the necessity of leaving a part of my wounded, who were collected as far as practicable in the darkness of the night and placed in the neighboring houses under care of our own surgeons detailed for that purpose.</p>

  <p>At 10 o'clock Gen. Mott moved out, followed by Gen. Egan. Egan's division halted at Dabney's Mill until after daylight to cover the withdrawal of Crawford's division, Fifth Corps. The cavalry commenced withdrawing by the Quaker road at 10.30. The pickets did not commence withdrawing until 1 a. m. on the 28th, when they were brought off under the direction of Brig.-Gen. De Trobriand. A party of about seventy men belonging to First Minnesota and Seventh Michigan Volunteers, under the command of Capt. Farwell, of the First Minnesota, was left on the field through some neglect and remained until nearly 9 o'clock on the morning of the 28th, when they commenced withdrawing. They were twice charged by the enemy's cavalry, but both charges were repulsed, and Capt. Farwell marched his command into the wood between the Dabney's Mill and Quaker road, followed for some distance by the enemy. By the display of excellent judgment and tact Capt. Farwell extricated his little command, coming into our lines by way of Reams' Station, having moved nearly all the way in sight of the enemy's cavalry. Capt. Farwell has been recommended for advancement one grade by brevet for good conduct on this occasion. Mott's division massed between the Vaughan road and the Wyatt house, after crossing Hatcher's Run on the morning of the 28th, while Egan's division massed near the Armstrong house, awaiting the withdrawal of the Fifth Corps. About 10 a.m. both divisions moved within the line of entrenchments and returned to their old camp near the Norfolk railroad.</p>

  <p>I desire to acknowledge my indebtedness to Brevet Maj.-Gen. Mott and Brig.-Gen. Egan, commanding the Third and Second Division of my corps, respectively, and to Gen. Gregg, commanding the cavalry, for their services on the field. Gen. Egan had, perhaps, an unusual opportunity for distinguishing himself, and he availed himself of it to the utmost, contributing most materially to our success. He has been recommended for the appointment of brevet major-general of volunteers for his distinguished services rendered it necessary to separate the brigades of Mott's division, and this fine body of troops had not the opportunity that I desired to give them and their brave commander. Gen. Gregg, by his stubborn and successful resistance to Hampton's attack, completed our success.</p>

  <p>In the reports of subordinate commanders particular mention is made of the following officers and men:</p>

  <p>First, Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Smyth, commanding brigade of Egan's division. Gen. Smyth is spoken of by Gen. Egan as "the life of</p>

  <p>CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 237-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>his (Egan's) command." His gallantry was very conspicuous at the crossing of Hatcher's Run in the morning and throughout the action on the plank road. Maj. and Bvt. Lieut. Col. W. G. Mitchell, my senior aide, was with Gen. Egan during the advance of the Second Division against the enemy's flank, and Gen. Egan speaks in high terms of his services and of his example to the troops; particularly commending him for effecting, at the head of the First Maine Heavy Artillery, the capture of about 200 prisoners and 1 color. I have had occasion to acknowledge the services of Maj. Mitchell in every action in which I have been engaged during the war. He always finds an opportunity for increasing his reputation for bravery and high soldierly qualities. I hope the brevet appointment of colonel, for which I have heretofore recommended him, may be conferred upon him. Capt. A. H. Embler, acting assistant adjutant-general of the Second Division, and one of Gen. Gibbon's personal aides, is also commended for gallantry, and is again recommended for a brevet appointment of major. Of Mott's division, Col. McAllister, Eleventh New Jersey Volunteers, commanding a brigade, is complimented by Gen. Egan for bravery and good conduct. The services of his brigade are set forth in the body of this report. He is recommended for the brevet appointment of brigadier-general of volunteers. Lieut. W. B. Beck, Fifth U. S. Artillery, is also mentioned for the gallant manner in which he maintained his position against a greatly superior force of the enemy's artillery. Sergt. Alonzo Woodroff and Corpl. John M. Howard, of the First U. S. Sharpshooters, are spoken of as having exhibited unusual courage.</p>

  <p>Gen. Gregg commanding the cavalry, calls particular attention to the case of Maj. S. W. Thaxter of the First Maine Cavalry. This officer was embraced in an order to proceed with a part of his regiment to Maine, to be mustered out, but remained voluntarily, and took command of the skirmish line of his brigade during the action.</p>

  <p>The following officers of my staff were on the field assisting me by conveying orders: Lieut. Col. C. H. Morgan, assistant inspector-general, chief of staff; Lieut. Col. J. S. Smith, chief commissary; Surg. A. N. Dougherty, medical director; Maj. W. G. Mitchell, aide-de-camp; Maj. S. Carncross, assistant adjutant-general; Maj. J. G. Hazard, chief of artillery; Maj. S. O. Bull, provost-marshall; Maj. H. H. Bingham, judge-advocate; Surg. J. M. McNulty; Asst. Surg. C. Smart, medical inspector; Capt. I. B. Parker, aide-de-camp; Capt. B. C. Ammon, assistant provost-marshal; Capt. T. L. Livermore, acting assistant inspector-general; Capt. M. H. Stacey, commissary of musters; Capt. J. G. Pelton, chief of ambulances; Capt. C. J. Mills, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. F. E. Town, signal corps; Lieut. Richard P. Strong, signal corps.</p>

  <p>I desire to mention particularly the services of Lieut.-Col. and Brevet Col. Morgan, assistant inspector-general and chief of staff, throughout the movement and on the field. I request, as I have often done heretofore, that he may be appointed a brigadier-general in the volunteers. I also request that the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel, recently withheld from Surg. A. N. Dougherty, medical director, may be conferred upon him for gallantry and good conduct.</p>

  <p>The reports of commanders are forwarded herewith. For the operations of Gen. Miles I respectfully refer to his report, as he was not under my immediate command. It will be seen that he was not idle, though holding a line several miles in length, with but a little over 6,000 men. On the night of the 27th he carried one of the enemy's forts</p>

  <p>PAGE 238-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>near the crater with a storming party of the One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, led by Capt. Brown of that regiment and Lieut. Price of the One hundred and sixteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, acting assistant adjutant-general of Mulholland's brigade. Lieut. Price was unfortunately killed. This party held the work for a short time, capturing several prisoners, including two field against them, and Gen. Miles had not the troops at his disposal to pursue his advantage. On the same night he captured a part of the enemy's picket-line, on the Jerusalem plank road, holding it for two or three hours, and retiring at leisure. Lieut. Col. Burke, Eighty-eighth New York Volunteers, is highly commended for his good conduct on this occasion. He had command of the attacking party. Capt. Jerry Brown, One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, is recommended for promotion by brevet to the rank of major for the gallant manner in which he led the storming party from the One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>

  <p>A tabular statement of casualties is hereto appended.</p>
