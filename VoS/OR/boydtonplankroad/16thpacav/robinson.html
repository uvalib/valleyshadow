  <p>Reports of Lieut. Col. John K. Robinson, Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, of operations September 15 and October 27.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY,</p>

  <p>October 31, 1864.</p>

  <p>COL.: In compliance with circular from headquarters Second Brigade, &amp;c., this date, I have the honor to report the part taken by Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry in the recent operations on Boydton plank road, &amp;c.:</p>

  <p>While the column (Third Brigade) was advancing toward Boydton plank road, leaving Dinwiddie Court-House road three miles from Court-House, one battalion, commanded by Capt. J. C. Robinson and one squadron by R. C. Caughey, C Company, picketed said road and branches. They were attacked and charged by the enemy, but repulsed them handsomely, holding roads till relived by First Brigade. In engagement on Boydton plank road the regiment was dismounted about 3.30 p. m. and aligned, joining the infantry left and opposite a very annoying rebel battery. The line had scarce been formed ten minutes till the enemy charged it, but retaining our fire until they came</p>

  <p>PAGE 646-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>quite close, then pouring in a heavy volley, our men repulsed them handsomely and punished them severely. No farther assault was made, but a constant sharpshooting fire was kept up by both sides and our line was furiously shelled at short intervals. The line was held till 8.30 p. m., when, in obedience to orders, the regiment was withdrawn with a loss of 5 killed, 22 wounded, and 7 missing.* Most of the latter have turned up.</p>

  <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

  <p>Your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>J. K. ROBINSON,<br />
  Lieut. Col. Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Cmdg. Regt.</p>

  <p>Col. M. KERWIN,<br />
  Cmdg. Second Brigade, Second Division, Cavalry Corps.</p>
