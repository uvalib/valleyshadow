  <p>Reports of Col. Michael Kerwin, Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, commanding Second Brigade, of operations August 1-20 and October 26-27.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. SECOND Brig., SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,</p>

  <p>November 4, 1864.</p>

  <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by this brigade in the last engagement near the Boydton plank road:</p>

  <p>The brigade broke camp at 3 p. m. October 26 and moved in rear of Third Brigade as far as the Weldon railroad, when it encamped near the Perkins house. At 3 a. m. on the following morning (27th) the march was again resumed, in the same position, no part being taken in the occasional skirmishing which took place during the march until we reached Quaker road at its intersection with the Vaughan road. Here the enemy made a faint attack upon our rear, which was repulsed by the Second Pennsylvania Cavalry, dismounted. The brigade was here relieved by the First Brigade and proceeded on its way up the Quaker road to where it intersects the Boydton plank road, when the following dispositions were made: The Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry was ordered to move along the plank road and hold in check a body of the enemy's cavalry which made its appearance near the road about one mile in front of our lines; the Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry was dismounted, supported by the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry (mounted), and placed on the left of infantry, facing the White Oak road, which line was held by them until the brigade was ordered back; the Second and Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiments were dismounted and ordered to the support of the Third Brigade, as was also the Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, which had been withdrawn from its former position. The brigade remained in this position until about 10.30 o'clock, when the orders was given to move back over the same road advanced by Second Brigade in advance.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of casualties and losses unstained in the engagement: Killed, 9 enlisted men; wounded, 2 commissioned officers (Capt. I. H. Ressler, Company L, and Lieut. S. H. Brown, Company F, Sixteenth Pennsylvania Calvary) and 35 enlisted men; missing, 20 enlisted men; total, 2 commissioned officers and 64 enlisted men; aggregate, 66.*</p>

  <p>One caisson and tender was left on the field, having received a shot through its stock which rendered it unserviceable.</p>

  <p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>M. KERWIN,<br />
  , Cmdg. Brigade.</p>

  <p>Capt. A. H. BIBBER,<br />
  Asst. Adjt. Gen., Second Division, Cavalry Corps.</p>

  <p>No. 241.</p>

  <p>Report of Col. Michael Kerwin, Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, of operations November 28.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. THIRTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY,<br />
  November 28, 1864.</p>

  <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to make the following report of a scout made to Rowanty Creek:</p>

  <p>The regiment was in readiness to mount at early daylight in pursuance of orders, but owing to the non-appearance of staff officer form Gen. Meade's headquarters was detained until 8 a. m. It then moved on the Lee's Mill road to that place, finding the planks taken from the bridge. These were replaced, and the regiment proceeded to Proctor's house, where a vedette of the enemy was found and a squadron left to hold the road. Thence taking the Jerusalem plank road to the Stony Creek road it proceeded to Dunn's house, where another vedette of the enemy was found and driven in. The reserve of this vedette appeared to be toward Salem Church. The command then moved to Rowanty Creek, where the main reserve of the enemy was found. The information obtained was that the only force at Stony Creek Station</p>

  <p>CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 645-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 87.]</p>

  <p>is a portion of Hampton's dismounted cavalry, with two pieces of artillery, a mounted picket reserve at Rowanty Creek, and vedettes as far as Proctor's house on the plank road. The command then returned to camp by the same route, bringing in 2 prisoners, 13 contrabands, 22 mules, 5 horses, 6 wagons loaded with wheat, &amp;c., and 2 carts.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>M. KERWIN,<br />
  Col., Cmdg. Regt.</p>
