  <p>Report of Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder, C. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, Second Division [Jackson's], of the battles of Gaines' Mill and Malvern Hill.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, VALLEY DISTRICT,</p>

  <p>July 9, 1862.</p>

  <p>SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade from June 27 to July 1 inclusive:</p>

  <p>The brigade left bivouac near Totopotomoy Creek at about 5 a.m., being in rear of the column, except one brigade. The march was slow and tedious; firing was heard on the right. Between 4 and 5 p.m. I received orders from Gen. Ewell to move up rapidly. I ordered the ordnance wagons and artillery to halt and move the brigade from the column, filing the right through a wood and swamp, directing the head of the column to the point where I heard the heaviest fire. On reaching a clear field near Cold Harbor I formed my command and led the head of the column near the Telegraph road, where the brigade was massed by regiments. Finding Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill, senior officer present, I reported my arrival and asked for orders; he directed me to remain in my present position. In a few moments he directed me to detach two regiments to support a battery. I ordered Col. J. W. Allen, Second Regt., and Col. W. S. H. Baylor, Fifth Regt. Virginia Volunteers, to move forward and execute this order, which was rapidly done.</p>

  <p>After waiting some half hour I was ordered by Gen. Hill to charge the enemy's line with my command. I immediately formed line of battle with the Thirty-third Regt., Col. J. F. Neff; Twenty-seventh, Col. A. J. Grigsby; Fourth, Col. C. A. Ronald; the Irish Battalion, Capt. Leigh, who was near, and moved forward. As the line advanced Col.'s Allen and Baylor formed on the left, and the entire line moved forward in handsome style through a swamp and thick undergrowth of laurel and bushes. On emerging from this, finding the line somewhat broken in consequence of this swamp, I ordered all troops whom I found in front to join this command, making the line continuous. Lieut.-Col. Gary, Hampton's Legion: Col. B. T. Johnson, First Maryland Regt.; Twelfth Alabama Regt.; Fifty-second Virginia, Lieut. Col. J. H. Skinner; Thirty-eighth Georgia, Capt. and Assistant Adjutant-Gen. Lawton, commanding, joined this line and moved in splendid style over the field, the enemy retiring before it long were it was possible to use the bayonet. The Second and Fifth Regt.'s Virginia Volunteers moved so rapidly they got in advance of the line, receiving a heavy fire, which thinned their ranks, depriving them of some of their best officers. Nothing daunted, they held their ground until the line came up, and moved on with that same impetuosity and determination.</p>

  <p>Here that gallant officer Col. J. W. Allen, Second Regt., fell mortally wounded, while leading his command in the charge. He was a true soldier and gentleman, whose loss to hiss regiment, country, and friends will long be mourned, though falling in so sacred a cause. His patriotism and noble character had endeared him to all. At the same time that meritorious soldier and gentleman Maj. F. B. Jones, of same regiment, fell mortally wounded. His mild and gentlemanly manner had long since endeared him to all, and deeply is his loss felt and regretted.</p>

  <p>The line advanced steadily under the fire of two batteries and much infantry, and the enemy were driven some 300 yards beyond McGehee's house; this being beyond their last position, the line was halted. The lateness of the hour [about 9 p.m.] and ignorance of the country prevented any farther pursuit of the enemy. At this time Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill came on the field, and I relinquished the command to him. Upon consultation with him it was decided to retire the line of battle to the crest just in rear. This I did, and took the necessary precaution to guard against any surprise.</p>

  <p>I cannot speak too highly of the officers and men of my brigade, in which, for the time, I must include the Irish Battalion, Capt. Leigh. Their coolness, bravery, and discretion entitle them to my warmest gratitude, as also those serving under me a portion of the time, especially that gallant soldier and gentleman Col. Bradley T. Johnson, with his small band of veterans, ever ready to advance on the enemy and aid our cause. Col. Baylor and his regiment were subjected to a heavy fire of artillery and infantry, but the held the regiment well in hand, moving up in gallant style. Though he lost heavily, he held the extreme left, and delivered to me two Parrott guns, a part of the fruits of his victory. Upon Lieut. Col. L. Botts devolved the command of the Second Regt. after the fall of Col. Allen, and this command he exercised with coolness and bravery, reflecting much credit upon himself and regiment. The other regiments were led up by their respective commanders in fine order, though their position did not place them under such heavy fire.</p>

  <p>My thanks are eminently due to my staff, Capt. O'Brien, Lieut.'s Howard and Garnett, for the promptness with which they transmitted my orders and the assistance rendered me during the evening, exposed to a heavy fire frequently and at great risk. Also to Mr. Samuel D. Mitchell, of Richmond, a volunteer aide, who was ever ready and prompt to transmit my orders to any point regardless of his own life. He fell mortally wounded while with the Second Regt. in advance and expired in a few moments-one of the many instances of the self-sacrificing spirit of our young men.</p>

  <p>Two revolving guns, one Napoleon gun, and many small-arms and stores were collected by Lieut. Garnett, ordnance officer of the brigade, on the morning of the 28th, and sent to the rear.</p>

  <p>Shortly after daylight on this morning the pickets were advanced to a wood in front and many prisoners brought in, among the number Brig. Gen. John F. Reynolds and Capt. Kingsbury, of his staff. The brigade remained in position during the day.</p>

  <p>On the 29th it was ordered to take the advance and move to the Chickahominy River, which it did. The bridge being incomplete, shortly before sunset it was ordered to its former bivouac.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the 30th it took up the march at 2.30 o'clock, following the troops in advance of it. At night it bivouacked near White Oak Swamp.</p>

  <p>Took up the march at 5 a.m. on July 1, following troops in front. Hearing from Gen. Whiting artillery was needed in front, I ordered Capt.'s Carpenter and Poague to report to Brig.-Gen. Whiting with their batteries. For an account of their operations I respectfully refer to their reports. The brigade was halted near a church in the wood and held in reserve. Being within range of the enemy's shell, it was twice removed to the rear; but, unfortunately, the first shot indicating the necessity of a move killed that promising and gallant officer Capt. Fletcher, Fifth Regt. Virginia Volunteers, and the next, causing a second move, killed 1 man and wounded 3 of same regiment. Between 6 and 7 p.m. I was ordered to the front with my command. On reporting to Gen. Jackson, I was ordered to file to the right through the woods and report to Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill. I obeyed the first part of the order. I had not gone far when I found the brigade under the fire of a battery. It moved steadily on under a heavy fire. I dispatched a staff officer to a house near by to see if I could hear of Gen. Hill's locality. I could learn nothing, and hearing a heavy fire to my left, I moved directly for it. To gain that point the command was exposed to a terrific fire, and in consequence of the darkness of the hour and much wood and swamp the brigade became greatly separated. Finding myself with a portion of the Thirty, third Regt., Col. Neff, and a portion of the Fourth Regt.-I moved to the assistance of our troops through the swamp sending Capt. O'Brien to find the other regiments and bring them up. On emerging from the swamp I found a handful of gallant men of the First and Third North Carolina Regt.'s receiving a most terrific fire. I immediately placed the Thirty-third and Fourth Regt.'s in position, and with about 100 men held this hill against the enemy, who gave us the most terrific fire I have ever seen. There was a continuous stream of shot, shell, and balls for some two hours, when the enemy's fire slackened, and ceased about 10 p.m.</p>

  <p>During this time the officers and men behaved with true courage. Our loss was heavy.</p>

  <p>Col. Neff and Maj. F. W. M. Holliday, Thirty-third Regt., and Lieut.'s Howard and Garnett, of my staff, particularly attracted my admiration by their coolness and untiring efforts to keep the men in their position. Their escape from injury is truly providential.</p>

  <p>About 9 p.m., while trying to find remnants of my brigade-for some few men had found out my position and joined-I met a portion of the Thirteenth Georgia Regt. and ordered it to this position. In a short time parts of my regiments came up, all having been subjected to a heavy fire while moving up, but in consequence of the thick wood and darkness could not find their proper positions. For details of their operations I refer to their several reports.</p>

  <p>Here the fearless and gallant Col. A. J. Grigsby, Twenty-seventh Regt. Virginia Volunteers, was wounded-slightly, I am glad to say-but obliged to leave the field. Capt. O'Brien, of my staff, was injured by a fall from his horse, and not with me after reaching the field.</p>

  <p>Hearing of troops near by not engaged I immediately sent for them, and was soon re-enforced by a portion of Gen. Lawton's brigade, Gen. J. R. Jones' brigade, under Lieut.-Col. Cunningham, and a part of the Louisiana Brigade, and that gallant band of Marylanders under the brave Col. B. T. Johnson. Col. Johnson, hearing I needed assistance, came forward to tender his regiment, which I gladly accepted, and gave him the advance, directing him to extend our line some half a mile to the right, placing my picket on and near the flank of the enemy. This duty he executed rapidly and with good judgment, holding this position until after the enemy had retired the following day. Lieut.-Col. Cunningham's brigade I placed on Johnson's left and the balance of Lawton's brigade between Cunningham's and my original position, securing my entire front and flank, sleeping on the field so hotly contested against heavy odds.</p>

  <p>After these dispositions Gen. Lawton arrived, and I rode in to report to Gen.'s Hill and Jackson my position. This effected, I returned to the field before dawn and made the requisite dispositions to repulse any attack; but at daylight we found the enemy had evacuated his position during the night, taking off his guns, but leaving his dead, small-arms, and other indications of a defeat and hasty retreat, which was an agreeable surprise, for I had learned, through prisoners captured about daylight, his force the day previous had been vastly superior to ours.</p>

  <p>Shortly after 6 a.m. on the 2d instant I was ordered to bivouac some 2 miles from the front.</p>

  <p>The casualties are as follows:</p>
