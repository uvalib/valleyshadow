  <p>HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIRST CORPS,</p>

  <p>July --, 1862.</p>

  <p>COL.: I continue my report from Friday evening, 27th ultimo. On Saturday morning the division marched back across the ravine to renew its supply of ammunition and get something to eat. We shortly received orders to march and to follow the command of Maj.-Gen. Hill. After marching half a mile we halted, the troops in front being at a halt, and so remained under arms all day, being ordered into bivouac where we were at night. This was at McGehee's house and farm, a position which had been the enemy's extreme right, and whence their causeway over the Chickahominy leads. The enemy had destroyed the bridge. All day Sunday we remained in the same position, marching early Monday morning and crossing the Chickahominy by the enemy's causeway. Passed through their encampments, crossed</p>

  <p>__________<br />
  * See pp.502-510, 973-984.</p>

  <p>the York River Railroad, and, marching by the Williamsburg road, we turned off at the White Oak Bridge fork and reached the bridge about noon, finding it destroyed and the enemy drawn up beyond in line of battle. Batteries were brought up and a heavy fire opened upon him, silencing his battery completely. Our fire was directed by Maj. Whiting, of the staff. Sundry ineffectual attempts were made during the day to repair the bridge, but the enemy keeping up a distant and random fire of shell about the crossing, the men would not work. During the afternoon the furious battle of Frazier's farm was raging between the enemy and the troops of Gen. Longstreet. It could be distinctly heard, and indeed was scarcely 2 miles from us. Our delay at White Oak was unfortunate. Next morning, the enemy having retired, the bridge was repaired and the troops passed, my division in the advance. Marching by the road to Turkey Bridge on the Turkey road, we presently fell in with the line of skirmishers of Maj.-Gen. Magruder's troops, moving in line of battle by the Charles City road. They halted for us to pass. The troops were marching by a flank. The commanding general of the corps, Maj.-Gen. Jackson, would not allow the dispositions to be made to advance with skirmishers deployed and in line, but caused the troops to press on until the head of column closed on the advance guard, a regiment of cavalry, in a thick wood near Crew's farm, about 11 a.m. On the farm the enemy were found very strongly posted. They immediately opened with shell on the woods, every portion of which was under their fire. The result was, the cavalry came to the right-about and broke through the long column of troops which filled the road, now enfiladed by the fire. Though suffering loss, they formed to the right and left with precision and promptness.</p>

  <p>To our left was a very large wheat field, on the farm of Mr. Poindexter, which afforded a good view of the enemy's position and fair opportunities for artillery. Batteries were ordered up. The enemy's position, naturally commanding, was materially strengthened by the judicious distribution of this artillery. The first battery ordered into Mr. Poindexter's field found itself exposed to a vastly superior cross-fire, and was soon compelled to retire with loss. Balthis' battery, better posted and better covered by the ground, fought well and continued the action until their ammunition was exhausted. Other batteries were ordered up. The position to be taken by the artillery rendered were ordered up. The position to be taken by the artillery rendered infantry support necessary, and I was directed by Gen. Jackson to form my line with my right on the road in the wood, advancing to the edge in front and holding that. This was done by the Third [Law's] Brigade. The line continued by Hood extended across Poindexter's field, the men lying concealed by the wheat and the roll of the ground. I had been strengthened by the Third Brigade, of Jackson's division proper, under the command of Brig.-Gen. Hampton. This was held in reserve. Trimble's brigade, of Ewell's division, supported my extreme left. This disposition I was directed to maintain, the general attack of our forces being understood to be made as soon as practicable on the extreme right, the enemy's left. In the mean time it became apparent from our position that the enemy had divined the movement; their artillery fire, which had been very server upon my batteries and troops, ceased, and heavy columns were discovered in movement for disposition on their left. After some time the movement of baggage and troops in retreat by the Turkey Bridge road could be plainly observed.</p>

  <p>After the attack commenced on the right my division, with the exception of two regiments on the right of my line, which was near our center, and some of the Texas skirmishers, had nothing to do with the battle except to suffer a murderous artillery fire, which they did unflinchingly. Personally assisted by my staff, I was called upon to direct the artillery fire, which I continued to do during the afternoon. From my point of view the enemy appeared to fight with great stubbornness, and our attack to have made but little impression upon him. He deployed at one time six batteries in front of our center, when, opening in this deployment with artillery, they, together with the stationary batteries already in position, and which we had been engaging at times during the day, all opened a terrific fire upon Poindexter's field. Our gunners replied with spirit, but from want of ammunition the contest was too unequal, and I caused them successively to withdraw. This cross-fire was excessively severe upon the supporting troops. Toward night, learning that the center was pressed hard, I received orders to direct Gen. Trimble to move over from the left to that point, and commenced to close my own troops into the right, when night fell, and with it the battle, which had raged with great fury, ceased. For an hour after night-fall the enemy shelled the woods and Poindexter's field with rapid and heavy fire. This indicated another withdrawal. My troops remained in position all night, the advanced scouts confirming the withdrawal of the enemy during the night, leaving their dead and wounded.</p>

  <p>Of affairs on our center and right I can give no account. My list of casualties is almost entirely from the artillery fire of the enemy, for scarcely a musket was fired in the division. When the immense amount of their artillery is considered, the violence and duration of their fire, and the exposed position of the troops, the loss, thanks to God, may be regarded as small, while the courage and unflinching endurance of the troops are worthy of the highest praise.</p>

  <p>The following is the list of killed and wounded:</p>

  <p>I regret that I do not know the names of the different commanders of batteries who reported to me during the day or designation of their artillery. Capt. Balthis behaved with great skill and gallantry and was wounded. All fought with great spirit, but labored under much disadvantage from want of ammunition, both as to kind and quantity.</p>

  <p>Wednesday morning, the 2d, a very heavy rain set in; the troops remained in bivouac, cooking. Thursday Maj.-Gen. Jackson's corps marched to take the road to Westover, but missed it, and bivouacked near Willis' Church. Thursday continued the march, arriving about 2 p.m. at Herring Creek, where the enemy's outposts were discovered intrenched. No further active operations occurred in which this division took any part.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully,</p>

  <p>Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Division.</p>
