  <p>HDQRS. TWENTY-FIRST PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY,</p>

  <p>August 8, 1864.</p>

  <p>SIR: In compliance with Special Orders, No. 209, from army headquarters, I have the honor to transmit the following report representing the casualties, fights, and marches of this regiment. The date of this regiment joining the Army of the Potomac commences with the fourth epoch; we are, therefore, unable to render my account of the first, second, and third epochs:</p>

  <p>FOURTH EPOCH.</p>

  <p>June 1.--Our regiment crossed the Pamunkey River and arrived at the Army of the Potomac, and were attached to the Second Brigade, First Division, Fifth Corps, and took up a position behind breast-works.</p>

  <p>June 2.--We changed position several times during the afternoon and evening, the enemy shelling us, from which we had 1 officer (Lieut. Waters) killed.</p>

  <p>June 3.--We were engaged with the enemy all day at Cold Harbor; our casualties were: Killed, 7; wounded, 47; among the latter being Col. Boyd, Capt. Phillips, Lieut. Doyle, and Lieut. Clarke. We remained there until night; we then moved to the left and occupied other breast-works until June 5. We then marched within half a mile of the Chickahominy, threw up breast-works, where we remained until June 12, when we marched to the Chickahominy.*</p>

  <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>O. B. KNOWLES,<br />
  Maj. Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry, Cmdg. Regt.</p>
