  <p>Reports of Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert, Lr. S. Army, commanding First Division, including operations May 4-July 1.</p>

  <p>CAVALRY, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,</p>

  <p>May 18, 1864.</p>

  <p>SIR: I have the honor to report that I sent a detachment of about 300 men, under Major Forsyth, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, to Guiney's Station, where he encountered about the same number of the enemy's cavalry. He drove them from the station, which he burned; also the post-office and a few store-houses; broke the railroad and cut the tele-graph; captured the mail, the most important of which is the paper inclosed.* The cars ran to this station last night. The enemy are intrenched at the Po River, where the Telegraph road crosses it. They have two pieces of artillery at this point. I can drive them away, if necessary, with some loss. I don't think there is anything except dismounted cavalry. I had a small skirmish on the road leading from Mattapony Church to Hamilton's Crossing. Only about 20 men drove them beyond the railroad, and my party returned via Hamilton's Crossing.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>A. T. A. TORBERT,<br />
  Brig.-Gen.</p>

  <p>Brig.-Gen. WILLIAMS,<br />
  Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Army of the Potomac.</p>

  <p>-----</p>

  <p>HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,<br />
  July 4, 1864.</p>

  <p>COLONEL: I have the honor to report the following as the part taken by this division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt, commanding Reserve Brigade--First, Second, and Fifth U.S. Cavalry, Sixth Regiment Pennsylvania Cavalry, First New York Dragoons; Brig.-Gen. Custer, commanding First Brigade--First, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Michigan Cavalry; Col. Devin, commanding Second Brigade--Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry) during the active operations of this year while under my command:</p>

  <p>I assumed command of this division April 11, 1864. May 4, the division broke camp at Culpeper, Va., and marched to Germanna Ford, on the Rapidan River, covering the rear of the main army and the trains. About 12 o'clock on the night of the 4th instant, I received orders to cross the Rapidan River at Ely's Ford instead of Germanna, as previously ordered. At daylight on the morning of the 5th the division marched for the Rapidan, crossing at Ely's Ford, and thence to Chancellorsville, where it took position on the left of the army. Here I was obliged to turn over the division to Brig.-Gen. Merritt on account of my suffering from an abcess near the end of my spine and having to undergo an operation under the influence of chloroform.</p>

  <p>May 9.--I was sent to Washington, via Fredericksburg, where I remained till May 16, when I rejoined the army and took command of all the cavalry with the army during the absence of the Cavalry Corps.</p>

  <p>__________<br />
  * Not found.</p>

  <p>PAGE 804-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>May 25.--I rejoined the Cavalry Corps, and assumed command of my division near Pole Cat Creek, on the road from Milford Station, on Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad, to Chesterfield.</p>

  <p>May 26.--The division started for Hanovertown Ferry on the Pamunkey River, marched all night, making the river about daylight. On the way the Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Second Brigade, was detached to make a demonstration as if we intended to cross at Jones' Ferry. This was well done under the direction of the excellent commander of the regiment, Lieut.-Col. Anderson. The enemy held the ferry at Hanovertown in small force; two canvas pontoon-boats were put up beyond range of the enemy's guns, and then taken to the river-bank by the engineers, preceded by a regiment of Gen. Custer's brigade, who drove the enemy from the opposite bank, where the boats were put in the river, and two squadrons dismounted, ferried over at once, and held the opposite bank till the pontoon bridge was laid, and Capt. Folwell, Fiftieth New York Engineers, and his men deserve great credit for the prompt manner in which they laid the bridge, part of the time under fire. Gen. Custer, knowing the importance of the movement, was there in person to superintend it, and very gallantly and expeditiously did he perform his duty. In one hour the bridge was laid and the division passed over it in the following order: Gen. Custer, Gen. Merritt, and Col. Devin. Gen. Custer met the enemy immediately after crossing, on the road to Hanover Court-House, at a fork of the road, about 1 mile from the ferry leading to Hanover Court-House and Haw's Shop. Two regiments were sent on each road. Gen. Merritt was sent on the left-hand road to Haw's Shop, to support the two regiments of Gen. Custer, gone in that direction, and Col. Devin on the right-hand road to Hanover Court-House, to support the two regiments of Gen. Custer, sent in that direction. The enemy were in strong force on the Hanover Court-House road, and the greater part of Col. Devin's brigade was put into action, with the two regiments of Gen. Custer. Gen. Custer was directed to go to Haw's Shop and take a right-hand road which came into the Hanover Court-House road in rear of the enemy; this he was doing very handsomely, when the enemy, seeing the movement, fled in confusion across Crump's Swamp, when I stopped the pursuit. Gen. Merritt's brigade, except one regiment, First New York Dragoons, was then ordered to a position about half way between Haw's Shop and the Hanover Court-House road, to hold the line of Crump's Swamp. This day the First Brigade captured 1 captain and 31 men, and the Second brigade 4 commissioned officers and 18 men.</p>

  <p>May 28.--The Sixth Corps arrived and relieved the cavalry from this position, and the division was ordered to Haw's Shop, to support Gen. Gregg's division (Second), which had been ordered to that point early in the morning. Here the enemy was met in very strong force--the supposition is all of their cavalry. I was directed to send Gen. Custer's brigade to report to Gen. Gregg, and this brigade went into action across the road leading from Haw's Shop to Mechanicsville, and it lost heavily in both officers and men, but it punished the enemy equally if not more severe. Too much praise cannot be awarded Gen. Custer and his brigade for the manner in which they fought on that day. Gen. Merritt's brigade was formed on the extreme right of the line, but was not seriously engaged, but the movement made the enemy fall back before</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 805-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>them. Col. Devin's brigade was held in reserve during this engagement. The enemy withdrew about sundown. About an hour after our infantxy relieved the cavalry and the division marched that night to a point on the Pamunkey, a short distance below Hanovertown. This day the First Brigade captured 1 officer and 34 men.</p>

  <p>May 29.--The division marched to New Castle Ferry, on the Pamunkey River, picketing the country about Old Church and toward Cold</p>

  <p>May 30.--About 4 p.m. The pickets of the Second Brigade (Col. Devin's), on the road from Old Church to Cold Harbor, were attacked, but they bravely held their ground till the balance of the brigade came up, when the enemy was found strongly posted on the south bank of the Matadequin, a deep and, in some places, impassable stream. Here a sharp engagement ensued, and it was found necessary to put in the Reserve Brigade (Gen. Merritt's) and two regiments of Gen. Custer's, after which the enemy was driven from one position to another for a distance of 3 miles, when he retreated entirely to Cold Harbor, leaving his dead and wounded on the field. Here the First Brigade captured 1 officer and 12 men, the Second Brigade 1 officer and 4 men; Reserve Brigade, 2 officers and 15 men. The fighting was all dismounted, and every one behaved in the bravest manner. In one instance the Second U.S. Cavalry drove the enemy before them with their pistols after their carbine ammunition had given out, and on their line could be seen Capt. O'Keeffe, of the corps staff, gallantly leading the men into action. The men being very much exhausted, the pursuit was stopped for that day and we bivouacked about 1 1/2 miles from Cold Harbor.</p>

  <p>May 31.--Knowing the enemy to be in force at Cold Harbor, I made dispositions to advance on that point, ordering Gen. Merritt in advance, followed by Gen. Custer, to move on the direct road to Cold Harbor, and detached Col. Devin's brigade to go to the same place by a road to the left, which came into Cold Harbor a little to the left of the one that the balance of the command was on, with orders to engage the enemy, when met in force, with one regiment, making the connection to the right with the balance of the command, and with the other two regiments to turn the enemy's right at all hazards, and get in among his led horses. In my opinion it was an excellent opportunity to Strike the enemy a severe blow, but the colonel said it was impossible, but it does not appear that a very serious attempt was made to carry out my designs. Gen. Merritt drove the enemy very handsomely before him for 1 1/2 miles, when he sought shelter behind breast-works of each and rails on a naturally strong position, supported by a brigade of infantry. Part of Gen. Custer's brigade was here put in on the left of Gen. Merritt, making the connection with Col. Devin. Not deeming it best to advance the whole line, and Gen. Merritt reporting that he thought he could turn their left, that move was made. At the same time the left was pushed forward. These movements had the desired result, for the enemy was obliged to leave his breast-works or be captured. Gen. Merritt's plan was eminently successful at the same time, capturing 4 officers and 61 men, infantry. The enemy were driven about three-quarters of a mile beyond Cold Harbor, leaving his dead and wounded on the field. I then made dispositions to hold this point, taking up a line along the Bottom's Bridge road and the Bethesda Church road, holding well to the front on the Gaines' Hill road. The corps commander</p>

  <p>PAGE 806-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>thinking my position rather isolated, being 3 or 4 miles from Gen. Gregg's division, and there being no infantry within 8 or 10 miles, I was ordered to withdraw during the night; this I accomplished very successfully, the enemy certainly not knowing what was going on. The most of my command had got back to the position occupied the night before, when I received a dispatch from Gen. Meade, through Gen. Sheridan, to the effect that he should hold on to all he had gained at Cold Harbor at all hazards; that the Sixth Corps would be up in the morning to relieve the cavalry. I immediately faced about and marched to Cold Harbor and took up the old position just before daylight without any opposition; in fact, it was done so quietly that I do not believe the enemy knew that I had, for a time, withdrawn from their front. The First Division can well be proud of their achievements on the 30th and 31st of May, when the above drove from the field both Gen.'s Hampton's and Lee's divisions of cavalry, and Gen. Butler's (South Carolina) brigade of mounted infantry, and one brigade of infantry. One of the severest losses the division and the cavalry service sustained on the 31st was the untimely death of Capt. McKee, First U. S. Cavalry, than whom a more gallant and accomplished soldier has not given his life for his bleeding country. On this day Gen.'s Merritt and Custer particularly distinguished themselves for personal gallantry and skill in handling their men. This day the Reserve Brigade captured 4 officers and 61 men; the First Brigade captured 47 men.</p>

  <p>June 1.--We found ourselves confronted by the enemy's infantry, their cavalry having withdrawn, and Brig.-Gen. Davies, of the Second Division, was ordered to report to me. About 6 a. m. the enemy made a desperate assault with a brigade of infantry on the lines of the Reserve Brigade, and they were handsomely repulsed, losing many in killed and wounded. Soon after the enemy made a second attempt, but with no better success. About 10 a. m. the infantry (Sixth Corps) began to arrive and relieve the cavalry, and this was accomplished about 1 p. m., when the division marched in the direction of White House, and encamped in the neighborhood of Prospect Church and Parsley's Mill.</p>

  <p>June 2.--Marched to Bottom's Bridge and had a slight skirmish with the enemy in a demonstration at the bridge over the Chickahominy.</p>

  <p>June 3.--Remained at Bottom's Bridge; nothing of interest except some artillery firing.</p>

  <p>June 4.--Marched to Old Church.</p>

  <p>June 5.--Marched to the right of the army connecting with the Fifth Corps and Gen. Wilson's division (Third) cavalry.</p>

  <p>June 6.--Marched to New Castle Ferry on the Pamunkey River.</p>

  <p>June 7.--Crossed the river on pontoon bridge, together with Second Division (Gen. Gregg's), on an expedition toward Gordonsville and the Virginia Central Railroad; camped on Maj. Douglas' farm, on the south side of the Mattapony River, about 2 miles from Dunkirk.</p>

  <p>June 8.--Marched and encamped near Pole Cat Station, on the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad. June 9.--Marched and encamped at Young's Mill.</p>

  <p>June 10.--Marched, crossing North Anna River, near Minor's Bridge, at Carpenter's Ford, and encamped about 4 miles from Trevilian Station, on the Virginia Central Railroad, and just before</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 807-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>going into camp 10 or 12 of the enemy attacked the head of the column, but soon retreated rapidly. This was the first time we had seen the enemy during this trip. Gen.'s Merritt and Custer camped for the night on the road to Louisa Court-House, and Col. Devin's brigade on the road to Trevilian Station. These two places are on the Virginia Central Railroad, and about 6 miles apart. The Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry (Second Brigade) was detached to go to a hospital near Spotsylvania Court-House, where some of our wounded were reported to be, and did not rejoin till late on the 11th.</p>

  <p>June 11.--I could get no definite information in regard to the enemy, but his pickets were in front of mine of both roads; moreover, I could get no accurate information concerning the roads to Trevilian Station from the inhabitants or my map, but from the best information I could get I learned that the direct route to the station from the forks of the road where I was encamped intersected the road from Louisa Court-House immediately at the depot, and that there was a county road running from the road to Louisa Court House to Trevilian Station, coming into the road from Louisa Court-House to the station about 700 yards from the station, and I was obliged to make my dispositions on the above information; so I ordered Brig.-Gen. Custer to take the last road referred to Trevilian road for the same place. Gen. Merritt was in the advance. Gen. Custer was directed as he neared the station to connect or communicate with the command on his right. The column started about 5 a. m., and almost immediately after leaving camp engaged the enemy. I was with the right column, and Gen. Merritt very handsomely drove the enemy before him about a mile, when the enemy took u a position in a dense woods and forest, where it was with the greatest difficulty that a man could get through even if there had been no enemy in front, and this part of the line was held by the South Carolina mounted infantry brigade on foot. The Reserve Brigade was at once dismounted and put into action, and here, I am sorry to say, the gallant Capt. Rodenbough, commanding the Second U. S. Cavalry, was severely wounded, and was obliged to leave the field. The men fought desperately, but it was hard to drive the enemy from his cover, as my men could not see their foe. In the mean time, Col. Devin, with the Fourth and Ninth New York Regiments, were put in to re-enforce Gen. Merritt. About this time Col. Gregg's brigade, of the Second Division, was ordered to report to me, and I suspended the attack to make dispositions for turning the enemy's left flank, placing Col. Gregg's brigade on my left. The enemy, undoubtedly seeing these dispositions, commenced to withdraw from my front, which I immediately followed up so closely that the had no time to form again till he was beyond the station, and I stopped the pursuit. They were driven back pell-mell without any organization and their forces cut in two, Gen. Fitz. Lee's division going toward Louisa Court-House, and Gen. Hampton's toward Gordonsville. During this time I could get no communication from Gen. Custer, but could hear his guns well in the rear of the enemy I was fighting, but it seems he was engaged with a force coming from the direction of Louisa Court-House on his left flank and rear. It appears that after skirmishing with the enemy for awhile on the direct road to Louisa Court-House early in the morning, he left that road to take the one I had indicated,</p>

  <p>PAGE 808-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>and that road came out on the railroad about 2 miles from Trevilian Station, instead of a half mile, as I supposed, which was the cause on his being unable to connect with the right column, and could not communicate with me, as the enemy was between us. After striking the railroad, the enemy from the direction of Louisa Court-House attacked his rear, but the pushed steadily on to the station, which point he reached in rear of the enemy engaged with Gen. Merritt and Col. Devin. In approaching the station, Gen. Custer found the enemy's led horses, trains, and caissons retreating rapidly in the direction of Gordonsville and Charlottesville, and he immediately ordered the Fifth Michigan Cavalry, Col. Alger, to pursue, which they did in a very gallant manner, capturing about 1,500 horse, 6 caissons, and a number of wagons. The regiment was soon divided up into small parties taking care of the captured property, and the enemy at once sent a still stronger force after them. They were obliged to relinquish their captures and get back the best way they could, and the greater part of the regiment came in. Then Col. Alger with a few men gallantly cut their way through a column of the enemy to our lines that afternoon. Gen. Custer reached the station about the time that the enemy were driven in such a confused mass from the front of Gen. Merritt and Col. Devin, so the enemy in a disorganized mass passed through some intervals in his line, passing to his rear, carried off his pack trains, headquarters wagon, and five caissons. The enemy captured one gun, but it was immediately recaptured, in a charge led by Gen. Custer in person; one caisson was recaptured, and the enemy was obliged to abandon two of ours, which were recovered intact. Much credit is due to Gen. Custer for saving his command under such trying circumstances. Later in the day Col. Gregg drove the enemy from the railroad and turnpike between Louisa court-House and Trevilian Station beyond Gen. Custer's position. On account of the exhausted condition of the men, it was not deemed expedient to advance father that day, and I made dispositions to hold the railroad at that point. This day the Reserve brigade captured 150 officers and men; the First brigade, 8 officers and 133 men; the Second Brigade, 10 officers and 136 men. The enemy in his flight destroyed one caisson and one wagon of hospital supplies and quartermaster's stores. Their loss in killed and wounded was very heavy. Gen. Rosser, commanding division, was severely wounded, 1 colonel, commanding brigade, killed, and 1 captured (wounded). Our loss was quite heavy, as the accompanying lists will show, but the enemy was more severely punished. This day Gen. Merritt and Col. Devin particularly distinguished themselves for bravery and coolness in action.</p>

  <p>June 12.--The division commenced destroying the railroad track and depot, and the track was effectually destroyed for 4 or 5 miles. About 3 o'clock I was ordered with my division and Gen. Davis' brigade of the Second Division to reconnoiter the enemy's position on the Charlottesville and Gordonsville roads. These roads fork about 1 1/2 miles beyond Trevilian Station. The enemy was found strongly entrenched across these two roads about 1 mile from the forks of the roads. One regiment and a section of artillery were placed in position for holding the Charlottesville road, but to make no demonstration. Gen. Custer's brigade was sent on the Gordonsville road, and Gen. Merritt's brigade put on the extreme</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 809-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>right, and, if possible, turn the enemy's right. A general advance was ordered, when the enemy driven from his first line of works, when he fell back to a line behind the railroad embankment. From this position on the Gordonsville road it was impossible to drive him, except by having a large force, and then with heavy loss, for the enemy had been re-enforced by one or two regiments of infantry from Gordonsville. It was not deemed expedient to make this sacrifice, as we already had from the fighting the day before as many wounded as we could take care of with our limited transportation. Moreover, our ammunition was getting short, and rations nearly exhausted. Under these circumstances, I was directed to suspend the attack about night, and after dark was ordered to withdraw to the station, which was done without molestation. During the engagement the Reserve Brigade fought with more than their usual desperation, driving the enemy before them, but were unable to hold all they gained, as the enemy was too strongly re-enforced-the men say by infantry. Great credit is due to Lieut. Williston, of the artillery, for the gallant manner in which he used his guns, part of the time upon the front line of our men. Three regiments-Seventeenth Pennsylvania, and Fourth and Sixth New York Cavalry-were put into action on Gen. Merritt's line, and rendered valuable service; Gen. Davies' brigade was held in reserve, and ready to support any part of the line, and one regiment held the enemy in check at a very important point n the extreme left and rear. This day each brigade of the First Division captured 3 prisoners each. A few of my wounded, I am sorry to say, were obliged to be left at Trevilian Station, on account of their severe wounds. About 12 o'clock at night the division marched back on the road we had come, and about sunrise bivouacked for a few hours on the north bank of the south fork of the North Anna River, and then marched to the north fork of the South Anna, where we remained for the night.</p>

  <p>June 14.--Marched and camped at Shady Grove Church on the Catharpin road.</p>

  <p>June 15.--Marched via Spotsylvania Court-House to Edge Hill Seminary on the Ta River.</p>

  <p>June 16.--Marched, crossing the Ta and Mattapony Rivers, passing through Bowling Green and down the north bank of the Mattapony River, camping on Dr. Butler's farm.</p>

  <p>June 17.--Marched via Newtown and Clarksville and camped near Walkerton.</p>

  <p>June 18.--Marched, camping at King and Queen Court-House, sending sick, wounded, and prisoners to West Point.</p>

  <p>June 19.--Returned on same road via Clarksville to Dunkirk on the Mattapony River.</p>

  <p>June 20.--Crossed the Mattapony on pontoon bridge and marched to the Pamunkey River opposite White House, via King William Court-House.</p>

  <p>June 21.--Crossed the Pamunkey River on the railroad bridge at White House to support Gen. Gregg's division, who meant the enemy on the opposite side. Col. Devin's brigade was pushed out on the road to Baltimore Cross-Roads, where he met the enemy in force, but succeeded in holding him in check with the loss of a few men. Gen. Custer was put on the road to Cumberland. Gen. Merritt was held on the road to Tunstall's Station, to support Gen. Gregg or the other two brigades of the division. That night the enemy withdrew from our front.</p>

  <p>PAGE 810-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>June 22.--Marched to Jones' (or Gowan's) Bridge, on the Chickahominy, and crossed two brigades, Col. Devin's and Gen. Custer's, without much opposition, leaving Gen. Merritt on the north side.</p>

  <p>June 23.--Remained in camp, and late in the afternoon Col. Devin's brigade, which was in advance, holding the roads to Charles City Court-House, and Long Bridge, on the Chickahominy, was strongly attacked by the enemy, but the colonel held his ground with his usual stubbornness, and finally drove the enemy from his front.</p>

  <p>June 24.--Marched via Charles City Court-House to near Westover Church.</p>

  <p>June 25.--Marched to Douthat's Point, on the James River.</p>

  <p>June 26 and 27.--Remained in camp.</p>

  <p>June 28.--Crossed James River in ferry-boats to Wind Mill Point.</p>

  <p>The cavalry fighting this year has been dismounted; the enemy has not dared to give us an opportunity to operate mounted, and when dismounted, they have had a great advantage of us from the fact that they have a very large brigade of mounted infantry armed with the rifled musket; but I am proud to say that the division has been signally successful in everything they have been called upon to perform; in fact, officers nor men never fought with more determination or courage. Too much credit cannot be given to the brigade commanders for the gallant and efficient manner in which they performed the duties incident to their position. I cannot speak too highly of the Horse Artillery (three batteries) commanded by Lieut.'s Williston, Pennington, and Heaton, serving with the division, and part of the time Lieut.'s Dennison and Randol, for they always used their guns to the advantage of every one, except the enemy. The medical department of the division in under the immediate control of the very accomplished surgeon, W. H. Rulison, Ninth New York Cavalry, and it is managed to the perfect satisfaction of all concerned. To the officers of my staff, for their invaluable services they have rendered in battle and on the march, I owe more than I can ever repay, and it would be invidious to particularize, for all seemed to vie with each other who would be first in all that is gallant and meritorious; but those who remain will allow me to express my appreciation of one, now absent, and who may not return, Capt. Craig Wadsworth, additional aide-de-camp, a worthy son of a worthy man, son of the lamented Gen. Wadsworth, who has proved himself one of the most gallant, energetic, and meritorious officers who has given his services to his country. From may 26 to June 26, 1864, the division has marched about 400 miles, and in the different engagements has lost as follows:</p>
