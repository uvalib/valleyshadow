  <p>Report of Col. Thomas C. Devin, Sixth New York Cavalry, commanding Second Brigade, including operations May 4-July 2.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION, July 4, 1864.</p>

  <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade, from May 4 to 26, inclusive: On the afternoon of May 4 the brigade marched from Culpeper, and encamped near Sheppard's Grove, on the road to Richards' Ford. May 5, crossed the Rapidan at Ely's Ford, and advanced to Chancellorsville. On the morning of May 6 I was ordered to advance with the brigade and Heaton's battery to the Brock road and take up a position on the right of Gen. Custer, and to endeavor to communicate with and watch the left of our infantry line. If I found Gen. Custer engaged I was ordered to support him. On reaching the position, I found Gen. Custer briskly engaged with the enemy, who had also opened a heavy fire upon him from a battery of three guns posted in a field in his front. I formed the brigade in support, and ordered Lieut. Heaton to place his battery in position behind the crest of the hill in rear of Custer's line, and then to run up his guns by hand to the crest, which was covered with dwarf pine. By this means the guns were trained and ready to open before the enemy were aware of their presence. The guns were at once opened, and in a few minutes the rebel battery was driven from the ground, with a loss of captain, lieutenant, several men, and 8 horses killed. The enemy made no further demonstration at this point during the day. I succeeded in connecting Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry with left of Second Corps, and Sixth New York Cavalry with right of Gen. Gregg, near Todd's Tavern. About 5 p. m. I was ordered to retire to the Furnaces, where the brigade encamped. On the morning of May 7 I was ordered to march to the point occupied the day previous, Gen. Custer following. We met the enemy on the road, drove in his advance, and succeeded in establishing the line on the right; but, as Gen. Gregg had not yet come up on the left, the enemy obstinately held the road to Todd's Tavern. A brisk skirmish ensued on that road, part of Sixth New York Cavalry charging down the road, but were repulsed with some loss, the enemy being dismounted and behind barricades. The advance of Gen. Gregg on the left soon after compelled the enemy to retire, and I was ordered to advance to Todd's Tavern, where the brigade was massed. Brig.-Gen. Merritt having assumed command of the division about 4 p. m., I was ordered to support the Reserve Brigade, then engaged with the enemy on the road to Spotsylvania Court-House. On reaching the front I was informed by Col. Gibbs that his ammunition was exhausted, and upon his request I successively dismounted Sixth and Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and relieved all of the Reserve Brigade that my front would cover. The men went in with a will and drove the enemy through the woods until dark, when I fell back slightly and took up a position at the cross-roads, holding well on the flanks. The brigade having advanced so far that no connection could be made with our troops on the right, I was ordered to fall back to the edge of the woods and encamp.</p>

  <p>53 R R--VOL XXXVI, PT I</p>

  <p>PAGE 834-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>On the morning of May 8 I was ordered to march in rear of the Reserve Brigade, on the road to Spotsylvania Court-House. The enemy were met near the point to which we had driven them the night previous, and a sharp fight ensued. I was ordered to support, and dismounting Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, sent them in on the right and left of the Reserve Brigade. The enemy was driven back to a strong position, barricaded along his whole front, which he succeeded in holding until the cavalry was relieved by the Fifth Corps, when the brigade was ordered to retire. The casualties in the brigade during the two days' fighting around Todd's Tavern summed up as follows: Killed, 7 men; wounded, 3 officers, 43 men; missing, 4 men; total, 3 officers, 54 men.</p>

  <p>The brigade was then ordered to proceed to Silver's, on the plank road, near which point in encamped.</p>

  <p>THE RAID.</p>

  <p>On the morning of May 9 the division, under the command of Brig.-Gen. Merritt, left camp at daybreak. I was ordered to follow in rear of Custer's brigade, and after crossing the Ny, Po, and Mat Rivers, reached Chilesburg, where the division halted to feed. The march was resumed, and, fording the North Anna, the brigade reached a point near Beaver Dam Station, on Virginia Central Railroad, after dark. At this point the Sixth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry were detached to destroy the railroad at the station, after which the brigade encamped.</p>

  <p>May 10, the brigade marched in rear of the division to Negro Foot, where a halt was made. After feeding animals the march was resumed, the brigade crossing Ground Squirrel Bridge, on the South Anna, after dark. The Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry was left on the north side to hold the bridge. The Ninth New York Cavalry and Sixth New York Cavalry encamped on south side.</p>

  <p>May 11, the brigade, having first burned the bridge, marched in rear of the Reserve Brigade, and reached Allen's Station, on Fredericksburg Railroad, at 11 a. m. Parties were immediately detached to destroy the railroad as far as Hungary Station. The enemy showing himself in strong force on left and front, I was ordered to advance to the front and drive him from the Brook turnpike. I moved to Yellow Tavern, where I found part of the Reserve Brigade. Advancing the Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry through the woods on the right, I swung around on the turnpike, driving the enemy from and seizing the cross-roads leading to Ashland and Hanover Court-House, the point being 6 miles from Richmond. I was then ordered to make a reconnaissance toward Richmond, at least as far as Brook Bridge. The Sixth New York Cavalry was ordered to advance, and the two leading squadrons to charge on the rebel cavalry about 500 yards in front. The enemy fled, closely pursued by the Sixth for over 2 miles, across the bridge, and into the outer works of Richmond. Our men were here checked until three squadrons dismounted and drove the rebels from the works, the mounted men charging them beyond Brook Church, and nearly to the inner works. The bells could be heard ringing, locomotives whistling, and general alarm and bustling seemed to prevail in Richmond. I reported the facts to the general commanding division, and was ordered to hold my advanced position as well as the cross-roads, 3 miles in rear. I had but two regiments (Ninth New York</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 835-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>Cavalry having been sent to the left to support Reserve Brigade), and one section Williston's battery. I detached two squadrons of Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry to a cross-road between Brook Bridge and my position to cover the rear of Sixth New York Cavalry, and with the other four squadrons and section of battery held the Ashland fork, opening upon the enemy's flank, while Gen. Custer charged him in front. The Ninth New York Cavalry, which had been sent to my left, had successfully charged and routed Fifth Virginia Cavalry from a strong position, killing their colonel (Pate) and killing and wounding a large number of their officers and men, and capturing 8 commissioned officers and 84 men, for whom they have receipts, although the regiment claims to have captured 115 men and 10 officers. At dark I was ordered to send a reconnaissance to the Mechanicsville turnpike. I ordered Maj. Hall, of Sixth New York Cavalry, on this duty with two squadrons. The reconnaissance was successfully made as far as Meadow Bridges, capturing an orderly with dispatches from Gen. Bragg. At midnight, I was ordered to march in advance of the division and in rear of Gen. Wilson. Passed through the outer works of Richmond, and about daybreak reached the vicinity of Meadow Bridges. Found Gen. Wilson engaging the enemy on the right. I was here ordered to send my pioneers to repair the Meadow Bridges, which the enemy were endeavoring to destroy. Lieut. Cating, with 8 pioneers, drove the party from the bridges and commenced work, but it was soon found that it would require a large force to repair and also to keep off the enemy. working detachments were sent down, and two regiments of First Brigade, armed with spencer rifles, were sent in to keep the enemy in check. After some hours' labor the bridges were repaired, under the direction of Gen. Custer, and I was ordered to follow the First Brigade across the bridge. The enemy having erected strong works on the left of the railroad, covering the bridges and road, and obstinately refusing to leave them, I was ordered to support Gen. Custer with two regiments. I dismounted and advanced the Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry on the left of the railroad. Those two gallant regiments, after coolly deploying in the open field under the enemy's fire, charged full upon his rifle-pits, utterly routing him and capturing a number of prisoners in the works, besides 30 of the enemy's wounded found in and around the works, who could not be taken off. The movement cost me some gallant officers and men. Lieut. Shultz, Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, was killed, and Maj. Corrigan, Ninth New York Cavalry, lost a leg, and has since died of his wounds. The enemy was pursued for a mile, but having no mounted men over the bridge, we were unable to reach him. After the brigade was mounted and formed I was ordered to march with the division to Gaines' Mill.</p>

  <p>May 13, marched with the division from Gaines' Mill to a point near Bottom's Bridge, and encamped.</p>

  <p>May 14, crossed the Chickahominy at Bottom' Bridge, and marched to Malvern Hill.</p>

  <p>May 17, I received orders to advance with my own and Reserve brigade to the cross-roads at New Market, and threaten the enemy in that direction. I placed the Reserve Brigade in position near New Market, and with the Second Brigade advanced to Camp Holly. From that point I ordered one regiment to proceed on the Varina road in the direction of Chaffin's Bluff. The regiment (Ninth New</p>

  <p>PAGE 836-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>York Cavalry) returned at night, having met a party of Forty-second Battalion Virginia Cavalry, who they routed, capturing 1 commissioned officer. I returned to camp at Malvern Hill, and the same night marched to Long Bridge.</p>

  <p>May 18, crossed the Chickahominy at Jones' Bridge, and marched to Baltimore Store, and encamped.</p>

  <p>May 21, marched to White House and encamped.</p>

  <p>May 22, crossed the Pamunkey at night and encamped.</p>

  <p>May 23, marched by King William Court-House, to the Mattapony, opposite Dunkirk, at which point I was ordered to bridge the river, if possible. This I effected by means of scows or ferry-boats, lashed together, anchored, and covered with lumber, procured by tearing down the store-houses at the ferry. The bridge was amply sufficient to cross the corps. The Sixth New York Cavalry were sent across mounted, and held the roads in front.</p>

  <p>May 24, the brigade marched, with the division, by Mangohick Church to Reedy Swamp, where it encamped. Horses and men suffered terrible with heat and dust. I had the horses led for 5 miles, and lost but few.</p>

  <p>May 25, marched in rear of the division, by Chesterfield Station, to Pole Cat Creek, where it encamped near the train.</p>

  <p>Although diminished in numbers by the absence of one regiment (Fourth New York Cavalry) an battery, the brigade sustained its well-earned reputation throughout this short and sharp campaign. The regimental commandants, Col. Sackett, Ninth New York Cavalry; Lieut.-Col. Anderson, Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry; and Lieut.-Col. Crocker, Sixth New York Cavalry, were conspicuous at all times for their gallantry and enterprise, and were well supported by their officers and men. To the brigade staff, Surgeon Clarke, Capt.'s Mahnken, Wright, and White, and Lieut.'s Cating and Parker, acting aides, I am indebted for valuable service. The lists of casualties have already been forwarded.</p>

  <p>Trusting this report may be found satisfactory, I am, very respectfully, you obedient servant,</p>

  <p>HDQRS. SECOND Brig., FIRST DIV., CAVALRY CORPS, July 4, 1864.</p>

  <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade since May 26, 1864:</p>

  <p>The brigade left camp near Pole Cat Creek in advance of the division on the morning of May 26 and marched to Mangohick Church, where the division halted for some hours. At 10 p. m. I marched in rear of the division, and one hour before daybreak reached the Pamunkey opposite Hanovertown. On the morning of May 27 crossed the pontoon bridge in rear of the division, and went into position on the hill to the right and front of Hanovertown. The Seventeenth Pennsylvania was ordered to the right to support a regiment of the First Brigade, then advancing upon and skirmishing with the enemy. One section of Heaton's battery was also placed</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 837-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>in position upon the right, the other section covering the approaches from Hanover Court-House. One squadron Ninth New York was ordered to the extreme right to cover the flank of the Seventeenth Pennsylvania. The enemy showing a disposition to retire, the Seventeenth Pennsylvania was ordered to swing around to its left flank through the woods and advance toward the road leading to Hanover Court-House. Lieut.-Col. Anderson successfully accomplished the movement as directed, capturing 2 rebel officers and 18 privates. At this point the line was connected with the right of the First Brigade. The enemy having withdrawn into the woods covering the bridge over Crump's Creek, I ordered part of the squadron of Ninth New York to charge down the road and develop his position. The charge was gallantly led by Capt. Wright, brigade inspector. The rebel pickets were met at the bridge, driven across the creek and over the opposite hill, where nearly a brigade of South Carolina cavalry was discovered in the road, attempting to get into position. Without hesitation the little band charged them and at one time had double their own number prisoners. The bridge having been partly destroyed and the party on retiring being hotly pursued, they succeeded in bringing off but 3 commissioned officers and 18 privates, prisoners. Ascertaining that the ground beyond was open, I ordered the Seventeenth Pennsylvania to mount and prepare to press the enemy, but as the regiment was about to advance I was ordered to hold the bridge and line of the creek. The Ninth New York was placed in position on the line indicated and the Seventeenth Pennsylvania and Sixth New York in line in the field to the right of the road, with Heaton's battery in position. The brigade soon after went into camp. The day's operations summed up a loss on the part of the brigade, 1 man killed, 2 wounded, and 1 missing; total 4. Five commissioned officers and 36 privates in all were captured by the brigade.</p>

  <p>On the morning of May 28, the enemy having retired from the vicinity of the creek, Lieut.-Col. Anderson, Seventeenth Pennsylvania, was ordered to advance and feel his position on the hill 1 1/2 miles in front. After skirmishing an hour the enemy was found strongly posted on the hill and wooded declivity in its front. As it was not intended to force an engagement, Lieut.-Col. Anderson was ordered to retire, and a division of the Sixth Corps having relieved the brigade, I was ordered to march to Haw's Shop. Arriving at this point, the brigade was massed in brigade line of regiments in squadron column, in rear of the Second Division, then engaged with the enemy. At dark I was ordered to march to Hanovertown, where the brigade encamped for the night.</p>

  <p>May 29, the brigade crossed Totopotomoy Creek and advanced to a position on the Old Church road, connecting with Second Division.</p>

  <p>May 30, I advanced to a position on right and rear of Lipscomb's Tavern, where the brigade encamped. I was here ordered to communicate with Gen. Warren's left (who was advancing toward Shady Grove Church) and to picket and hold Cold Harbor road. After a personal reconnaissance on the latter road, I posted the reserve on the strong position at Matadequin Run, with pickets advanced to the road forks three-fourths of a mile in front. My orders were, if attacked, the reserve should hold the run in any event until support arrived.</p>

  <p>PAGE 838-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>FIGHT AT MATADEQUIN CREEK.</p>

  <p>About one hour after being posted the advanced pickets were attacked by a battalion of cavalry and driven across the creek, at which point the enemy were checked. I immediately ordered Maj. Durland with the other two squadrons (three squadrons being detached on the Mechanicsville road) to support his pickets and re-establish them. This was effected in a short time, the enemy retiring upon being charged and the pickets were again advanced. About one hour after the first attack it was again renewed in force. Ordering the Sixth and Ninth New York to saddle up and follow, I proceeded to the front and found the three squadrons of the Seventeenth briskly engaged with the enemy, who was endeavoring to force a passage across the creek. I immediately dismounted and deployed the Sixth New York on the right of the Seventeenth and the Ninth New York on the left. There was but little time for reconnoitering the ground, which on both flanks was heavily wooded, as the enemy was pressing both flanks of the Seventeenth, but I judged it to average the same as that in my front, and believing that the enemy's force was not superior to my own, I intended as soon as his front was fully developed to turn his left with the Sixth New York and endeavor to secure some prisoners and horses. At this time the general commanding division came upon the ground and assumed command. The enemy began to show a much heavier force, and successively the Reserve Brigade and part of the First Brigade were sent in and became warmly engaged. The ammunition of the Seventeenth Pennsylvania having become exhausted, they were temporarily relieved, the Second Regulars taking up their position. The Sixth New York forced a passage across the ravine and creek, and pressed the enemy's left successfully. The Ninth New York, on the left, after crossing two very deep ravines, found themselves on the north bank of the creek with an abrupt descent and ascent of nearly 40 feet on each bank and the enemy strongly barricaded on the edge of the woods facing the south bank, with a clearing of 15 rods in his front. After losing some valuable men, Col. Sackett was forced to abandon the attempt to cross in the face of the enemy until the gallant charge of two regiments of First Brigade in the center relieved him by flanking the left of the rebel position, when he immediately crossed the creek and pressed the enemy sharply, capturing a number of prisoners. At this time a general advance being ordered and the enemy in full retreat, I advanced to the forks, and thence to the intersection of Bottom's Bridge road with that to White House, at which point the brigade encamped for the night. The day's operations summed up in loss to the brigade of 1 commissioned officer killed and 3 wounded; 4 enlisted men killed, 21 wounded, and 2 missing; total, 31.</p>

  <p>FIGHT AT COLD HARBOR.</p>

  <p>On the afternoon of May 31 I received the following order:</p>

  <p>HDQRS. FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,<br />
  May 31, 1864.<br />
  Col. DEVIN,</p>

  <p>Cmdg. Second Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps:<br />
  COL.: There will be an advance of the division on Cold Harbor this p.m. You will be in the saddle and start promptly at 4 p.m. on the road where your scouts went this morning. From all information I can gain, you can go within 1 1/2</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 839-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>miles of Cold Harbor without meeting their pickets. Keep a few men ahead, and when they meet the enemy halt and let your command close up. When you hear that I am well engaged on the right, where Gen. Merritt will advance, I want you to make a bold push for Cold Harbor. It is possible you may have to dismount regiment to attract the enemy, attract should read attack. but you must send one or two saber regiments in among their led Correction from General Index. horses. Gen. Custer will send one regiment across the country from his present position, starting at 4 p.m. Caution your men of this, and don't fire on them if they get into Cold Harbor in advance, or while marching up there. Have no bugle calls while getting ready. Endeavor to communicate with me across country. I will be on the road where Gen. Merritt is.</p>

  <p>Yours, &amp;c.,<br />
  A. T. A. TORBERT,<br />
  Brig.-Gen. of Volunteers, Cmdg. First Cavalry Division.</p>

  <p>The roads by which I was directed to reach Cold Harbor formed two sides of a quadrangle, on one side of which Gen. Merritt was to advance. I started at the hour named with one squadron (Hanley's) of Ninth New York in advance. When within 2 miles of Cold Harbor a line of pickets was discovered across the road and faced toward us. I halted and closed the column, as per order, and advancing to reconnoiter, found them to be the pickets of Fifth Michigan. I immediately ordered the commanding officer to take his regiment off the road and to the right, and again advanced. One mile in advance of this point I was fired upon by the enemy's pickets, and, charging upon them, was stopped by a barricade with dense thicket on each side. At this time skirmishing was first heard on our right, apparently from Gen. Merritt's advance. I immediately dismounted the Seventeenth Pennsylvania (as I wished to keep the Ninth New York mounted for a charge), and advanced through the woods, at the same time removing the barricade, and ordering the Ninth to follow mounted. The Seventeenth became almost immediately heavily engaged, losing a number of men. We had by this time almost reached Cold Harbor, but, finding another strong barricade in my front, and the pressure on the left of the Seventeenth becoming very heavy, I was forced to dismount the Ninth New York to support them. I now had but one regiment left (Sixth New York) to guard my left, rear, and led horses, but I determined, if opportunity offered, to send that in mounted. On emerging from the woods near Cold Harbor, I found myself in the direct front of the enemy's barricades, which extended one-third of a mile to my left, from which they were then maintaining a very heavy fire on the Seventeenth Pennsylvania, then charging on the cross-roads. The Ninth New York at this time advancing on the left and rear of the Seventeenth, the enemy left his position behind the barricade and retired in the direction of Gaines' Hill. There was no opportunity to use the saber. The nature of the country effectually prevented a mounted command from reaching the right flank of the enemy's position, and it was utterly impossible to force a passage up the road until the barricade had been carried and removed and the enemy driven from the woods on the left. Not a moment's time was lost after reaching the first barricade until the brigade fought its way into Cold Harbor. The Seventeenth Pennsylvania alone lost nearly 30 men in half an hour. The brigade was then ordered to take up a position (dismounted) on Gen. Custer's left, and erect barricades, with a view maintaining the important position from which the enemy had been driven by the division. About midnight the brigade was ordered to retire to the position it had occupied in the morning. On reaching the Bottom's Bridge road, I was ordered</p>

  <p>PAGE 840-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>to halt and await orders. At 3 a.m. I was ordered to return and reoccupy my position at Cold Harbor. This I effected at daylight, and again connected with Gen. Custer. During the attack on the position which followed my command was not engaged, excepting the advances skirmishers. About noon the brigade was relieved, and marched in rear of the division to Prospect Church, where it encamped for the night.</p>

  <p>June 2, the Seventeenth was ordered to proceed in the direction of Cold Harbor and endeavor to find some road leading to the left of our position of the day previous, and to communicate with the left of our infantry line. Lieut.-Col. Anderson, commanding Seventeenth Pennsylvania, found it impossible to reach the left, except by the direct approach to Cold Harbor, and after making a detour of some miles found himself at Sumner's Bridge, where Gen. Gregg was engaging the enemy. Part of the Sixth New York, under Maj. Hall, was sent in toward Dispatch Station, where they met two squadrons of rebel cavalry, which they drove toward Bottom's [Bridge]. About noon the brigade advanced to the bridge, the advance guard, under Capt. Aitkens, driving a strong party of the enemy's cavalry across the bridge. The Sixth New York was ordered to the vicinity of the bridge when the enemy unmasked a gun upon the south bank and opened upon the led horses of Sixth New York with solid shot, killing 4 horses and taking off the leg of 1 private of Sixth New York. The brigade went into camp on the left of the bridge, which the Sixth continued to hold, although much annoyed by the enemy's sharpshooters. Lieut. Cortely on was severely wounded while relieving his skirmishers.</p>

  <p>June 4, the brigade marched to Old Church, at which point Heaton's battery and the Fourth New York Cavalry, with some remounted men of other regiment, joined the brigade.</p>

  <p>June 5, the brigade marched to Studley's, near Haw's Shop, and encamped for the night.</p>

  <p>June 6, the command marched by Hanovertown to New Castle Ferry and went into camp.</p>

  <p>June 7, the brigade crossed the Pamunkey at New Castle Ferry on pontoons, and marched in rear of the division to a point 2 miles north of Aylett's, where it encamped for the night.</p>

  <p>June 8, marched by Pole Cat Station to a point near Athens, where the brigade encamped.</p>

  <p>June 9, marched by Chilesburg to the vicinity of New Market, where the brigade encamped.</p>

  <p>June 10, marched to Good Hope Church, at which point the Seventeenth Pennsylvania was ordered to proceed to a point on the right flank where a rebel hospital was said to be located. Marched from Good Hope Church to Woolfolk's farm, 5 miles from Trevilian Station, where the brigade encamped.</p>

  <p>June 11, the pickets of the brigade were attacked at daylight, but the enemy (a small party) were driven off. Shortly after the Reserve Brigade advanced toward Trevilian and my command was ordered to follow. The Reserve Brigade soon became heavily engaged, and I was ordered to send one regiment in support. The Ninth New York was deployed and advanced on the right of the main road, connecting on its right with the First New York Dragoons, and on the left with a small detachment of Second Regulars (30 men). I was now ordered to send in the Fourth New York on the left of Gen. Merritt's line. The regiment was deployed,</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 841-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>connecting on the right with First Regulars and on the left with Col. Gregg's brigade. The First Regulars being soon after withdrawn from the left, the Fourth New York was ordered to move to the right and connect with the road. Heaton's battery having been sent to the extreme left, three squadrons of the Sixth New York were ordered to support it. One squadron of the Sixth had been sent to communicate with Gen. Custer, and one squadron in rear of the division trains.</p>

  <p>FIGHT OF 11TH, NEAR TREVILIAN.</p>

  <p>The two regiments of my brigade, Fourth and Ninth New York, being now formed on each side of the road, I assumed command at that point and advanced with the line. Gen. Torbert, commanding division, came up immediately after and advanced with the skirmishers. On emerging from the woods the enemy were found occupying with their center a house and orchard, on a ridge three-quarters of a mile in front of Trevilian. I ordered the advance to be sounded, and the Ninth New York to charge and occupy the house and orchard. This they accomplished with a cheer, taking a number of prisoners. Gen. Torbert immediately ordered the line to be formed on the crest until the alignment could be rectified, the enemy still maintaining a heavy fire. In charging the orchard the Ninth New York had diverged to the right, and the Fourth New York continuing to keep the left of the road, a regiment of Gregg's brigade had crossed the rear of the Fourth New York and came out of the right. I immediately formed the regiment on the crest, on the left of Ninth New York. An advance was again ordered, and sending for Heaton's battery and the Sixth New York, I directed Lieut. Parker, of my staff, to re-establish the connection between Fourth and Ninth New York, and to press on to the station, which was successfully accomplished, the station occupied, and a number of prisoners captured from Fifth South Carolina, together with a hospital wagon, loaded with stores, and one battle-flag. I was then ordered to bring the battery and Sixth New York. Gen. Merritt having now advanced his line upon the right, I placed Heaton's battery in position in rear of his right, the approach to my position on the left being difficult and the position of the battery on the right being an excellent one. Soon after the enemy pressed and attempted to drive in the skirmishers of the Reserve Brigade, when I ordered the battery to open, and the rebels were soon driven to the woods. At a later hour they advanced in heavier force on the same point, but again the well-directed fire of the battery drove the enemy to shelter, and he desisted from further effort. Gen. Torbert then ordered the battery to take up a position 150 yards in advance of the previous one. The line at the same time advanced . About 6 p.m. the Fourth New York and First New York Dragoons were ordered to advance and feel the position in front. I advanced with the Fourth New York, and ascertained that the enemy had retired beyond the fork of Gordonsville and Charlottesville roads. I was ordered by Gen. Torbert to hold the forks, which I did with the Sixth New York, the other regiments remaining in position at the station, and connecting on the left with Gen. Custer's and on the right with Gen. Merritt's brigades. The Seventeenth had come in during the day after a hard march of 20 miles on the right, Lieut.-Col. Anderson having paroled some 63 men and 1</p>

  <p>PAGE 842-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>officer, and brought in 35 men and 1 officer prisoners. The Fourth and Ninth New York captured during the engagement 10 officers and 101 men; turned over besides a number of wounded left in the hands of the surgeons. On losses were severe. Col. Sackett, Ninth New York, was mortally wounded while gallantly leading his regiment into action, and several other officers and many brave men fell before the station was carried. During the afternoon details were made from the Fourth and Ninth New York, and the railroad at the station was thoroughly torn up.</p>

  <p>FIGHT OF THE 12TH BEYOND TREVILIAN.</p>

  <p>The next morning. June 12, the work of destroying the railroad station, water-tank, &amp;c., was renewed and continued until after noon. The brigade was then ordered to advance and mass in rear of Custer's brigade, which was moving upon the enemy's position beyond the road forks. I was at the same time ordered to hold the road to Mumford's, across South Anna. The enemy shortly after made a demonstration on that road, but the Ninth New York being sent out in support of the pickets, their rebels were checked and driven back. I was then ordered to send one regiment dismounted to the right of the railroad, and two mounted regiments to report to Gen. Merritt. I forthwith sent the regiment as ordered, the Seventeenth with Lieut. Cating, of the brigade staff, and the Fourth and Sixth New York with Lieut. Goldsmith, of division staff. I remained with the Ninth New York and battery near the position first taken up. As I was not personally engaged in the action which followed, I would respectfully refer to annexed reports* of regimental commanders for details of the position assigned to and part taken by their regiments. At dark, hearing that the command was falling back, I proceeded to the front, and meeting Col. Cesnola, Fourth New York, who was endeavoring to reform his command. I ordered him to form at the road forks. I sent Lieut. Cating to retire the Seventeenth, and Capt. Wright to bring out the Sixth New York. The former regiment had been obliged to shift position to the right, and it was 10.30 p.m. before the regiment could be found and retired. The loss of the three regiments was severe, amounting to 1 officer killed and 5 wounded; 18 enlisted men killed, 62 wounded, and 15 missing. At midnight the brigade was ordered to march with the division, and crossing the North Anna and North Fork, went into camp near Twyman's Store on the afternoon of June 13.</p>

  <p>June 14, the brigade marched in rear of the division to Shady Grove Church, near which point it encamped.</p>

  <p>June 15, marched by Spotsylvania Court-House to Stanard's Marsh and encamped.</p>

  <p>June 16, marched by Bowling Green to a point near Mattacocy Bridge and encamped.</p>

  <p>June 17, marched to Newtown, Chapel bridge and Clarksville to a point near Walkertown, and encamped.</p>

  <p>June 18, marched by Walkertown to King and Queen Court-House, and encamped.</p>

  <p>June 19, marched by Walkertown and Clarksville to Dunkirk. Two squadrons of the Sixth New York were ordered to swim their horses over the Mattapony and hold the opposite front until the</p>

  <p>pontoon should be laid. Heaton's battery was placed in position on the hill to the left covering the crossing. The remainder of the brigade went into camp.</p>

  <p>June 20, crossed the pontoon bridge in the rear of the division, the Fourth New York being ordered to remain at Dunkirk as guard to the bridge and train, marched by King William Court-House and Lanesville to camp near the White House bridge.</p>

  <p>June 21, crossed the railroad bridge and massed in the field beyond. I was here ordered to march to Saint Peter's Church.</p>

  <p>FIGHT NEAR SAINT PETER'S CHURCH.</p>

  <p>With the three regiments of the brigade, and the rifle section of Heaton's battery, I advanced up the hill on the road to Saint Peter's Church. Almost immediately after entering the woods I met the enemy's advance, and, after a brisk skirmish, drove them about a mile, until I came in sight of the church, about 600 yards on my left front. On the direct and right front the road continued through thick woods. At this point the enemy made a determined stand, and I was obliged to dismount the Ninth New York, the ammunition of part of the Seventeenth becoming exhausted. The enemy's front could be "felt" for one-half mile to the right of the road, and could be seen for half a mile to the left of the church. The ground on the left was open with deep ravines between my position and the church. Heavy columns of dust could be seen passing from extreme left to right. A squadron of Sixth New York was disposed to watch the left flank, when the enemy's dismounted skirmishers advanced down the hill, and opened a hot fire upon them, driving them back. I was obliged to dismount other squadrons of the Sixth, who soon checked and drove back the enemy. The rebel line was evidently just in front of an parallel with the road from Saint's Peter's Church to Tunstall's. A prisoner from Wickham's brigade stated that Lee and Hampton were both in front, and there was evidently a heavy force. At the time I had replenished my ammunition and was about to make a determined effort to drive the enemy from their cross-road in front (having notified the general commanding of my intention), I received orders not to advance until ordered. While awaiting orders Lieut.-Col. Anderson, of the Seventeenth, notified me that the enemy appeared to be retiring, when I assumed the responsibility of advancing, and occupied the cross-roads and church without opposition. On the right the enemy's rear guard be seen retiring in haste. During the heavy skirmishing in front, the enemy opened one gun from the right of the church, but as it did not annoy me I did not unmask my section, not wishing to use it until about to advance. During this short but severe fight, Maj. Bentley, Ninth New York, one of our bravest and most efficient officers, was struck in the leg, necessitating amputation. I was ordered to hold the cross-roads and church, which I did with the Ninth New York, the other regiments retiring 2 miles to camp, where I was joined by the Fourth New York, which had brought the pontoon train from Dunkirk.</p>

  <p>June 22, I was ordered to march with the brigade to Baltimore Store; thence in advance of the division to Jones' Bridge, on the Chickahominy. Arriving at that point a small party of the enemy were found attempting to destroy the bridge over the mill-race. They were driven off and the bridge partially saved. Some men</p>

  <p>PAGE 844-67 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. XLVIII. [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>were immediately thrown across and found the same party endeavoring to destroy the bridge across the river. Knowing the importance of preserving whatever means of crossing existed, I had advanced to the bridge, and immediately ordered Maj. Beardsley, with the other squadrons of the Sixth York, to cross and occupy the roads in front. The brigade followed and encamped in advance of the division, holding the roads leading to Charles City Court-House and Long Bridge.</p>

  <p>FIGHT AT JONES' BRIDGE.</p>

  <p>On the morning of June 23 Lieut.-Col. Nichols, with the Ninth New York, was sent on special service to the James River. Soon after the pickets of the Sixth New York on Long Bridge road were attacked by a heavy force of the enemy, who succeeded in flanking their barricades and drove them into within 500 yards of the main road. They were quickly re-enforced by the other squadrons and the enemy were checked until I came up with the Fourth New York and Seventeenth Pennsylvania. In the mean time, Getty, whose column had halted near the road, had offered me a colored regiment until I could get my other regiments up. The colored soldiers behaved well enough at first, but their officers could not be found, and they were soon in hopeless confusion. I relieved them with the Seventeenth Pennsylvania, and sending in the Fourth New York on the right, drove the enemy back to a strong position, which he had barricaded, and from which on my again advancing to assail him, he retired with precipitation. I immediately established my pickets 1 mile in advance of my former position and returned to camp. The attacking force was Chambliss' brigade and two guns. Our loss was 6 men killed, 1 officer and 8 men wounded, and 1 man missing, nearly all the killed being from the pickets of Sixth New York, and showing the desperate tenacity with which they endeavored to hold their position.</p>

  <p>On the morning of June 24 the brigade marched in rear of the division by Charles City Court-House to James River, arriving after night-all. The brigade had scarcely encamped before "boots and saddles" was sounded and I was ordered to march to the road forks, 1 1/2 miles beyond Charles City Court-House, and support Gen. Getty, who had been ordered to hold that position. On arriving near that point I massed the brigade and battery in the field on his left and rear, and dismounting the Seventeenth Pennsylvania and Fourth New York, relieved Gen. Getty's line on the left of the main road, holding the approach by which the enemy was executed to advance with one 12-pounder gun in position at the road fork. The night passed without alarm except from Gen. Getty's troops, who would fire into each other occasionally. The infantry retired soon after daylight, and an hour afterward I was relieved and marched to Charles City Court-House, thence to camp near Wyanoke Landing.</p>

  <p>June 28, the brigade crossed in transports to Wind Mill Point and encamped.</p>

  <p>June 29, marched to Prince George Court-House.</p>

  <p>June 30, marched to Lee's Mills; thence to Jerusalem plank road; returning and encamping near Lee's Mills.</p>

  <p>July 1, marched to plank road, and at night camped at intersection of road to Prince George Court-House.</p>

  <p>July 2, marched to James River, and encamped at Light-House Point.</p>

  <p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 845-67 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>

  <p>During the short but arduous campaign since May 26 the brigade has lost 220 officers and men killed and wounded, a loss comparatively severe when it is recollected that they were all old and tried soldiers. But 49 men are missing, many of whom doubtless have been killed or wounded, while during the same time the brigade has captured from the enemy over 200 men and 20 officers.</p>

  <p>Where all have done their whole duty it is impossible to discriminate. The regimental commanders, their officers and the men, have, as always heretofore, been up to the mark whenever they have been placed or whenever duty has been intrusted to them.</p>

  <p>The brigade staff, Capt.'s Mahnken, Wright, and White, and my acting aides, Lieut.'s Cating and Parker, have rendered me most valuable and often hazardous service. Dr. Clarke, surgeon-in-chief, has been indefatigable in the performance of his duties, and the wounded owe much to his timely care and prescience. Lieut. Wheeler, acting assistant quartermaster of the brigade, has as usual rendered valuable service, not only to the command but to the whole division, and I would again urge upon superior authority the claims of this energetic and efficient officer.</p>

  <p>Trusting this report may be found satisfactory, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>THOS. C. DEVIN,<br />
  Col., Cmdg. Brigade.</p>

  <p>Capt. A. E. DANA,<br />
  Asst. Adjt. Gen., First Div., Cavalry Corps.</p>

  <p>N. B.--I should have stated that it was by Gen. Torbert's order that Lieut. Cating was sent to bring out the Seventeenth Pennsylvania on the night of June 12.</p>
