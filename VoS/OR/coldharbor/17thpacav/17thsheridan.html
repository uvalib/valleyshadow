      No. 67.] </p>
    <p> HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, New Orleans, La., May 13, 1866. GEN.: I have the honor
      to make the following report of the operations of the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac, from
      April 6, 1864, to August 4, 1864: </p>
    <p> On March 27, 1864, I was relieved from the command of the Second Division, Forth Corps, Army
      of the Chamberland, to take command of the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac, and on the 4th
      of April, in General Orders, No. 144, current series, War Department, I was assigned to that
      corps, then lying in the vicinity of Brandy Station, Va. The corps consisted of three
      divisions and twelve batteries of horse artillery, and in a few days after I joined was
      adjusted as follows: Brig. Gen. A. T. A. Torbert to command the First Division; Brig. Gen. D.
      McM. Gregg, the Second Division; and Brig. Gen. J. H. Wilson, the Third Division; the
      artillery being under the command of Capt. Robertson, U. S. Army. The officers and men were in
      pretty good condition, so far as health and equipment were concerned, but their horses were
      thin and very much worn out by excessive, and, it seemed to me, unnecessary picket duty, the
      picket-line almost completely encircling the infantry and artillery camps of the army,
      covering a distance, if stretched out on a continuous line, of nearly 60 miles. The enemy,
      more wise, had been husbanding the strength and efficiency of his horses by sending them to
      the rear, in order to bring them out in the spring in good condition of the impending
      campaign; however, shortly after my taking command, much of the picketing was done away with,
      and we had about two weeks of leisure time to nurse the horses, on which so much depended;
      consequently, on the 4th of May, when the campaign opened, I found myself with about 10,000
      effective men, and the same number of horses in passable trim. After carefully studying the
      topography of the country from the Rapidan to Richmond, which is of a thickly wooded
      character, its numerous and almost parallel streams nearly all uniting, forming the York Rive,
      I took up the idea that our cavalry ought to fight the enemy's cavalry, and our infantry the
      enemy's infantry. I was strengthened in this impression still more by the consciousness of a
      want of appreciation on the part of infantry commanders as to the power of a large and
      well-managed body of horse, but as it was difficult to overcome the established custom of
      wasting cavalry for the protection of trains, and for the establishment of cordons around a
      sleeping infantry force, we had to bide our time. </p>
    <p> On May 4 the army moved; Gregg's division taking the advance to Ely's Ford, on the Rapidan;
      Wilson's the advance to Germanna Ford, on the same stream; Torbert's covering the trains of
      the army in rear, holding from Mitchells' Station to Culpeper, and around to Stevensburg, and
      strongly picketing the fords from Germanna Ford to Rapidan Station. As soon as the Second
      Corps reached Ely's Ford, Gregg moved to Chancellorsville, and, upon the Fifth Corps reaching
      Germanna Ford, Wilson made the crossing of the Rapidan, moved through Old Wilderness, and
      advanced to Parker's Store. On the 5th Torbert joined me at Chancellorsville, and Gen. Meade
      ordered Wilson in the direction of Craig's Meeting-House, where he was attacked, and, after a
      sharp engagement, driven back, via Shady Grove Church, to Todd's Tavern. It was necessary for
      him to take this route, as the enemy's infantry had advanced from the direction of Orange
      Court-House, and had occupied Parker's Store and the direct road back to our army. When Gen.
      Meade discovered that Wilson was cut off, he sent word to me, near Chancellorsville, to go to
      his relief, and I immediately dispatched Gen. Gregg's division in the direction of Todd's
      Tavern, where he met Wilson, who was still being followed up. The enemy's pursuing force was
      attacked by Gregg at this place, defeated, and driven to Shady Grove Church, a distance of 3
      or 4 miles. It was now well understood that the enemy's cavalry at Hamilton's Crossing had
      joined Gen. Lee's forces, and the necessity for my moving to that point, as ordered, was
      obviated. </p>
    <p> As I was held responsible for the left flank of our army and the trains, I made such
      disposition of the troops under my command as to hold the line of the Brock road, beyond the
      Furnaces, and thence around to Todd's Tavern and Piney Branch Church, but Gen. Meade, on false
      report, became alarmed about his left, and notified me in the following note that Hancock's
      left had been turned, and directed me to draw in my forces to protect the trains: </p>
    <p> HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, </p>
    <p> May 6, 1864--1 p. m. </p>
    <p> Maj.-Gen. SHERIDAN, </p>
    <p> Cmdg. Cavalry Corps: </p>
    <p> Your dispatch of 11.45 a. m. received. Gen. Hancock has been heavily pressed, and his left
      turned. The major-general commanding thinks that you had better draw in your cavalry so as to
      secure the protection of the trains. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> The order requiring an escort for the wagons to-night has been rescinded. </p>
    <p> A. A. HUMPHREYS, </p>
    <p> Maj.-Gen. and Chief of Staff. </p>
    <p> I obeyed this order, and the enemy took possession of the Furnaces, Todd's Tavern, and Piney
      Branch Church, the regaining which cost much fighting on the 6th and 7th, and very many
      gallant officers and men. </p>
    <p> On the 6th Custer fought at the Furnaces and defeated the enemy, who left his dead and
      wounded in our hands. On the 7th the trains of the army, under directions from headquarters
      Army of the Potomac, were put in motion to go into park at Piney Branch Church. As this point
      was held by the enemy, I was confident that the order must have been given without fully
      understanding the condition of affairs, and therefore thought the best way to remedy the
      trouble was to halt the trains in the vicinity of Alrich's, attack the enemy, and regain the
      ground. This led to the battle of Todd's Tavern, in which the enemy was defeated. Gregg
      attacked with one of his brigades on the Catharpin road, and drove the enemy over Corbin's
      Bridge; Merritt, who was in command of the First Division during the temporary absence of
      Torbert, attacked with his division, on the Spotsylvania road, driving him toward
      Spotsylvania, and Davies' brigade, of Gregg's division, made a handsome attack on the Piney
      Branch Church road, uniting with Merritt on the Spotsylvania road. The pursuit was kept up
      until dark. Gregg's and Merritt's divisions encamped in open fields, in the vicinity of Todd's
      tavern, with orders to move in the morning, at daylight, for the purpose of gaining possession
      of Snell's Bridge, over the Po River. To accomplish this, Wilson, who was at Alsop's house,
      was directed to take possession of Spotsylvania early on the morning of the 8th, and thence
      move into position at Snell's Bridge. Gregg and Merritt were ordered to proceed to the same
      point, the former via the crossing at Corbin's Bridge, the latter by the Block house. Had
      these movements been carried out successfully, it would probably have sufficiently delayed the
      march of the enemy to Spotsylvania Court-House as to enable our infantry to reach that point
      first, and the battles fought there would have probably occurred elsewhere; but upon the
      arrival of Gen. Meade at Todd's Tavern the orders were changed, and Gregg was simply directed
      by him to hold Corbin's Bridge, and Merritt's division ordered in front of the infantry
      column, marching on the road to Spotsylvania in the darkness of the night, the cavalry and
      infantry becoming entangled in the advance, causing much confusion and delay. I was not duly
      advised of these changes, and for a time had fears for the safety of Gen. Wilson's command,
      which had proceeded, in accordance with my instructions, to Spotsylvania Court-House,
      capturing and holding it until driven out by the advance of Longstreet's corps. </p>
    <p> The time had now come to leave the Wilderness, where we had successfully held the left of
      the army, and defeated the enemy's cavalry on the 5th at Todd's Tavern and at the Furnaces;
      again on the 6th at the Furnaces, and on the 7th at Todd's Tavern. During the 8th I received
      orders to go out and engage the rebel cavalry, and when out of forage, of which we had half
      rations for one day, I was to proceed to the James River, and replenish from the stores which
      Gen. Butler had at Bermuda Hundred. Pursuant to this order the three divisions of cavalry, on
      the evening of this day, were concentrated in the vicinity of Alrich's, on the plank road to
      Fredericksburg, and on the morning of the 9th commenced the march. It will be seen, upon
      examination of the map of Virginia, that there was but very little space for a large cavalry
      force to operate on the left of our army, from Spotsylvania to the Rappahannock, and that we
      were liable to be shut in. I therefore concluded to march around the right of Lee's army, and
      put my command, before fighting, south of the North Anna, where I expected to procure grain;
      where I was confident that while engaging the enemy's cavalry no timely assistance from his
      infantry could be procured, and whence, if not successful, I could proceed west and rejoin our
      army, swinging around toward Gordonsville and Orange Court-House. With this view we started,
      marching out on the plank road to Tabernacle Church; trench to the Telegraph road; thence down
      through Chilesburg to Anderson's Crossing of the North Anna. This movement was made at a walk,
      with three divisions on the same road-making a column of about 13 miles in length-marching by
      the flank of the enemy. I preferred this, however, to the combinations arising from separate
      roads, combinations rarely working as expected, and generally failing, unless subordinate
      commanders are prompt and fully understand the situation; besides, and engagement was
      imminent, and it was necessary that the force be well together. As soon as the Ny Po, and Ta
      Rivers, each giving an excellent defensive line to the enemy, were passed, all cause for
      anxiety was removed, and our ability to cross the North Anna unquestionable. </p>
    <p> After passing the Ta River the enemy's cavalry came against the rear of my column, and Gen.
      Davies, who had the rear brigade, was directed to fight as rear guard, following up the main
      column. It is with pleasure I say that he and his command performed this responsible and
      trying duty with courage and good judgment. About dark Merritt crossed the North Anna at
      Anderson's Ford; Gregg and Wilson encamped on the north side, engaging the enemy up to a late
      hour at night. After Merritt's division crossed, Custer's brigade was ordered to Beaver Dam
      Station on the Virginia Central Railroad, where he recaptured 375 Union prisoners, taken by
      the enemy in the Wilderness; destroyed the station, 2 locomotives, 3 trains, 100 cars, 90
      wagons, from 8 to 10 miles telegraph wire and railroad, 200,000 pounds bacon, and other
      supplies, amounting in all to about 1,500,000 rations, and nearly all medical stores of Gen.
      Lee's army. These stores had been moved from Orange Court-House to this point, either because
      Gen. Lee wished to have them directly in his rear-the road used for hauling from Orange
      Court-House to Spotsylvania being on a parallel line to his line of battle-or because he
      contemplated falling back, or being driven back, to the North Anna. On the morning of the 10th
      Gregg and Wilson were again attacked, but their crossing was covered by the division on the
      south side of the North Anna, and was effected without much loss. </p>
    <p> An important point of the expedition had now been gained, and we had also obtained forage
      for our almost famished animals; our next object was to husband their strength and prepare to
      fight. It now became apparent that the enemy, in following up our rear, had made a great
      mistake, and he began to see it, for, when we leisurely took to Negro Foot road to Richmond, a
      doubt arose in his mind as to whether his tactics were good, whereat he immediately halted off
      from the rear, and urged his horses to the death so as to get in between Richmond and our
      column. This he effected, concentrating at Yellow Tavern, 6 miles from the city, on the Brook
      turnpike; consequently the march on the 10th was without much incident, and we quietly
      encamped on the south bank of the South Anna, where we procured all necessary forage, marching
      from 15 to 18 miles. On the night of the 10th and 11th of May Davies' brigade, of Gregg's
      division, was ordered to Ashland, and arriving before the head of the enemy's column, which
      had to make a wide detour to reach Yellow Tavern, drove out a force occupying the town; burnt
      a locomotive with train of cars attached; destroyed the railroad for some distance, and
      rejoined the main column at Allen's Station, on the Fredericksburg railroad. From Allen's the
      entire command moved on Yellow Tavern, Merritt in advance, Wilson next, and Gregg in rear. The
      enemy here again made an error in tactics by sending a large force to attack my rear, thus
      weakening his force in front, enabling me to throw all my strength on that which opposed my
      front, and fight this force with a small rear guard. </p>
    <p> Merritt gallantly attacked the enemy at Yellow Tavern, and got possession of the Brook
      turnpike. The enemy, still confident, formed his line a few hundred yards to the east of this
      pike, enfilading it with his artillery fire, and making Yellow Tavern a hot place; but Gibbs
      and Devin held fast with their brigades, supported by artillery, and Custer charged the
      enemy's battery and line, supported by Chapman's brigade, of Wilson's division-in fact, by the
      whole of Wilson's divisions, Gregg having one brigade available to support. Custer's charge,
      with Chapman on his flank, was brilliantly executed; first at a walk, then at a trot, then
      dashing at the enemy's line and battery, capturing the guns and gunners and breaking the line,
      which was simple enough to receive the charge in a stationary position. In this assault Gen.
      J. E. B. Stuart, commanding the enemy's cavalry, was mortally wounded. </p>
    <p> Gregg about the same time charged the force in rear with equal success, and ended the
      engagement. We captured a number of prisoners, and the casualties on both sides were quite
      severe. After Custer's charge and the enemy's line was broken-one portion of which was driven
      toward Ashland, the other toward Richmond-a reconnaissance was sent up the Brook turnpike,
      toward the city, dashed across the south fork of the Chickahominy, drove a small force from
      the exterior line of the works, and went inside of them. I followed up this party, and found
      between the two lines of works a road leading to that from Mechanicsville to Richmond. I
      thought we could go around on this across the Mechanicsville pike, south of the Chickahominy,
      and encamp next night (12th) at Fair Oaks, and determined to make the movement, being
      influenced to some extent in doing so by the reports from colored people, during the
      afternoon, that Gen. Butler's force had reached a small stream about 4 miles south of
      Richmond, on the south side, and that I possibly could help him by a demonstration. Therefore,
      after making the wounded as comfortable as possible, we commenced the march about 11 o'clock
      on the night of the 11th, and massed the command on the plateau south of Meadow Bridge at
      about daylight; torpedoes planted in the road-many of which exploded, killing several
      horses-being the only difficulty encountered. At daylight on the morning of the 12th Wilson
      encountered the enemy's batteries on, or near, the Mechanicsville pike, and could not pass
      them. As soon as I was notified of this condition, Custer's brigade was ordered to make the
      crossing to the north side of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge, but as the bridge was found
      to have been destroyed, and the enemy's cavalry posted on the north side, I ordered Merritt's
      entire division to repair it, and to make the crossing at all hazards. During the time thus
      occupied, the enemy gave the working party great annoyance by sweeping the bridge and the
      force supporting it, crossed a small force of tow or three regiments, attacked dismounted, and
      was repulsed; still the work on the bridge continued, and when it war finished, Merritt
      crossed nearly all his division, dismounted, and was repulsed; still the work on the bridge
      continued, and when it war finished, Merritt crossed nearly all his division, dismounted,
      attacked the enemy, carried his line of temporary breast-works, and continued the pursuit to
      Gaines' Mill. Mean time the enemy advanced from behind his works at Richmond, and attacked
      Wilson and Gregg. Wilson was driven back in some confusion, but Gregg was ready, having
      concealed a heavy line of skirmishers in a bushy ravine, in his front, and when the enemy
      marched to attack, with more display than grit, this unexpected and concealed line opened a
      destructive fire with repeating carbines, and some of Wilson's men at the same time turning in
      on their flank, the line broke in disorder, and went into security behind the breast-works
      defending the city. The six batteries of regular artillery were used by Capt. Robertson, chief
      of artillery, with great effect, and contributed much to our success. The enemy considered us
      completely cornered, but such was not the case, for while we were engaged, scouting parties
      were sent along the Chickahominy, and several fords found by them. This attack and repulse
      ended the battle; for the balance of the day we collected our wounded, buried our dead, grazed
      our horses, and read the Richmond papers, two small newsboys having, with commendable
      enterprise, entered our lines and sold to the officers and men. Between 3 and 4 o'clock in the
      afternoon the remaining portion of the command crossed the Chickahominy and encamped at and
      between Walnut Grove and Gaines' Mill. </p>
    <p> On the 13th the march was resumed, encamping at Bottom's Bridge. On the 14th we marched
      through White Oak Swamp, and went into camp between Haxall's Landing and Shirley, on the James
      River. Our casualties on the march were 425.* All transportable wounded and a large number of
      prisoners were brought along the this point, and the former, through the kindness of Gen.
      Butler's medical offices, quickly cared for on arrival. From the 14th until the 17th we rested
      in this camp, sending out scouting parties as far as New Market, in the direction of Richmond.
      On the night of the 17th we commenced the return march, crossing the Chickahominy at Jones'
      Bridge, and went into camp on the 18th at Baltimore Cross-Roads and vicinity. </p>
    <p> The uncertainty of what had happened to the Army of the Potomac during our absence made the
      problem of how to get back and where to find it somewhat difficult, particularly so as I knew
      that re-enforcements had come up from the south to Richmond; I therefore determined to cross
      the Pamunkey River at the White House, and sent to Fortress Monroe for a pontoon bridge to be
      used for that purpose. While waiting, I ordered Custer with his brigade to proceed to Hanover
      Court-House, and if possible, destroy the railroad bridges over the South Anna; Gregg and
      Wilson were sent at the same time to Cold Harbor, to demonstrate in the direction of Richmond
      as far as Mechanicsville, so as to cover Custer started it was found on examination that the
      railroad bridge at the White house had been but partially burned, and could be repaired, and
      Gen. Merritt was at once put on this duty. By sending mounted parties through the surrounding
      country, each man bringing back a board, it was made passable in one day, and on the 22d, when
      Custer and Gregg returned, we crossed, encamping that night at Aylett's, on the Mattapony
      River. Custer encountered a large force of the enemy apparently moving from the direction of
      Richmond to Lee's army, and was unable to accomplish his mission. Gregg occupied Cold Harbor
      and sent scouting parties, which encountered small squads of mounted men, to the vicinity of
      Mechanicsville, but nothing of great importance occurred. </p>
    <p> At Aylett's we learned from citizens, and captives belonging to Lee's army, that the Army of
      the Potomac was at North Anna River, in the vicinity of Chesterfield Station. </p>
    <p> On the 23d the march was resumed, encamping at Reedy Swamp. On the 24th we rejoined the Army
      of the Potomac in the vicinity of Chesterfield. This ended the first raid, which occupied
      sixteen days. We lost but few horses, considering their condition when we started. The average
      distance traveled per day did not exceed 18 miles; the longest march being 30 miles. The
      horses which failed were shot by the rear guard, as they could have been easily recuperated
      and made serviceable to the enemy. I think the actual number lost would not exceed 300,
      perhaps not more than 250. </p>
    <p> On the 25th Gen. Wilson, with his division, was transferred to the right of the army, and
      made a reconnaissance south of the North </p>
    <p> __________ <br/> * For revised return of casualties during Sheridan's first expedition, see
      p. 184. </p>
    <p> Anna as far as Little River; the other two divisions remained encamped from the 24th until
      the 26th, in the vicinity of Pole Cat Station. On the 26th a movement of the army commenced in
      order to make the crossing of the Pamunkey River at or near Hanovertown. Torbert's and Gregg's
      divisions, with Russell's divisions, of the Sixth Corps, took the advance to secure the
      crossings, with directions to demonstrate so as to deceive the enemy as much as possible in
      the movement. To accomplish this end, Torber was ordered to move to Taylor's Ford, on the
      Pamunkey, and demonstrate until after dark as if the crossing was to be made at that point,
      then to leave a small guard, quietly withdraw, and march to Hanovertown ford, where the real
      crossing was to be made. Gen. Gregg was ordered to Littlepage's crossing of the Pamunkey, to
      demonstrate in the same manner, to retire quietly after dark, leaving a guard to keep up the
      demonstration, and march quickly to Hanovertown crossing, taking with him the pontoon bridge.
      Russell took up the march and followed the cavalry. </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 27th Custer's brigade, of Torbert's division, made the crossing,
      driving from it about 100 of the enemy's cavalry and capturing 30 or 40; the balance of the
      division followed this brigade, and advanced to Hanovertown, where Gen. Gordon's brigade of
      rebel cavalry was encountered, routed, and driven in great confusion in the direction of
      Hanover Court-House, the pursuit being continued to a little stream called Crump's Creek.
      Gregg was moved up to this line, and Russell encamped near the crossing of the river. </p>
    <p> We had been successful in our mission, and, upon the arrival of the army, on the 28th, it
      crossed the Pamunkey behind our line, unimpeded. I was immediately after ordered to
      demonstrate in the direction of Mechanicsville, in order to find out the enemy's where-about,
      and therefore directed Gregg's division to move out, via Haw's Shop, on the Mechanicsville
      road, but when about three-fourth of a mile in advance of Haw's Shop it encountered the
      enemy's cavalry, which was dismounted and behind a temporary breast-work of rails, &amp;c.
      Gregg vigorously attacked this force, which appeared to be the rebel cavalry corps, and a
      brigade of South Carolina troops, reported 4,000 strong, armed with long-range rifles, and
      commanded by a Col. Butler; these Carolinians fought very gallantly in this their first fight,
      judging from the number of their dead and wounded, and prisoners captured. The most determined
      efforts were made on both sides in this unequal contest, and neither would give way until late
      in the evening, when Custer's (Michigan) brigade was dismounted, formed in close column of
      attack, and charged, with Gregg's division, when the enemy was driven back, leaving all his
      dead and his line of temporary works in our possession. This was a hard contested engagement,
      with heavy loss, for the number of troops engaged, to both sides, and was fought almost
      immediately in front of the infantry line of our army, which was busily occupied throwing up
      breast-works. After dark, our own and the enemy's dead being buried, we moved to the rear of
      the infantry, and went into camp on the morning of the next day (the 29th) in the vicinity of
      Old Church. </p>
    <p> In the battle at Haw's Shop but one brigade (Custer's) of Torbert's division was engaged;
      the other two, being posted on the Crump Creek line, could not be gotten up until relieved by
      the Sixth Corps. They arrived in the afternoon, however, but did not become seriously engaged,
      only demonstrating on the right of Gregg. After we had taken position at Old Church, Wilson's
      division was ordered to the right of the army, and Gregg's and Torbert's pickets pushed out in
      the direction of Cold Harbor, which was occupied by the enemy in some force. As our occupation
      of this point was essential to secure our lines to the White house, which was to be our base,
      its possession became a matter of deep interest. The enemy appeared to realized this also, for
      he, at a very early period took possession of it, and pushed a force up to Matadequin Creek on
      the Old Church road, putting his front parallel with the Pamunkey-which was then our line to
      the White House-in order to make it dangerous for our trains. This force encountered the
      pickets of the First Division at Matadequin Creek, but they held fast and fought gallantly
      until re-enforced by their division on the north side of the creek, which took up the contest.
      The fight then became general and was stubbornly contested, but the enemy finally gave way,
      and was pursued within 1 1/2 miles of Cold Harbor. In this fight Butler's South Carolinians
      were again put in to receive the brunt, and many of them were killed and captured. On the
      morning of the 31st I visited Torbert and Custer, at Custer's headquarters-Torbert's division
      having the advance-an found that they had already talked over a plan to attack and capture
      Cold Harbor, which I indorsed, and on the afternoon of the 31st the attack was made, and after
      a hard-fought battle, the town taken. Gregg was immediately moved to the support of Torbert,
      but the place was captured before any of his troops became engaged. </p>
    <p> Cold Harbor was defended by cavalry and infantry, and on the Old Church side the enemy had
      thrown up temporary breast-works of logs and rails. The fight on the part of our officers and
      men was very gallant; they were now beginning to accept nothing less than victory. After
      gaining the town, I notified army headquarters to that effect, but that the enemy in
      additional numbers were arriving there; that I could not hold it with safety to my command,
      and that I would move out, an did so; just after we had left, however, a dispatch was received
      directing that Cold Harbor be held at all hazards, and I therefore immediately ordered its
      reoccupation, changed the temporary breast-works thrown up by the enemy, so as too make them
      available for our troops, dismounted the cavalry, placing them behind these works, and
      distributing the ammunition in boxes along the line, determined to hold the place as directed.
      While this was being done the enemy could be heard giving commands and making preparations to
      attack in the morning. </p>
    <p> Just after daylight June 1 he marched to the attack, and was permitted to come close in to
      come close in to out little works, when he received the fire of our batteries and repeating
      carbines, which were used with terrible effect, and was driven back in confusion; still
      determined to get the place, after reorganizing, he attacked again, but with the same result.
      About 10 o'clock the Sixth Corps arrived and relieved the cavalry, which moved toward the
      Chickahominy, and covered the left of the line until relieved by Hancock's corps during the
      afternoon. While the balance of the cavalry were engaged at Cold Harbor, Wilsons' division was
      posted on the right of the army, near the head waters of the Totopotomoy Creek. On being
      relieved by the infantry from the Cold Harbor line the two divisions moved down the
      Chickahominy, encamping for the night of the 1st of June at Prospect Church and vicinity, and
      on the 2d we moved down the Chickahominy still farther, taking a position on the north side,
      at Bottom's Bridge; the enemy's cavalry occupying the south side, with artillery in position
      at the fords. No movements took place on the 3d; the enemy shelled our position at very long
      range but did not damage. </p>
    <p> On the 4th the First Division marched back to Old Church, and on the 6th the Second Division
      was relieved at Bottom's Bridge by one brigade of Wilson's division, and marched back to the
      same vicinity; thence both divisions moved to New Castle Ferry, where the trains, which had
      been sent to White House, reached us, with supplied for a march, since called the Trevilian
      raid. </p>
    <p> While Gregg's and Torbert's divisions were operating on the left of the army, Wilson, who
      was on the right, engaged the enemy at Mechump's Creek on the 31st of May; at Ashland on the
      1st of June, and on the 2d of June at Haw's Shop-the scene of the battle of May 28, and at
      Totopotomoy Creek. The battle at Ashland was brought about by McIntosh's brigade, which had
      been ordered to that vicinity for the purpose of covering a movement made to the South Anna to
      destroy the railroad bridges over that stream, and which was successful. </p>
    <p> On the 6th of June I received instructions from Gen. Meade and the lieutenant-general to
      proceed with two divisions of my corps to Charlottesville, for the purpose of cutting the
      Virginia Central Railroad, to unite, if possible, with Maj. Gen. D. Hunter, whom I expected to
      met at or near Charlottesville, and bring his command over to the Army of the Potomac. There
      also appeared to be another object, viz, to remove the enemy's cavalry from the south side of
      the Chickahominy, as, in case we attempted to cross to the James River, this large cavalry
      force could make such resistance at the difficult crossings as to give the enemy time to
      transfer his force to oppose the movement. Two divisions being ordered to proceed on this
      raid, Wilson was detached by the following order, and took the advance of the Army of the
      Potomac, on its march to the James River: </p>
    <p> HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, </p>
    <p> New Castle Ferry, June 6, 1864. </p>
    <p> Brig. Gen. J. H. WILSON, </p>
    <p> Cmdg. Third Cavalry Division: </p>
    <p> GEN.: I am directed by the major-general commanding to notify you that he will march from
      New Castle Ferry at 5 a. m. to-morrow, taking with him the First and Second Cavalry Divisions.
      During his absence you will report and receive your orders direct from the headquarters Army
      of the Potomac. </p>
    <p> Your division quartermaster and commissary will have to attend to the supplying of your
      command. </p>
    <p> Orders have been issued directing the officers in charge at the White House to send all
      detachments of cavalry (mounted) belonging to the different cavalry divisions to report
      temporarily for duty with your command. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> Very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> JAS. W. FORSYTH, </p>
    <p> Lieut.-Col. and Chief of Staff. </p>
    <p> On June 7, the command being prepared with three days' rations in haversacks, to last for
      five days, two days forage on the pommel of the saddles, 100 rounds of ammunition, 40 on the
      person and 60 in wagons, 1 medical wagon, 8 ambulances, and 1 wagon each for division and
      brigade headquarters, we crossed the Pamunkey at New Castle, and encamped that night between
      Aylett's and Dunkirk, on the Mattapony River. On the 8th we encamped 2 miles west of Pole Cat
      Station. It was my intention to march along the north bank of the North Anna, cross it at
      Carpenter's Ford, strike the railroad at Trevilian Station, and destroy it to Louisa
      Court-House, march past Gordonsville, strike the railroad again at Cobham Station, and destroy
      it thence to Charlottesville as we proceeded. We, therefore, on the 9th of June, resumed the
      march along the Anna-our advance guard skirmishing, as it almost always did, with mounted men
      of the enemy-and encamped on East Northeast Creek, near Young's Mill. During this day I
      learned that Breckinridge's division of infantry was passing slowly up the railroad to
      Gordonsville parallel to me, and that the enemy's cavalry had left their position on the south
      side of the Chickahominy, and were marching on the old Richmond and Gordonsville road on
      Gordonsville. This information was confirmed by a party sent to cut the telegraph wires along
      the railroad during the night. On the 10th the march was resumed; we passed through Twyman's
      Store, crossed the North Anna at Carpenter's Ford, and encamped on the road leading to
      Trevilian Station and along the banks of the North Anna. During the night of the 10th the
      boldness of the enemy's scouting parties, which we had encountered more or less every day,
      indicated the presence of a large force. </p>
    <p> On the morning of the 11th we resumed the march on Trevilian, meeting at once an driving the
      enemy's advance parties in our front. Torbert had the leading division, and, at a point about
      3 or 3 1/2 miles from Trevilian Station, encountered the enemy in full force behind a line of
      breast-works constructed in dense timber. Custer, with his brigade, was ordered to take a wood
      road found on our left and get to Trevilian Station, or at least in rear of the enemy, and
      attack his led horses. In following this road he passed between Fitz. Lee's and Hampton's
      divisions-the former being on the road leading from Louisa Court-House to where the battle
      commenced, the latter on the direct road from Trevilian to the same point-and on, without
      opposition, to Trevilian Station, which he took possession of. As soon as I found that Custer
      had gotten to the rear of the enemy, the remaining two brigades of Torbert's division were
      dismounted and formed line of battle, assailed the enemy's works, and carried them, driving
      Hampton's division pell-mell and at a run back on Custer, at Trevilian, who commenced fighting
      in all directions. So panic-stricken was this division (Hampton's) and so rapidly was it
      pushed that some of it was driven through Custer's lines, and many captured. While the First
      Division was thus engaged Gregg attacked Fitz. Lee on the Louisa Court-House road, and drove
      him in the direction of Louisa Court-House; the pursuit was continued until about dark.
      Hampton's division made its way in the direction of Gordonsville, and was joined during the
      night by Fitz. Lee, who made a detour westward for that purpose. </p>
    <p> At night my command encamped at Trevilian Station, and from prisoners, of which we had
      captured about 500, I learned that Hunter, instead of coming toward Charlottesville, as I had
      reason to suppose, was at or near Lexington, moving apparently on Lynchburg; that Ewell's
      corps was on its way to Lynchburg, on the south side of James River; and that Breckinridge was
      at Gordonsville or Charlottesville, having passed up the railroad, as heretofore alluded to.
      I, therefore, made up my mind that it was best to give up the attempt to join Hunter, as he
      was going from me instead of coming toward me, and concluded to return. Directions were at
      once given to collect our own wounded and those of the enemy in hospitals, and to make
      provision for their transportation back in ammunition wagons and in vehicles collected from
      the country. I was still further influenced in my decision to return by the burden which these
      wounded threw upon me, there being over 500 case of our own, and the additional burden of
      about 500 prisoners, all of whom must have been abandoned by me in case I proceeded farther;
      besides, one more engagement would have reduced the supply of ammunition to a very small
      compass. </p>
    <p> On the morning of June 12 we commenced destroying the railroad to Louisa Court-House, and in
      the afternoon I directed Torbert to make a reconnaissance up the Gordonsville road to secure a
      by-road leading over Mallory's Ford, on the North Anna, to the Catharpin road, as I proposed
      taking that route in returning, and proceeding to Spotsylvania Court-House, thence, via
      Bowling Green and Dunkirk, to the White House. In the reconnaissance Torbert became heavily
      engaged, first one brigade, then another, then the last, the battle continuing until after
      dark. Gregg during this time was breaking up the railroad to Louisa Court-House. </p>
    <p> The result of Torbert's fighting made it impossible to cross at Mallory's Ford without
      venturing a battle next day, in which case the remainder of our ammunition would have been
      consumed, leaving none to get back with; therefore, during the night of the 12th, we moved
      back on our track, recrossed the North Anna at Carpenter's Ford on the following morning,
      unsaddled our horses and turned them out to grazed, as they were nearly famished, having had
      no food for two days, and in the afternoon proceeded to the vicinity of Twyman's Store, where
      we encamped. The enemy, excepting a small party which Gen. Davies dispersed with one of his
      regiments, did not follow us. </p>
    <p> I left near Trevilian three hospitals containing many rebel wounded, and 90 of ours that
      were non-transportable with medicines, liqueurs, some hard bread, coffee, and sugar. I regret
      to say that the surgeons left in charge were not well treated by the enemy, and that the
      hospitals were robbed of liquors and stores. On the 14th the march was continued, and we
      reached the Catharpin road-upon which it was originally intended to move after crossing
      Mallory's Ford, and which would have saved much time and distance-and encamped at Shady Grove
      Church. On the 15th we camped at Edge Hill, on the Ta River, having passed over the
      battle-field of Spotsylvania, and on the 16th at Dr. Butler's farm, on the Mattapony, having
      marched through Bowling Green. Being as yet unable to ascertain the position of the Army of
      the Potomac, and uncertain whether or not the base at the White House had been discontinued, I
      did not like to venture between the Mattapony and Pamunkey Rivers, embarrassed as I was with
      wounded prisoners, and about 2,000 negroes that had joined us, and therefore determined to
      push down the south bank of the Mattapony far enough to enable me to send them with safety to
      West Point, where I expected to find gun-boats and transports. Following this plan, we
      proceeded on the 17th to Walkerton and encamped, and on the 18th resumed the march through
      King and Queen Court-House, encamping in its vicinity. I here learned that the base at the
      White House was not entirely broken up, and that supplies there awaited me; therefore, on the
      morning of the 19th I sent the wounded, prisoners, and negroes to West Point, escorted by two
      regiments of cavalry, and turning, marched to Dunkirk, on the Mattapony, a point at which the
      river was narrow enough for my pontoons to reach across. </p>
    <p> On my march from Trevilian to this point we halted at intervals during each day to dress to
      wounded and refresh them as much as possible. Nothing could exceed the cheerfulness exhibited
      by them; hauled as they were in old buggies, carts, ammunition wagons, &amp;c., no word of
      complaint was heard. I saw on the line of march men with wounded legs driving, while those
      with one disabled arm were using the other to whip up the animals. On the 20th we resumed the
      march at an early hour, to the sound of artillery, in the direction of the White House, and
      had proceeded but a short distance when dispatches from Gen. Abercrombie notified me that the
      place was attacked. I had previously sent an advance party with directions to move swiftly,
      and to report to me by counties the condition of affairs; from these I soon learned that there
      was no occasion to push our jaded animals, as the crisis, if there had been one, was over, and
      therefore moved leisurely to the banks of the Pamunkey opposite White House, and encamped, the
      enemy holding the bluffs surrounding the White House farm. On the morning of the 21st Gregg's
      division was crossed over dismounted, and Torbert's division mounted, and the enemy driven
      from the bluffs, and also from Tunstall's Station in the evening, after a sharp engagement. I
      found here orders to break up the White House depot, and to moved the trains over to
      Petersburg, via Jones' Bridge. I immediately commenced breaking up as directed and making my
      arrangements to carry over and protect a train of over 900 wagons, knowing full well that I
      would be attacked if the enemy had any spirit left in him. On the morning of the 22d I sent
      Torbert in advance to secure Jones' Bridge, over the Chickahominy, so that we could make the
      crossing at that point, and Gregg marched on a road parallel to the one on which the train was
      moving, and on its right flank, as it was the only flank requiring protection. The train was
      not attacked, but was safely parked on the south side of the Chickahominy for the night. On
      the morning after Torbert had secured the crossing, the 23d, the enemy attacked his picket
      post on the Long Bridge road, with Chambliss' bridge, and drove it in, but on its being
      re-enforced by six companies of colored troops belonging to Getty's command, the enemy was
      repulsed, and the picket post re-established. This brigade, I was told by the prisoners taken,
      was the advance of the rebel cavalry corps, and through it Hampton had been advised of our
      having already secured the crossing of the Chickahominy. Gen. Getty had relieved Gen.
      Abercrombie, and was in command of a small infantry force, composed mostly of the odds and
      ends of regiments and batteries. </p>
    <p> On the 24th the march was resumed, with directions to cross the trains at Bermuda Hundred,
      where there was a pontoon bridge. To reach this point I was obliged to march through Charles
      City Court-House, thence by Harrison's Landing and Malvern Hill, the latter of which was
      occupied by the enemy; in fact, he held everything north of the James except the tete-de-pont
      at the crossing. Torbert's division moved out on the Charles City Court-House road as an
      escort to the trains, and when in the vicinity of the Court-House the advance guard
      encountered the enemy and drove him across Herring Creek, on the road to Westover Church. As
      soon as this attack was reported to me, orders were immediately given to park the train-the
      head of which was far beyond Charles City Court-House-at convenient points on the road, and
      Torbert was directed to push his whole division to the front to meet the enemy, while Gregg,
      who had marched on the road leading to Saint Mary's Church for the purpose of protecting the
      right flank of the train, and who had also been attacked, was instructed to hold fast until
      all the transportation could pass Charles City Court-House. The train was immediately after
      put in motion, and safely parked in the vicinity of Wilcox's Landing. At Saint Mary's Church
      Gregg was attacked by the entire cavalry corps of the enemy, and after a stubborn fight, which
      last until after dark, was forced to retire in some confusion, but without any loss in
      material. This very creditable engagement saved the train, which should never have been left
      for the cavalry to escort. During the night and next morning the train was moved back through
      Charles City Court-House to Douthat's Landing, on the James River, where it was ferried over,
      after which the troops were transported in the same manner. </p>
    <p> Before the crossing was completed Gen. Meade notified me to move rapidly to the support of
      Gen. Wilson, who had been ordered on a raid to break the communication south of Petersburg by
      destroying the South Side and Danville railroads. Gen. Wilson's expedition had been successful
      until it reached the left of the army on its return, when it encountered, at Reams' Station, a
      large force of infantry sent down the Weldon railroad from Petersburg, and being at the same
      time attacked on the flank by cavalry, the command was routed and obliged to fall back across
      Nottoway River at Poplar Hill, whence a wide detour was necessary to reach the main army, in
      consequence of which, as the heat was intense, the loss in animals was great. As soon as the
      orders from Gen. Meade were received I hastened with Torbert and Gregg, via Prince George
      Court-House and Lee's Mills, to Reams' Station, where I found the Sixth Corps, but was too
      late to render material assistance. I immediately, however, sent out parties to procure
      information concerning the expedition, and learned from them that it had crossed the Nottoway
      and was safe. </p>
    <p> The results obtained in the destruction of the South Side and Danville railroads were
      considered equivalent to the losses sustained by Gen. Wilson's division. Had an infantry force
      been sent sooner to Reams' Station, raid would have been eminently successful. </p>
    <p> Gen. Wilson states in his report as follows: </p>
    <p> Foreseeing the probability of having to return northward, I wrote to Gen. Meade the evening
      before starting that I anticipated no serious difficulty in executing his orders; but unless
      Gen. Sheridan was required to keep Hampton's cavalry engaged, and our infantry to prevent Lee
      from making detachments, we should probably experience great difficulty in rejoining the army.
      In reply to this note, Gen. Humphreys, chief of staff, informed me it was intended the Army of
      the Potomac should cover the Welson road the next day, the South Side road the day after, and
      that Hampton having followed Sheridan toward Gordonsville, I need not fear any trouble from
      him. </p>
    <p> Still no timely relief was sent. As soon as Wilson was found to be safe, I was ordered back
      to Light-House Point and vicinity to rest my command, which had marched and fought for
      fifty-six consecutive days, and remained there from the 2d till the 26th of July, refitting
      and picketing the left of the army. White at this camp I received about 1,500 horses. These,
      together with about 400 obtained at Old Church by dismounting recruits, were all that were
      issued to me while personally in command of the Cavalry Corps, from April 6 to August 1, 1864. </p>
    <p> On the afternoon of July 26, I moved with the First and Second Divisions of
      cavalry-Torbert's and Gregg's-for the north side of the James River, in connection with the
      Second Corps, and was directed, if an opportunity offered, to make a raid on the Virginia
      Central Railroad and destroy the bridges over the North and South Anna Rivers, and those over
      Little River. We crossed the Appomattox at Broadway Landing, and on arriving at Deep Bottom,
      where we were joined by Gen. Kautz' small cavalry division of the Army of the James, the
      command was massed, to allow the Second Corps to pass an take the advance across the James.
      Soon after the Second Corps had crossed a small portion of it carried the enemy's works in
      front of the tete-de-pont, and captured four pieces of artillery. </p>
    <p> The cavalry moved to the right of the Second Corps, and found the enemy occupying a strong
      line of works, extending across the New Market and Central roads leading to Richmond, the
      right resting on Four-Mile Creek. His cavalry vedettes, posted in front of Ruffin's house on
      the New Market road, were discovered by the Second U. S. Cavalry, and driven back on their
      infantry line of battle composed of two divisions. The high ground in advance of Ruffin's
      house thus gained was immediately occupied by the First Division as a line of battle, and
      Second Division placed on its right, covering the road from Malvern Hill to Richmond.
      Immediately upon the formation of our line, the enemy advanced to the attack and drove the
      cavalry back over the ridge, on the face of which it quickly lay down in line of battle at a
      distance of about 15 yards from the crest. When the enemy's line reached this crest, a fire
      from our repeating carbines was opened upon it, whereupon it gave way in disorder, and was
      followed over the plain beyond by the cavalry, which captured about 250 prisoners, and 2
      battle-flags, besides killing and wounding very many. This counter attack against infantry was
      made by the First and Second Cavalry Divisions simultaneously, and our line re-established.
      During the engagement, which is called the battle of Darbytown, Gen. Kautz was in support of
      Gregg on the right of the line. </p>
    <p> The enemy, deceived by the long front presented by the Second Corps and cavalry, was
      undoubtedly impressed with the idea that nearly all of our forces had been moved to the north
      side of the James, and at once transferred a large body of his troops from the lines at
      Petersburg to our front at New Market; as I understood, this transfer by the enemy was the
      object which the lieutenant-general wished to attain, in order that the mine explosion of
      Petersburg might, to a greater certainty, result in the capture of the city. </p>
    <p> On the afternoon of the 28th the Second Corps withdrew to a line near the head of the
      bridge, and the cavalry was drawn back to a position on its right. In order to deceive the
      enemy still more, I sent during the night one of my divisions to the opposite side of the
      James, first covering the bridge with moss and grass to prevent the tramp of the horses being
      heard and at daylight marched it back again on foot in full view of the enemy, creating the
      impression that a large and continuous movement to the north side was still going on. On the
      29th nothing occurred during the day on either side, except a skirmish by some of Gen. Kautz's
      command, in the vicinity of Malvern Hill; but, after dark, the Second Corps was hastily and
      quietly withdrawn to the south side, to take part in the engagement which was expected to
      follow the mine explosion. I was directed to follow, and withdrew by brigades from my right,
      successively, passing them over the bridge. This movement was one involving great anxiety, as,
      when the Second Corps moved, the space at the mouth of the bridge, occupied by me was so
      circumscribed that an offensive movement in force by the enemy must have resulted in the
      annihilation of my whole command. Shortly after daylight on the 30th the recrossing had been
      effected, and by 10 o'clock my advance division was well over to the left of our army in front
      of Petersburg; but as the mine attack had failed it was not necessary to carry out the part
      assigned to the cavalry. The movement to the north side of the James for the accomplishment of
      our part of the plan connected with the mine explosion was well executed, and every point
      made; but it was attended with such anxiety and sleeplessness as to prostrate almost every
      officer and man in the command. </p>
    <p> On the 1st of August I was relieved from the personal command of the Cavalry Corps, and
      ordered to the valley of the Shenandoah. Torbet's and Wilson's divisions were directed to join
      me there. </p>
    <p> It will be seen by the foraging narrative that the idea advanced by me at the commencement
      of the campaign, viz, "that our cavalry ought to fight the enemy's cavalry, and our infantry
      the enemy's infantry," was carried into effect immediately after the battle of the Wilderness.
      The result was constant success and the almost total annihilation of the rebel cavalry. We
      marched when and where we pleased; were always the attacking party, and always successful. </p>
    <p> During the period herein embraced I am led to beleive, on information derived from the most
      reliable sources, that the enemy's cavalry was superior to ours in numbers; but the esprit of
      our men increased every day, while that of the enemy diminished. In these marches, and in
      others afterward performed in connection with the Valley and Appomattox campaigns, we were
      obliged to live to a great extent on the country. Forage had to be thus obtained for our
      horses and provisions for our men, consequently many hardships were necessarily brought on the
      people, but no outrages were tolerated. I do not believe war to be simply that lines should
      engage each other in battle, as that is but the duello part-a part which would be kept up so
      long as those who live at home in peace and plenty could find the best youth of the country to
      enlist in their cause (I say the best, for the bravest are always the best), and therefore do
      not regret the system of living on the enemy's country. These men and women did not care how
      many were killed or maimed, so long as war did not come to their doors, but as soon sa it did
      come in the shape of loss of property, they earnestly prayed for its termination. As war is a
      punishment, and death the maximum punishment, if we can, by reducing its advocates to poverty,
      end it quicker, we are on the side of humanity. </p>
    <p> In the foregoing brief sketch. I have been unable to give in detail the operations of the
      cavalry, and will have to trust to the subordinate reports to make up the deficiency. In
      consequence of our constant activity we were obliged to turn over our wounded and prisoners
      whenever and wherever opportunity offered, and often times without receipts. I am also,
      therefore, unable to furnish an accurate list of either my casualties or prisoners captured
      from the enemy. I think my casualties from May 5 to August 1 will number between 5,000 and
      6,000 men, and that the captures in prisoners will exceed 2,000. We sent to the War Department
      from the 5th of May, 1864, to the 9th of April, 1865, the day on which the Army of Northern
      Virginia surrendered, 205 battle-flags, captured in open field fighting; it is nearly as many
      as all the armies of the United States combined sent there during the rebellion. The number of
      field pieces captured in the same period was between 160 and 170; all in open field fighting.
      These captures of flags, colors, and artillery were made during the campaign the operations of
      which I have just related, the Shenandoah campaign, the march from Winchester to Petersburg,
      and the Appomattox campaign. To the Sixth and Nine- teenth Corps, Gen. Crook's command, which,
      with Merritt's and Custer's divisions of cavalry, composed the Army of the Shenandoah, and to
      the Fifth and Sixth Corps, which operated with me on the Appomattox campaign, a proportionate
      share of these captures belong. </p>
    <p> It will be seen by this report that we led the advance of the army to the Wilderness; that
      on the Richmond raid we marked out its line of march to the North Anna, where we found it on
      our return; that we again led its advance to Hanovertown, and thence to Cold Harbor; that we
      removed the enemy s cavalry from the south side of the Chickahominy by the Treyvilian raid,
      and thereby materially assisted the army in its successful march to the James River and
      Petersburg, where it remained until we made the campaign in the valley; marched back to
      Petersburg, and again took its advance and led it to victory. In all the operations the
      percentage of cavalry casualties was as great as that of the infantry, and the question which
      had existed "'Who ever saw a dead cavalryman?" was set at rest. </p>
    <p> To Gen.'s D. McM. Gregg, Torbert, Wilson, Merritt, Custer, Devin, J. Irvin Gregg, McIntosh,
      Chapman, Davies, and Gibbs, to the gallant officers and men of their commands, and to the
      officers of my staff, I return my sincere thanks. </p>
    <p> I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> P. H. SHERIDAN, </p>
    <p> Maj.-Gen., U.S. Army. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Bvt. Maj. Gen. JOHN A. RAWLINS, </p>
    <p>Chief of Staff, Headquarters Armies of the United States, Washington, D.C. </p>
