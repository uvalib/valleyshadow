    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, U.S. Army, commanding Second Division, of operations
      August 17-September 4, including engagement at Thoroughfare Gap and battle of Bull Run. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, THIRD ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> Hall's Hill, September 4, 1862. </p>
    <p> COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the report of operations of my division from the 17th of
      August, when directed by you to retire to the east side of Cedar Mountain, to this date: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> At sunrise on the 30th, I was ordered by you to send two brigades to report to Gen. Kearny,
      and conducted the First Brigade, Gen. Duryea; Fourth Brigade, Col. Thoburn, which relieved a
      portion of Gen. Kearny's division. Gen. Duryea's brigade advanced in the woods, driving the
      enemy along the line of the old railroad excavation until directly under their guns, the
      Fourth Brigade a little retired on his right. While occupying this ground Gen. Duryea was
      subjected to a heavy fire of artillery and infantry, in which he received a slight wound and
      severe contusion from a shell, but remained at his post animating his men, who behaved
      admirably. It was in this heavy fire that my aide, Capt. Fisher, while with his usual zeal,
      acting under orders, had his horse shot under him, and was taken prisoner. The Second and
      Third Brigades, under Gen. Tower, with the four batteries, occupied our left. </p>
    <p> While thus disposed I received the order to "Forward my division" from the right on the road
      leading from Sudley Springs to New Market and follow along that road "in pursuit of the
      enemy." I gave this order, and reported to Gen. Heintzelman as directed, when informed that
      the enemy following up the already advanced brigade, and confident that they had no intention
      of retiring, so reported personally to you, and was then directed to abandon pursuit and
      resume my first position, where the brigades were soon exposed to a galling cross-fire. </p>
    <p> Gen. Tower commanding Second and Third Brigades, was detached to the extreme left with
      Hall's and Leppien's Maine batteries. This portion of the division most gallantly endeavored
      to maintain their position, suffering severely, until Gen. Tower fell seriously wounded, and
      the loss of officers and men was very great. </p>
    <p> The engagement now became general from right to left. I moved Thompson's battery to the
      extreme right of the line to dislodge the enemy, but was outnumbered in guns, and withdrew it
      to unite with Matthews' battery on the right of Stevens' division, to aid in checking the
      enemy's advance, which was now pushed along the front. Their loss in men and horses entirely
      disabled these batteries, and in connection with the casualties among the commanding officers,
      compelled the division to retire toward night, making a desperate stand at Mrs. Carter's
      house, used for a hospital, which proved unavailing against the superior force. </p>
    <p> On the 31st we remained at Centreville, supplying the exhausted division. The Fourth Brigade
      was here detached, and the commanding officer, Col. Thoburn, being wounded, I have been unable
      to obtain his report, but respectfully submit the casualties in the First Second, and Third
      Brigades. </p>
    <p> On the 1st of September we took up position on the Aldie road, acting in conjunction with
      Gen. Reno's division, and held this point until the 2nd September, when, in compliance with
      orders, we fell back to Hall's Hill, near Washington. </p>
    <p> In recapitulating the services of the brigade commanders I would make particular mention of
      Brig.-Gen. Duryea, commanding First Brigade, for his noble conduct at Thoroughfare Gap and his
      indomitable courage displayed at Bull Run while holding a trying position. </p>
    <p> I desire to express my especial obligations to Brig.-Gen. Tower, commanding Second Brigade,
      for his indefatigable zeal and valuable services on all occasions, particularly at
      Thoroughfare Gap and at Bull Run, where he was detached with two brigades and their batteries,
      and highly distinguished himself. I commend the conduct of Col. Root, Ninety-fourth Regiment
      New York Volunteers, who, although painfully wounded at Bull Run, continued on duty. </p>
    <p> The Third Brigade, although early deprived of their efficient commander, Brig.-Gen.
      Hartsuff, behaved admirably. I particularly noticed Col. Coulter, Eleventh Pennsylvania
      Volunteers, whose regiment bore the brunt of the engagement at Thoroughfare Gap. </p>
    <p> Col. Thoburn, First Virginia, commanding Fourth Brigade, deserves high commendation for his
      valuable services. Capts. Matthews' and Thompson's Pennsylvania batteries and Capts. Leppien's
      and Hall's Maine batteries deserve to be mentioned not only for their uniform attention to
      their duties, but for their efficiency throughout the 30th August. My thanks are due to the
      officers of my staff, Capt. John W. Williams, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. W. Fisher,
      aide-de-camp, and Capt. B.W. Richards, aide-de-camp, who severally exhibited a high degree of
      efficiency and personal bravery. </p>
    <p> Surg. N.R. Moseley, medical director, was untiring in his exertions and care of the wounded. </p>
    <p> Maj. William Painter showed remarkable zeal and energy; also Acting Ordnance Officer Lieut.
      M.S. Smith, Thirteenth Massachusetts Volunteers. </p>
    <p> Very respectfully, </p>
    <p> JAMES B. RICKETTS, </p>
    <p> Brig.-Gen. Volunteers, Commanding Division. </p>
    <p> Col. E. SCHRIVER, </p>
    <p> Chief of Staff. </p>
