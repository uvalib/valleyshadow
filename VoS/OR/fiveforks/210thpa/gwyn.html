  <p>Reports of Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, U. S. Army, commanding Cavalry.</p>

  <p>HDQR. THIRD Brig., SECOND DIV., FIFTH ARMY CORPS,</p>

  <p>April 10, 1865.</p>

  <p>MAJ.: I have the honor to submit the following report in reference to the engagement of the 1st instant:</p>

  <p>After bivouacking until 1 p.m. this command moved up the Boydton plank road, in obedience to orders from headquarters Second Division, Fifth Corps, from a point about twelve miles from Dinwiddie Court-House, in the following order: Company A, Third Delaware Volunteers, under command of Capt. D. D. Joseph, was ordered to the front as an advance guard, the Delaware battalion, under command of Capt. Richards, acting as support; the head of the main column, composed of the One hundred and ninetieth, One hundred and ninety-first, and One hundred and fifty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanded by Bvt. Col. Joseph B. Pattee, and Two hundred and tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, under Lieut. Col. E. L. Witman, following at distance of 100 yards in rear of the Delaware battalion. When arriving near the Court-House we diverged to the right, following a road leading to the White Oak road. At about 8 a.m. a halt was ordered and the men allowed to rest until about 2 p.m., when the command again moved forward until reaching a point near the left of the enemy's entrenched line on the White Oak road, when it was formed in two lines of battle--the front line composed of the Fourth Delaware Volunteers, under Capt. W. H. Maclary, Third Delaware Volunteers, under Capt. J. H. Cade, One hundred and ninety-first Pennsylvania Volunteers, under Capt. Perez L. Norton, and the One hundred and fifty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, under Maj. E. T. Tiers, all under command of Bvt. Col. Joseph B. Pattee, of the One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers; the Two hundred and tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers forming the second line, under command of Lieut. Col. E. L. Witman, the right resting on a road leading at right angles with the White Oak road. The One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, under command of Capt. R. M. Birkman, was deployed as skirmishers, covering the brigade front. The Second Brigade, Second Division, Fifth Corps,</p>

  <p>CHAP. LVIII.] THE APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN. PAGE 877-95 [Series I. Vol. 46. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 95.]</p>

  <p>was on the left in echelon; the Third Division, Fifth Corps, on the right. At about 3 o'clock the line advanced against the enemy, forcing their skirmish line back to their main line, which was also driven back in confusion. After following them up for some distance I halted, reformed the line, and changed direction to the left, so as to be able to attack their works on the flank and rear. We again charged their line, driving it in great confusion, capturing two battle-flags and many prisoners; the color-sergeant of the One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers planting the first stand of colors on the captured works.</p>

  <p>I am unable to state the number of prisoners captured, on account of the command having pressed forward so rapidly, sending them to the rear as we advanced; I, however, sent back one squad of 300 men, under charge of Capt. J. W. Scott, One hundred and fifty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers. At this point the skirmish line of the One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers extended intervals to the right, in order to keep up the connection, on account of the Third Division line having fallen back some distance. The pursuit was continued until darkness put an end to further operations.</p>

  <p>Subjoined is a list of casualties in the command during the engagement.</p>

  <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>JAMES GWYN,<br />
  Brevet Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Brigade.</p>
