    <p> Report of Lieut. Col. Edward L. Witman, Two hundred and tenth Pennsylvania Infantry. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. 210TH PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS, </p>
    <p> April 12, 1865. </p>
    <p> MAJ.: In obedience to circular from brigade headquarters of this date, I have the honor to
      forward a statement of operations in which this regiment was engaged on the 1st of April,
      1865. </p>
    <p> About 1.30 a.m. we broke camp and marched about eight miles in the direction of Dinwiddie
      Court-House and halted about two hours, when we proceeded about two miles toward the enemy's
      works and formed in line of battle. By order of Gen. Gwyn the One hundred and fifty-seventh
      Pennsylvania Volunteers was attached to this command and posted on our left. We then marched
      in line of battle about one-quarter of a mile before opening fire, which brought us to the
      edge of the woods in which the enemy was posted, when sharp musketry firing commenced. We were
      ordered forward, and drove the enemy from his works, whom we followed for about two miles,
      until the regiment became scattered. About 5 o'clock the Fifth Corps assembled in a field near
      the works captured from the enemy, marched to the rear, near where the battle commenced, and
      went into camp for the night. </p>
    <p> On making out our field return we discovered that we had sustained a loss of 1 enlisted man
      killed, 28 wounded, and 8 missing. </p>
    <p> Very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> E. L. WITMAN, <br/>Lieut. Col., Cmdg. 210th Pennsylvania Volunteers. </p>
