  <p>HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,</p>

  <p>April 12, 1865.</p>

  <p>COL.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this division on April 1, 1865:</p>

  <p>The division was ordered to move down the Boydton pike during the night of March 31, and report to Gen. Sheridan at Dinwiddie Court-House. Before arriving there it was met by a staff officer of Gen. Sheridan with instructions to turn off on a road leading west into a road leading from Dinwiddie Court-House to the White Oak road, and thus come upon the left and rear of the enemy, who was facing Gen. Sheridan's command, near Dinwiddie. As we approached, just after daylight, the enemy hastily decamped. The cavalry pursued, and this corps, having united, followed northward about 2 p.m. Arriving near the White Oak road the enemy were found in line of battle, with breast-works along that road facing south. Our troops were formed in line of battle for the attack--two cavalry divisions on the left, my division on the left of the corps line, the Second and Third Brigades in two lines (the Second on the left), the First Brigade in support. Advancing through the woods into an open the skirmishers engaged those of the enemy, pushing them back. Soon after crossing the White Oak road, finding the enemy's fire to come from the left, I changed front to the left by facing the Second Brigade to the left and filing it to the left. Not to lose time, I also threw the First Brigade into the front line, on the left of the Second. The Third Brigade, soon after engaging the enemy, finding its right flank in the air (I must confess that I experienced anxiety also on this account), portions of it were very unsteady, but subsequently moved up and bore their part in the action in a handsome manner. After this change of front the troops were pushed forward, and soon came upon the left flank of the enemy, which was thrown back at right angles with his main line and covered by a</p>

  <p>strong breast-work, screened behind a dense undergrowth of pines and about 100 yards in length. This breast-works my troops charged and carried at the bayonet's point, capturing in carrying it over 1,000 prisoners and several battle-flags. Halting there a short time by Gen. Sheridan's order, till it was apparent the enemy were giving way generally, I pushed forward rapidly, holding my men in hand and marching steadily in line of battle, the First Brigade leading. The pursuit was continued till dark, over some three miles, and till orders were received to halt. The division was then retired to camp near the Five Forks. It took in this battle some 2,000 prisoners and 8 battle-flags.</p>

  <p>That distinguished soldier, Bvt. Brig. Gen. Fred. Winthrop, U. S. Volunteers, fell mortally wounded just as his brigade was gallantly charging the enemy's breast-works, and in the moment of triumph freely laid down his life for his country. His dying thoughts were for his comrades, and his last anxious inquiries were concerning the fate of the day. Col. R. N. Bowerman, Fourth Maryland Volunteers, was wounded while gallantly commanding the Second Brigade.</p>

  <p>For further details, flags and prisoners captured, &amp; C., I respectfully refer to the accompanying reports of brigade commanders.</p>

  <p>At some opportune moment I will take pleasure in forwarding the names of those officers who, by their gallantry and soldierly conduct, have merited reward. I must again express my thanks to my staff for their gallantry and zeal on this as on all other occasions. Those with me were: Bvt. Col. C. E. La Motte, Fourth Delaware Volunteers, division inspector; Bvt. Maj. W. W. Swan, U. S. Army, acting assistant adjutant-general; Capt. W. I. Purnell, Eighth Maryland Volunteers, assistant commissary of musters; Capt. Jesse D. Childs, First Maryland Volunteers, assistant provost-marshal; Bvt. Capt. Robert P. Warren, One hundred and forty-sixth New York Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Bvt. Capt. John J. Diehl, Fifteenth New York Heavy Volunteers, aide-de-camp.</p>

  <p>I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>R. B. AYRES,<br />
  Brevet Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Division.</p>
