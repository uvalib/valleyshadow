    <p> Appomattox Court-House, Va., April 14, 1865. </p>
    <p> CAPT.: In obedience to your order of to-day, I have the honor to make the following report
      of the operations of my regiment in the late </p>
    <p> PAGE 892-95 N. AND SE. VA., N. C., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LVIII. [Series I. Vol. 46.

    <p> great movements, resulting in the surrender of Gen. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia,
      under his command: </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> Early in the morning of April 1 the whole corps withdrew from this part of the line. The
      movement was covered by our brigade, </p>
    <p> CHAP. LVIII.] THE APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN. PAGE 893-95 [Series I. Vol. 46. Part I, Reports.
      Serial No. 95.] </p>
    <p> under the personal direction of Maj.-Gen. Warren and Brig.-Gen. Baxter, commanding the
      brigade. It was understood that the corps was to march about four miles in the direction of
      the South Side Railroad, where our cavalry, under Sheridan, were confronted by a large rebel
      force, and to report to him with a view of co-operating with him in his contemplated movement
      against the enemy. It was about 2 p.m. when we reached him, in front of the enemy's
      entrenchments at the Five Forks. Immediate preparations were made for the attack. The cavalry
      were on the left, and the infantry (being the Fifth Corps) on the right; our brigade (Second,
      under Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter) on the right, my regiment being on the right of the brigade. At
      about 3 p.m. the line was in readiness to advance, and very soon thereafter the grand movement
      commenced. The ground over which we were to pass was composed of woods, fields, thickets of
      underbrush, swamps, ditches, streams, &amp; C. After arriving at a certain road running
      parallel with the line of battle, a half-wheel was to be made to the left, intending by this,
      in which we succeeded, to swing around into the enemy's rear. The enemy was soon met along the
      whole line. We moved in this battle over a distance of three miles. The movement and the
      fighting continued, we driving the enemy all the time, until dark ended the battle, being one
      of the most grand, complete, and important victories of the war. Indeed, it seems to have been
      the turning point in the great movements against Petersburg and Richmond and the destruction
      of Lee's army, as all of these important places and that great army that has confronted us for
      nearly four long, wearisome, bloody years soon after fell into our possession. </p>
    <p> I am happy in being able to say that my regiment conducted itself in this long trying
      engagement in the most gallant manner; and in this I am glad to say it only vied with the
      other gallant regiments composing the brigade. The thanks of the general commanding the
      brigade immediately at the close of the engagement, for the good conduct of my regiment, was
      most gratifying. </p>
    <p> In this great work of to-day I must acknowledge, in addition to the personal aid extended by
      Brig.-Gen. Baxter, commanding brigade, the important aid given in the various movements by
      Capt. W. G. Sheen, acting assistant adjutant-general, Capt. B. F. Bucklin, commissary of
      subsistence, Lieut. R. C. Knaggs, aide-de-camp, and Lieut. A. Leavitt, of his staff. Laboring
      under special difficulties in consequence of the very few officers in my regiment, the aid
      extended by these officers is the more appreciated. The difficulties to be overcome in
      advancing in line of battle over such ground were great. </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> T. F. MCCOY, <br/>Col., Cmdg. Regt. </p>
    <p> Capt. W. G. SHEEN, <br/>Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
