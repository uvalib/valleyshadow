  <p>Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas C. Devin, U. S. Army, commanding First Division.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,</p>

  <p>April --, 1865.</p>

  <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this division from March 29 to April 9, 1865, inclusive:</p>

  <p>The division--consisting of First Brigade, Col. Peter Stagg, First Michigan Cavalry, commanding; Second Brigade, Col. Charles L. Fitzhugh, Sixth New York Cavalry, commanding, and Reserve Brigade, Brig. Gen. Alfred Gibbs, commanding--marched from camp in front of Petersburg on the morning of March 29, encamping the same night near Dinwiddie Court-House.</p>

  <p>On the morning of March 30 the division advanced to feel the enemy's position, and was disposed as follows: The Second Brigade was massed two miles in front of the Court-House, at the intersection of the Brooks road with that to Five Forks, one regiment of this brigade in advance to the Boydton plank road; the First Brigade massed at Boisseau's house, with a regiment advanced across Gravelly Run toward the White Oak road; two regiments of the Reserve Brigade were advanced upon the direct road to the Five Forks, while the two remaining regiments were thrown out upon the right flank to communicate with the advance of the First Brigade. The whole line formed nearly a semicircle, radiating from the position occupied by Second Brigade. During the day demonstrations were made upon different points of the front, and it was ascertained that the enemy in force occupied the White Oak road and the Five Forks. About 3 p.m. Maj. Morris, with 150 men of Fifth and Sixth U. S. Cavalry, had pushed the enemy to within three-fourths of a mile of the Five Forks, when he was suddenly surrounded by overwhelming numbers and was forced to cut his way out, losing three officers and a number of men. The First U. S. Cavalry and two regiments of the Second Brigade were at once ordered to his support, and another attempt made to carry the position; but the enemy advancing a strong line of infantry, the command was ordered to retire and encamp a short distance in rear. The position at Five Forks was difficult of approach for cavalry, the front being covered by a swamp and heavy woods.</p>

  <p>On the morning of March 31 the First Brigade was advanced, as on the previous day, and the enemy in force were found occupying the White Oak road. The Reserve Brigade was massed at the intersection of the Brooks road, and the Second Brigade was dismounted and advanced toward the Five Forks. It was now ascertained from prisoners captured that the Forks were occupied by Pickett's division of infantry and at least a division of cavalry, and Col. Fitzhugh was ordered to hold his position and communicate on his left with Dadvies' brigade, of Second Division. At this time the Second Brigade occupied the apex of a triangle, the left of which was held by Davies' brigade and the right by Stagg's brigade, of First Division. One mile in front of the Second Brigade and across Chamberlain's Swamp were the Five Forks, the direct road to which was held by the Second Brigade. It will thus be seen that Col. Fitzhugh's position was far in advance of the other lines, necessarily retired by the conformation of the ground. About 2 p.m. heavy firing was heard upon the left of Second Brigade, and immediately after I received a pressing request for support from Col. Janeway, of Davies' brigade. I at once ordered a regiment of First</p>

  <p>Brigade to his relief, and on proceeding to that part of the line found the troops retiring precipitately. Finding it impossible to rally them, Maj. Dana, of the division staff, was sent to order Col. Fitzhugh to move his brigade by the left flank and take up Gen. Davies' position, leaving a regiment to hold the Five Forks road. This disposition was promptly effected and the enemy's advance checked. At this time a heavy line of infantry moved down the direct road from Five Forks and drove in the Sixth New York, which had been left to hold that front; part of a regiment of First Brigade was pushed in support of the Sixth, and the enemy was checked, but only for a moment. At the same time the left of the Second Brigade was outflanked, and a heavy line emerged from the woods on its front. In a few minutes the brigade would have been surrounded. I ordered Col. Fitzhugh to retire and connect with First Brigade. While this was being effected the rebel cavalry charged down the road through their infantry line, but the stubborn valor and well-directed fire of our men repulsed them on each occasion. Twice the brigade was obliged to halt and charge the enemy while retiring. On reaching the point where I had left the First Brigade I found it had been forced back by the rapid advance of the enemy on our left, who then occupied its position and had cut us off from the cross roads. Col.'s Fitzhugh and Stagg were at once ordered to fall back across the country in the direction of the Brooks road, in accordance with orders from Gen. Merritt, should we be unable to connect with the left. The men retired in order, showing such a front as prevented the rebel cavalry (which now hovered in force upon their right flank) from charging them. A line was now formed in front of the plank road and the led horses (which had been sent toward the left of our infantry) were brought up. I was about to push down the Brooks road and endeavor to connect with the Reserve Brigade, when Gen. Davies (who had joined the division with a portion of his brigade) assumed command and directed me to march to Dinwiddie Court-House by the plank road. On reporting at Dinwiddie Court-House I was ordered to march to Crump's farm, where the division encamped.</p>

  <p>At the time that the First and Second Brigades were forced to retire on the right, the Reserve Brigade (which was massed at the intersection of the Brooks road), with Miller's section of battery, became hotly engaged with the advancing enemy. The brigade was dismounted, and in a brilliant charge drove the exulting foe for nearly half a mile; but, as on the right, the heavy masses of the enemy soon pressed back the gallant handful of men. At dark the brigade was relieved by the Third Division. While engaged the section of battery rendered most valuable service in checking the enemy's advance.</p>

  <p>On the morning of April 1 the division, nothing daunted by the repulse of the two previous days, again moved toward the stubbornly contested battle-ground of the Five Forks. Col. Stagg, with the First Brigade, met the enemy as usual at Chamberlain's Swamp, and an infantry line was immediately developed, showing that the position was not to be taken without a hard fight. The whole of the Second Brigade was now dismounted, and Col. Fitzhugh was ordered to cross the swamp, gain a position on the opposite side, and cover the crossing of the First Brigade mounted. The movement was gallantly effected under a heavy fire, and the First U. S. Cavalry and First, and Sixth Michigan Cavalry were crossed on the left of the brigade, while the Fifth Michigan was crossed upon the right to cover that flank. The Reserve Brigade was thrown out upon the right and rear in the direction of the White Oak road. A charge was now ordered to gain the wood in</p>

  <p>PAGE 1124-95 N. AND SE. VA., N. C., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. XVIII. [Series I. Vol. 46. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 95.]</p>

  <p>front of the Forks. The Second Brigade, flanked by the cavalry, gallantly advanced at the charging step, and, driving the enemy clear through the woods, developed a strong line of breast-works, covering the Forks and filled with masses of infantry. In this advance the cavalry charged up to within twenty yards of the works, and the dismounted men of the Second Brigade captured and dragged off prisoners from the breast-works. Capt. Ham, of Seventeenth Pennsylvania, was mortally wounded at this point. But the work was too strongly held for our line to carry, and the brigade was forced to retire to the wood. The line was thus held until 4.30 p.m., when a brigade of Third Cavalry Division having connected upon our left, and the Fifth Corps advancing to attack the enemy's right flank, the whole division was dismounted and ordered to advance and again charge the enemy's works. Capt. Lord, First U. S. Cavalry, was ordered to keep his regiment mounted and in readiness to charge should the enemy's line be broken. The whole line advanced under a terrible fire from the enemy's works; but the regiment on the right of Third Division giving way, the Third Division was halted and reformed. On the second charge the troops on our left again fell back; but notwithstanding this defection, the division pressed forward the enemy's works were carried after an obstinate struggle, the right was connected with the left of Fifth Corps, the front of the division changed to the left, and the enemy pursued for two miles. As the works were carried Capt. Lord was ordered to charge with his regiment, and gallantly responded, clearing the breast-works at a bound, and charging far in advance of the division. In carrying the position we captured on our own front 1,000 prisoners, 2 battle-flags, and 2 guns. Thanks to the friendly cover of the woods, which extended to within less than forty yards of the enemy's works, our loss was comparatively light, except in officers. In some regiments every squadron commander was killed or wounded.</p>

  <p>With regard to the conduct of officers and men it is sufficient to state that under the hottest fire not a straggler could be seen along the whole line--every man was in his place and at his work. The division encamped upon the battle-field.</p>

  <p>On the morning of April 2 the division marched on the White Oak road, and turning to the right struck the South Side Railroad midway between Ford's and Sutherland's Stations. Gen. W. H. F. Lee's division of rebel cavalry was found in position at this point. Skirmishers were advanced and the division placed in readiness for a fight, but a few rounds from Miller's section of battery were sufficient to induce the enemy to retire with precipitation. The railroad was then torn up, ties burnt, and rails heated and bent. The division then advanced, and turning to the left at Cox's road again came up with Lee's cavalry. Fitzhugh's (Second) brigade, in advance, dismounted and rapidly drove the enemy from one position to another, until, at 5 p.m., we met the rebel infantry in heavy force at Scott's Cross-Roads. A heavy fire of musketry and artillery was at once opened upon the Second Brigade. The First Brigade was dismounted and deployed in support of the Second. Miller's section was placed in position on the road, and by its rapid and effective fire materially assisted in repulsing several attempted charged of the enemy's infantry line on our position. The Reserve Brigade was disposed (mounted) on the flank and in support of the battery. The enemy was finally driven to the shelter of the barricades he had erected covering the cross-roads, from which it was impossible to dislodge him with our limited force. The force opposed to us consisted</p>

  <p>CHAP. LVIII.] THE APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN. PAGE 1125-95 [Series I. Vol. 46. Part I, Reports. Serial No. 95.]</p>

  <p>of Pickett's and Johnson's divisions of infantry and Lee's division of cavalry. At night-fall the command was retired half a mile and encamped, the front being held by the Reserve Brigade and one regiment of First Brigade. During the night the enemy made several attempts to feel our line. Capt. J. H. Bell, of the Second Brigade staff, rendered meritorious service at this point by opening communication with Gen. Sheridan, at Sutherland's Station. Communication was also opened with Crawford's division, of Fifth Corps, which had advanced upon the Namozine road within a mile of our position. At daybreak the lines were advanced, but the enemy had retired.</p>
