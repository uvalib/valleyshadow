    <p> HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., THIRD DIV., SIXTH ARMY CORPS, <br/> September 27, 1864. </p>
    <p>CAPT.: I have the honor to forward a report of the operations of this command during the
      recent engagements from September 19 to date, inclusive: </p>
    <p> On the 19th instant, at 2.30 a.m., this command broke camp near Clifton, Va., with orders to
      proceed across the country in the direction of the Opequon River. The river was crossed at
      about 8.30 a.m., and after marching a mile and a half the enemy's skirmishers were met, when a
      line of battle was immediately formed. This brigade was formed on the right of the Second
      Division, and on the left of this division in two lines--the Fourteenth New Jersey Volunteers
      and One hundred and sixth New York Volunteers in first line, the Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania
      Volunteers and Tenth Vermont Volunteers second line. The One hundred and fifty-first New York
      Volunteers were thrown forward immediately as skirmishers for the purpose of driving the
      enemy's skirmishers back that a battery might be placed in our immediate front. This being
      accomplished, the fighting was confined to the skirmish line and the artillery until 11.40
      a.m. with inconsiderable loss on our side. At this hour we were ordered by Capt. Smith, acting
      assistant adjutant-general, to make an assault upon the enemy's position in our front, this
      brigade being the directing brigade, with orders not to halt until we received orders.
      Precisely at the appointed moment our column gallantly advanced, and was immediately exposed
      to a terrific fire from the enemy's guns. Maj. Vredenburgh, commanding Fourteenth New Jersey
      Volunteers, who was charged with the direction of the line, and while bravely urging his
      troops forward, was struck by a shell and instantly killed, his last words being, "Guide on
      me, boys; I will do the best I can." The brigade moved quickly forward for about a mile,
      passing a house on the right of the pike and capturing almost all the enemy in our immediate
      front. Two pieces of artillery, which had worked considerable damage to our troops, were then
      discovered and a charge was made to secure possession of them. At this moment it was
      discovered that our right flank was not protected by the Nineteenth Corps, and that a heavy
      force of the enemy had been placed in position for the purpose of cutting us off. These guns
      would have been taken by our troops had our flanks been properly protected. The order was
      given for our men to fall back on the second line, but the enemy advancing at the same time in
      force, threw us temporarily into confusion. The line was soon reformed, and the enemy again
      driven from the house above mentioned, and our line formed </p>
    <p> PAGE 232-90 OPERATIONS IN N. V. A, W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LV. [Series I. Vol. 43. Part
      I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] </p>
    <p> about 100 yards in advance, the men protecting themselves with rails, &amp;c. Heavy
      firing on both sides was kept up until about 4 p.m. Whilst holding this line the enemy charged
      twice, but was repulsed, with heavy loss, both times. The brigade was again moved forward, in
      conjunction with the whole line, driving the enemy before them in the greatest confusion.
      Without any further check we passed through Winchester and had the honor of placing our flags
      first on the heights beyond Winchester. The brigade captured many prisoners, who were sent
      under guard to the rear. </p>
    <p> In this connection I cannot bestow too much praise upon all the members of my staff, they
      being untiring in their efforts to rally the men under heavy fire, and by their actions
      inspiring the men with courage. I mention with pleasure the following-named officers, all of
      whom distinguished themselves by their gallantry: Capt. Charles H. Leonard, assistant
      adjutant-general; Capt. Hiram W. Day, acting assistant inspector-general; Capt. Charles M.
      Bartruff, acting aide-de-camp; Lieut. John A. Hicks, acting aide-de-camp; Lieut. Benjamin F.
      Miller, acting aide-de-camp. I would also mention Sergt. Maj. Nathan F. Peck, One hundred and
      fifty-first New York Volunteers, who came under my immediate observation and was conspicuous
      in reforming the men. Among others, the brigade mourns the loss of the gallant Maj.
      Dillingham, of the Tenth Vermont Volunteers. The loss in both officers and men was severe. A
      list of casualties has been forwarded.* </p>
    <p> About dark we were ordered to fall back to Winchester and camp for the night on the right of
      Gen. Getty's division. </p>
    <p> September 20 received orders to move forward at 5 a.m. in the direction of Strasburg. When
      within a mile of Strasburg went into camp and remained all night, the enemy occupying Fisher's
      Hill. On Wednesday, September 21, at 12.30 p.m., moved by the right flank around Strasburg
      about two miles; threw up earth-works and remained all night. Thursday, September 22, in the
      morning about 11 o'clock, received orders to move out with the Second Brigade and take a
      certain hill in our front. This was successfully done, this brigade forming the second line.
      About 4 p.m., Gen. Crook having turned the enemy's left, we were ordered by Capt. Smith,
      acting assistant adjutant-general, to move forward, connecting with Gen. Crook's left. The
      command moved steadily forward under a heavy artillery fire, obliquing to the right until we
      passed a piece of woods in our front, when the command made a rush into the works on the right
      of the Second Brigade and captured three brass pieces and one steel piece. The credit of
      capturing these pieces belongs to the Tenth Vermont Volunteers and One hundred and fifty-first
      New York Volunteers. The One hundred and sixth New York Volunteers claims to have captured one
      Parrott gun. The enemy fell back in great confusion and many prisoners were captured, who were
      sent to the rear. </p>
    <p> All officers and men did their duty. I take pleasure in mentioning two instances of personal
      bravery brought to my notice, viz: First Lieut. E. E. Russell, of the One hundred and
      fifty-first New York Volunteers, who drove a rebel lieutenant from a gun with his saber as he
      was putting in a fuse to fire it. Private David Robinson, Company B, One hundred and
      fifty-first New York Volunteers, fought desperately hand to hand with the enemy over a gun,
      being knocked down with the butt of a musket. He, however, succeeded in killing his opponent.
      First Sergt. Julius Ambruster, Company E, One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, is
      also very highly spoken of by the commandant </p>

    <p> of his regiment as having handled his company (of which he was in command) splendidly on the
      skirmish line on the 19th instant, I presume there were numerous other instances of personal
      valor, but commandants of regiments have neglected to report them. </p>

    <p> ----- </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., THIRD DIV., SIXTH ARMY CORPS, <br/>Near Middletown, Va., November 3,
      1864. </p>
    <p>CAPT.: In compliance with orders from headquarters Third Division, I have the honor to submit
      the following report of the operations of this brigade on the 19th ultimo: </p>
    <p> Before daylight I was awakened by firing on the right of our picket-line, which, being quite
      sharp, I turned out and was about ordering the brigade under arms, when it ceased entirely,
      and I again turned in. In about an hour firing again commenced to our extreme left, and
      apparently in our rear, which, increasing, I ordered the brigade under arms. A few minutes
      later Lieut. Tracy, from division staff, came with orders to get under arms and pack up, which
      was accordingly done. The brigade was then ordered to move to the pike, and started by the
      right flank; had proceeded about half way when Lieut. Tracy brought orders to move back to the
      old position, facing west. I soon received an order, through Lieut. Tracy, to form line on the
      crest of a hill facing south. The brigade moved to the position by the left flank, filing to
      the left in two lines, and I found McKnight's battery on our left with nothing connecting on
      our right. The men were ordered to lie down, and troops, artillery, and wagons went pouring
      through our lines. It being quite foggy, it was difficult to tell when our troops were through
      and the enemy commencing to come. As soon as satisfied on that point the brigade commenced
      firing, and the crest in front was soon cleared and kept clear. Just at this time I found the
      right was giving way under a heavy enfilading fire from the crest where the Second Brigade had
      been camped. I ordered up support from the second line, but the fire was so heavy that the men
      could not be held there. Finding the men giving way, the fire having increased in our front, I
      held them as long as possible to give Capt. McKnight time to get away his battery. Seeing
      Capt. McKnight commencing to limber up, and not able to hold the men any longer, I gave the
      order to fall back to the next crest, which was done in good order, the men lying down until
      the enemy appeared on the crest we had just left, when the brigade commenced firing and soon
      drove the enemy off, when the brigade was again moved forward and brought off three guns that
      had been abandoned. Sergt. William Mahoney, color bearer of the Tenth Vermont Volunteers, was
      the first man to reach the guns, and mounted one of them, waving his colors for his comrades
      to join-him. I regret to announce that this brave soldier was afterward killed. The brigade
      again fell back, and, the enemy appearing on our left flank, continued to retreat until
      reaching a piece of woods, when the brigade was again formed on a crest under an order from
      Gen. Wright, the general complimenting Sergt. Edward </p>
    <p> PAGE 234-90 OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LV. [Series I. Vol. 43. Part
      I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] </p>
    <p> Heller, color bearer of the One hundred and fifty-first, for his bravery, which compliment
      was most richly deserved. The brigade remained in this position until ordered to move back
      slowlyk, which was done, to a road, when, according to order, through Capt. Wood, it was
      formed in second line, together with number of scattered troops. This position was held some
      time, when I again had orders to fall back, which I did, until arriving on a hill between two
      pieces of woods, when an order came to halt and form. After being here a short time an order
      came by Capt. Wood, of division staff, to move to the rear by right of regiments and to
      incline to the right toward the pike. We proceeded in this manner until ordered to halt and
      form in line, faced to the front, after which Lieut. Tracy brought orders to move forward and
      form on the right of the Second Brigade. I found the Second Brigade formed in a piece of
      woods, and formed in one line on their right, the men throwing rails and logs up in front for
      protection. The brigade lay here under a fire of shell until about 4 p.m., when Capt. Smith
      came with an order to move forward, connecting on the left with the Second Brigade. The
      brigade moved through the woods, when it received a very heavy fire on the right flank, under
      which it was broken, but soon reformed in its old position, and again moved forward to a stone
      fence, the enemy being behind another stone wall in front with a clear field intervening.
      There was a stone wall running from the right flank of the brigade to the wall behind which
      the enemy lay. Some of my men lay scattered along this last-named wall. The First Division lay
      to the right and in advance, nearly parallel with the enemy. Everything appeared to be at a
      dead lock, with heavy firing of artillery and musketry. At this stage Col. Keifer, commanding
      division, came to me an inquired what men those were lying along the wall running from our
      line to the enemy's, and ordered me to send them forward to flank the enemy and drive them
      from their position. The execution of the order was entrusted to Capt. H. W. Day, inspector of
      the brigade, who proceeded along the wall, and getting on the enemy's flank dislodged them,
      when the brigade was moved rapidly forward, in connection with Second Brigade, and did not
      stop until we arrived in the works of the Nineteenth Corps, when, in accordance with orders
      from Col. Keifer, the brigade went to its position of the morning, got its breakfast, and
      encamped, satisfied that it had done a good day's work before breakfast. </p>
    <p> I take great pleasure in stating that in the last charge, Corpl. Daniel P. Reigle captured a
      battle-flag from a color bearer of the enemy. </p>
    <p> Among our casualties I have to regret the loss of the brave and gallant Augustus Phillips,
      adjutant of the One hundred and eighty-fourth New York Volunteers, who, though he had been in
      the brigade but a short time, had proved himself to be a gallant soldier and a gentleman, and
      died as a soldier should die, bravely doing his whole duty. </p>
    <p> The loss of the brigade was: Officers--killed, 4; wounded, 15. Enlisted men--killed, 34;
      wounded, 190. Total, 243.* </p>
