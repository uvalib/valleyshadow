    <p> and Ohio road. If he moves across Ridge I will move directly across from this place to meet
      him, and I think I can defeat his infantry and thwart his movements on the east of the
      mountains. But what shall I do if he sends re-enforcements to Grant or remains in the lower
      Valley? He has laid waste nearly all of Rockingham and Shenandoah, and I will have to rely on
      August for my supplies, and they are not abundant there. Sheridan's purpose, under Grant's
      orders, has been to render the Valley untenable by our troops by destroying the supplies. </p>
    <p> My infantry is now in good heart and condition, and I have sent a special messenger to you
      to get your views. Without Kershaw I would have about 6,000 muskets. </p>

    <p> NEW MARKET, October 20, 1864. <br/>(Via Richmond.) <br/>The Sixth and Nineteenth Corps have
      not left the Valley. I fought them both yesterday. I attacked Sheridan's camp on Cedar Creek
      before day yesterday morning, and surprised and routed the Eighth and Nineteenth Corps, and
      then drove the Sixth Corps beyond Middletown, capturing 18 pieces of artillery and 1,300
      prisoners; but the enemy subsequently made a stand on the pike, and, in turn, attacked my
      line, and my left gave way, and the rest of the troops took a panic and could not be rallied,
      retreating in confusion. But for their bad conduct I should have defeated Sheridan's whole
      force. On the retreat back to Fisher's Hill the enemy captured about thirty pieces of
      artillery and some wagons and ambulances. The prisoners were brought off. My loss in men was
      not heavy. Gen. Ramseur was seriously wounded while acting with gallantry, and was captured by
      the enemy. </p>

    <p> NEW MARKET, October 21, 1864. <br/>My net loss in artillery on the 19th was twenty-three
      pieces. My loss in killed and wounded in less [than] 1,000. In the early part of the day it
      was not more than 100. I cannot say how many were captured, but I think very few. Many of the
      men scattered, and are still coming in. The enemy's infantry is very badly demoralized. My men
      ran without sufficient cause, and the capture of artillery, &amp;c., was made by the
      enemy's cavalry. The enemy is not pursuing; his loss was very severe. I have sent off over
      1,300 prisoners. </p>

    <p> NEW MARKET, October 21.1864. <br/>GEN.: The telegraph has already informed you of the
      disaster of the 19th; I now write to give you a fuller account of the matter. </p>
    <p> Having received information that the enemy was continuing to repair the Manassas road, and
      that he had moved back from Fisher's Hill, I moved on the 12th toward Strasburg for the
      purpose of endeavoring to thwart his purposes if he should contemplated moving across the
      Ridge or sending troops to Grant. </p>
    <p> On the 13th I made a reconnaissance in force beyond Strasburg, and found the enemy on the
      north bank of Cedar Creek and on both sides of the pike. This was too strong a position to
      attack in front. I therefore encamped my force at Fisher's Hill and waited to see whether the
      enemy would move, but he commenced fortifying. </p>
    <p> On the night of the 16th Rosser, with two brigades of cavalry and a brigade of infantry
      mounted behind his men, was sent around the left to surprise what was reported by his scouts
      to be the camp of a division of cavalry. He found, however, that the camp had been moved, and
      he only found a picket, which he captured. As I could not remain at Fisher's Hill, for want of
      forage, I then determined to try and get around one of the enemy's flanks and surprise him in
      camp. After ascertaining the location of the enemy's camps from observation from a signal
      station on Massanutten Mountain, I determined to move around the left flank of the enemy. I
      selected this flank from information furnished by Gen. Gordon and Capt. Hotchkiss, who had
      gone to the signal station, and because the greater part of the enemy's cavalry was on
      picketed. To get around the enemy's left was a very difficult undertaking, however, as the
      river had to be crossed twice, and between the mountain and river, where the troops had to
      pass, to the lower ford there was only a rugged pathway. I thought, however, the chances of
      success would be greater from the fact the fact that the enemy would not expect a move in that
      direction on account of the difficulties attending it and the great strength of their position
      on that flank. The movement was accordingly begun on the night of the 18th just after dark,
      Gordon's, Ramseur's, and Pegram's divisions being sent across the river and around the foot at
      night I moved with Kershaw's division through Strasburg toward a ford on Cedar Creek just
      above its mouth, and Wharton was moved on the pike toward the enemy's front, in which road the
      artillery in the rear, for Kershaw to attack the left flank, and for Gordon [Wharton?] to
      advance in front, supporting the artillery, which was to open on the enemy when he should turn
      on Gordon or Kershaw, and the attack was to begin at 5 a.m. on the 19th. Rosser was sent to
      the left to occupy the enemy's cavalry, and Lomax, who had been sent down the Luray Valley,
      was ordered to pass Front Royal, cross the river, and move across toward the Valley pike.
      Punctually at 5 Kershaw reached the enemy's left work and attacked and carried it without the
      least difficulty, and very shortly afterward Gordon attacked in the rear, and they swept
      everything before them, routing the Eighth and Nineteenth Corps completely, getting possession
      of their camp and capturing 18 pieces of artillery and about 1,300 prisoners. They moved
      across the pike toward the camp of the Sixth Corps, and Wharton was crossed over, the
      artillery following him, but the Sixth Corps, which was on the enemy' extreme right of his
      infantry, </p>

    <p> PAGE 562-90 OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LV. [Series I. Vol. 43. Part
      I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] </p>
    <p> was not surprised in camp, because Rosser had commenced the attack on that flank about the
      same time as the attack on the other, and the firing on the left gave that corps sufficient
      time to form and move out of camp, and it was found posted on a ridge on the west of the pike
      and parallel to it, and this corps offered considerable resistance. The artillery was brought
      up and opened on it, when it fell back to the north of Middletown and made a stand on a
      commanding ridge running across the pike. In the meantime the enemy's cavalry was threatening
      our right flank only Lomax's old brigade, numbering about 300 men, it became necessary to make
      dispositions to prevent a cavalry charge, and a portion of the troops were moved to the right
      for that purpose, and word was sent to Gordon, who had got on the left with his division, and
      Kershaw, who was there also, to swing round the advance with their divisions, but they stated
      in reply that a heavy force of cavalry had got in their front, and that their ranks were so
      depleted by the number of men who had stopped in the camps to plunder that they could not
      advance them. Rosser also sent word that when he attacked the cavalry he encountered a part of
      the Sixth Corps supporting it; that a very heavy force of cavalry had massed in his front, and
      that it was too strong for him, and that he would have to fall back. I sent word to him to get
      some position that he could hold, and the cavalry in front of Kershaw and Gordon having moved
      toward Rosser, they were moved forward and a line was formed north of Middletown facing the
      enemy. The cavalry on the right made several efforts to charge that flank, but was driven
      back. So many of our men had stopped in the camp to plunder (in which I am sorry to say that
      officers participated), the country was so open, and the enemy's cavalry so strong, that I did
      not deem it prudent to press farther, especially as Lomax had not come up. I determined,
      therefore, to content myself with train to hold the advantages I had gained until all my
      troops had come up and the captured property was secured. If I had but one division of fresh
      troops I could have made the victory complete and beyond all danger of a reserve. We continued
      to hold our position until late in the afternoon, when the enemy commenced advancing, and was
      driven back on the right center by Ramseur, but Gordon's division, on the left, subsequently
      gave way, and Kershaw's and Ramseur's did so also, when they found Gordon's giving way, not
      because there was any pressure on them, but from an insane idea of being flanked. Some of
      them, however, were rallied, and with the help of the artillery the army was checked for some
      time, but a great number of the men could not be stopped, but continued to go the rear. The
      enemy again made a demonstration, and Gen. Ramseur, who was acting with great gallantry, was
      wounded, and the left again gave way, and then the whole command, falling back in such panic
      that I had to order Pegram's and Wharton's commands, which were very small and on the right,
      to fall back, and most of them took the panic also. I found it impossible to rally the troops.
      They would not listen to entreaties, threats, or appeals of any kind. A terror of the enemy's
      cavalry had seized them, the there was no holding them. They left the filed in the greatest
      confusion. All the captured artillery had been carried across Cedar Creek, and a large number
      of captured wagons and ambulances, and we succeeded in crossing our own artillery over, and
      everything would have been saved if we could have rallied 500 men, but the panic was so great
      that nothing could be done. A small body of the enemy's cavalry dashed across Cedar Creek
      above the bridge, and got into the train and artillery </p>
    <p> CHAP. LV.] THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY CAMPAIGN. PAGE 563-90 [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports,
      Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] </p>
    <p> running back on the pike, and passed through our men to this side of Strasburg, tore up a
      bridge, and thus succeeded in capturing the greater part of the artillery and a number of
      ordnance and medical wagons and ambulances. The men scattered on the sides, and the rout was
      as thorough and disgraceful as ever happened to our army. </p>
    <p> After the utter failure of all my attempts to rally the men I went to Fisher's Hill with the
      hope of rallying the troops there and forming them in the trenches, but when they reached that
      position the only organized body of men left was the prisoners, 1,300 in number, and the
      provost-guard in charge of them, and I believe that the appearance of these prisoners moving
      back in a body alone arrested the progress of the enemy's cavalry, as it was too dark for them
      to discover what they were. Many of the men stopped at Fisher's Hill and went to their old
      camps, but no organization of them could be effected, and nothing saved us but the inability
      of the enemy to follow with his infantry and his expectation that we would make a stand there.
      The state of things was distressing and mortifying beyond measure. We had within our grasp a
      glorious victory, and lost it by the uncontrollable propensity of our men for plunder, in the
      first place, and the subsequent panic among those who had kept their place, which was without
      sufficient cause, for I believe that the enemy had only made the movement against us as a
      demonstration, hoping to protect his stores, &amp;c., at Winchester, and that the rout of
      our troops was a surprise to him. I had endeavored to guard against the dangers of stopping to
      plunder in the camps by cautioning the division commanders and ordering them to caution their
      subordinates and take the most rigid measures to prevent it, and I endeavored to arrest the
      evil while in progress without avail. The truth is, we have very few field or company officers
      worth anything, almost all our good officers of that kind having been killed, wounded, or
      captured, and it is impossible to preserve discipline without good field an company officers. </p>
    <p> I send you a map* of the battle-field with the surrounding country. You will see marked out
      on it the different routes of the several columns. The plan was a bold one and was vigorously
      pursued by the division commanders, and it was successful, but the victory already gained was
      lost by the subsequent bad conduct of the troops. The artillery throughout, from first to
      last, in this as well as in all the actions I have had, behaved nobly, both officers and men,
      and not a piece of artillery has been lost by any fault of theirs. I attribute this good
      conduct on their part to the vast superiority of the officers. Col. Carter and all his
      battalion commanders richly deserve promotion. They not fought their guns gallantly and
      efficiently, but they made the most strenuous efforts to rally the infantry. </p>
    <p> It is mortifying to me, general, to have to make these explanations of my reserves. They are
      due to no want of effort on my part, though it may be that I have not the capacity or judgment
      to prevent them. I have labored faithfully to gain success, and I have not failed to expose my
      person and to set an example to my men. I know that I shall have to endure censure from those
      who do not understand my position and difficulties, but I am still willing to make renewed
      efforts. If you think, however, that the interests of the service would be promoted by a
      change of commanders, I beg you will have no hesitation in making the change. The interests of
      the service are far beyond any mere personal considerations, and if they require it I am
      willing to surrender </p>

    <p> my command into other hands. Though this affair has resulted so disastrously to my command,
      yet I think it is not entirely without compensating benefits. The Sixth Corps had already
      begun to move off to Grant and my movement brought it back, and Sheridan's forces are now so
      shattered that he will not be able to send Grant any efficient aid for some time. I think he
      will be afraid to trust the Eight and Nineteenth Corps. </p>
    <p> The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was very heavy, and we took 1,300 prisoners, making,
      with some taken by Rosser, and others taken on the day of reconnaissance, over 1,500. My loss
      in killed and wounded was not more than 700 or 800, and I think very few prisoners were lost.
      A number of my men are still out, but they are coming in. Except for the loss of my artillery
      the enemy has far the worst of it. We secured some of the captured artillery, and our net loss
      is twenty-three pieces. I still have twenty pieces besides the horse artillery. The enemy is
      not pursuing, and I will remain here and organize my troops. </p>
