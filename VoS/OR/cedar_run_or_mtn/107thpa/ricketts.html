    <p> Report of Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, U.S. Army, commanding Second Division, Third Corps. </p>
    <p>HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, THIRD CORPS, ARMY OF VA., </p>
    <p> August 14, 1862. </p>
    <p> COLONEL: Agreeably to orders I have the honor to submit the following report of the part
      taken by my division in the late engagement near Cedar Mountain: </p>
    <p> On Friday, the 8th instant, the division was ordered from camp north of Culpeper, and took
      position on the Orange road, near its junction with the road leading to Stevensburg, and
      remained there until ordered forward about 5 p.m. on the 9th, reaching the field about 7
      o'clock. The division was immediately directed to relieve the right of Gen. Banks' corps,
      which was done by forming line of battle--Tower's brigade on the right, Carroll's on the left,
      Hartsuff's brigade in close column of division in rear of Tower's, and Durea's in rear of
      Carroll's; two batteries of artillery--Leppien's and Matthews'--on the right, and two
      batteries--Thompson's and Hall's--toward the left and center. </p>
    <p> This arrangement was being rapidly completed when the enemy advanced a battery near a point
      of woods to our left in close range and opened a brisk fire, followed by discharges of
      infantry. Hall's battery had formed, Thompson's camp into action while receiving the enemy's
      fire, and both replied with such good effect as to cause the withdrawal of the enemy, leaving
      us in undisturbed possession of the field for the night. The excellent practice of the
      artillery and the general good conduct of the division are deserving of praise. </p>

      No. 16.] </p>
    <p> I herewith submit the reports of brigade commanders, chief of artillery, and the colonel
      commanding Firs Maine Cavalry, who was temporarily allotted to Gen. Bayard's brigade, the
      casualties amounting to 103 killed, wounded, and missing, according to the accompanying list.*
      In this connection I must knowledge the attention and zeal of my staff, Surg. N.R. Moseley,
      medical director; Maj. D. Tillson, chief of artillery; Maj. William Painter, division
      quartermaster; Capt. J.W. Williams, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. William Fisher,
      aide-de-camp; Capt. B.W. Richards, aide-de-cam, who each rendered important services in his
      appropriate duties. </p>
    <p> I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> JAMES B. RICKETTS, </p>
    <p> Brig.-Gen. Volunteers, Commanding Division. </p>
    <p> Col. E. SCHRIVER, </p>
    <p> Chief of Staff. </p>
