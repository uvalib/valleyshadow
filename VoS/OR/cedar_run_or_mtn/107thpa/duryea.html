  <p>Report of Brig. Gen. Abram Duryea, U.S. Army, commanding First Brigade, Second Division.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. 1ST BRIG., 2nd DIV., 3rd ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF VA.,</p>

  <p>August 14, 1862.</p>

  <p>SIR: I have the honor to report that this brigade took up the line of march for the scene of action at Slaughter Mountain on the evening of the 9th instant at 4 o'clock p.m., arriving on the field about 7 o'clock. When within about 1,000 yards of the enemy he opened upon the column from a battery within a wood with solid shot and shell, causing a panic among the wagon and ambulance drivers, who turned their horses and fled toward the rear. The troops, however, remained firm, conducting themselves admirably.</p>

  <p>The shot at this point passed over us, doing little damage. We continued our march along the road until we arrived within 500 yards of the enemy, filing to the right into a corn field. The enemy then poured in a volley, which killed a captain of the Twelfth Massachusetts, who was in close proximity, and wounded 8 or 10 of my command.</p>

  <p>We progressed in our march under fire until we obtained a supporting position to Thompson's and Hall's batteries. These batteries soon</p>

  <p>CHAP. XXIV.] CEDAR MOUNTAIN, VA. PAGE 173-16 [Series I. Vol. 12. Part II, Reports. Serial No. 16.]</p>

  <p>after opened a terrific and deadly fire, which closed the conflict for the day. The enemy then took up his line of retreat.</p>

  <p>The list of casualties in this command has already been reported.*</p>

  <p>I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>A. DURYEA,</p>

  <p>Brig.-Gen.</p>

  <p>Gen. RICKETTS,</p>

  <p>Commanding Second Division.</p>
