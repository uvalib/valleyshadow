  <p>Report of Capt. Thornton J. Elliott, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry.</p>

  <p>NEAR LYNCHBURG, VA., April 15, 1865.</p>

  <p>SIR: In obedience to orders received I reported with my squadron, consisting of Companies F and B, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, to Maj. Abell, chief of artillery, Twenty-fourth Army Corps, at Appomattox Court-House, April 9, 1865. On the following day (10th) I proceeded to Red Oak Church, capturing in that vicinity as follows: 60 rebels, who surrendered under a flag of truce; 54 pieces of artillery, brass and iron field pieces; 1 battle-flag; 36 gun carriages and caissons. The cannon were mostly buried or secreted. In addition to the above there was a large amount of ammunition, many wagons, caissons, forges, and sets of harness which had been destroyed by the enemy.</p>

  <p>From April 10 to 12 engaged in extracting and removing cannon. Received orders the 13th to report to my command at Lynchburg, Va., at which place I arrived on the morning of the 14th instant.</p>

  <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>THORNTON J. ELLIOTT,<br />
  Capt., Cmdg. Squadron, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry.</p>
