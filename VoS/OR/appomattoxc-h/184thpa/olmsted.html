    <p> Reports of Col. William A. Olmsted, Fifty-ninth New York Infantry, commanding First Brigade. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, </p>
    <p> April 10, 1865.</p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> April 4 and 5, we marched to Amelia Station, on Danville road. April 6, Gen. Hays ordered
      the Seventh Michigan to advance as skirmishers; the brigade followed the division column. Gen.
      Hays was relieved from command and Gen. Smyth assumed command. Shortly afterward Maj.-Gen.
      Barlow, having been assigned to the command, ordered the brigade to move; marched in column by
      ranks of fours in support of Third Brigade, advancing in battalion columns of fours. At Amelia
      Springs, by order of Gen. Barlow, detailed the One hundred and eighty-fourth Pennsylvania
      Volunteers to relieve a brigade of First Division, and remain until further orders. The
      Fifty-ninth New York Veteran Volunteers, commanded by Capt. Ludgate, was thrown out as
      skirmishers to Third Brigade, at Perkinson's Saw mill, and captured a rebel wagon train. </p>
    <p> April 7, advanced with the brigade, my brigade marching in column on the right flank of the
      road; arrived near High Bridge, all on Danville road; deployed the Nineteenth Maine; they
      advanced, and afterward moved to the right and saved the High Bridge, also a smaller bridge
      for crossing below the bridge; formed line of battle on left of railroad and advanced the
      Seventh Michigan and Fifty-ninth New York Veteran Volunteers as skirmishers and flankers. Just
      as the brigade moved I was ordered to move by the right flank, cross the railroad, and march
      in column in rear of Second Brigade to support Smyth. Advanced about two miles when we met the
      enemy's the skirmish line moved promptly in advance to within rifle range of Farmville, when
      part of the skirmish line was captured. After the position was carried was ordered to advance
      down the railroad to Farmville; after the men had mealed for dinner took the advance and moved
      to the right, and </p>

    <p> formed line of battle on the right of First Division; at sundown changed front and formed
      line facing the enemy. April 8, moved in column by fours, marching them through heavy woods on
      right of road. April 9, marched in column of fours down Lynchburg road, and participated in
      the grand and glorious surrender of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia to the Army of the
      Potomac; went into camp, where we now remain. </p>
    <p> The following is a correct list of casualties, on the days they occurred.* </p>
    <p> April 9, all the prisoners captured on the 7th were recaptured and reported to their
      regiments, and are now doing duty. </p>
    <p> The brigade captured 3 guns (12-pounders, light) at Crow's house, and 18 of all calibers at
      High Bridge, and about 1,000 prisoners in all. </p>
    <p> Respectfully submitted. </p>
    <p> WILLIAM A. OLMSTED, <br/>Col. Fifty-ninth New York Veteran Vols., Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
