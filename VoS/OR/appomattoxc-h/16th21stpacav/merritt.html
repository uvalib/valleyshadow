    <p> Report of Bvt. Maj. Gen. Wesley Merritt, U. S. Army, commanding Cavalry, Army of the
      Shenandoah. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. CAVALRY OF THE ARMY OF THE SHENANDOAH, </p>
    <p> April 20, 1865. </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> April 8, marched at 6 a.m. through Prospect Station toward Appomattox Court-House. The Third
      Division, in advance, met with no opposition until it arrived near Appomattox Station. Here
      the enemy's advance column was struck, moving on the Lynchburg road toward Danville. The
      enemy's army was in force at Appomattox Court-House. Artillery, prisoners, and wagons were
      here captured by the Third Division, which rushed into the enemy's lines, carrying all before
      them. Three trains of cars were also taken by this division, loaded with subsistence stores
      for Lee's army. The First Division was brought up rapidly, and, deploying dismounted on the
      right of the Third Division, assisted materially in the captures. This division was advanced
      within a short distance of Appomattox Court-house, being posted across the road on which the
      enemy was attempting to move, and effectually destroying his chance of making a night's march
      in retreat, as he intended to do as on former occasions. </p>
    <p> CHAP. LVIII.] THE APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN. PAGE 1121-95 [Series I. Vol. 46. Part I, Reports.
      Serial No. 95.] </p>
    <p> It is impossible to overestimate the value of this day's work. The enemy's supplies were
      taken, as it were, out of their mouths. A strong force, they knew not how strong, was posted
      along their line of retreat at a point where they did not expect opposition. Night was upon
      them; tired, dispirited, and starving they lay at our feet. Their bravest soldiers, their
      hardiest men, gave way when they heard the noise of battle far in the rear, and the night of
      despair fell with the night of the 8th of April darkly and terribly on the Army of Northern
      Virginia. </p>
    <p> April 9, at daylight the command was in readiness to move. Gen. Crook relieved the First
      Division in the position which it had occupied during the night. This division was ordered to
      move to the right. The enemy advanced against Gen. Crook's front in heavy force. The cavalry
      was forced back by overwhelming numbers. Gen. Custer was immediately ordered to move up with
      his division. The cavalry retired slowly, but of necessity. Soon the Twenty-fourth corps took
      up Crook's line on the left of the First Division, and the Fifth Corps deployed in rear of
      Gen. Devin. So soon as the heavy columns of the enemy discovered we had infantry in position
      he abandoned his evidently formed idea of forcing the road of his retreat, and retired
      precipitately toward the valley, where his wagon train was parked. The cavalry, now
      disengaged, was thrown rapidly to the right, taking possession of the high ground on the
      enemy's left within a short half mile of his camp. There every disposition was made for an
      attack. The rebel army was at our mercy. The artillery played rapidly for a few moments, when
      a flag of truce sent from the enemy's line silenced forever the noise of battle between the
      Union and rebel armies of Virginia. </p>
    <p> April 10, the command marched at 8 a.m. for Burke's Station, under the immediate command of
      Gen. Custer. The undersigned, having been appointed one of the Union commissioners to arrange
      the details of surrender, remained at Appomattox Court-House until the 12th instant. </p>
    <p> Thus were concluded the labors of the campaign-a campaign, so far as cavalry in concerned,
      which has scarcely a parallel in history Never did men behave better; never endure more
      uncomplainingly the severest of hardships. No task was too severe; no danger too imminent for
      the cavalry to encounter or overcome. The gallant, daring, and rapid execution of the brave
      commander of the Third Division, united with the sure, steady, and unchangeable courage and
      bearing of the commander of the First Division, have accomplished a work which must shed glory
      on the Union cavalry for all time to come. </p>
    <p> In making up this record it was impossible to enter into details with reference to the
      different commands or officers without extending it to a very great length. The attention of
      the major-general commanding is respectfully invited to the reports of division commanders
      transmitted herewith; they will necessarily enter more largely into particulars. The
      exceptions to those throughout the command who have given the most complete satisfactory are
      very few. It is enough glory to be associated with such men--a double glory to have commanded
      them. </p>
    <p> To my staff I owe especial thanks; one and all, they performed their duties at all times
      with judgment, energy, and indefatigable zeal. I commend them to the attention of the
      major-general commanding. </p>
    <p> W. MERRITT, <br/>Brevet Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Cavalry. </p>
