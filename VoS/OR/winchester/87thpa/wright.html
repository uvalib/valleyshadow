    <p/> No. 11. <p/>Reports of Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright, U. S. Army, commanding Sixth Army
    Corps, of operations August 6-October 10 and October 19. <p/> HDQRS. SIXTH ARMY CORPS, <p/>
    October 18, 1864. <p/> COL.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken
    by the Sixth Corps in the battle of the Opequon, on the 19th of September: <p/> On the 18th of
    that month orders were received from the headquarters of the Middle Military Division, about 2
    p.m., to move upon the enemy, but before the command had been actually started the orders were
    countermanded with the understanding that the movement was delayed till the next day only. In
    the evening of the same day the orders to march were repeated, directing the movement to
    commence at 2 a.m. of the 19th, with the Sixth Corps in advance, followed by the Nineteenth,
    taking the route by the Berryville and Winchester pike, the Army of West Virginia, under Brevet
    Maj.-Gen. Crook, then at Summit Point, to follow up the movement and halt at the Opequon
    crossing till further orders. Brevet Maj.-Gen. Emory, commanding the Nineteenth Corps, was
    instructed to report to me at the crossing of the Opequon. Starting promptly at the hour
    designated, the Second Division, Brig.-Gen. Getty commanding, leading, the corps crossed the
    country to a point on the Berryville and Winchester pike about two miles from the Opequon, where
    we met the head of the Nineteenth Corps column, which, by a shorter route, had just come up,
    though probably starting later. Halting the Nineteenth Corps for the Sixth to pass, the march
    was continued to the Opequon, where, learning that Wilson's division of cavalry, which had
    preceded the infantry advance, had crossed the creek, passed through the defile of some two or
    three miles in length on the other side, and was holding the rolling ground beyond, I ordered,
    with the approbation of Maj.-Gen. Sheridan, the halting of all trains, and the prompt advance of
    the infantry with one battery of artillery, the rest of the artillery being held back till it
    could be ascertained that it would not impede the advance of the infantry columns through the
    narrow gorge alluded to. <p/> After passing the defile the infantry was promptly formed in line
    of battle, with the Second Division on the left, next the Third Division, and then the First
    Division, in reserve, with the First New York Independent Battery, Lieut. W. H. Johnson
    commanding, on the right. The remaining artillery was promptly brought up, and three other
    batteries, viz, the Fifth Maine, Battery M, Fifth U. S. Artillery, and C, First Rhode Island
    Light Artillery, were placed in position on the <p/> PAGE 150-90 OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA.,
    MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LV. [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No.
    90.] <p/> corps front by the chief of artillery, Col. C. H. Tompkins. The Nineteenth Corps,
    Brevet Maj.-Gen. Emory commanding, followed, and was posted on the right of the pike, connecting
    with the Sixth Corps. The order of battle of this corps will no doubt be described by Gen. Emory
    in his report; that of the Sixth Corps was designed to be in two lines of the Second and Third
    Divisions, the First being held in reserve; but the necessities of the case required that the
    Second Division should be in great part in one line in order to cover the ground, as is more
    fully explained in the report of Gen. Getty, commanding that division. <p/> As fast as the
    infantry arrived the cavalry of Gen. Wilson's division was relieved, skirmishers were sent
    forward, and the cavalry battery replaced by the First New York Independent, as already stated.
    When the infantry lines of the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps were formed the order for advance was
    given. This was at 11.40 a.m., and the two corps moved handsomely to the front, driving for a
    time everything before them. After a considerable advance of the infantry and artillery a most
    determined charge of the enemy was made on the left of the Nineteenth Corps, crowding it back,
    and then turning on the flank of the Third Division, Sixth Corps, threatened a disaster to the
    day. It was too early in the battle to choose to put in the reserve of the Sixth Corps, but
    seeing that the fate of the day depended on the employment of this force I at once sent it in,
    and directed Col. Tompkins, chief of artillery, to hold two of his batteries in position and
    turn them on the advancing column, they being the only ones having a fire on this part of the
    enemy's lines. The First Division moved admirably on the enemy, and the batteries with canister
    opened upon them with murderous effect, the two driving them back in much disorder. This was the
    turning point in the conflict. Getty, on the left, with part of Ricketts' division not involved
    in the break, maintained their front, and fell back only to secure their lines and preserve
    their connection with the right. For some time after the opposing ranks were comparatively
    quiet, neither side making any serious demonstration, the interval being employed in arranging
    the lines and preparing for another advance. <p/> In the meanwhile the command of Maj.-Gen.
    Crook had been brought up, formed on the extreme right, and about 4 p.m. advanced upon the
    enemy's left. Seeing the success of this movement, I at once ordered forward the Nineteenth and
    Sixth Corps, and a few moments later received orders to the same effect from Maj.-Gen. Sheridan.
    From this moment till night closed the pursuit everything went favorably, the enemy being driven
    at all points toward and beyond Winchester, though many parts of our line met with obstinate and
    sanguinary resistance at various points. Our men, however, were in the best of spirits, and
    nothing could resist their determined advance. After our forces reached Winchester the enemy
    made a show of standing on the Strasburg road, and the Sixth and Nineteenth changed front with
    the design of again attacking, but the opposing line fell back, and darkness and the exhausted
    condition of the men, who had been on foot since 2 a.m. and had gone through a long and hard
    contested battle, precluded farther pursuit for the time. Rest was absolutely indispensable to
    all, and the troops were ordered into camp for the night. <p/> In presenting this brief and very
    general description of the events of the day, I have not attempted to give a detailed account of
    the <p/> CHAP. LV.] THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY CAMPAIGN. PAGE 151-90 [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I,
    Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] <p/> gallant actions of the regiments, brigades,
    and divisions of the corps. They are shown in the reports of their commanders herewith, and are
    to be taken in connection with this in order to have a perfect idea of the obstinacy of the
    action, the various minor movements made by their respective commanders to meet the exigencies
    of the movement, and to present the gallant conduct of officers and men on this hardbought
    field, to whose bravery the country is indebted, so far as this corps is concerned, for the
    success of the day. Neither have I referred to other commands further than was necessary to
    present a general and connected history of the battle. Much in regard to them which fell under
    my own observation, and that of the most important and gallant character, has been omitted
    entirely as having no reference to the movements of this corps. The battle of the Opequon
    affords a rare example in the many hard-fought fields of this war in which all the arms of
    service could co-operate with full effect. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery had their full share
    in the operations of the day, and their movements were in entire harmony. The artillery of this
    corps alone expended eighteen army wagon-loads of ammunition, and all with good effect upon the
    results of the conflict. All of my batteries were effectively engaged. <p/> To specify
    particular officers or organizations where all did so well, where almost every officer and man
    did his duty gallantly, would seem invidious, and I shall therefore speak only of my staff, who
    each and all performed their whole duty to my entire satisfaction, and of the division
    commanders, Gen.'s Ricketts, Getty, and Upton, and Col. Thompkins, chief of artillery, who, by
    their gallantry and the skill with which they handled their respective commands, did much toward
    securing the successes of the day. For the distinguished services brigade and regimental
    commanders and individual officers I would revere to the reports herewith. <p/> In closing this
    report I cannot refrain from adverting to the gallant commander of the First Division, Brig.
    Gen. D. A. Russell, who lost his life while bravely leading his command into action at a
    critical period of the battle-an officer whose merits were not measured by his rank, whose zeal
    never outran his discretion, whose abilities were never unequal to the occasion, a man tenderly
    just to his friends and heartily generous to has fores. In the memory of this entire command
    there will ever live a sincerity of admiration and respect, a richness of glorious recollections
    to foster the widespread influence which his life created, worthy only of such a character and
    of deeds like his. <p/> A nominal list of casualties accompanies this report;* also the reports
    of Brig. Gen. E. Upton, while commanding First Division; Brig. Gen. G. W. Getty, commanding
    Second Division; Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, commanding Third Division; Brig. Gen. D. D.
