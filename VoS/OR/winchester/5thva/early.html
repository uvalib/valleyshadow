    September 17-October 19. <p/> HDQRS. VALLEY DISTRICT, <p/> New Market, October 9, 1864. <p/>
    GEN.: In advance of a detailed report I have determined to give you an informal account of the
    recent disasters to my command, which I have not had leisure to do before. <p/> On the 17th of
    September I moved two divisions (Rodes' and Gordon's) from Stephenson's Depot, where they,
    together with Breckindridge's division, were encamped (Ramseur being at Winchester to cover the
    road from Berryville), to Bunker Hill, and on the 18th I moved Gordon's division, with a part of
    Lomax's cavalry, to Martinsburg, to thwart efforts that were reported to be making to repair the
    Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This expedition was successful, and the bridge over Back Creek was
    burned by a brigade of cavalry sent there. On the evening of the 18th Rodes was moved back to
    Stephenson's Depot and Gordon to Bunker Hill, with orders to start at daylight to return to his
    camp at Stephenson's Depot, which place he reached at a very early hour next morning. About the
    time of Gordon's arrival on that morning firing was heard in Ramseur's front, and now a report
    reached me that the enemy's cavalry had appeared on the Berryville road. I ordered Rodes,
    Gordon, and Breckinridge to have their divisions under arms ready to move to Ramseur's
    assistance, and rode to his position to ascertain the extent and character of the demonstration.
    On getting there I found Ramseur's division in line of battle, and the enemy evidently advancing
    with his whole force. The other divisions were immediately ordered up and the trains all put in
    motion for their security. Rodes and Gordon arrived just before the enemy commenced advancing a
    heavy force on <p/> CHAP. LV.] THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY CAMPAIGN. PAGE 555-90 [Series I. Vol. 43.
    Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] <p/> Ramseur's left for the purpose of
    overwhelming him, and when their columns commenced advancing on Ramseur I attacked them with
    Rodes' and Gordon's divisions, and drove them back, with great slaughter, the artillery doing
    most splendid service, Braxton's battalion, driving back with canister a heavy force, before
    which Evans' brigade, of Gordon's division, which was on the left, had given way. This brigade
    was now rallied, and Battle's brigade coming to its assistance, the enemy was pushed back a
    considerable distance, and we were successful. Breckinridge's division did not arrive for some
    time, because Gen. Breckinridge had moved it out after my order to him to drive back some of the
    enemy's cavalry which was crossing the Opequon, and I sent for him again, and he came up in the
    afternoon before the enemy had made any further attack; but as he reported the enemy's cavalry
    advancing on the road from Charlestown, by Brucetown and Stephenson's Depot, I ordered one of
    his brigades to the left on that road, and directed Gen. Fitz Lee to take charge of all the
    cavalry on that flank (my left) and check the enemy's cavalry, and moved the other two brigades
    of Breckinridge's division toward the right, where our forces were weakest and the enemy was
    making demonstrations in force. Breckinridge was scarcely in position before our cavalry on the
    left was discovered coming back in great confusion, followed by the enemy's, and Breckinridge's
    force was ordered to the left to repel this cavalry force, which had gotten in rear of my left,
    and this, with the assistance of the artillery, he succeeded in doing; but as soon as the firing
    was heard in rear of our left flank the infantry commenced falling back along the whole line,
    and it was very difficult to stop them. I succeeded, however, in stopping enough of them in the
    old rifle-pits constructed by Gen. Johnston to arrest the progress of the enemy's infantry,
    which commenced advancing again when the confusion in our ranks was discovered, and could have
    still won the day if our cavalry would have stopped the enemy's; but so overwhelming was the
    battle, and so demoralized was a larger part of ours, that no assistance was received from it.
    The enemy's cavalry again charged around my left flank, and the men began to give way again, so
    that it was necessary for me to retire through the town. Line of battle was formed on the north
    side of the town, the command reorganized, and we then turned back deliberately to Newtown, and
    the next day to Fisher's. <p/> We lost three pieces of artillery, two of which had been left
    which the cavalry on the left, and the other was lost because the horses were killed and it
    could not be brought off. <p/> In this fight I had already defeated the enemy's infantry, and
    could have continued to do so, but the enemy's very great superiority in cavalry and the
    comparative inefficiency of our turned the scale against ut. <p/> In this battle the loss in the
    infantry and artillery was: Killed, 226; wounded, 1,567; missing, 1,818; total, 3,611. <p/>
    There is no full report of the cavalry, but the total loss in killed and wounded from September
    1 to October 1 is: Killed, 60; wounded, 288; total, 348. But many were captured, though a good
    many are missing as stragglers, and a number of them reported missing in the infantry were not
    captured, but are stragglers and skulkers. Wharton's (Breckinridge's) division lost six colors,
    and Rodes' division captured two. Rodes' division made a very gallant charge, and he was killed
    conducting it. <p/> I fell back to Fisher's Hill, as it was the only place where a stand could
    be made, and I was compelled to detach Fitz Lee's cavalry to the Luray Valley to hold the
    enemy's cavalry in check should it advance up that valley. <p/> PAGE 556-90 OPERATIONS IN N.
    VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LV. [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc.
    Serial No. 90.] <p/> The enemy's loss at Winchester was very heavy. Doctor McGuire has received
    a letter from a member of his family who states that 5,800 of the enemy's wounded were brought
    to the hospital at Winchester, and that the total wounded was between 6,000 and 7,000; and a
    gentleman who passed over the field says that the number of killed was very large. Sheridan's
    medical director informed one of our surgeons left at Woodstock that the number of wounded in
    hospital at Winchester was the same as stated in the letter to Doctor McGuire, and I am
    satisfied from what I saw that the enemy's loss was very heavy. The enemy's infantry force was
    nearly, if not quite, three times as large as mine, and his cavalry was very much superior, both
    in numbers and equipment. This I have learned from intelligent persons who have seen the whole
    of both forces. <p/> I posted my troops in line of Fisher's Hill with the hope of arresting
    Sheridan's progress, but my line was very thin, and having discovered that the position could be
    flanked, as is the case with every position in the Valley, I had determined to fall back on the
    night of the 22d, but late that evening a heavy force was moved under cover of the woods on the
    left and drove back the cavalry there posted, and got in the rear of my left flank, and when I
    tried to remedy this the infantry got into a panic and gave way in confusion, and I found it
    impossible to rally it. The artillery behaved splendidly, both on this occasion and at
    Winchester. I had to order the guns to be withdrawn, but the difficulties of the ground were
    such that twelve guns were lost because they could not be gotten off. <p/> The loss in the
    infantry and artillery was 30 killed, 210 wounded, and 995 missing; total, 1,235. I have been
    able to get no report of the loss in the cavalry, but it was slight. Very many of the missing in
    the infantry took to the mountains. A number of them have since come in and others are still
    out. The enemy did not capture more than 400 or 500, but I am sorry to say many men threw away
    their arms. <p/> The night favored our retreat, and by next morning the commands were pretty
    well organized. At Mount Jackson next day I halted and drove back a force of cavalry which was
    pursuing, and then moved to Rude's Hill, where I halted until the enemy's infantry came up next
    day and was trying to flank me, when I moved off in line of battle for eight miles, occasionally
    halting to check the enemy. This continued until nearly sundown, when I got a position at which
    I checked the enemy's further progress for that day, and then moved under cover of night toward
    Port Republic to unite with Kernshaw. After doing this I drove a division of cavalry from my
    front at Port Republic, and then moved to Waynesborough, where two divisions under Torbert were
    destroying the bridge, and drove them away; and after remaining there one day I moved to the
    vicinity of Mount Crawford, where I awaited the arrival of Rosser's brigade to take the
    offensive, but before it arrived the enemy was discovered to be falling back on the morning of
    the 6th. I immediately commenced following the enemy, and arrived here on the 7th, and have been
    waiting to ascertain whether Sheridan intends crossing the Blue Ridge before moving farther.
    <p/> Respectfully, <p/> J. A. EARLY, <br/>Lieut.-Gen. <p/> Gen. R. E. LEE. </body>
