  <i>Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert, Lr. S. Army, commanded the First Division of the Army of the Potomac which included the 22nd Pa. Cav.</i> CHAP. LV.] THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY CAMPAIGN. PAGE 427-90 [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] place to Smithfield, Va.; the Second Division West Virginia Cavalry (Brig.-Gen. Averell) covering the country from Smithfield in the direction of Martinsburg and the vicinity of the Potomac river. During this time the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt) was reorganized in three brigades--the First Brigade, commanded by Brig.-Gen. Custer; the Second Brigade, by Brevet Brig.-Gen. Devin, and the Reserve Brigade, by Col. Lowell, of the Second Massachusetts Cavalry. While the army lay in this position the cavalry was contranctly active, annoying the enemy by forced reconnaissances and otherwise. On the 13th the Second [First] Brigade, Third Division (Brig.-Gen. McIntosh), moved up the Berryville and Winchester pike in the direction of Winchester, drove the enemy's cavalry before him three miles, and within two miles of Winchester came upon a regiment of infantry (the Eighth South Carolina) and by a sudden dash of the Third New Jersey and Second Ohio Regiments this regiment was broken and completely surrounded, and the whole regiment entire--officers, men, and colors--marched into camp. Too much praise cannot be given Brig.-Gen. McIntosh for his quick decision and gallantry on this occasion. Orders were issued for the army to moved on the 19th of September The Third Division (Brig.-Gen. Wilson) moved on the Berryville and Winchester pike in the direction of Winchester, in advance of the infantry; the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt) moved on the right to cross the Opequon Creek at Seivers' and Locke's Fords; the Second Division West Virginia Cavalry (Brig.-Gen. Averell) was ordered to cross the Opequon Creek and moved on the Winchester and Martisburg pike in the direction of Winchester. I remained on the right, in command of these two divisions. Early in the morning the crossing of the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt) was opposed by rebel infantry, but the cavalry gallantly charged across the creek and drove them from their first position back to their second, about a mile and a half from the creek, where the infantry held the cavalry in check for some time, they being posted behind stone walls and rail breast-works. In the meantime Brig.-Gen. Averell was steadily driving the enemy's cavalry before him in the direction of Winchester. Brig.-Gen. Averell getting well in rear of the infantry force in front of the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt), they commenced to fall back, when the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt) advance rapidly, and made a junction on the Valley pike with Brig.-Gen. Merritt on the left of the Valley pike. We were now about four miles from Winchester; we came square upon the left flank of the rebel army, now hotly engaged with the Federal forces. Their infantry liens were at once charged by brigades, which lines were broken, and a great many prisoners and battle-flags captured. This day the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt) alone captured 775 prisoners, about 70 officers, 7 battle -flags, and 2 pieces of artillery. The rebel army being driven though Winchester, after dark the pursuit was stopped, and the First and Third Division (Brig.-Gen.'s Merritt and Wilson) bivouacked one the Winchester and Strasburg pike, and Brig.-Gen. Averell's division on the Moorefield pike about three miles from Winchester. During PAGE 428-90 OPERATIONS IN N. VA., W. VA., MD., AND PA. [CHAP. LV. [Series I. Vol. 43. Part I, Reports, Correspondence, Etc. Serial No. 90.] the day the Third Division (Brig.-Gen. Wilson) fought gallantly, doing wonders, driving a division of rebel infantry from different positions, and clearing he way for our infantry to form. On this occasion Brig.-Gen. McIntosh, commanding Second [First] Brigade, Third Division, suffered the loss of a leg, and Brig.-Gen. Chapman, commanding First [Second] Brigade of same division, was slightly wounded. No one could have acted with more coolness and gallantry than did Brig.-Gen. Merritt, Wilson, Custer, McIntosh, Chapman, and Brevet Brig.-Gen. Devin and Col. Lowell. Too much praise cannot be given the cavalry for the active part they played on this memorable occasion. At daylight on the 20th the army started in pursuit of the rebel army, Brig.-Gen. Averell's division of Merritt on the Valley pike to Cedar Creek, and Brig.-Gen. Wilson, via Stephensburg and Cedarville, on the Front Royal pike. The enemy were overtaken posted in a strong position at Fisher's Hill above Straburg, Va. The infantry coming up relieved the First Division (Brig.-Gen. Merritt), in front of the enemy, and this division was then placed on the right of the infantry near Strasburg. Brig.-Gen. Averell's division was moved across Cedar Creek, and placed on the right of Brig.-Gen. Merritt's division on the Back road.
