  <p>HDQRS.,</p>

  <p>May 12, 1864. (Received Hanover Junction, 13th.)</p>

  <p>Hon. SECRETARY OF WAR:</p>

  <p>This morning at dawn the enemy broke through that part of our line occupied by Johnson's division and gained possession of a portion of our breast-works, which he still holds. A number of pieces of artillery fell into his hands. The engagement has continued all day, and, with the exception indicated we have maintained our ground. In the beginning of the action we lost a large number of prisoners, but, thanks to a merciful Providence, our subsequent casualties were not large. Maj.-Gen. Johnson and Brig.-Gen. Steaurt were taken prisoners. The brave Gen. Perrin was killed, and Gen.'s Walker (of the Stonewall Brigade) and Daniel severely wounded.</p>

  <p>R. E. LEE,</p>

  <p>Gen.</p>
