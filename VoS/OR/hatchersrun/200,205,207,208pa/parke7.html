    <p> Reports of Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, U. S. Army, commanding Ninth Army Corps, of operations
      February 5-7 and March 25. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. NINTH ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> February 14, 1865. </p>
    <p> COL.: In compliance with instructions from headquarters Army of the Potomac, I have the
      honor to submit the following report of the operations of this corps during the movement of
      the 5th, 6th, and 7th instant: </p>
    <p> At 1 o'clock on the morning of the 5th I received the circular order from headquarters of
      the army, directing me to hold my command "in readiness to move at short notice, anticipating
      that the movement to be ordered will consist of the withdrawal of all the troops, except the
      minimum number necessary to maintain the picket-line and the garrison of the works." </p>
    <p> At this time our front extended from the Appomattox to Battery 24, and was held by the First
      and Second Divisions, with the Third Division in reserve. All the preparations were at once
      made for the movement. At 1.45 p.m. of the 5th I received an order to send Gen. Hertranft's
      division (the Third) down the Vaughan road to report to Maj.-Gen. Humphreys at Hatcher's Run.
      Gen. Hartranft moved his division as rapidly as possible and reported to Maj.-Gen. Humphreys
      at 8 p.m. Gen. Hartranft's report is forwarded herewith. In compliance with instructions Col.
      Brainerd, commanding Engineer Brigade, at City Point, reported to me with his command during
      the evening of the 5th, and was posted as a reserve in the vicinity of the Avery house. On the
      following day this brigade was moved to the left and directed to Maj.-Gen. Getty, commanding
      Sixth Corps. </p>
    <p> The Third Division, Gen. Hartranft commanding, returned during the night of the 10th and
      took up their old position. On the following morning the divisions holding the front lines
      were extended the left as far as Fort Howard, and are now holding the line from the Appomattox
      to that point. </p>
    <p> I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> JNO. G. PARKE, </p>
    <p> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. </p>
    <p> Col. GEORGE D. RUGGLES, </p>
    <p> Assistant Adjt.-Gen., Army of the Potomac. </p>
