    <p> HDQRS. 107TH PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS, </p>
    <p> February 12, 1865. </p>
    <p> CAPT.: I have the honor to report that on the evening of February 6 I took command of the
      One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, the regiment at that time forming part of the
      Third Brigade, Third Division, Fifth Army Corps. We bivouacked for the night on the south side
      of Hatcher's Run, near the bridge. The regiment lay here until 11 a.m. on the morning of the
      7th and then marched up the stream about three-quarters of a mile, and then formed part of the
      brigade line of battle and advanced in support of Baxter's brigade, who was skirmishing the
      enemy in front. We advanced in support of this brigade, entering the woods and taking
      possession of the unfinished rebel works captured in Baxter's advance. Here we halted, and,
      felling trees, threw up additional works and slashed the timber in front. While here the enemy
      threw shells, but they all passed over, doing us no injury. About 4.30 p.m. we were marched to
      the left by the flank about half a mile (troops of the Sixth Corps occupying the works we
      left). I then received orders to cross the breast-works and advanced in line with the brigade.
      I also received instructions that the guide would be right. We had not advanced far until I
      found the regiments on my left had great difficulty in keeping up with the line, on account of
      the guide being right; it required nearly a right half wheel to do so. A charge being ordered,
      I advanced the regiment under fire until within a very short distance of the rebel works, but
      before penetrating that far the troops on my right and left gave way, falling back to the
      breast-works which we had crossed, part of my own regiment falling back with them; but with
      the colors of the regiment, the three commissioned officers I had with me, and about one-half
      of my men, we fell back about 100 yards, halted, and reformed my line, the enemy making no
      attempt at an advance. After dark the regiments composing the brigade returned and took
      position on my right and left. A short time after we were marched by the flank to the right,
      making connection with the left of Gen. Bragg's brigade, and were ordered to build
      breast-works. </p>
    <p> About 1 o'clock on the morning of the 8th we were marched to the rear, crossing Hatcher's
      Run, and bivouacked in the field on the north side of the run. On the afternoon of the 9th I
      was relieved of the command of the regiment by the return of Col. McCoy. Lieut. John F.
      Williams was injured by a fall in the charge. I had 1 man killed and 6 wounded. </p>
    <p> The three commissioned officers with me, viz: First Lieut. O. P. Stair, Company A; First
      Lieut. John F. Williams, Company F, and Second Lieut. H. H. Hutton, behaved with great
      gallantry. Sergts. John Delany, John A. Tompkins, William C. Beck, and Michael J. Hawley,
      behaved very bravely and rendered a great deal of assistance. Sergt. F. J. Swoyer, color
      bearer of the regiment, behaved with his usual courage until compelled to relinquish the same,
      being wounded in the hand. </p>
    <p> I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> H. J. SHEAFER, </p>
    <p> Maj. One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers. </p>
    <p> Capt. HARRISON LAMBDIN, </p>
    <p> Asst. Adjt. Gen., Third Brig., Third Div., Fifth Army Corps. </p>
    <p> P. S.--For names of wounded, see list of casualties accompanying report of Col. McCoy.* </p>
