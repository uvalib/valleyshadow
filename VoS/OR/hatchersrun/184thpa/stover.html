    <p> Report of Col. John H. Stover, One hundred and eighty-fourth Pennsylvania Infantry, of
      operations February 5-11. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. 184TH PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS, </p>
    <p> February 12, 1865. </p>
    <p> SIR: I have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders, my command was reported on the
      brigade parade ground at 6 a.m. February 5. The regiment marched with the brigade until we
      reached the picket-line on the Vaughan road. The One hundred and eighty-fourth was then
      assigned to the right of the brigade, and, after several maneuvers, was formed in line
      immediately west of the Riddle house. Here fortifications were erected and skirmishers thrown
      in front. I remained in this position until the morning of the 11th instant, when, after
      destroying all the fortifications of the brigade, I withdrew the regiment to the lines it now
      occupies. The regiment was not heavily engaged with the enemy, and consequently I lost but two
      men wounded, viz, Joseph Jenkins, sergeant, Company B, wounded, and John Adams, private,
      Company K, wounded in hand. I have every reason to be proud of the deportment of the officers
      and men during this campaign. No special opportunity was presented for unusual gallantry,
      except on the night of the 5th, when a portion of the picket-line was driven in by the enemy.
      Lieut. Col. Charles Kleckner promptly re-established the line, driving the enemy from the pits
      he had captured. I accordingly recommend him to the favorable notice of the Col. commanding
      the brigade. </p>
    <p> Respectfully, &amp;c., </p>
    <p> JOHN H. STOVER, </p>
    <p> Col., Cmdg. Regt. </p>
    <p> Capt. WILL GILDER, </p>
    <p> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., First Brigade. </p>
