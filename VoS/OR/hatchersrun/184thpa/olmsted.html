      Part I, Reports. Serial No. 95.] </p>
    <p> No. 53. </p>
    <p> Report of Col. William A. Olmstead, Fifty-ninth New York Infantry, commanding First Brigade,
      of operations February 5-7. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIRST Brig., SECOND DIV., SECOND ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> February 13, 1865 </p>
    <p> MAJ.: In compliance with circular of the 11th, Second Division headquarters, I report the
      part taken by this brigade on the 5th, 6th and 7th instant. </p>
    <p> February 5, the brigade was formed at its old camp, and marched at 7 a.m. down the Vaughan
      road, where we halted for the Third Division, Second Army Corps, to pass. The Nineteenth
      Massachusetts, Lieut.-Col. Rice, was advanced as skirmishers in front of a brigade of the
      Third Division. The balance of the brigade moved on the Vaughan road, and changed direction to
      the right through the woods, arriving at or near Hatcher's Run, crossed over Wild Cat Run, and
      formed line of battle, facing the woods and westward as follows: The One hundred and
      eighty-fourth Pennsylvania on left; Thirty-sixth Wisconsin, One hundred and fifty-second New
      York, Fifty-ninth New York the Seventh Michigan, and First Minnesota were thrown out as
      skirmishers to the left and front with their left resting on Hatcher's Run. The Nineteenth
      Massachusetts connected with the First Minnesota, picketing to the Nineteenth Maine, who
      advanced and carried the enemy's works on Hatcher's Run. Along the base of Hatcher's Run the
      Twentieth Massachusetts was sent, by order of Gen. Smyth, to support a brigade of the Third
      Division. They were relieved after the engagement on Sunday, February 5. </p>
    <p> February 6 and 7, no material change of troops. </p>
    <p> I have the honor to report that during the engagement of Sunday, the 5th, on our right, and
      Mounday, the 6th, on our left the conduct of officers and men was more than could be expected;
      their coolness and contentment and patient waiting attracted the attention of myself and
      staff; and I can safely say, had an opportunity offered itself, they would have done credit to
      the general commanding the division. </p>
    <p> I wish to mention for brevet promotion, for gallant and fearless discharge of duty, and for
      general attention thereto, Lieut. Col. George W. La Point, commanding Seventh Michigan
      Volunteers, and Maj. M. Van Sickle, of the same regiment; also Capt. Frank Houston, commanding
      First Minnesota Battalion; also Lieut. W. H. Tibbitts, Nineteenth Massachusetts, and First
      Lieut. and Actg. Adjt. J. F. Aytoun, Nineteenth Massachusetts and Maj. John Kelliher,
      Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers for gallant and meritorious conduct on picket-line. I
      cannot close this report without mentioning with credit the officers of my staff; always
      ready, prompt, and each showed the disposition of the soldier, by obeying strictly their
      orders and delivering them under fire; and I do therefore ask for a brevet for Capt. Will
      Gilder, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. A. B. Holmes, acting brigade-inspector; Capt. Thomas
      Huggins, temporary aide-de-camp; and Second Lieut. William H. Tripp, personal aide. </p>
    <p> Herewith I subjoin the reports of the regimental commanders. </p>
    <p> I am, major, yours, respectfully, </p>
    <p> WILLIAM A. OLMSTED, </p>
    <p> Col. Fifty-ninth New York Veteran Vols., Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
