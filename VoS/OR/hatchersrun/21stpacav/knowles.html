    <p> February 15, 1865. </p>
    <p> MAJ.: In compliance with instructions from headquarters Second Cavalry Division, I have the
      honor to make the following report of operations of this brigade in the engagements of the
      5th, 6th, and 7th instant: </p>
    <p> The brigade (with the exception of the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, who were ordered to report to
      Gen. Warren at 6 a.m., 5th instant) left its present camp at 3 a.m., 5th instant; marched, via
      Gary's Church and Reams' Station, to Dinwiddie Court-House, where we remained about one hour;
      then returned to the Rowanty, where we bivouacked. </p>
    <p> At 1 a.m., 6th instant, orders were received to march, when in company with the division the
      brigade marched, via Monk's Neck bridge, to the Vaughan road and joined the infantry near
      Hatcher's Run, where the brigade was formed on the west side of the run. Here the Sixth Ohio
      Cavalry, which accompanied the infantry on the advance, rejoined the brigade, participated in
      the engagement on the 6th instant, with but slight loss. The Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry
      was ordered to report half to Gen. Crawford and half to a staff officer of Gen. Meade. </p>
    <p> At 1 p.m., 7th instant, the brigade returned to Weldon railroad, where it remained during
      the night, and on the morning of 8th instant returned to camp. </p>
    <p> I have the honor to mention the following-named enlisted men as having displayed marked
      bravery on the advance to Hatcher's Run while with the infantry: Sergt. Michael Eck, Company
      L, Sixth Ohio Cavalry; Corpl. Harley B. Scribner, Company L, Sixth Ohio Cavalry; Private
      William W. Porter, Company L, Sixth Ohio Cavalry; Corpl. W. Emerson Dunlap, Company K, Sixth
      Ohio Cavalry. </p>
    <p> Respectfully submitted. </p>
    <p> O. B. KNOWLES, </p>
    <p> Col., Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
    <p> Bvt. Maj. H. C. WEIR, </p>
