  <p>No. 136.</p>

  <p>Report of Col. Edgar M. Gregory, Ninety-first Pennsylvania Infantry, commanding Second brigade, of operations August 18-30.</p>

  <p>HDQRS. SECOND Brig., FIRST DIV., FIFTH CORPS,</p>

  <p>Camp on the Weldon Railroad, Near Petersburg, Va.,</p>

  <p>August 30, 1864.</p>

  <p>CAPT.: In compliance with Circular No. 120, from corps headquarters, I have the honor to submit the following statement of the operations of this command, commencing the 18th instant:</p>

  <p>The command broke camp at daylight on the 18th instant, and at 7 road, following the said road about two miles, where, striking a country road leading to or near the Yellow House, and following the said road for about one mile, a halt was ordered, and the brigade deployed in line of battle, about one mile and a half from the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad. The enemy made no attempt to resist our advance on the road, either because they were not apprised of our movements or had no force at hand to justify the attempt. On reaching the railroad a portion of the troops proceeded to destroy the track by tearing up the rails and</p>

  <p>tie, while other portions of the command proceeded to erect breastworks for the defense of the brigade. The casualties on that day were small, but two wounded. From the 18th to the 21st the enemy made an attack on our front and flank, but were easily repulsed, leaving their dead on the field. Our loss in the brigade was very light, we having but 5 men killed, 2 commissioned officers and 9 enlisted men wounded, and 3 enlisted men missing.</p>

  <p>I have to regret the loss of one of my aides, Lieut. Robert F. Bourne, of the Twenty-second Massachusetts Regiment, who was severely wounded in the leg, while in the discharge of his duty.</p>

  <p>Since the action of the 21st instant the command has not been engaged, but has remained undisturbed in camp up the present date.</p>

  <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p>E. M. GREGORY,<br />
  Col., Cmdg.</p>

  <p>Capt. W. S. DAVIS,<br />
  Actg. Asst. Adjt. Gen., First Division, Fifth Army Corps.</p>
