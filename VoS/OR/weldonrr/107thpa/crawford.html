    <p> Reports of Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford, U. S. Army, commanding Third Division, of
      operations August 18-21, October 27-28, and December 7-12. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> Before Petersburg, Va., September 25, 1864. </p>
    <p> COL.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command during
      the 18th, 19th, and 21st of August: </p>
    <p> Having reached the Globe Tavern (or Yellow House) about noon on the 18th ultimo, I received
      instructions to mass my command in the immediate vicinity, and to hold them in readiness to
      move at a moment's notice. My division consisted of the First Brigade, Col. P. Lyle
      commanding; the Second Brigade, Col. Coulter commanding, and the Third, a provisional brigade,
      consisting of two regiments (the One hundred and ninetieth and One hundred and ninety-first
      Veteran Pennsylvania Reserve Volunteers, Col. Hartshorne commanding), numbering in the
      aggregate about 3,000 effective men. In about an hour I received orders to advance. The Second
      Division under Gen. Ayres was advancing on the left of the railroad. My orders were to advance
      on the right in line of battle and form connection with the Second Division on my left. The
      ground in my immediate front was low, and in front ended in a dense and almost impenetrable
      thicket which ran along the whole line from right to left. The thicket was cut up which swampy
      grounds, and was almost impassable. The First Brigade, under Col. Lyle, was on the left, the
      Second, under Col. Coulter, was in the center, and the Third Brigade, under Col. Hartshorne,
      advanced in support on the right. I at once directed that a strong skirmish line should be
      deployed and thrown into the woods. The One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers was
      deployed and advanced, the line of battle following. Meantime the enemy's batteries stationed
      near the Davis house had opened and obtained range of the command. Finding that the regiment
      deployed as skirmishers did not properly cover my front, I ordered it to be relieved by the
      One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania, or First Pennsylvania Reserve Veteran Volunteers,
      under Col. Hartshorne, and directed the One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania to rejoin its
      brigade. </p>
    <p> While superintending this movement and the general advance of my line, I sent a staff
      officer to find the right of the Second Division and to insure a firm connection with it on my
      left. This was thoroughly effected by the Sixteenth Maine Regiment, of Lyle's brigade (see
      report of Col.'s Lyle, McCoy, and Tilden). It was raining heavily as we advanced. On the right
      of the Sixteenth Maine was the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts, under command of Lieut.-Col.
      Peirson. Hardly had the connection been made and the brigade advanced into position on the
      right when the enemy threw himself on the right of the Second Division and forced it back. The
      woods and undergrowth on the right of the railroad were so thick on the left of my line as to
      be almost impenetrable. The enemy, however, after having driven back the right of the Second
      Division, seeing his advantage in regard to the troops on the right of the road, advanced
      directly on my left flank. The line fell back, continuing to fight until it entirely
      confronted the enemy, when a stand was made and the enemy retired, and the line again advanced
      to its original position. At this time I received an order from the major-general commanding
      the corps, which was reiterated through </p>
    <p> PAGE 492-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports.
      Serial No. 87.] </p>
    <p> Lieut.-Col. Bankhead, the acting assistant inspector-general, to throw forward my right,
      and, as far as possible, advance toward the railroad and strike the enemy on his left flank.
      This was at once ordered, and the line moved forward on the right. The skirmish line, strongly
      supported, advanced. We met the enemy on the right and center and drove him back from tow
      chains of hastily-constructed rifle-pits to his entrenchments beyond a large corn-field in
      front of the thicket of woods. To advance my line was a matter of the greatest difficulty. So
      dense and tangled was the undergrowth, and so interspersed with swamps, that it was almost
      impossible to keep up the congestion or to see beyond twenty or thirty feet. The line was
      established, however. I reported to the general commanding the corps the result of my advance,
      and received from him the following communication: </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIFTH ARMY CORPS, <br/>August 18, 1864--8 p. m. <br/>Gen. CRAWFORD: <br/>You have
      done very well indeed in getting forward through that difficult country so far. Make yourself
      strong as you can and hold on. I will try and re-enforce you by Bragg's brigade in the
      morning, and establish direct communication with the Ninth Corps pickets. We are going to hold
      on here. </p>
    <p> Respectfully, <br/>G. K. WARREN, <br/>Maj.-Gen. </p>
    <p> The line was entrenched during the night in front of the First Brigade. At daylight next
      morning I ordered the Second Brigade to take position on the right of the First Brigade and to
      extend the entrenchments on its front. It moved to its position and commenced throwing up the
      works. In order to extend my line as far as was desired, the One hundred and ninety-first
      Pennsylvania, under Col. Carle, was ordered to take post on the right of the One hundred and
      ninetieth Pennsylvania, and these two regiments covered the whole of my front and flank--a
      strong skirmish line. The picket-firing continued during the night. At 3 a. m. Gen. Bragg
      reported to me with his brigade, consisting of the Sixth Wisconsin Volunteers, Seventh
      Wisconsin Volunteers, Twenty-fourth Michigan Volunteers, Seventh Indiana Volunteers,
      Nineteenth Indiana Volunteers, and First Battalion New York Sharpshooters, and numbering only
      60 officers and 700 men. I directed Gen. Bragg, in person, to proceed to my right flank and
      take position there until further orders, and at the same time sent a staff officer to conduct
      him. Before daylight a staff officer of the general commanding the corps, Capt. Cope,
      aide-de-camp, came with orders to the effect that Gen. Bragg's brigade should extend to the
      right until a congestion was formed with the Ninth Corps. I at once sent a staff officer with
      Capt. Cope to see Gen. Bragg, and to carry out the orders he had received. The Ninth Corps
      pickets were found in the neighborhood of the Aiken house, the shortest point from the right
      of my line, and the line advanced at once directly eastward until it should strike the
      position this division had formerly occupied in front of the Strong house. At 8 o'clock I went
      in person to the house and found that the change as ordered was being made. About 1 o'clock
      the enemy advanced a strong skirmish line through the corn-field and into the woods. He struck
      the right of the One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania and the front of the One hundred and
      ninety-first Pennsylvania, and after a short contest he was forced to retire. I now rode to
      the extreme right of Gen. Bragg's line in order to satisfy myself that it was properly </p>
    <p> CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 493-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial
      No. 87.] </p>
    <p> established. At 12 o'clock an aide of the major-general commanding the corps came to the
      right of Col. Carle's regiment. I accompanied him to the neighborhood of the corn-field, and
      learned from him that it was determined to make a change in Gen. Bragg's line; that it was to
      be advanced to the edge of the corn-field from that point indicated by two trees, which were
      pointed out. The line was to run directly east, and that it must be run by the compass. </p>
    <p> Gen. Bragg was, in the meantime, endeavoring to establish his line as previously ordered. I
      rode to the right for the purpose of conferring with him. I went along the entire front. Upon
      arriving at the Strong house I could not find the right of his line. I sent a staff officer to
      determine it, and to direct it to advance. I then returned, passing different portions of the
      Ninth Corps en route to the support of the Fifth. As I was returning along the rear of my
      line, when opposite the Nineteenth Indiana Regt. detail of Bragg's brigade, I met the men from
      that regiment upon the road along which our ambulances had gone in the morning. I asked why
      they had left the front. They replied they had been driven back by the enemy, and asked if I
      had not heard the firing. I called a second lieutenant, who seemed to be in charge, and
      directed him to reform his line, and at once return to his position and establish his
      connection to the right and left. I at once sent an order to Gen. Bragg, who was now on the
      left of his line, with the intention of rectifying it according to the orders received from
      Maj. Roebling, an aide of the major-general commanding the corps, and directed him to send a
      portion of the regiment which he had in reserve to support the line occupied by the Nineteenth
      Indiana Regt. I then rode down the rear of my line. I had scarcely reached the center,
      however, when the enemy, who had steadily concentrated in the cornfield on the right, burst
      through he thin line of Bragg's brigade, crossed the road into the woods beyond, and, changing
      front, swept down in rear of my entire line. I was at this time near my left flank.
      Simultaneously with their flank attack they advanced in line of battle and attacked our whole
      line from right to left. They advanced within 30 yards of our works. In front their advance
      was checked, and they were being repulsed, when the rebel line commenced its advance along our
      rear. At this moment our artillery opened fire upon friend and foe, the shells bursting among
      our men, the projectiles striking in the rear of the breast-works, killing some officers and
      men and wounding many others. Immediately the cry was raised that the enemy were in our rear,
      and the men began to fall back from the entrenchments on the left of Lyle's brigade. In the
      dense thicket in which they were engaged it was impossible to know the truth. Col. Wheelock,
      commanding the Second Brigade, finding that our artillery was producing such effect upon his
      men, ordered them to leap over the breast-works and take position on the other side. This was
      accomplished just as the rebel line, diverted from their purpose, were driven by the fire of
      our artillery into the woods in my rear and were making a hasty retreat. A volley was fired
      from this brigade, which drove them upon a wood road, which led into the corn-field, and this
      entire brigade, under the gallant officer who commanded it, remainder in the entrenchments
      until the close of the action. The left of Lyle's brigade, in retreating through the woods
      into the space in the rear, met the rebel lines as they were advancing into the woods from the
      fire of our artillery, and many of them were captured. The brigade under Col. Hartshorne,
      while attacked in front, was also </p>
    <p> PAGE 494-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports.
      Serial No. 87.] </p>
    <p> attacked in rear by the rebels, who swept round and drove them at the point of the bayonet
      hurriedly to the rear. After a short but determined fight, they destroyed their rifles by
      breaking them against the trees, and a large number were made prisoners. </p>
    <p> Col. Wheelock, commanding the Second Brigade, finding himself unsupported on the right or
      left in the entrenchments, and fearing the enemy might obtain the advantage of him, as the
      fire of our artillery was severe, fell back in line of battle to the edge of the woods. I was
      reforming what was left of Lyle's brigade, and ordered them to take post upon the left of
      Wheelock. I advanced with the whole line, regained possession of the works, and re-established
      my picket-line as it had been formed in the morning. A brigade, under Col. Humphrey, of the
      Ninth Corps, advanced on my left, and his brigade and the Second Brigade of my division
      reoccupied the works. A brigade, under Gen. Hartranft, advanced on the right. In this advance
      the colors of a rebel regiment were captured. On the afternoon of the 19th a rebel flag
      belonging to a North Carolina regiment was captured by Private Solomon J. Hottenstine,* of the
      One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania, and was presented by him to the general commanding the
      division, who deposited it with the corps commander. I remained upon the center and left of my
      line until the close of the action. The rebels passed freely around me on every side, and I
      was once in their hands, but escaped almost miraculously. I held the men to the entrenchments
      until our own artillery rendered our position absolutely untenable. There was no falling back
      beyond the artillery by any part of my line. The men fought surrounded by the enemy on every
      side, and while I deeply regret the loss of so many brave veteran officers and men to the
      cause of the country at the present time, I have the satisfaction of knowing that in their
      capture, however much I may deplore it, no dishonor or blame can attach to them. They fought
      bravely and successfully with the foe in their front. (That the enemy successfully approached
      their rear from the extreme part of the line cannot be, and I am glad to know is not, justly
      chargeable to them.) </p>
    <p> The officers of my immediate staff supported me most gallantly, as the following record will
      show: My adjutant-general, Capt. Monteith, had his horse killed under him. Lieut. Clarke,
      aide-de-camp, was severely wounded and his arm broken while carrying an order to the right of
      the line. Lieut. Mead, commissary of musters, Lieut. Merrifield, pioneer officer, and Capt.
      Smith, acting division inspector, had their horses wounded. My personal orderly was shot
      through the breast, the flag bearer's horse was killed, and 2 mounted orderlies' horses were
      wounded and 1 lost. </p>
    <p> The total loss in killed, wounded, and missing was as follows: From division staff, 1
      officer wounded; First Brigade, 42 officers and 811 men; Second Brigade, 15 officers and 345
      men; Third Brigade, 33 officers and 711 men. Total, 91 officers and 1,867 men.+ On the 21st
      the command was on the extreme right of the line and was not engaged, except the batteries of
      the division. </p>
    <p> The reports of Col. Lyle, commanding First Brigade; of Col. Wheelock, commanding Second
      Brigade; of Col. Tilden, commanding the extreme left of the line, and also of Brig.-Gen.
