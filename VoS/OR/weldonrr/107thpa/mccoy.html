    <p> Report of Col. Thomas F. McCoy, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Infantry, commanding
      First Brigade, of operations August 18-September 12. </p>
    <p> HDQRS. FIRST Brig., THIRD DIV., FIFTH ARMY CORPS, </p>
    <p> Camp near Weldon Railroad, Va., September 12, 1864. </p>
    <p> CAPT.: In compliance with the orders of the commanding general of the division, I have the
      honor to report the operations of this brigade on the Weldon railroad from the 18th ultimo: </p>
    <p> The brigade on that day was composed of the following regiments: One hundred and fourth
      Regt. New York Volunteers, Col. G. G. Prey; Ninetieth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, Lieut.
      Col. C. L. Peirson; Sixteenth Maine Volunteers, Col. C. W. Tilden, and One hundred and seventh
      Regt. Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers, Col. T. F. McCoy, and was formed in column in the order
      named. The aggregate number of officers and men was as follows: field officers, 8; line
      officers, 59; buns, 1,108. The column moved in the direction of the Weldon railroad about 8 a.
      m., the Third Division being preceded by the First and Second Divisions respectively. The
      Fourth Division was in rear of the column. The day was oppressively warm and the soldiers
      suffered greatly form the hot sun. The railroad was reached by the First Brigade about noon at
      the Yellow House, or Six-Mile Station, south of Petersburg. The troops were massed in the
      fields near this point on the right or east of the railroad. The troops that had preceded us
      had already advanced one battery and some infantry up the road in the direction of the city,
      and other bodies of troops were engaged in destroying the railroad. There is here a large and
      beautiful </p>

      No. 87.] </p>
    <p> area of cleared ground of several hundred acres, extending east and west of the railroad and
      north along the road, perhaps half a mile from the Yellow House. This clearing is surrounded
      by a dense wood, interspersed with swamps, parts of it so filled with underbrush that it is
      difficult to penetrate. The ground is generally a level. In these grassy fields the troops
      were permitted to rest about an hour, when they were called to arms. The battery on the
      railroad had opened and skirmishing had commenced on the right and left of the road in the
      direction of Petersburg and in the woods beyond the open ground just mentioned. This brigade,
      then under the command of Col. Peter Lyle, of the Ninetieth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, was
      formed in line of battle and advanced to within a short distance of the woods. The One hundred
      and seventh Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers were ordered to deploy as skirmishers, and
      advanced to within a short distance of the woods. The One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania
      Veteran Volunteers were ordered to deploy as skirmishers, and advanced into the woods about
      twenty yards and halted for further orders. While this regiment was in the act of deploying
      and advancing, orders were given for it to oblique to the right and also extend the intervals
      that it might extend to the right and form a cave, following the line of the clearing so as to
      protect the right flank of the division, the other brigades of which were now advancing and
      forming on the right of the first. </p>
    <p> The brigade soon advanced into the woods with orders to connect with the right of the Second
      Division, which extended across and to the right of the railroad from 50 to 100 yards. This
      was effected by the Sixteenth Maine Regt. (Col. Tilden), that regiment being on the left of
      the brigade. While Col. Lyle was exerting himself to bring up each successive regiment on the
      right of the Sixteenth Maine into line, it being very difficult to accomplish in the thick and
      tangled wood and underbrush, the enemy's column of battle advanced and made a furious attack
      on the Second Division, on our left, and extending along the front of our brigade, then in
      course of formation. The Sixteenth Maine first came under the fire with the right of the
      Second Division. The troops on the Second Division, on our left, and extending along the front
      of our brigade, then in course of formation. The Sixteenth Maine first came under the fire
      with the right of the Second Division. The troops on the right of that division retiring
      somewhat, left the left flank of this brigade exposed. This regiment holding its ground for
      some minutes, soon discovering that the enemy was threatening the flank and rear, fell back
      some 150 yards, together with the other regiments of the brigade that had also become engaged,
      suffering a loss of some killed, wounded, and missing. This was not done, however, without
      inflicting loss upon the enemy. Lieut. William T. Spear, Thirty-ninth Massachusetts
      Volunteers, a most worthy officer, of Christian habits and character, was killed in this part
      of the action, and Lieut. Col. Charles L. Peirson and Lieut. John D. Reed were wounded, the
      former very seriously, together with a considerable number of men killed, wounded, and a few
      prisoners. The Sixteenth Maine Regt. also lost in killed, wounded, and prisoners. Lieut. John.
      T. Reilly, of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, was taken prisoner, with some of the men
      of that regiment. These regiment retiring but a short distance and reforming, the line of
      battle was again formed as soon as possible. The One hundred and seventh Regt. Pennsylvania
      Veteran Volunteers (seven shooters). The brigade, in connection with the troops on our right
      and left, again advanced under a brisk skirmish fire and partially reoccupied the ground from
      which it had just retired. The skirmishing was kept up during the evening and night 12 o'clock
      with but little intermission. </p>
    <p> PAGE 504-87 OPERATIONS IN. SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I,
      Reports. Serial No. 87.] </p>
    <p> During the night intrenchments were thrown up, and during the early part of the 19th the
      troops were engaged in strengthening their works. In the morning it was discovered that the
      enemy's skirmish line had been withdrawn several hundred yards to rear of the one occupied on
      the previous night, leaving a few dead in our hands and quite a number of small-arms. The dead
      were buried and the arms sent to the rear. In our front there was quietness during the early
      part of the day. At about 2 o'clock in the afternoon the brigade moved by the right flank for
      a distance of about 200 yards, occupying part of the ground vacated by the Second Brigade, the
      party of the line we vacated Division. The men again engaged in repairing the works, a heavy
      rain during the day having made additional labor necessary. At about 4 o'clock a brisk
      musketry fire was opened on our right on the line, perhaps a half or three quarters of a mile
      distant and in front of another or part of another division of the corps. A short time before
      this fire was opened it was reported to Col. Lyle by the picket officer that the enemy was
      forming a line of battle in our immediate front. The fire continued on the right and seemed to
      grow in volume. The regiments were in the breast-works, and very soon thereafter the whole
      line opened a heavy musketry fire, repelling the enemy in every attempt to approach our lines.
      This fire was continued almost without intermission until rifle-balls and shells began to come
      from our rear, and very soon thereafter a backward movement was made in the direction of our
      second line of battle. In passing through the woods in the direction named, the fire from our
      own batteries was very hot, and I believe some were killed and not a few wounded. The enemy
      also suffered from this fire. Before reaching the clear ground a rebel column was met that had
      interposed through a break in the line in the division on our right, while our division in our
      part of the line was repelling the attack from the front, and came along in our rear between
      our retiring force and the second line of works, and this being effected through the thick
      wood and with great daring, was accomplished unperceived by us and before measures could be
      taken to resist or avoid it; hence we lost in prisoners largely, in both officers and men. </p>
    <p> The following field officers were captured and taken to Petersburg by the enemy: Col. G. G.
      Prey, One hundred and fourth New York Volunteers: Col. C. W. Tilden, Sixteenth Maine
      Volunteers; Lieut. Col. J. R. Strang, One hundred and fourth New York Volunteers, reported to
      be wounded; Lieut. Col. William A. Leech, Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers; Maj. Jacob M.
      Davis, same regiment. Others were taken but made their escape before they could be taken to
      the enemy's rear. Thirty-three line officers were taken and 721 enlisted men. </p>
    <p> I would not omit to mention that Col. Tilden, of the Sixteenth Maine, a most worthy and
      esteemed officer, being deeply impressed with a vivid recollection of a former imprisonment in
      Richmond, after having been taken to Petersburg and on his way under guard from that city to
      the Libby Prison, made a most daring and successful escape, and rejoined his regiment the
      third night after his capture. Considering the perils through which he passed in making his
      escape, it cannot be otherwise regarded than remarkably providential. He was accompanied by
      Lieut. E. F. Davis, of the same regiment. I would also state that the brigade staff has
      suffered severely by the following members of it having been captured: Capt. Byron Porter,
      assistant adjutant-general, </p>
    <p> CHAP. LIV.] THE RICHMOND CAMPAIGN. PAGE 505-87 [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports. Serial
      No. 87.] </p>
    <p> general, Capt. E. J. Trull, acting brigade inspector, and Lieut. I. F. R. Hosea, commanding
      pioneer corps. Lieut. A. Leavitt, acting aide-de-camp, was captured, but made his escape, and
      bringing into our lines a number of prisoners. It was with difficulty that Col. Lyle,
      commanding brigade, made his escape, having to abandon his horse in the attempt. With all
      these losses, however, the remnant of the brigade was rallied, and with the aid of other
      troops advanced again into the woods, and late in the evening reoccupied the line of the
      afternoon. All these operations of the afternoon took place during a rain-storm, and the men
      were wet to the skin and greatly exhausted. </p>
    <p> On the 20th the brigade was relieved from duty in the front line and took position in the
      open field on the right of the railroad, again connecting with the Second division and in
      support of the Ninth Massachusetts Battery, when the men threw up a line of intrenchments
      during the afternoon fronting the northeast. There were indications of an attack of the enemy
      during the night, and on the morning of the 21st the indications were still more striking and
      apparent. At 9 o'clock the enemy opened their batteries, and soon after their columns of
      infantry advanced against the left flank and front of our line. Their repeated attempts to
      advance upon the works were repulsed, and after about an hour's fighting they retired in
      disorder, leaving many prisoners in our hands and the ground strewn with their dead and
      wounded. Our loss in this engagement was comparatively small, which may be attributed to our
      men fighting behind breast-works. The artillery on our part of the line did the greater part
      of the fighting. Some prisoners were turned over to Col. Lyle that were taken in our front.
      There was no further fighting during the day. The wounded rebels were carried from the field
      and well cared for by our surgeon. On Monday, 22d, the dead were buried. On the 23d the
      division under Gen. Hancock's corps was heavily engaged with a large force of the enemy. At
      this period in the movements of the brigade, Col. Lyle, who had been in command since the
      battles of the Wilderness, to the great satisfaction of the officers and men, was compelled by
      severe illness to relinquish the command to the undersigned. I immediately assumed command and
      marched the column to the Yellow House, when I received an order from Brig.-Gen. Crawford,
      commanding the division, to report with my command to Brig.-Gen. Bragg, which I did at once
      and moved under his direction toward Reams' Station. Having marched about one mile, orders
      were received to counter march the command and go into camp for the night. On the following
      day, the 26th, we were again ordered to change camp and throw up a line of works southeast of
      the Yellow House. September 2, instant, the brigade, with the division, was supporting the
      cavalry under Gen. Gregg in a reconnaissance, since which time, with little interruption, it
      has remained quietly in camp near the Gurley house. </p>
    <p> It affords me pleasure to state that the One hundred and ninetieth and One hundred and
      ninety-first regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers, formerly composing the Third Brigade of the
      Third Division, have been transferred to this brigade, and have composed a part of it since
      the </p>
    <p> PAGE 506-87 OPERATIONS IN SE. VA. AND N. C. [CHAP. LIV. [Series I. Vol. 42. Part I, Reports.
      Serial No. 87.] </p>
    <p> morning of the 23d of August. In the operations of the 18th and 19th these regiments lost by
      capture about three-fourths of the number they had with the command, including Col. W. R.
      Hartshorne, One hundred and ninetieth, commanding the brigade, and Col. James Carle,
      commanding One hundred and ninety-first, with Maj. John A. Wolff, of the former, and Maj. M.
      Weidler, of the latter regiment, together with a large proportion of their line officers. Not
      having any personal knowledge of the operations of these regiments, then composing the Third
      Brigade, I cannot report their operations further than to inclose the reports of Capt. N. B.
      Kinsey, of the One hundred and ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Capt. R. M. Birkman, One
      hundred and ninetieth, temporarily assigned to the One hundred and ninety-first, who have been
      in command of these regiments since the disaster of the 19th, to which I would respectfully
      refer the brigadier-general commanding the division. </p>
    <p> I also forward, as a part of my report, the several reports of the regimental commanders of
      the brigade, and would refer the commanding general to rheum for many of the details that I
      have necessarily omitted. </p>
    <p> A recapitulation of the losses are appended to this report.* I should not omit to state that
      a rebel flag belonging to a North Carolina regiment was captured on the afternoon of the 19th
      by Private Solomon J. Hottenstine, of Company C, One hundred and seventh Regiment Pennsylvania
      Veteran Volunteers, who presented it on the field to Brig.-Gen. Crawford, commanding the
      division. </p>
    <p> In closing this imperfect report of the operations of the brigade, I would express my
      extreme regret at the loss of so many brave veteran officers and men. They are a great loss to
      this gallant corps and army, and to the good cause of our country. This is especially so at
      the present crisis of the contest. In their capture, however we may deplore it, it is
      gratifying to be assured that no dishonor or blame can attach to them. They battled bravely
      and successfully with the foe in their front. That the enemy was allowed to approach their
      rear from a distant part of the line cannot, and I am glad to know is not, chargeable to them.
      They have truly for a time lost their liberty and the privilege of continuing to battle for
      the righteous cause of the Government, but they have not sullied their fair fame, won and
      maintained on may battle-fields; they still retain a soldier's patriotism, integrity, and
      honor. </p>
    <p> I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p>
    <p> T. F. McCOY, <br/>Col., Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
