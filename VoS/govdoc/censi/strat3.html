<h3>Strategies for Using the Aggregated Census Data:</h3></center>

<h2>Rates of Increase</h2></center>
<p>Oftentimes we want to know if a characteristic of the population
has changed over time, and at what rate. For example, how fast, if
at all, was the free black population in Augusta County growing
between 1850 and 1860? How did this compare to the rate of increase
for the free black population in Franklin County?</p>
<p>The formula to calculate a rate of increase for any given
variable between year 1 and year 2 is:</p>
<br />
<center>((year 2 - year 1)/year 1)</center>
<br />
<p>Note that if the value for year 2 is less than the value for
year 1, the rate of increase will be negative (and can properly be
termed a rate of decrease). Rates of increase can be transformed
into <b>percentage rates of increase</b> by simply multiplying by
100.</p>
<p>To follow through with our example, according to the U.S.
censuses, the free black population of Augusta County increased
from 574 in 1850 to 586 in 1860. Subtracting the 1860 value from
the 1850 figure results in a positive increase of 12 free blacks.
Dividing this difference by 574 (the free black population in year
1) yields a rate of increase of .02. Multiplying this rate by 100
to form a percentage, we can say that the number of free blacks in
Augusta County increased two percent between 1850 and 1860. Because
rates of increase standardize for population size, we can compare
this figure to rates computed for Franklin county, different states
or regions, or the U.S. as a whole. The comparable rate of increase
for Franklin County, for example, was -.076. This indicates that
the free black population in Franklin County actually
<u>declined</u> 7.6 percent between 1850 and 1860.</p>
