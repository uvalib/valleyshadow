<p>Drawing on national election returns and data found in the
decennial federal census, these maps set Augusta and Franklin Counties
in the context of their respective states, the Mid-Atlantic
region, and the North and the South.  They also allow for direct comparisons between the two
counties.  The maps are based on a broad range of demographic and
economic characteristics, including population size, racial
composition of the population, religious affiliation,
agricultural output, and manufacturing production.  Each map is
unique, displaying the results for one variable.  Asterisks mark
Augusta and Franklin Counties, and each map is divided into five
roughly equal parts, or quintiles,
indicated by color.  The map key shows the cutoff points for the
different colors used on the map.  The distribution of the variables on each 
map is based only on
data for the area mapped and not for the nation as a whole.  In other words,
maps of the Mid-Atlantic region are based on data for the Mid-Atlantic
region only (Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland), and maps of the
North and the South are based solely on data for those regions of the
country.</p>

<p>These comparative maps are based on maps generated by the <a
href="http://terrapin.umd.edu/asdg/gahm/gahm.html"> Great
American History Machine</a>, developed by Professor David W. Miller of
Carnegie Mellon University.  Currently, the Great American History
Machine is maintained by the <a href="http://terrapin.umd.edu">
Academic Software Development Group</a> at
the University of Maryland at College Park, under the direction of Dr.
Chad K. McDaniel.  The Great American History Machine, which permits
the interactive mapping of an enormous array of county-level data from
1790 to the present, is now available on CD-ROM from the University of
Maryland at College Park.</p>
