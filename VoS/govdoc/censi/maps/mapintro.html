    <h1>Map Grid Discussion</h1>
  </center>

  <p>Families in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, and Augusta County, Virginia, considered a variety of factors in establishing their homesteads, including proximity of churches, availability of natural resources, concentration of like ethnicities, and kinship ties with their neighbors. Eight of the fifteen Snively families living in Franklin County in 1860, for example, lived in the eastern half of Antrim Township, in some cases on adjoining farms. Linking entries from county maps or city tax lists to demographic information in the federal census of 1860 offers one way to explore the relationships between these individuals and their community. Although chronological and methodological difficulties render an exact correspondence between maps and census data impossible, the connections that can be made provide a startlingly detailed portrayal of life in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

  <p>Chronological gaps between the publication dates of each map and the 1860 census explain, in part, why many names from the maps could not be linked with census records. The two-year gap between Riley and Hoffman's Franklin County map of 1858 and the census prevents a complete overlap between the two sources, but overall they are highly compatible. The gap appears more considerable in Augusta County, with Jedediah Hotchkiss's 1870 map post-dating the census by ten years. Because Hotchkiss based the 1870 map on several earlier maps and gathered much of the data prior to 1870, however, the 1870 map still serves as a reliable source for identifying the residents of Augusta County in 1860. Moreover, the large number of links that exist between the 1870 map and the 1860 census attests to the compatibility of these sources.</p>

  <p>Maps from the two counties indicate the locations and names of each household within each county. Additional names drawn from city tax lists in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and Staunton, Virginia, supplement the names found on the maps. These names, when linked with population, agriculture, and, for Augusta, slaveholders censuses of 1860, form four databases: Franklin County, Augusta County, Chambersburg, and Staunton.</p>

  <p>By clicking on a name on either map, users retrieve a record from the databases and thus have a gateway for the available information for that name. For example, by clicking on "Jas. Bridge," who lived west of Humpback Mountain in the southernmost part of Augusta County, users call up the following record (we have numbered the fields for your convenience):</p>

  <center>
    <table cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <th>Field 1</th>

        <th>Field 2</th>

        <th>Field 3</th>

        <th>Field 4</th>

        <th>Field 5</th>

        <th>Field 6</th>

        <th>Field 7</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Bridge:</td>

        <td>Ja[me]s:</td>

        <td>54:</td>

        <td>E6:</td>

        <td>580/737:</td>

        <td>307/18:</td>

        <td>N:</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>

  <p>Field 5 contains links to the population census; field 6, to the agriculture census; field 7, to the slaveholders census. The <a href="../censi/CEN1.html">discussion of the federal census</a> explains what the numbers in these fields mean. By going to the indicated record in the appropriate census, users retrieve demographic information about James Bridge. Fields 3 and 4 contain grid and plot numbers which allow users to reverse their search, going from the population database to a precise location on a county map. In the case of James Bridge, a user would go to Augusta map 54 and trace the plot number E-6 to find Bridge's place of residence.</p>

  <p><b>Points to remember:</b></p>

  <p>1. Multiple layers of transcriptions, from the census taker or mapmaker to present-day researchers, have created numerous spelling and clerical errors in the databases. The links provided, therefore, should be considered the <b>best possible links</b> rather than <b>the irrefutably correct links</b>. Users should try variant spellings when looking for even the most common names; Johnsons often appear as Johnstons, and Coiners could be Koiners. Brackets contain clarifying or supplemental information or, when accompanied by question marks, uncertain but possible information.</p>

  <p>2. "N" means that no link was possible with the available information. In many cases, links could be made with the population census but, because the individual was not a farmer or did not own slaves, not with the other censuses. In other cases, no link could be made whatsoever. Anything from transcription errors to migration or death of the individual could result in an "N" link.</p>

  <p>The agriculture and slave censuses are subsets of the population census. Nevertheless, users will in rare cases find "N/N" for the population census link, indicating no link was possible, but then find a link for the agriculture and/or slave census. Various distortions could account for this discrepancy. Users should be aware, however, that any entry in the agriculture and slave censuses should also appear in the population census.</p>

  <p>3. "M" means that multiple links were possible, with no clear indication as to which link was best. Users should search the census records to see the possible links. In some cases, a name has "M/M" for links with one or more of the censuses, and has a specific link with another census. For example, the record "Cullen:W.:M/M:285/20[William F.]:369[William F.]:" indicates that more than one "W. Cullen" lived in Augusta County, as the population census indicates, but only one "W. Cullen [William F.]" appeared in the agriculture and slaveholders censuses. The links to the agriculture and slaveholders censuses, therefore, are the only possible links but may not be correct. In other words, whichever "W. Cullen" is the correct one from the population census may not be the one who owns agricultural land or slaves.</p>

  <p>4. In most cases, names associated with businesses (for example, "Snively's Store") were not linked with census records. No attempts were made to link "Heirs of" entries on the maps with census records (for example, "Snively, Heirs of").</p>

  <p>5. Names on the maps were taken to be heads of households. Unless the maps indicated that a particular name was that of a woman (by including "Miss" or "Mrs."), the name was taken to be that of a male.</p>

  <p>6. Separate lists exist for the cities of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and Staunton, Virginia. Some of the names on these lists came from the county maps, but most came from city tax lists. The tax list for Staunton contains only those people who owned real estate and thus includes only the wealthier residents of the city. Information from personal property tax lists for Staunton is currently unavailable. In contrast, the tax list for Chambersburg includes both those people who owned real estate and those who owned only other personal property, such as watches or horses. Therefore, the city list for Chambersburg is more comprehensive than the one for Staunton, and users should be cautious when comparing wealth between residents of the two cities.</p>

  <p>7. The databases for the counties and cities include names that appear on one of the maps and/or city tax lists. The databases do not contain the names of every person living in each county. Therefore, when users are unable to locate a certain name in the database, they should go directly to the census database and search there.</p>

  <p>8. The page numbers from the population census correspond with particular areas in each county. In Franklin County, the page numbers correspond with areas delineated on the 1858 map. Therefore, page numbers indicate what district or village a certain person lived in. In Augusta County, however, the page numbers are less helpful. They correspond to distinct geographic areas, but those areas are not delineated on the 1870 map. Therefore, the numbers do not offer the same kind of clear information for Augusta that they do for Franklin. <a href="map2.html">The attached chart indicates the page numbers from the population census and the areas to which they correspond.</a></p>
