          <p>Drawing on national election returns and data found in the decennial federal census, these maps set Augusta and Franklin Counties in the context of their respective states, the Mid-Atlantic region, and the North and the South. They also allow for direct comparisons between the two counties. The maps are based on a broad range of demographic and economic characteristics, including population size, racial composition of the population, religious affiliation, agricultural output, and manufacturing production. Each map is unique, displaying the results for one variable. Asterisks mark Augusta and Franklin Counties, and each map is divided into five roughly equal parts, or quintiles, indicated by color. The map key shows the cutoff points for the different colors used on the map. The distribution of the variables on each map is based only on data for the area mapped and not for the nation as a whole. In other words, maps of the Mid-Atlantic region are based on data for the Mid-Atlantic region only (Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland), and maps of the North and the South are based solely on data for those regions of the country.</p>

          <p>These comparative maps are based on maps generated by the <!-- a
href="http://terrapin.umd.edu/asdg/gahm/gahm.html" --> Great American History Machine, developed by Professor David W. Miller of Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, the Great American History Machine is maintained by the <!-- a href="http://terrapin.umd.edu" -->
           Academic Software Development Group at the University of Maryland at College Park, under the direction of Dr. Chad K. McDaniel. The Great American History Machine, which permits the interactive mapping of an enormous array of county-level data from 1790 to the present, is now available on CD-ROM from the University of Maryland at College Park.</p>
