<p>In addition to collecting data on agricultural production, slave
ownership, and characteristics of the population, census-takers
also recorded information on industrial production in the United
States. This data appears in the manuscript schedule of the census
of the products of industry--more commonly called the manufacturing
census. Each page of the manuscript manufacturing census contains
fourteen fields of data for twenty separate industrial
establishments, defined not only as enterprises which manufacture a
product, but as businesses engaged in mining, fishing, or
commercial trading. The data census-takers collected provided
detailed information regarding all phases of industrial
production--from the raw materials these businesses consumed, to
the amount of labor they utilized, to the finished goods they
produced. You will find searching the manufacturing census helpful
for discovering information about specific industrial producers as
well as for examining trends in industrial production in both
Augusta and Franklin counties. Those users interested in comparing
and contrasting the industrial might of these counties should
consult the aggregate data presented in the
<a href="../statistics/cen.stats.html">
Statistical Tables Compiled from Census Records</a>.</p>
<h2><font color="#990000">History of the Manufacturing
Census</font></h2>
<p>The first census of industrial production in the United States
was undertaken in 1810 and was inextricably linked to the nation's
growing entanglement in the Napoleonic Wars. In an effort to reduce
the country's dependence on the importation of manufactured goods
and thereby ensure the country's economic prosperity during
international trade (and shooting) wars, national political leaders
called for increased industrial production at home. With more
manufactured goods produced in the United States, the country would
no longer need to export agricultural products to European nations
in order to purchase needed industrial items and, thus could avoid
conflicts over trade like the brewing crisis with England. The
purpose of the manufacturing census was to provide data on the
state of industrial production in the United States and to answer
such basic questions as what items were produced domestically and
how many people labored in manufacturing establishments.
Ultimately, the census was designed to "show the practical
foundation, actual progress, condition, and establishment of the
American arts and manufactures, and their connection with the
wealth and strength of the United States." The census would also
provide data which would allow for comparisons between the value of
domestic manufactures, external manufactures, and foreign trade.
This first manufacturing census was relatively brief, only
inquiring into the kind, quantity, and value of goods produced. But
despite its brevity, the census was widely considered to be
inaccurate and fraught with errors. For instance, data from
numerous cities and counties went uncollected, and no clear
criteria existed for deciding whether an item produced in the home
should be recorded in the manufacturing census or in the Home
Manufacturing field of the agricultural census.</p>
<p>The manufacturing census was undertaken again in 1820 and again
was fraught with errors. As a result, the manufacturing census was
dropped from the 1830 and 1840 collections, though enumerators did
collect a small amount of information on manufacturing
establishments in 1840 as part of the "Schedule of Mines,
Agriculture, Commerce, Manufactures, etc." In 1850 census officials
revived the manufacturing census as a separate schedule and
increased to fourteen the number of fields in which enumerators
would record data. The 1850 manufacturing census, however, proved
to be just as flawed as the earlier attempts at data collection. In
fact, this was such a problematic document that it was not
published until 1859. Census officials did believe, though, that
they had devised an effective and informative schedule for
collecting information on manufacturing establishments. As a
result, both the 1860 and 1870 censuses utilized the same
fourteen-field form as the 1850 census.</p>

<h2><font color="#990000">Explanation of Fields</font></h2>
<p><a name="page" id="page"><b>Census Page Number and Location:</b>
The census page number refers to the page of the manuscript census
on which a particular record can be found (each page can list up to
twenty records). In the location box on the census schedule
enumerators noted the district (for Augusta) or the township (for
Franklin) in which the manufacturing establishment was
situated.</a></p>
<p><a name="company" id="company"><b>Name of Company or Last Name
of Individual:</b> Enumerators recorded the name of the company,
corporation, or individual(s) who owned the business. This is the
most important field in the manufacturing census because all of the
other data fields for each record contain information about the
establishment identified in this field. Enumerators typically
entered the name of an individual in this field, though
occasionally the manuscript form lists the names of firms,
companies, or corporations. When searching this field, enter the
entire name of the business or company desired. For instance,
searching on H. S. Gallaher &amp; Son will return a results page on
this business. However, when searching for an individual, enter
only their last name in this field. For example, to find
information on the business owned by Samuel Bare of Augusta County,
entering his surname will return a results page with information on
his mill. If the first name of the individual is known, enter it in
the First Name field. To begin a search for individuals or
companies in the manuscript manufacturing census, click on the box
for this field, enter the name you want to find, and then click the
Initiate Search button. The search engine will return a results
page with information about the manufacturing establishment
searched on. Names of businesses or individuals followed by an
asterisk (*) indicate that the name is not legible on the census
form. For a more detailed explanation of this symbol, see
"Important Notations" below.</a></p>
<p><a name="first" id="first"><b>First Name:</b> Use this field to
enter the first name of individual business owners. To search on
company names, enter the full company name in the Name of Company
or Last Name of Individual field.</a></p>
<p><a name="business" id="business"><b>Name of Business,
Manufacture, or Product:</b> This field more accurately refers to
the <i>type</i> of business, such as blacksmith or mill, or the
<i>type</i> of product manufactured, such as wagons. In an effort
to clarify an issue which had caused problems in earlier
manufacturing censuses, enumerators were instructed not to include
on this list household manufactures in which annual production
failed to surpass $500. Instead, these items of household
manufacturing were to be included in the agricultural census.
Enumerators, however, were to collect information on commercial
establishments which engaged in the trading or selling, rather than
the producing, of manufactured goods. To search in this field,
enter the name of a business, manufacture, or product, and click on
the Initiate Search button. A</a> <a href="biz.html">list of common
businesses, manufactures, and products</a> will help users refine
their searches.</p>
<p><a name="capital" id="capital"><b>Capital Invested, in Real and
Personal Estate, in the Business:</b> This field refers to the
amount of money invested in a manufacturing establishment. To
calculate 2002 dollars, multiply 1860 dollars by 19.89
<!--  and 1870 dollars by 14.13 -->; for further information on
this conversion, see</a>
<a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm">http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm</a>.
This figure includes both the value of the land on which the
business is situated and the value of personal wealth invested in
the business. Personal estate is defined as all non-land property,
such as implements, tools, machinery, and even slaves. To search on
this field, enter the desired value in the Capital Invested field,
click on the symbol to indicate "greater than," "less than," or
"equal to," and then click the Initiate Search button at the bottom
of the page.</p>
<p><a name="raw" id="raw"><b>Quantities, Kinds, and Values of Raw
Materials:</b> An important aspect of the survey of manufacturing
establishments was inquiries into the raw materials consumed in the
manufacturing process. Although many establishments utilized
several different raw materials, the manuscript schedule did not
provide enough space for recording this data. As a result,
enumerators were forced to squeeze this information into a small
space on the manuscript schedule. Quantities of raw materials
refers to the amount of raw materials used or consumed during
production, expressed in the proper measurement for each item. For
instance, wheat was measured in bushels and coal was measured in
tons. Kinds of raw materials refers to the type of raw materials
used, including fuel. Because of space restrictions, enumerators
frequently grouped several minor types of raw materials into the
category "miscellaneous" or "other articles." A list of</a>
<a href="biz.html">common raw materials</a> is provided to guide
users in their search of this field. In the Value of Raw Materials
field, census-takers recorded the value for the quantity of each
item specified in the previous two columns. For raw materials
designated "other articles" or "miscellaneous," enumerators
recorded the aggregate value of these items.</p>
<p><a name="power" id="power"><b>Kind of Motive Power, Machinery,
Structure, or Resource:</b> This field actually offers data for
three but different types of questions, all of which focus on the
sources of power in the establishment. First, it contains
information on the source of motive of power--what makes the
machines work, and the factory run? Common sources of power include
steam, water, horses, buhrstones (millstones) and hands (meaning
people). Second, this field indicates the quantities and kinds of
machines used, such as looms, presses, and mills. Third, this field
offers information on the kinds of structures or resources of
power, such as furnaces, and the number of fires, quarries, and
mines. To search on this field, enter the item you want to find in
the appropriate box on the search form and click the Initiate
Search button.</a></p>
<p><a name="hands" id="hands"><b>Average Number of Male and Female
Hands:</b> Census-takers collected data on labor in industrial
establishments as part of the manufacturing census. Most of these
businesses employed either all men or all women; few were the
establishments employing members of both sexes. Likewise, the vast
majority of businesses offered work only for men; few women found
work in manufacturing businesses.</a> To search on this field,
enter the number of employees you want to find (by gender), select
either "greater than," "less than," or "equal to," and click on the
Initiate Search button.</p>
<p><a name="wage" id="wage"><b>Average Male or Female Monthly
Wage:</b> These fields supplement the fields on number of employees
by offering data on average monthly wages for all the labor of all
the workers. With data from these two fields, users can calculate
the average earnings for individual laborers. To calculate 2002
dollars, multiply 1860 dollars by 19.89
<!--  and 1870 dollars by 14.13 -->; for further information on
this conversion, see</a>
<a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm">http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm</a>.</p>
<p><a name="products" id="products"><b>Quantities, Kinds, and
Values of Annual Products:</b> The last three fields on the
manuscript schedule relate to the final goods produced by
manufacturing establishments. Given the importance of this field
and the potential for confusion as to precisely which goods were
produced by an establishment, the census-takers' instructions
warned that "it will require great care to fill this column
properly." The chief difficulty in recording this data was
determining which items were produced on the premises.
Additionally, enumerators were instructed to record the value of
the product at the point of manufacture and not its final market
value. In other words, transportation and other related expenses
were not to be reflected in the value the enumerators recorded. As
in the corresponding raw materials field, quantities of annual
products were expressed in the proper measurement for the items
produced--bushels, tons, barrels, etc. For establishments which
produced multiple items, enumerators recorded only the names of the
four most important products, grouping the rest together as "other
articles." Finally, the value of annual products produced was found
by multiplying the value of each item by the quantity manufactured.
A</a> <a href="biz.html">list of common products</a> will help
users refine their searches.</p>
<p><a name="notations" id="notations"><b>Important Notations:</b>
An asterisk (*) at the end of a last name, first name, or business
name indicates an illegible name on the manuscript census form. If
"i?" appears in a field on the results page, this indicates an
illegible entry on the manuscript census form.</a></p>
<h2><font color="#990000">Helpful Hints</font></h2>
<p>Here are some helpful hints for searching the manuscript
population census:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching the manufacturing census will be particularly useful
to users when done in conjunction with searches of the
<a href="/ag_census">agricultural
census</a>,
<a href="/population_census">population
census</a>, and
<a href="/slave_census">slaveowner
census</a>. Such searches will reveal demographic, family, farm,
and slaveowning data for particular manufacturers. For example,
after learning from the manufacturing census that Peter Brough
owned a flour mill in Franklin County's Guilford Township, one can
search the agricultural census to learn about his farm
holdings.</li>
