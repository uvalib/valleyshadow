<p>	In innumerable ways, small and large, Augusta's free blacks
were reminded of their anomalous status within a slave society.  One
such reminder was a law mandating their registration at the
courthouse.  Passed by the state legislature in January 1803, in
response to the 1800 Gabriel Prosser slave rebellion in Richmond, the
law was designed to "more effectually restrain the practice of negroes
going at large."  Three years later, the state passed a
law that even further emphasized free blacks' tenuous position in
Virginia.  This second law, also designed to control the free black
population, required that all freed slaves leave the state within
twelve months of their emancipation.  It was later modified to allow
local courts to grant individuals permission to remain, sometimes
indefinitely, sometimes only for a period of months or years.
Free-born blacks, however, were exempt from this second law.

</p><p>	According to the registration law, county clerks were required
to record a free black's age, name, color (a subjective decision), any
visible birthmarks or scars, whether they had been born free or the
court in which they had been emancipated.  Unlike the census, however,
the burden was on the free black to choose to register, as well as to pay
the twenty-five cent registration fee.

</p><p>	We have been given permission to
reproduce Katherine Bushman's transcription of the Augusta County and
Staunton City Registers of Free Negroes.  The registers are a
valuable, if problematic, source.  Valuable, because they contain a
total of 706 registrations (523 in the county and 193 in Staunton),
providing us with the <a href="samples.html">names, ages, physical 
descriptions, names of
emancipators, and family connections</a> of people who left few or no
other written records.
The first recorded registration is dated <a
href="fblack.early.html#first">20 July 1810</a>, the last on <a
href="fblack.late.html#last">7
November 1864</a>.  Problematic, because the majority of free blacks chose not
to register.  Of the 586 free blacks
recorded in the 1860 census, probably fewer than one-third ever
registered.  Clearly, then, these laws were enforced selectively, if
at all.  <a href="vena.html">The Vena family of Augusta County 
provides a good example of
the challenge of using these sources</a>.

</p><p>	Yet other free blacks registered more than once. Robert
Campbell, a wealthy mulatto barber registered numerous times over the
years.  Through the registry, in fact, we can <a href="campbells.html">trace 
changes in his family</a>: two wives, several children, and the 
occasional apprentice.
Campbell may have availed himself of the registry in an effort to
protect his <a href="campbellcen.html">considerable wealth and
property.</a> By reaffirming his and his
family's legal standing in the community, he achieved a measure of
security in a time and place with few assurances for free blacks.

</p><p>	In addition to having their registration noted at the courthouse, 
free blacks could also receive a copy of their registration
This was generally noted in their record, with the phrase "Copy
Delvd."  This copy afforded them a measure of safety when traveling outside of
the county, in areas where they would be unknown to local whites.   
Similarly, many registrants were <a href="otherco.html">either born free or
emancipated in another county</a>.  Registering in Augusta proclaimed
their status as legitimate free men or women in their new
home.  Parents might register their children, keeping them
free from unscrupulous whites who might try to enslave them.
Frequently, too, a free black would update his or her registration if 
scarred by illness or accident. </p></td></tr></table></center>
