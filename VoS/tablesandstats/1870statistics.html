      <blockquote>
        These tables show the 1870 general population breakdowns for Augusta and Franklin in terms of race, age, and gender.

      <h3><a href="1870agriculture.html">Agriculture in the Counties, 1870</a></h3>

      <blockquote>
        In 1870, Augusta and Franklin had similar numbers of farms, and similar proportions of improved and unimproved farm acreage. While farms in Augusta tended to be much larger than those in Franklin, the value of land, farms, and farm products in Franklin were consistently around twice as much as those in Augusta.
      </blockquote>

      <h3><a href="1870churches.html">Churches: Denominations and Property, 1870</a></h3>

      <blockquote>
        Church life was prominent in both counties in 1870. Because of higher land values in Pennsylvania than in Virginia, Franklin churches held more valuable property than those in Augusta. Both were dominated by protestant christian sects, with Methodist congregations being most prevalent in Augusta and Reformed German in Franklin.

      <h3><a href="1870education.html">Education and Literacy Rates, 1870</a></h3>

      <blockquote>
        School attendance in 1870 was much higher in Franklin than in Augusta among whites and blacks, although few African-Americans attended school in either county. African-Americans also made up the majority of illiterate people in both counties, although it was a lower percentage of the population in Franklin.

      <h3><a href="1870manufacturing.html">Manufacturing in the Counties, 1870</a></h3>

      <blockquote>
        Franklin had roughly twice the number of manufacturing facilities in 1870 as did Augusta. Franklin also invested capital more heavily in manufacturing, producing nearly three times as many products as Augusta.

      <h3><a href="1870tax_property.html">Property Values, Taxation, and Public Debt, 1870</a></h3>

      <blockquote>
        This table shows the relative property values, taxation, and public debt in each county. Taxation was heavier at the state level for people in Augusta, while people in Franklin were taxed most heavily at the town and county levels. Town public debt was higher in Augusta, while county public debt was higher in Franklin.
