He planned to pursue it through traditional means of research until he became involved in the creation of the Institute of Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia, when it became clear that hypermedia offered new possibilities for doing local studies. He is the Director of the Valley of the Shadow Project and author of a book based on the Valley Project, <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies: War in the Heart of America, 1859-1863</i> published in 2003 by W.

              <h3>Background</h3>

              <p>In 1991, the University of Virginia's campus-wide Information Technology Committee generated the idea of the <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities</a>, a place where technologists and humanists would collaborate on cutting-edge research projects. The International Business Machines Company (IBM) generously donated equipment and technical support. John Unsworth was named director in 1993.</p>

              <p>Chosen as one of the two "prototype fellows" for the Institute in its initial year of 1992-1993, Edward Ayers of Virginia's History Department received the half-time support of systems analyst Ross Wayland, an RS6000 workstation, and the financial support necessary for the digitization of the newspaper and census images, performed by Accessible Archives of Philadelphia.</p>

              <p>In the summer of 1994, the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace received a grant from the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities to install a sample of the project in Staunton. The staff of the Birthplace, led by its director, Susan Klaffky, and its research director at the time, Susan Simmons, conducted extensive outreach programs to bring the Augusta County community into the project. The project received generous support from the Valentine Museum, which helped accelerate the research in the late summer and early fall of 1994. Pat Hobbs of the Wilson Birthplace worked with the Historic Staunton Foundation and the Augusta County Historical Society to provide valuable primary resources.</p>

              <p>Over the years we have been sustained by the generous contributions of several institutions. The University of Virginia has provided generous support for the project. W. W. Norton and Company agreed to publish a version of the Valley Project in CD-ROM form in 1996. In the fall of 1996, the Valley Project received a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities' Teaching with Technology Initiative, providing crucial support to the project.</p>

              <p>We are very grateful for the support we have received, without which the <u>Valley of the Shadow</u> Project would not be possible.</p><br />
