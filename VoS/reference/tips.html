                        <h3>Tips for Searching with the Wildcard Characters (* and ?)</h3>
                        <p>There are two available wildcard characters: the question mark, '?', can be used to match on a <i>single character</i>, and the asterisk, '*', can be used to match on <i>one or more</i> characters., Either can be used in searches where you are unsure of the correct spelling of a name, occupation, or location, but they cannot be at the front of a search term.  These wildcards are
                            available for use in all text fields.</p>
                        <p><b>Example of using the wildcard at the end of a word:</b> If you were
                            unsure whether a last name was spelled 'Waddell' or 'Waddel' you could enter
                            the search <pre>wadde?</pre> into the Last Name field, and entries for both names
                            would be returned.</p>
                        <p><b>Example of using the one-or-more wildcard in the middle of a word:</b> If you were
                            unsure whether a woman's first name was Biddy or Betsy, you could enter
                            <pre>b*y</pre> into the search box for First Name. This search would return records
                            for anyone with the first name 'Biddy' or 'Betsy' as well as 'Betty', 'Barney',
                            or 'Bobby'.</p>
                        <p>Using the wildcard in the middle of a word can also help if you are
                            unsure whether a given letter in a name is single or double. For
                            example, the search <pre>rei*y</pre> would return entries containing both 'Reily'
                            and 'Reilly'. This type of search can also help if you are unsure of a
                            vowel in a word. For example, the search jens%n would return records
                            containing the names Jensan, Jensen, and Jenson.</p>
                        <h3>Tips for Searching Numeric Fields</h3>
                        <p>When searching numeric fields, 4 options are available. You can search
                            using &gt;, =, &lt;, and &lt;&gt;. The &lt;&gt;
                            option allows you search for values that are NOT the term you indicate.
                            For example, in the Slave Owner's Census, a search of
                            Total Number of Slaves &lt;&gt; 10 would return all slave
                            owners who owned did not own exactly 10 slaves.</p>
                        <h3>Tips for Searching Text Fields</h3>
                        <p>All text fields are case-insensitive. Therefore, a search of Last Name:
                            Smith would return the same results as Last Name: smith.</p>
			<p>Complex search queries may not return any results: try starting with a simple query and return to the search page and refine your search by adding more query terms and/or ranges.</p>
