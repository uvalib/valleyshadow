            The Valley of the Shadow timelines have been compiled out of the Valley newspapers and allow you to compare events and developments within each county throughout the Civil War era. Broken down by year, each timeline compares events in Augusta County, Virginia, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania, as well as developments in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and on the national scene. Some of the county events have been linked back to the full newspaper accounts, and the original articles on each county event may be found in the <a href="../../newspapers/opening.html">Valley newspapers</a>. For brevity, abbreviations were used whenever possible, particularly when events referenced states or military ranks. When searching for articles in the Valley newspapers, remember that events were often reported many days, and sometimes weeks, after they occurred.
