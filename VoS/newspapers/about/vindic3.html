          <p><b>Columns 1-3:</b> These columns were usually some combination of advertisements and local announcements. Lists of candidates for local offices, marriage and death notices, meetings of local militia units, resolutions of the town council, and other local information appeared here, and were almost always shared by the <i>Vindicator</i> and the <i>Spectator</i>. Curiously, among the advertisements appearing in these first few columns were announcements of out-of-state lotteries. Column 2 of the February 3 edition, for example, carried ads for the Delaware and Georgia lotteries. Such items never appeared in the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

          <p><b>Columns 4-7:</b> Here, advertisements appeared, but not in any particular order. The local appeared alongside the ads from New York, the ads for hotels alongside those for insurance companies and grocers, the commercial alongside the announcements of legally mandated public auctions and chancery court decisions. Every ad appearing on page 3, apparently, was "Miscellaneous."</p>
