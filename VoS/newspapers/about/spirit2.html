  </center><b>Columns 1-2:</b> As on page 1, this space was usually occupied by a <a href="poetry.html">poem</a>. Sometimes a number of poems appeared here, and while the verse usually just filled most of column 1, a long poem might extend into the next column. When the verse ended in column 1, it was usually followed by the beginning of a piece of short fiction or some other item of a literary nature. Nearly always, this item was lengthy, extending into column 2 or beyond. The February 1 selection, a short story entitled "The Stratagem" and excerpted from the <i>Welcome Guest</i>, was unusually long, beginning in column 1 and reaching into column 5.

  <p><b>Columns 3-5:</b> This space was usually filled with items taken from other newspapers, and tended to be selected in an effort to give a feel for the atmosphere of another place--through travel accounts or descriptions of unusual or "thrilling" incidents, often delivered in the form of a story. These items were not unlike those selected to appear on page 1, though they tended to be longer. <img align="right" alt="Marriage" hspace="15" src="marry.jpg" vspace="15" /> Other articles appearing in these columns dealt with morality and etiquette, and were not necessarily lengthy, such as the piece to the right discussing the proper marriage age for a woman.</p><b>Column 6:</b> When not an extension of the types of material appearing in columns 3-5, column 6 often carried more poetry. This was especially true for the top half of the column.<br clear="all" />
