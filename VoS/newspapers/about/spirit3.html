        <p>Though columns 1 or 2 could carry stories or poetry like those appearing on page 2, page
            3 usually comprised advertisements. Unlike the <i>Spectator</i>, however, which divided
            its ad space broadly by location of the advertiser (local, Richmond, Baltimore, other),
            the <i>Valley Spirit</i> separated advertisers by the type of product or service they
            offered. On February 1, 1860, for example, the <i>Valley Spirit</i> divided its ad space
            into <a href="adcats.html">six separate categories.</a> These categories, while
            incorporating most ads on a page, did not fit them all, <img align="left" alt="Lumber Ad"
                hspace="15" src="lumber.jpg" vspace="15"/>
            <br clear="all"/> and, especially toward the foot of a column, miscellaneous ads appear.
            For example, in column 3 of the February 1 issue, eight inserts for hotels follow the
            heading for "Hotels," but the column also carried ads for a house painter, a furniture
            manufacturer, a lumberyard, and a pharmacy, among others.</p>
