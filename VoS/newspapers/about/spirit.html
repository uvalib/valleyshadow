<p> What would become the Chambersburg <i>Valley Spirit</i> began
publishing in 1831 as the Franklin <i>Telegraph.</i>  The <i>Telegraph</i> 
became the Chambersburg <i>Times</i> in 1841, and changed its name to the 
Cumberland <i>Valley Sentinel</i> in 1848.  In 1851, John M. Cooper and 
Peter Dechert moved their newspaper, the Shippensburg <i>Valley 
Spirit,</i> to Chambersburg from Shippensburg.  In 1852, the <i>Valley 
Sentinel</i> and the Shippensburg <i>Valley Spirit</i> merged to form the 
Chambersburg <i>Valley Spirit.</i>  In 1857,
Cooper and Dechert sold the paper to George H. Mengel and Co., and in
1860 Mengel was joined in partnership by John Ripper.  In 1862,
H. C. Keyser and B. Y. Hamsher purchased the <i>Valley Spirit.</i> Keyser 
and Hamsher then merged the <i>Valley Spirit</i> with the Chambersburg 
<i>Times</i> (this was a new incarnation of the <i>Times,</i> founded in 
1858.  It bears no relation to the <i>Times</i> of the 1840s.) and briefly
changed the name of their paper to the <i>Spirit and Times</i> before 
returning to the
moniker <i>Valley Spirit</i> in 1863.  John M. Cooper and Co. repurchased the
<i>Valley Spirit</i> in 1867.  Throughout the 1850s, the <i>Valley 
Spirit</i> was edited by Dr. William H. Boyle, a county doctor prominent 
in community affairs until his death in 1877.</p>
<p>Democratic in its politics, the <i>Valley Spirit</i> was published on
Wednesdays.  Normally, the paper consisted of eight pages, each six
columns across.  Like the <i>Staunton Spectator,</i> the <i>Valley 
Spirit</i> was sold only by subscription, for an annual rate of $1.75, 
and as in the <i>Spectator,</i> advertisements were sold to appear in a 
minimum of three issues, with significant discounts given for long-term 
(more than three months) appearances and large-sized ads.  The <i>Valley 
Spirit</i> also specified that additional charges were levied for "extra
display"--a graphic or unusual typeface--in an advertisement.
The <i>Valley Spirit</i> publishers also took it upon themselves to judge the
value of an advertisement to the community, stating that
"communications on subjects of limited or individual interest will
be charged 8 cents per line."</p></td></tr>
