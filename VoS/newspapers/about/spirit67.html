        <p>Page 6 was almost always filled with advertising, though news might fill column 1. As
            throughout the <i>Valley Spirit</i>, ads were placed by category rather than place of
            origin, though columns of miscellaneous ads did appear. On February 1, while <b>columns
                5-6</b> were "miscellaneous" ads--for sewing machine companies in New York and
            Baltimore, a steamboat service headquartered in Pittsburgh, a furrier in Philadelphia,
            and others--ads also appeared in <b>columns 2-4</b> under the categories "Saddlery,
            &amp;amp;c.," "Hardware," "Watches and Jewelry," and "Agricultural."<br clear="all"
            /></p>

        <p>Page 7 followed the same format as page 6. On February 1, page 7 carried <a
                href="localad.html">ads</a> under a number of headings, including "Professional
            Cards" (these were small inserts, mostly for local lawyers and doctors), "Hats &amp;
            Caps," "Drugs, &amp;c.," "Musical," "Ready-Made Clothing," "Stoves, Tinware,
            &amp;c.," and "Medical." </p>
