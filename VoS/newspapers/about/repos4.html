            <p>In the <b>top half of column 1</b>, the <i>Repository and Transcript</i> ran
              information about affairs of the state and national Republican parties. On February 1,
              1860, for example, this space announced the holding of state and national conventions
              to nominate candidates for president. By May, however, this sort of information was
              replaced by the <i>Repository and Transcript</i>'s endorsement of candidates for
              office, led by the Republican Lincoln-Hamlin ticket. Editorials appeared beginning
              with the <b>second half of column 1</b> and extending into <b>column 5</b>. These,
              unsurprisingly, dealt nearly exclusively with national or state politics. On February
              1, for example, editorials berated the South for its political demands in the name of
              getting an "equal share," condemned Southerners for whipping their slaves, and <a
                href="repos4b.html">commended Pennsylvania Representative James Moorhead for his
                reproach of fellow Pennsylvania Congressman William Montgomery</a>. Note, however,
              that in the editorials the <i>Repository</i> diverged significantly from the <i>Valley
                Spirit</i> not only in tone but in content as well. Where the <i>Repository</i>
              concerned itself with broad sectional commentary in its lead editorial of February 1,
              1860, the <i>Valley Spirit</i> instead focused on railroad policy in the state senate.
              Both papers had strong positions on national political affairs, but there was no
              greatly significant lead story that every paper had to comment upon. Even as the
              "sectional conflict" brewed, the newspapers' priorities could lie elsewhere.</p>

            <p>In <b>columns 5-6</b>, the paper ran reports from its "correspondents" (who always
              wrote under pseudonyms) about political events in important locales, such as
              Washington or the state capital of Harrisburg. Sometimes these correspondents traveled
              further afield, as in May, when the <i>Repository and Transcript</i> ran
              correspondence from a reporter in Chicago writing about the National Republican
              Convention.</p>
