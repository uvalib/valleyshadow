        <p><b>Column 1</b>, and sometimes <b>column 2</b>, carried random news items, sometimes
            mixing local, national, international, and human interest stories on a single page. On
            February 1, for example, agricultural advice reprinted from the <i>Country Gentleman</i>
            appeared alongside an item describing battles between United States troops and Native
            Americans in the West.</p>

        <p><b>Columns 3-6</b>, again, were advertisements. Unlike ads appearing on other pages of
            the <i>Valley Spirit</i>, however, information on page 8 clearly appealed especially to
            agricultural, commercial, and legal interests. Market information appeared here (with
            commodity prices from Chambersburg, and usually from Philadelphia and Baltimore as
            well), as did a yearly almanac calendar. The remainder of the columns were generally
            filled with information about banks, land sales (local and regional), court cases, and
            other legal notices, such as estate divisions.<br/></p>
