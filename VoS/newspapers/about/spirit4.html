        <p><b>Column 1:</b> Below the date and name of the publisher, the <i>Valley Spirit</i>
            featured its latest political endorsement. (In February, the paper endorsed the
            candidacy of Jeremiah Black, a member of the Buchanan administration. The paper changed
            its endorsement to Northern Democrat Stephen Douglas after the Democratic convention of
            1860, only to endorse Southern Democrat John Breckinridge less than two months before
            the 1860 presidential election.) The endorsement was followed by the lead editorial.
                <img align="right" alt="Endorsement" hspace="15" src="endorse.jpg" vspace="15"/> As in many
            newspapers of the period, this editorial nearly always dealt with a political issue, but
            it was not necessarily an issue of national significance. The February 1 issue, for
            example, carried a lead editorial criticizing Franklin County's state representatives
            for inadequately standing up for the county's interests in the building of railroads.</p>

        <p><b>Columns 2-4:</b> This space was usually filled with articles describing national
            political affairs: reports from Congress (when in session), activities of prominent
            national politicians, and political happenings in other states and their legislatures.
            The Democratic leanings of the <i>Valley Spirit</i> colored its coverage of political
            news significantly. On February 1, for example, it reported the positive reception of a
            speech by Stephen Douglas on the floor of the Senate, called a number of Whig
            congressional representatives from Pennsylvania "hyprocrites [sic]" for their position
            on the election of the Speaker of the House, and in a number of other articles dealt
            strictly with the politics of the Democratic party at the state and federal level.
            Typical of the <i>Valley Spirit</i>'s attitude toward the Republican party, when
            discussing it at all, was an editorial in columns 3-4 excerpted from a paper called the
                <i>Constitution</i>
            <a href="repbash.html">blasting the Republicans.</a></p>

        <p><b>Columns 5-6:</b> These columns were also filled with items of national interest,
            though they tended to discuss activities of legislative bodies far less than those in
            columns 2-4. More frequently, these articles were similar to the human interest stories
            that appeared on pages 1 and 2. One significant feature of these columns was that the
            print was usually smaller than in columns 1-4. This allowed the publishers of the
                <i>Valley Spirit</i> to cram more information into their paper, but distinguishing
            the type size of columns 5-6 in this fashion also served to draw the reader's attention
            to the editorial and political columns of this page. </p>
