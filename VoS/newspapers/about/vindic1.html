        <p><b>Columns 1-2:</b> Below the <i>Vindicator</i>'s masthead, which announced that it "published every Friday morning, on Main Street, two doors below B. Crawford's Corner," small advertisements appeared. As on page 1, column 1, of the <i>Spectator</i>, these ads were almost entirely from local individuals offering their professional services or announcing that their stores had received new goods for sale. There was some overlap among these ads--one lawyer or grocer might purchase the same ad in both the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Vindicator</i>. Not every advertiser, however, purchased an ad in both papers. This may speak to a lack of funds on the part of an advertiser, or possibly to an advertiser's politics. A staunch Democrat might not wish to give his money to a Whig paper like the <i>Spectator</i>, preferring instead to support the <i>Vindicator</i> exclusively (and perhaps draw more exclusively Democratic customers in turn). Still, although the ads in the <i>Vindicator</i> and <i>Spectator</i> were not precisely identical, it was from the local advertisements generally--with their common names of sponsors, streets, and landmarks--that one could recognize that the papers also shared a population. As we shall see, the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Vindicator</i> rarely were concerned with the same national or international issues, but the advertisements precluded their having entirely divergent content.</p>

        <p>Column 2 carried ads as well, though in 1860 the Baltimore Lock Hospital, founded by a Dr. Johnston (who also seemed to be the hospital's only physician), purchased all of column 2 for nearly the entire year.</p>

      <td colspan="2">
        <p><b>Columns 3-7:</b> The head of column 3 almost always carried one or two short poems, sometimes with attribution to an author or journal, sometimes published anonymously. Much of the remainder of page 1 was filled with articles. These could be short (perhaps one-quarter of a column) or long (more than one column). Unlike the <i>Spectator</i>, however, which most frequently devoted article space on page 1 to human interest stories and strange happenings around the nation, the <i>Vindicator</i> seems to have been more likely to combine these pieces with political articles. Page 1 on February 3, for example, did carry an article about a large wedding in St. Louis, but also printed both a long piece from the <i>New York Express</i> rebuking author Victor Hugo for having praised John Brown, and a letter to the editor addressing the question of free blacks in the South. Short jokes, moral aphorisms, and the like ran at the bottoms of columns 3-7 on page 1, just as they did in the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>
