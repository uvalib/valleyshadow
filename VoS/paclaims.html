    <h1>Claims from the Burning of Chambersburg, 1865-1868</h1>
  </center>Confederate troops destroyed over $1.6 million in real estate and personal property when they burned the town of Chambersburg in 1864. To help residents rebuild, the Pennsylvania legislature set aside funds and authorized a commission to evaluate the claims of those with damaged property. The commission received claims from a total of 593 Franklin County residents. Most claimants received only one third to one half the amount they requested.
