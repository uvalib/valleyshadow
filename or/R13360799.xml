                    need to go to Staunton.</p>

                <p>In my letter of instructions for organizing an expedition from your department
                    for the purpose of cutting the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, I fixed the
                    route by Covington and the number of troops of each arm to be sent, on limited
                    information of the country to be traversed and on examination of your last
                    returns. I understood the best and most accessible route was from Covington. If
                    this is not the case I do not insist upon the route, but only upon the work to
                    be done.</p>
                <p>If you can increase the cavalry force to go with the expedition, do so. As the
                    first part of the route to be traveled by this expedition is through a country
                    that will furnish but little subsistence or forage a larger train will have to
                    accompany it than I designed. This will be pretty well exhausted of supplies
                    before reaching Lewisburg, where the country becomes rich, and the most of it
                    can be returned to Beverly under an escort of, say, 800 to 1,000 men, which will
                    have to be detached from the expedition for that purpose.</p>
                <p>This expedition, being co-operative with movements made by other armies, cannot
                    leave Beverly until the other armies are ready to leave also. I am now satisfied
                    preparations cannot be made elsewhere before the 20th instant. You may
                    understand, then, you have until the 20th instant to concentrate your forces.</p>
                <p>It is possible the expedition with Gen.'s Ord and Averell may have to return to
                    you by way of the Shenandoah Valley. To provide against this contingency you
                    should collect any available force you may have at a convenient point from which
                    to march on Staunton to meet them. Should you find it necessary to go to
                    Staunton, you will want to take as large a supply train as you can, to not only
                    provide for the troops you take with you, but to feed those you go to meet.
                    Please consult Gen. Averell as to the most practicable routes for accomplishing
                    the object to be attained, and advise with me by telegraph and letter of your
                    conclusions.</p>
