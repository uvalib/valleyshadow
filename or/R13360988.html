<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Franz Sigel writes General Julius Stahel regarding plans for an
                    April, 1864, advance. Sigel plans to take Staunton, where he will await

<p>Maj.-Gen. STAHEL:</p>
<p>MARTINSBURG,</p>
<p>April 26, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch received. Col. Wilkinson is supposed to be at Clarksburg. He is
                    ordered to relieve the Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania by the Sixth Virginia Regt. and
                    the Second Maryland. Brig.-Gen. Crook will probably not be ready for three or
                    four days on account of the delay of our troops at Parkersburg. Has the
                    Twenty-first New York advanced from Beverly, and has the Tenth Virginia Infantry
                    fallen back to Beverly? Will Brig.-Gen. Sullivan be here soon? I have depended
                    on the arrangements with the Sixth Virginia Cavalry going to Beverly, even if
                    the Fourteenth Pennsylvania should be sent there, because this latter regiment
                    has to join Gen. Crook. It may now be sent to Beverly to re-enforce Col. Harris.
                    All the dismounted men of the Sixth Virginia should be ordered there at once.
                    The mounted men may follow them after we can spare them. I cannot be responsible
                    for any reverse if we cannot re-enforce Col. Harris, of the Tenth Virginia, at
                    once. The troops at Beverly will join us as soon as we have arrived at Staunton
                    and Lewisburg. They are only temporarily detached. Direct Capt. Barringer to
                    send all serviceable army wagons and ambulances which are not absolutely
                    necessary to this place. We can rely only on twenty-five wagons from Hagerstown.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SIGEL,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
