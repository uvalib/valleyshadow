<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>May 4, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I. To prevent the destruction of railroad property or outrage upon the traveling
                    public by troops belonging to or passing through this department, it is hereby
                    ordered that commanding officers of troops at posts where there are railroad
                    depots will have sufficient guards thereat for the purpose of preserving order
                    and arresting any drunken or disorderly soldiers who may be passing over the
                    said roads.</p>
<p>II. The officers in charge of soldiers passing through this department will be
                    held strictly responsible for the behavior of their men on railroad trains. When
                    they fail or refused to use their authority to enforce order and obedience among
                    the troops the superintendent of the railroad is requested to report them to
                    these headquarters with a statement of the facts.</p>
<p>III. If a disturbance occurs on any of the trains, the conductor of the same
                    will, by telegraph or otherwise, notify the officer commanding troops at the
                    most convenient point on the railroad, who will adopt such measures as may be,
                    in his judgment, necessary to promote the interest of the service, protect the
                    property of the road, and secure the safety of passengers.</p>
<p>By command of Maj.-Gen. Couch:</p>
<p>JNO. S. SCHULTZE,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
