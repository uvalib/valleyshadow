<p><b>Summary:<br></b>J. D. Cameron writes in July, 1861, to Secretary of War Simon Cameron concerning
                    a riot over late pay among men of the Second Pennsylvania, a regiment composed
                    mostly of men from Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Hon. SIMON CAMERON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG,</p>
<p>July 27, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The trouble was caused by the officers of the Second Regiment, who told their men
                    that they had all their rolls prepared, and when excited about not being paid,
                    instead of trying to quiet them, urged them on to riot. The excitement delayed
                    everything to-day. Paymaster Jolly is preparing the rolls of that regiment, and
                    Brua up to time of the riot was paying the First and Twenty-fifth. The
                    paymasters were doing their duty, and if the officers had done theirs everything
                    would have been well. All is quiet now. Gen. Keim ordered out the regiment of
                    three-years' men, who dispersed the mob. The Second is composed principally of
                    men from Chambersburg.</p>

<p>J. D. CAMERON.</p>
