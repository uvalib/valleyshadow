<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this March, 1863, letter, Union General Robert Milroy writes General Robert
                    Schenck concerning the importance of repairing the railroad from Harper's Ferry
                    to Winchester. Milroy states that doing so will make the capture of the Valley
                    as far as Staunton easier. He also discusses the strategic importance of the
                    Shenandoah Valley in general, and the desirability of encouraging latent
                    unionist sentiment in the area.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. R. C. SCHENCK:</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, VA.,</p>
<p>March 9, 1863.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>Pardon me for again calling your attention to the over-whelming importance of the
                    repair of the railroad from Harper's Ferry to this place at the earliest
                    possible moment. When it is remembered that this Valley is the key, not only to
                    the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but to all of West Virginia; that it is
                    necessary to establish a permanent base at this place for supplies and
                    operations, for taking and occupying the Valley south to Staunton; that the
                    transportation now in use between this and Martinsburg would, by the repair of
                    said railroad, all be released and be made available in an advance up the
                    Valley; that said advance will be greatly delayed, if not defeated, unless the
                    transportation is thus released and made available; that the season for active
                    operations is at hand; that the repairs of said railroad would give assurance to
                    the inhabitants of this place and surrounding country that the Government had
                    firmly re-established its power, and revive and call out a strong Union
                    sentiment, new suppressed and held in check by our present apparently doubtful
                    occupancy, surely the wisest strategy, economy, and effort for the public good
                    would require its immediate repair, cost what it may.</p>
<p>I am, general, with great respect, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. H. MILROY,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
