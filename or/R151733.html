<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this June, 1863, Confederate dispatch, First Corps Assistant Adjutant Gilbert
                    Moxley Sorrel writes General George Pickett with orders for movements in the

<p>HDQRS. FIRST ARMY CORPS,</p>
<p>Maj. Gen. G. E. PICKETT,<br> Cmdg. Division:</p>
<p>Greenwood, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 1, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>As directed yesterday evening, if relieved in time to-day by Gen. Imboden, the
                    commanding general desires you to come on this evening as far as this point, and
                    to follow on after the remainder of the command across the mountains to-morrow
                    morning. If you do not start from the vicinity of Chambersburg before to-morrow
                    you may move on across the mountain without stopping here. When you arrive here,
                    either this evening or to-morrow, the commanding general wishes you to relieve a
                    brigade of Gen. Hood at New Guilford, and send it forward to rejoin his
                    division. Your own brigade will in turn be relieved by Gen. Imboden when he gets
                    here and sent on to rejoin you. The captured contrabands had better be brought
                    along with you for further disposition.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>G. M. SORREL,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
