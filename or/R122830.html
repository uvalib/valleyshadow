<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Staunton Virginia served as an important muster and supply center during the
                    first months of the war. In this May, 1861, letter, Robert E. Lee writes Major
                    R. M. Boykin, Jr. at Grafton, VA. Lee informs Boykin that arms for new recruits
                    are available at Staunton.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Maj. R. M. BOYKIN, JR., Grafton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 11, 1861.</p>
<p>MAJOR:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 7th has just been received, and I regret to learn that the
                    prospect of assembling the Virginia forces at Grafton is so unfavorable. You
                    must persevere, however, and call out companies from the well-affected counties,
                    and march them to Grafton, or such other point in that vicinity as you may
                    select. Four hundred rifles and some ammunition have been ordered from Staunton
                    to Maj. Goff, Virginia Volunteers, at Beverly, Randolph County, who has been
                    directed to communicate their arrival to Col. Porterfield, and take his
                    directions as to their disposition. You can by this means arm certain companies
                    and prepare them for service, preparatory to receiving those from Harper's
                    Ferry. I do not think it prudent to order companies from other parts of the
                    State to Grafton, as it might irritate, instead of conciliating the population
                    of that region. On Col. Porterfield's arrival at Grafton communicate this letter
                    to him.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p> R. E. LEE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
