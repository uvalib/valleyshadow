<p>Brig. Gen. G. W. CULLUM,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>CUMBERLAND, MD.,</p>
<p>December 8, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. Averell left New Creek this morning with three regiments of cavalry
                    and a battery, for the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. He will proceed via
                    Petersburg, Franklin, Monterey, Covington, and Fincastle, and strike the
                    railroad in Botetourt and Roanoke Counties. Brig.-Gen. Scammon will also move
                    from the Kanawha to-day, on Lewisburg and Union, for the purpose of threatening
                    the enemy and the railroad near New River, engaging his attention and making a
                    diversion in Averell's favor. Brig.-Gen. Sullivan will move a force up the
                    valley via Winchester, Strasburg, Woodstock, &amp;c., threatening Staunton,
                    and engage the attention of Imboden, and prevent him from sending a force
                    against Averell.</p>
<p>Lee may possibly send a mounted force when he learns of this movement, from his
                    left, for the purpose of cutting Averell off; but this, if attempted, I hope
                    will be frustrated by corresponding movements of Gen. Meade's cavalry. If my
                    plans and orders are promptly and faithfully executed, I hope to accomplish
                    important results. It will certainly cut off all communication by railroad and
                    telegraph between Lee and Longstreet.</p>
