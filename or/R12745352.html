<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Colonel J. S. Robinson reports on intelligence gathered from a woman who
                    travelled from Richmond to Maryland via Staunton, VA, in June, 1863. The woman,
                    one Mrs. Fry, reported that Confederate forces moving north for Lee's invasion
                    of Pennsylvania left Richmond poorly defended, and many citizens moved to
                    Staunton, VA, for security.</p>

<p>Col. Asmussen, Chief of Staff, Eleventh Corps:</p>
<p>Middletown, Md.,</p>
<p>June 27, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>A second omnibus has just arrived from Hagerstown. Mrs. Fry, one of the
                    passengers, reports that she left Richmond, Va., three weeks ago to-morrow. The
                    rebel troops had all left, with the exception of a small detachment, which was
                    doing guard duty. She reports that she came via Staunton. She says that she left
                    the latter place on Sunday last. Many of the prominent citizens of Richmond had
                    gone to Staunton for security. Nearly all the rebel troops have passed over the
                    Potomac into Maryland.</p>
<p>Very truly,</p>
<p> J. S. ROBINSON,<br> Col., Comdg. Post.</p>
