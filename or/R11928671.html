<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee instructs General George Steaurt at Winchester to continue

<p>Brig. Gen. GEORGE H. STEAURT,<br> Winchester, Va.:</p>
<p>Camp near Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p>October 18, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The enemy retired yesterday afternoon from Leetown and Charlestown, the points
                    which their respective columns from opposite Shepherdstown and Harper's Ferry
                    reached. From information received last night, I believe the former recrossed
                    the Potomac at the ford below Shepherdstown, and the latter withdrew to Harper's
                    Ferry. I wish you would persecute vigorously the police of Winchester and the
                    hospitals. Continue to send back the serious cases of sick to Staunton.
                    Convalescents must be returned to their regiments when able to resume duty. I
                    have been informed that the medical is granting wholesale furloughs to men in
                    hospitals. This is wrong; none ought to be furloughed but such as really require
                    it. I have sent scouts to Wardensville, the Cacapon Bridge, and points in that
                    direction, to give notice of any approach of enemy's cavalry from Hancock or
                    Cumberland, with directions to communicative with you. I have thought it
                    possible that an expedition similar to Stuart's might be attempted, passing near
                    Front Royal and crossing the Blue Ridge. The enemy's cavalry yesterday came up
                    as far as Paris and Snickersville from Loudon. I wish you would be on the alert,
                    and keep your Maryland troops and others with you prepared for any emergency.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
