<p><b>Summary:<br></b>By mid-June, 1864, Union forces that had advanced into the Shenandoah Valley
                    returned to West Virginia. In this letter, Union Captain E. B. Gere reports that
                    before his withdrawal he had heard that Confederate troops were in the vicinity
                    of Staunton, which had been briefly held by the Union.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. STAHEL:</p>
<p>BEVERLY,</p>
<p>June 18, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have returned to Beverly went beyond Hightown. Learned that there was a rebel
                    force at or near Staunton, and that Gen. Hunter had gone to Lexington. The
                    people all along our way were told a day or two previous that the detachment was
                    coming through to Staunton by some of the released prisoners that Col. Harris
                    had sent from here. I had no guide, nor could not get one, and was entirely
                    ignorant of the country. My command is nearly out of ammunition, having none
                    since we left the regiment. I send the dispatches through the way directed by
                    Maj. Lang and think they will get through.</p>
<p></p>
<p>E. B. GERE,<br> Capt., Cmdg.</p>
