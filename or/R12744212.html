<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius N. Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna,
                    reports from Chambersburg in July, 1863, on the successful defense of
                    Pennsylvania during Lee's invasion. Couch devotes attention primarily to the
                    movements and actions of emergency militia units. He mentions sending emergency
                    militia from New York to defend Chambersburg, discusses Lee's advance on the
                    town, and reports the capture of enemy men and supplies during a raid on
                    retreating Confederate columns at Greencastle. He also discusses preparations
                    for the defense of Harrisburg, including African-American participation, and the
                    mobilization of men and supplies throughout the state.</p>

<p>Col. J. C. Kelton,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>Hdqrs. Department of the Susquehanna,<br> Chambersburg,
                            Pa.,</p>
<p>July 15, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>In obedience to instructions from the honorable Secretary of War, I left
                    Washington June 11, for Harrisburg, in order to assume command of the newly
                    organized Department of the Susquehanna.</p>
<p>After an interview with His Excellency Governor Curtin and gentlemen of his
                    council, an order was prepared and issued to the department, calling for a corps
                    of troops for State defense. This was in accordance with instructions received
                    from Mr. Stanton.</p>
<p>The Governor also issued a proclamation to the people of the State in connection
                    with my order.</p>
<p>On the 15th, 800 of the enemy's mounted force appeared at Chambersburg, 16 miles
                    north of the Maryland line. They were closely watched by about 120 men of the
                    First New York Cavalry, under Capt. Boyd, who covered the wagon train of Gen.
                    Milroy on its retreat from Winchester, Va., toward Harrisburg, Pa.</p>
<p>At this date there were not 250 organized men in the department for duty. The
                    sick in the hospital at York were removed, as well as the United States stores
                    at Carlisle.</p>
<p>Lieut.-Col. Coppee, of Philadelphia, volunteered his services to the State, and
                    was sent to Altoona to arrange with the officers of the Pennsylvania Railroad
                    Company for the defense of that point, the bridges crossing the Juniata, as well
                    as the mountain passes, southerly toward Bedford, McConnellsburg, and London.</p>
<p>Comparatively few troops offered for State defense.</p>
<p>The President called for volunteers for six-months' service, and Governor Curtin
                    issued his proclamation for 50,000 men. This was on the 15th, and men in masses
                    began to assemble at Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Huntingdon, Altoona, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The militia of Pennsylvania was not organized. Farmers in the threatened parts
                    were directed to remove their stock.</p>
<p>On the 17th, the only company of infantry, Capt. McGowan's, from York Hospital,
                    was sent to Shippensburg. Rebel advance fell back on the 18th to Greencastle.
                    Some 2,500 of Gen. Milroy's force, in retreating, via Hancock, arrived near
                    Bedford Springs, where their commander joined them. They were a good deal
                    demoralized. Col. Higgins re-enforced Milroy with 1,200 men, without blankets or
                    camp equipage. Militia regiments from New York began to arrive. New Jersey sent
                    one regiment for three days. Other companies from that State reported at
                    Harrisburg.</p>
<p>The Secretary of War placed the arsenals and clothing depots at my disposal; also
                    gave me ample authority to receive, subsist, and arm whatever troops might be
                    offered from the neighboring States.</p>
<p>The New York militia were mustered into the United States service for thirty
                    days. The Pennsylvanians generally declined to be mustered for six months.
                    Finally, a portion consented to serve during "the existence of the emergency."</p>
<p>The heights on the right bank of the Susquehanna, opposite to Harrisburg, were
                    being fortified, in order to cover that city and the important bridges. Some of
                    the patriotic citizens of that city volunteered to work in the trenches; others
                    were paid. The colored population were not behind their white brethren in giving
                    assistance.</p>
<p>The Eighth and Seventy-first New York Militia went to Chambersburg on the 19th.</p>
<p>Rebel advance of infantry and artillery, 8,000 men, reported at Hagerstown.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. W. F. Smith joined after returning from Altoona and Bedford. He was
                    placed in command of all the troops and defenses opposite Harrisburg. The works
                    were being pushed under the chief engineer of the department, Capt. J. B.
                    Wheeler, assisted by Maj. James Brady, First Pennsylvania Artillery; Capt.
                    Wilson, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and other employees of that and the
                    Northern Central road.</p>
<p>Every effort was made to organize artillery and get it into position. Maj.
                    Granville O. Haller, acting aide-de-camp, was sent to Gettysburg to take
                    command.</p>
<p>Capt. David McConaughy, of Gettysburg, in company with others, were sent out as
                    scouts to gain information.</p>
<p>Col. Thomas, Twentieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, had the defense of the bridges of
                    the Northern Central Railroad.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 22d, the rebel cavalry advanced upon Chambersburg, followed
                    by heavy masses of infantry and artillery. It was the head of their army, under
                    Gen. Lee. A part of Ewell's corps advanced toward Carlisle, which place they
                    occupied on the 27th and 28th by 12,000 men, our forces, under Brig.-Gen. Knipe,
                    falling back to near Harrisburg. The remainder of Ewell's corps, 8,000, crossed
                    from Chambersburg to Gettysburg on the 26th; drove in our scouts with their
                    supports, with a loss to us of 176 men missing and prisoners of the Twenty-sixth
                    Emergency Regt.. From that place the enemy moved in the direction of York.</p>
<p>The chief burgess and a deputation of citizens met this force 9 miles from the
                    town, and formally surrendered. It was occupied by Gen. Early on the 28th. A
                    body of 2,500 of the rebels immediately pushed toward Columbia, drove in the
                    troops at Wrightsville, under Col. Frick, who retreated across the river and
                    burned the bridge. Same day, their advance approached to within 3 miles of
                    Harrisburg, engaging our pickets and reconnoitered the works.</p>
<p>Col. Thomas, Twentieth Regt., in charge of bridges near York, retired toward the
                    Susquehanna.</p>
<p>The call of June 15 brought only seven full regiments. The Governor obtained the
                    sanction of the President, and called out 60,000 militia for State service.
                    These rendezvoused at Harrisburg, Reading, and Huntingdon. Up to this time, New
                    York had sent nearly 6,000 men.</p>
<p>Col. E. Franklin, a citizen of Lancaster, had been placed in command of the fords
                    and bridges on the Lower Susquehanna, to Conowingo, in Maryland, some of which
                    were guarded by citizens partially armed with shot-guns.</p>
<p>Five thousand men of the counties bordering on the Juniata filled the passes
                    leading to their homes, and threw up military works. They were an army of
                    bushwhackers, commanded by ex-officers.</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. Smith advanced to Carlisle July 1, with 3,000 men. During the night,
                    Lee's cavalry, 3,200 strong, surrounded the place, and, after demanding its
                    surrender, shelled the town, retiring before the next morning in the direction
                    of Gettysburg, where Gen. Lee was hastily concentrating, having been forced to
                    this by the rapid movements of the Army of the Potomac, under Gen. Meade.</p>
<p>The battle of Gettysburg was fought on July 1, 2, and 3, when the rebels
                    commenced falling back to Hagerstown. Brig.-Gen. Knipe joining Smith, the latter
                    moved in the direction of Gettysburg through the mountains, via Pine Grove, in
                    order to make a diversion in favor of Meade by attacking Lee's flank and rear.
                    This movement compelled the latter to keep a large force in line of battle near
                    Cashtown. Smith was ordered by Gen. Meade to join him at Gettysburg.
                    Subsequently it was countermanded, and he followed the retreating army of Lee,
                    via Altodale, to the vicinity of Waynesborough, where he effected a junction
                    with one of Meade's brigades, under Brig.-Gen. Neill. Smith's division was
                    mostly composed of New York troops, including one brigade of Pennsylvania
                    emergency men, under Col. Brisbane, acting brigadier-general. I respectfully
                    refer to the elaborate report of Brig.-Gen. Smith.</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Sigel was assigned to duty in this department, and took command of the
                    rendezvous at Reading. Maj.-Gen. Stahel was present as chief of cavalry.</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Dana, on duty at Philadelphia, reported to me at Chambersburg on the
                    11th, and was assigned to the command of the Second Division, composed of
                    Pennsylvania militia, excepting two New York regiments, under the command of
                    Brig.-Gen. Yates.</p>
<p>Col.'s Beaver and Miles, both of the Second Army Corps, dangerously wounded at
                    Chancellorsville, commanded Camps Curtin and Huntingdon.</p>
<p>Col. Pierce, Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry, who had succeeded Milroy, killed,
                    wounded, and captured a company of rebel cavalry at McConnellsburg.</p>
<p>On July 5, Capt. Jones, First New York Cavalry, attacked Lee's wagon train near
                    Greencastle, and brought off 645 prisoners, 300 of whom were wounded, 90 wagons,
                    and 1 piece of artillery.</p>
<p>Had Col. Pierce fully carried out my instructions, he would have inflicted very
                    heavy loss upon the rebels, in breaking up their trains. He sent in nearly 1,000
                    prisoners; Gen. Smith about 300, with some wagons and horses. This officer
                    joined his force with those of Gen. Meade, the latter having under advisement
                    the breaking up of this division and distributing the regiments among the
                    brigades of his army. This course was recommended to that officer and approved
                    by Gen. Smith. Lee, however, recrossed the Potomac before it was accomplished.
                    Thus ended, disastrously to the enemy, their invasion of Maryland and
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I received from Governor Curtin and State officers every assistance. Among the
                    latter, more prominently were Col. John A. Wright, aide-de-camp; Hon. William M.
                    Meredith, attorney-general; Adjutant-Gen. A. L. Russell, Commissary-Gen. Irwin,
                    Gen. Cameron, Col. T. A. Scott, Judge Watts, Hon. Charles McAllister, Col.
                    McClure, Judge Francis M. Kimmell, Col. Stumbaugh, and J. N. Du Barry, together
                    with a very great number of gentlemen residing within the limits of the
                    department, who lent their assistance in working for the common cause.</p>
<p>The Governor of New York pushed forward his regiments with alacrity. They were
                    generally armed and equipped ready for field service, and their arrival brought
                    confidence.</p>
<p>Among the patriotic associations in the country, the Union League, of
                    Philadelphia, is not surpassed for its vigor and efficient labor. It alone
                    placed several regiments in the field.</p>
<p>The militia of Pennsylvania raised to resist the invasion was composed of men
                    from all classes and professions, and was a fine body of men.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to the following-named gentlemen, who freely gave their
                    services to the State, and served as volunteers on my staff; they were stationed
                    in various sections of the department: Lieut. Col. Henry Coppee, Military
                    secretary; Maj.'s Wilson and Wayne Mac Veagh; Capts. David McConaughy, W. A. H.
                    Lewis, and A. Wright; and Cadets Reuben W. Petrikin, William Krause, and Charles
                    W. Raymond, from West Point, extra aides-de-camp.</p>
<p>New York sent nineteen regiments and one battery, commanded by the following
                    brigadier-generals: Brig.-Gen.'s Hall, Yates, Ewen, Crooke, and Smith.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania furnished eight regiments of emergency men, twenty-two regiments of
                    three-months' militia, five companies of artillery, one battalion of six-months'
                    infantry, two regiments and one battalion of six-months' cavalry, and one
                    battalion of three-months' cavalry. The three-months' men were generally
                    organized between July 4 and 11 of the same month.</p>
<p>New Jersey sent one battalion of infantry that remained until after the invasion.</p>
<p>Number of prisoners reported, 1,341, of whom nearly 500 were taken under arms,
                    400 wounded, and the remainder stragglers and deserters. This does not include
                    quite a number who escaped through the mountains and went north, being aided in
                    this by the citizens.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Comdg.</p>
