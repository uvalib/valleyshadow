<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Grant writes Franz Sigel with plans for May, 1864, movements in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. Grant suggests that Sigel send men to Lynchburg to return to
                    Staunton where they can pick up supplies.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. FRANZ SIGEL, Winchester, Va.:</p>
<p>CULPEPER, VA.,</p>
<p>May 2, 1864--11 p .m.<br> (Received 6.40 a. m. 3d.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I do not want you to move farther south than Cedar Run, to watch any movement the
                    enemy may attempt by the way of the Shenandoah Valley. The Army of the Potomac
                    occupies nothing between the Blue Ridge and Orange and Alexandria Railroad. In
                    the plan which I first gave you, but which was modified at your suggestion, it
                    was thought, taken in connection with the movements of this army, the force
                    which was to start from Beverly might work easterly to Lynchburg and return to
                    Staunton. Then you would want to meet them with a train loaded with supplies. It
                    is to be hoped the efforts making for raising troops will enable us to send any
                    re-enforcements you may require, should the enemy move down the Valley. Call on
                    Gen. Halleck for what may be necessary, and report to him after the 3d. To cut
                    New River bridge and the road ten or twenty miles east from there would be the
                    most important work Crook could do.</p>
