<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Charles A. Dana writes the Union Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, to report
                    information gathered from a deserter. Dana reports that Confederate General
                    Richard Ewell is in Maryland, and that he left much of his supplies and baggage
                    in Staunton.</p>

<p>SECRETARY OF WAR,<br> Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>CITY POINT, VA.,</p>
<p>July 4, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>A deserter from the Sixty-first Virginia, who came into Hancock's lines this
                    morning from the extreme right of the rebel army, says it was reported in their
                    camp that Ewell had gone into Maryland with his own corps and the other forces
                    lately operating in the Valley. He took only hard bread in his wagons and left
                    all baggage at Staunton. The same deserter reports that the rations of Lee's
                    army have been reduced to one-quarter of a pound of meat, whilst the ration of
                    sugar and coffee has ceased to be regularly issued.</p>

<p>C. A. DANA.</p>
