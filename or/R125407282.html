<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Cavalry Commander William E. Jones writes General John D. Imboden
                    concerning a possible April, 1863, Union attack on the Valley. Jones orders that
                    the area around Staunton serve as a rendezvous point in case of trouble.</p>

<p>Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg. at Shenandoah Mountain:</p>
<p>LACEY SPRING, VA.,</p>
<p>April 16, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>There is no sign of the enemy in the Valley. News has reached me from Sperryville
                    just now, but no tidings of the move anticipated. Orders are sent by the bearer
                    of this to your cavalry to encamp between Harrisonburg and your position, to
                    await orders either from you or me. Your infantry and artillery you can put in
                    camp where it may best suit you, keeping in view some point of rendezvous toward
                    Staunton, if threatened by a force my immediate command cannot meet. My opinion
                    is, the attack on the Valley has been abandoned, if ever entertained, by the
                    enemy. Gen. Stuart is still near Culpeper Court-House. As soon as plans for the
                    future can be arranged, you will be notified. If you can put everything in
                    condition for action in your absence, I would be glad to see you in day or so to
                    arrange our affairs.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. E. JONES,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
