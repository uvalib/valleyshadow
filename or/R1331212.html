<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee writes Secretary of War James Seddon in March, 1864, to

<p>Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,<br> Secretary of War, Richmond,
                        Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>March 9, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I beg leave to call your attention to the importance of a speedy organization of
                    the minutemen in the counties bordering on the Allegheny Ridge, for the
                    protection of the agricultural and mining interests of that valuable region.
                    Gen. Imboden has sent me a plan of apportionment of these counties for the
                    formation of regiments, which I approve. He thinks that five regiments from
                    Page, Shenandoah, Hardy, and such portions of the counties lower down as we can
                    control, with its rendezvous at Woodstock; a second regiment from Rockingham,
                    Pendleton, and Highland, with its rendezvous at Harrisonburg; the third from
                    Augusta and Bath, with headquarters at Staunton; the fourth from Rockbridge and
                    Allegheny, rendezvous at Lexington or some more convenient point; the fifth from
                    Botetourt, Roanoke, and Craig, with headquarters at Salem, Buchanan, or
                    Fincastle, or such point as may be selected. These regiments, organized under
                    good commands, with proper rendezvous to be assigned for the different
                    battalions in case of alarm, with a good system of signaling, ought to be able
                    to protect the valley and punish severely raiding parties of the enemy. I would
                    suggest that the Conscript Bureau send active and efficient officers into the
                    counties aforesaid in order to perfect the organization of these regiments as
                    speedily as practicable.</p>
<p>I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
