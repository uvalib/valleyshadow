<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Phil Sheridan writes to Chief of Staff Henry Halleck in January,
                    1865, concerning arrangements to provide for the destitute citizens of the
                    Shenandoah Valley between Staunton and Winchester. Sheridan wishes to distribute
                    rations among the civilians.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff of the Army,
                        Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p>January 25, 1865.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>In obedience to instructions, and from military necessity, the Valley of the
                    Shenandoah from Winchester to Staunton, a distance of ninety-two miles, was so
                    much desolated as to make it necessary to issue at the present time a small
                    number of rations. These destitute people cannot be provided for according to
                    the system proposed in your communication of December 24, 1864, to Maj.-Gen.
                    Dodge. The people of this section are now so poor that there is no way that a
                    tax fund can be created, except by an attempt to sell household furniture, and
                    even then I doubt if there would be purchasers. The number now issued to will
                    reach probably 800, but will increase. The issue made to these people have been
                    carefully managed, and are only made in small quantities.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
