                <p>In answer to your dispatch of yesterday afternoon I have the honor to report:
                    First. That the injured Napoleon of the Washington Artillery was sent to the
                    rear on the 4th of July, by order of Maj. Eshleman, in the reserve ordnance
                    train of the army, under charge of Capt. James M. Garnett, and it is presumed it
                    is now in Richmond. Capt. Garnett's train arrived at Gordonsville some days ago
                    from Staunton, where it was intended to turn over the guns brought there by it.
                    Second. The 12-pounder howitzer of Dearing's battalion was sent to the rear on
                    the 4th of July, by order of Col. Alexander, in Capt. Garnett's train,
                    proceeding to Staunton. Third. A 12-pounder howitzer of Alexander's battalion
                    was sent to the rear on the 4th of July, by order of Col. Alexander, in Capt.
                    Garnett's train, proceeding to Stanton. Fourth. The 12-pounder howitzer of the
                    Washington Artillery was also sent to the rear on the 4th of July, by order of
                    Maj. Eshleman, in the reserve ordnance train of the army (with the Napoleon of
                    that battalion), proceeding to Staunton. Fifth. The 12-pounder howitzer of
                    Henry's battalion was being transported to the rear when a wheel broke down and
                    it was abandoned on the road from Gettysburg near Fairfield. It was subsequently
                    found by Col. Baldwin, chief ordnance officer Army of Northern Virginia, and by
                    him bought off in a wagon and supposed to have been sent to Staunton. Sixth. The
                    3-inch rifle (Rome, Ga., manufacture) of Cabell's battalion was turned over to
                    Lieut. Walke, ordnance officer artillery First Corps, at Bunker Hill on 17th of
                    July, and by him sent to Stanton. Seventh. A 12-pounder howitzer of Alexander's
                    battalion was injured in action and ordered by Col. Alexander to be abandoned on
                    the field of Gettysburg. It was subsequently brought off the field by the
                    ordnance train artillery First Corps and sent to Staunton. Eighth. The 3-inch
                    rifle (Richmond make), Henry's battalion, was bursted on the 2d of July and left
                    upon the field. It will be seen by the foregoing that the only loss of guns by
                    the artillery of this corps was one 3-inch rifle (Richmond make), Henry's
                    battalion, bursted in action and abandoned on the field on the 2d instant. All
                    the other disabled guns were finally saved and sent to the rear via Staunton for
                    Richmond.</p>

                    <salute>In the hope that the report may prove satisfactory to the general
                        commanding, I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant.</salute>
