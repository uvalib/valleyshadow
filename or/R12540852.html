<p>Maj. Gen. SAMUEL JONES,<br> Cmdg. Department
                        Southwestern Virginia, Dublin, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 3, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have received your letter of May 28. I am very much obliged to you for the
                    offer of the Fiftieth Virginia Regt. So far as I am able to judge at this
                    distance, I think that this army need strengthening at this time more than
                    yours. I will, therefore, keep the regiment in question for the present, but
                    will send it back to you whenever you need it.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Virginia are on their way to this point.</p>
<p>Gen. Imboden's command was organized for service in North-western Virginia and
                    the Valley, and he reports directly to me. I have instructed him to operate in
                    the Valley and on the line toward Staunton, Huttonsville, Cheat Mountain,
                    Monterey, and the Potomac.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to do without the transportation captured.</p>
<p>I send you a copy of an order reducing the transportation of this army, and even
                    with this reduction I am deficient in general transportation for commissary,
                    quartermaster, &amp;c., trains.</p>
<p>Wishing you success in your department in the operations of the summer's
                    campaign,</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
