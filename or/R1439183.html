<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this September, 1864, dispatch, John Schultze, Assistant Adjutant for the
                    Department of the Susquehanna, writes from Chambersburg to Colonel F. Asbury Awl
                    with marching orders for troops in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
<p>September 13, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>The commanding general directs that you march your regiment as follows: On the
                    14th instant march from your present camp via Saint Thomas to Bridgeport; on the
                    15th instant march from Bridgeport to Cashtown; on the 16th instant march from
                    Cashtown via Rutt's corner (which is three miles from Cashtown on the road to
                    Chambersburg), where you will turn to the left and march by shortest line back
                    to your present camp. The sick will be left in camp in charge of a medical
                    officer. An officer with a small squad of men will be left to guard the stores,
                    camp, &amp;c. You can make arrangements to have rations meet you at
                    Cashtown. The march will be an easy one, with frequent halts. No straggling,
                    pilfering, or interfering with private property in any way will be allowed. The
                    Keystone Battery, Capt. M. Hastings commanding, will be ordered to report to you
                    on the morning of the 14th. You will direct it to proceed with you, and will be
                    under your orders.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. S. SCHULTZE,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
