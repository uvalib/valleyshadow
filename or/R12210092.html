<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Henry Wise commanded a Confederate brigade during the summer, 1861,
                    struggle for what is now West Virginia. Staunton served as a base of supply in
                    these actions as evidenced by General William Wing Loring's letter announcing
                    the movement by rail of reinforcements through Staunton.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS, Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Huntersville, Va.,</p>
<p>July 30, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>I have just seen a reliable man who tells me that he was in Gen. Wise's camp las
                    Friday, 26th July; that Wise was at Gauey Brigade, on his retreat to Lewisburg,
                    about sixty miles distant. He thinks that Wise intended to fight the enemy at
                    Tompkins' [farm], eight miles from the bridge.</p>
<p>Upon learning this, I sent word to Staunton for the two Georgia regiments and the
                    battery expected at Staunton to be moved by the train to Millsborough, there to
                    remain until further orders.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
