<p>Col. N. WILKINSON,<br> Clarksburg:</p>
<p>BUCKHANNON, W. VA.,</p>
<p>January 12, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>About 115 men have arrived from Beverly, nearly all of whom are of the Eighth
                    Ohio: forty-seven are armed. One man says he left Beverly at 2 o'clock
                    yesterday. Rebels were making off with the plunder as rapidly as possible.
                    Quarters and bridge are all that was burned. Thinks they started for Staunton
                    with prisoners, &amp;c. Estimates their force at about 900. I started a
                    cavalry scout for Beverly at about 2 o'clock afternoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. C. RIZED,<br> Maj.</p>
