                <p>CITY POINT, VA., February 8, 1865.<lb/> Lieut. Col. T. S. BOWERS,<lb/> Assistant
                    Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
                <p>We have news from Richmond by our agents who left there yesterday. Failure of
                    peace negotiations, although used by the party to arouse people, is having very
                    depressing effect generally. Provisions and gold, which had heretofore fallen,
                    are again advancing, flour being sold for $1,200 per barrel. This is also partly
                    due to the fact that cold weather had prevented much movement on the James River
                    Canal. Day before yesterday only three boats arrived with provisions and forage.
                    There seems to be considerable movements of troops in the Valley, or of those in
                    Southwestern Virginia, lately commanded by Breckinridge, which our friends in
                    Richmond have not been able to sift. They say Central railroad has been bringing
                    in field artillery for three days past, and that on Saturday last about 2,000
                    infantry went through Richmond south, probably to our left; whether the infantry
                    came from the Valley, Western Virginia or from the north side, we are unable to
                    say, except that the information is contained in the same sentence which states
                    arrival of the field artillery by the Central railroad. Our friends say with
                    certainty that Wickham's brigade of cavalry, from Early's late command, has
                    arrived at Richmond; that it was understood day before yesterday that it was en
                    route for the enemy's left on the north side; that it was through that Wickham
                    was to relieve Gary's command, and that latter was to be sent south. Another of
                    our agents says: "We hear that it is expected to concentrate in North Carolina,
                    and siege guns are being removed. The Staunton men and detectives of Richmond
                    have made arrangements to run the blockade to save themselves." Our agent says
                    he was present at the great meeting on the evening of the 6th instant, and that
                    in his speech Jeff. Davis made use of an expression that every negro would be
                    armed, which has been suppressed in the published accounts.<lb/> GEO. H.
