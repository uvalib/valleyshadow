<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel Armistead Long writes General Gustavus Smith in October,
                    1862. He discusses orders concerning the artillery. He also directs Smith to
                    inquire in Staunton about guns available for the Richmond defense, since many
                    were stockpiled in that place.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. GUSTAVUS W. SMITH,<br> Cmdg.,&amp;c.,
                        Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 16, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>By direction of Gen. R. E. Lee, I inclose herewith an extract of Special Orders,
                    No. 209, and desire you to direct Maj. E. F. Moseley, First Regt. Virginia
                    Artillery, to proceed at once to join this command, bringing with him the men
                    from Capt. Wyatt's and Ritter's batteries. You will direct him to turn over such
                    public property as is not wanted with the companies to the proper Departments in
                    Richmond, and make the necessary arrangements for the transportation and
                    subsistence of his men on the march. Should the men be sent by railroad, it is
                    desired that Lieut.'s Robertson and Thurmond be directed to assist Maj. Mosley
                    in taking charge of them, and that the commanding officers of disbanded
                    companies be directed to make out descriptive lists of their men. Should the men
                    of Capt. Young's battery prefer remaining in the artillery, the men are to be
                    turned over to Maj. Moseley, who will bring them up for distribution. Should
                    they desire to return to the infantry, direct Capt. Young, to report with his
                    company to the commanding officer of the regiment from which he was detached.
                    The officers of the disbanded companies will be disposed of in Richmond as you
                    may think best, under the direction of the Secretary of War.</p>
<p>Should you want the horses and guns that have been turned in, you had better keep
                    them at Richmond. Should you want other guns for the defense of Richmond, you
                    can get them from Staunton. Forty guns from reduced batteries have been sent to
                    that place.</p>
<p>I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> A. L. LONG,<br> Col. and Military Secretary.</p>
