<p>SIGNAL OFFICER OF THE ARMY,<br> Washington City, D. C.: CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER OF THE ARMY.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C.,</p>
<p>September 4, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of operations of the signal
                    detachment of the Department of West Virginia in the field during the campaigns
                    of the spring and summer of 1864:</p>
<p>On the 1st day of March, 1864, in obedience to an order from the Adjutant-Gen.'s
                    Office, Washington, directing me to take command of the signal detachment of the
                    Department of West Virginia, I proceeded to the headquarters of the department,
                    at Cumberland, Md. My arrival there being just at the time that Gen. Sigel was
                    expected to relieve Gen. Kelley in command of the department, but little could
                    be done until the arrival of Gen. Sigel on the 12th of March. In the
                    intermediate time I got my men into camp and established drills, &amp;c.,
                    and continued the station at Martinsburg in communication with station of
                    observation at Mills' Gap. Immediately on Gen. Sigel's assuming command, I
                    waited upon him with a report of the condition of my party and a statement of
                    its needs. He approved my requisition for all things necessary for its
                    equipment, and a communication addressed by me to the Bureau of the Signal Corps
                    asking permission to request a detail of officers having been approved by the
                    Signal Officer of the Army and forwarded to Gen. Sigel, he directed me to select
                    the most suitable officers to be detailed. Nine officers were thus detailed in
                    all; the first one on the 3d of April, the last on the 25th. They reported as
                    follows: April 5, 1; 14th, 1; 15th, 3; 17th, 2; 21st, 1; 25th, 1; total, 9.
                    Immediately on reporting the obligation to secrecy was taken by each officer and
                    he was furnished with the code and his instruction commenced. On my arrival in
                    the department I inspected the detachment, and found it to consist of 4 officers
                    and 14 enlisted men, and in addition, 30 enlisted men accompanied me from
                    Washington. On the 22d of April 54 enlisted men arrived from the Signal Camp of
                    Instruction at Georgetown, D. C., and on the 23d, 63 enlisted men arrived from
                    the Department of the Susquehanna. There were also 8 men detailed for temporary
                    duty from the Fourteenth Regt. Pennsylvania Cavalry. Thus the aggregate force
                    consisted of 13 officers and 169 enlisted men.</p>
<p>When I was ordered to take the field with my command, aside from the 4 whom I
                    found there, the officers had had study as follows: One twenty-three days, 1
                    fourteen days, 3 thirteen days, 2 eleven days, 1 eight days, 1 three days.</p>
<p>The enlisted men may be classified as follows: Experienced men, 14; together with
                    those from Signal Camp of Instruction who accompanied me, 30, making 44 well
                    taught. Recruits from Signal Camp of Instruction, 54, indifferently taught;
                    recruits from the Department of the Susquehanna, 63; untaught; temporary detail,
                    Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, 8, untaught; total, 169. There were about 80
                    men mounted and armed; the others were not mounted for want of horses, and not
                    armed by reason of the inability of the Ordnance Department to fill my
                    requisition for arms. Thus it will be seen that I had in my party 5 officers and
                    44 enlisted men capable of doing efficient signal duty; the others had to be
                    taught, and even many of them equipped, during the exigencies of an active
                    campaign. I represented to Gen. Sigel, how insufficiently the officers and men
                    were instructed, and provided, and urged the propriety, rather, I thought,
                    necessity, that all not ready for efficient signal duty should be left in camp
                    to complete their instruction and equipment, that they might not disappoint his
                    expectation of them, but he decided that they were needed in the field, and
                    directed me to take them as they were, and do the best I could with them.</p>
<p>The following is an outline of the campaign in West Virginia in 1864, in which
                    this detachment participated: The Shenandoah column, under Sullivan, and the
                    West Virginia column, under Crook, were to meet at Staunton, and proceed thence
                    together toward Lynchburg, all under command of Sigel, who would move to
                    Staunton with Sullivan's column. With this view the troops of Sullivan's column
                    concentrated at Martinsburg, W. Va., toward the end of April, where Sigel joined
                    them, and on the 30th of April the march commenced. The command moved slowly,
                    halting at Winchester till the 9th of May; from the 9th to the 11th, at Cedar
                    Creek; from the 11th to the 15th, at Woodstock, when we marched to New Market,
                    where, after a severe action, we were repulsed and fell back to Cedar Creek,
                    arriving there on the afternoon of the 16th, and remained there (Gen. Sigel
                    being relieved by Gen. Hunter on the 21st) till the 26th, when the march
                    recommenced under Hunter. We proceed to Harrisonburg, thence to Port Republic,
                    thence to Piedmont, where June 5, we met and defeated the enemy, and June 6
                    entered Staunton, where, on the 8th, we were joined by Crook, and marched to
                    Lexington in four columns. From Lexington Averell's cavalry was sent in advance
                    to Buchanan, the main force following next day on two parallel roads. From
                    Buchanan we marched toward Lynchburg, crossing the Blue Ridge at the Peaks
                    Otter. We skirmished continually with the enemy after passing Staunton, and on
                    the 17th of June pushed him into his works at Lynchburg, where darkness ended
                    the day's fighting, and during the night he was heavily re-enforced, and on the
                    18th we fought to gain possession of their works and the city, but failed to do
                    so, and at night on the 18th commenced to fall back, recrossing the Blue Ridge
                    at Buford's Gap (the enemy pursuing and harassing our rear till clear of the
                    mountains), and marched by way of New Castle, Sweet Springs, Meadow Bluff, and
                    Gauley Bridge, to Loup Creek, where we took water transportation in part, and
                    part marched to Parkersburg. There we learned that the enemy's force, released
                    from the Valley by our forced retreat westward, were invading Maryland, and
                    Hunter hastened forward his troops toward Martinsburg. Sullivan's division was
                    made the advance, and after recovering Martinsburg, he proceeded to Harper's
                    Ferry, and on the arrival of Gen. Hunter and staff the troops were disposed
                    about the foot of the Valley. Gen. Wright, moving from Washington by way of
                    Poolesville, crossed the Potomac at Edwards' Ferry into Virginia. The enemy
                    having fallen back, again advanced and retook Martinsburg, but were again driven
                    out. Wright's command having rejoined Hunter, the whole force was moved toward
                    Frederick City, July 30, and encamped about Frederick City till the 6th of
                    August, when we returned to Harper's Ferry, and shortly after Gen. Sheridan was
                    placed in command.</p>
<p>The operations of the signal detachment during these movements were in detail as
                    follows:</p>
<p>On the 29th of April I received at Cumberland, telegraphic orders from Gen.
                    Sigel, who was at Martinsburg, to go there with my whole party (sending the
                    mounted men by the turnpike and bringing the others by rail), and on the morning
                    of the 30th I left Cumberland in obedience to that order. The mounted men I
                    placed under the command of Lieut. Jones, assisted by Lieut.'s Fortney and
                    Brault, and with the dismounted men reached Martinsburg that evening, where I
                    was advised by Capt. Melvin, assistant adjutant-general, to remain until I heard
                    from Gen. Sigel, who was at or near Winchester. I remained there, re-arranging
                    the party as well as possible the next day.</p>
<p>On the 2d of May I determined to go out and find Gen. Sigel and get some orders;
                    so taking a small detail of mounted men from the party previously at Martinsburg
                    and a part of the dismounted men, I went out and reported to Gen. Sigel at his
                    headquarters, about two miles beyond Winchester. The next morning (3d) I went
                    into Martinsburg, and met the mounted party, who had arrived from Cumberland the
                    evening before, and took them out to Winchester.</p>
<p>On the 4th I opened a station of observation at Round Hill, about three miles
                    west of Winchester, and surveyed route for a line of stations to Strasburg.</p>
<p>On the 5th I opened a line to Martinsburg, the intermediate stations being at
                    Green Spring and Mills' Gap.</p>
<p>On the 8th, by direction of Gen. Sigel, all stations were discontinued and
                    officers and men called in.</p>
<p>On the 9th the march up the Valley commenced; we halted that afternoon at Cedar
                    Creek. On the evening of the 9th I sent Lieut.'s Ellis and Smith with scouting
                    party to Round Top, a low mountain about three miles beyond Strasburg. They
                    returned on the 10th, having been on the mountain, but smoky atmosphere
                    prevented their making any observations or communicating with headquarters.</p>
<p>On the 11th we marched to Woodstock. On the march I left Lieut.'s Ellis and Smith
                    at Round Top with a guard of cavalry and infantry. This evening fixed station at
                    headquarters to communicate with Round Top, and also with the road in front of
                    our advance, where I posted parties of observation.</p>
<p>On the 12th I opened a new station at the front and advanced the one posted
                    before. This evening, by direction of Gen. Sigel, I sent a party toward the
                    rear, arranged and instructed as follows: Sergeant Landon, with ten men, to halt
                    at Cedar Creek, and Sergeant Knapp, with ten men, to go on to near Newtown, and,
                    remaining concealed, send scouts carefully toward Winchester, to go through
                    Winchester, if possible, to observe any movements of the enemy on our rear, and
                    report any observations by a prearranged code of rockets. Sergeant Landon and
                    the station at Round Top to repeat any rockets seen. Later in the night I sent a
                    party down the road half way to Round Top to repeat any rocket signals from the
                    rear, as it was so misty I feared Round Top might not be seen from headquarters.</p>
<p>On the 13th Sergeant Knapp returned, arriving at noon, but in the morning, having
                    been unable to hear anything of him, I directed Lieut. Ellis to send three or
                    four men cautiously to look for Knapp's party. He sent two signal men and three
                    cavalrymen and they not returning, Lieut. Smith, with three men, went out on his
                    own responsibility. Neither of these parties were ever heard of afterward, and
                    it is probable they were captured at or near Fisher's Hill.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 14th I sent another to the same place with the same
                    instructions, under Sergeant Curry. He sent four men to Winchester, but they
                    were never heard from afterward, and from later information gained of parties of
                    bushwhackers being at Kernstown, it is probable these four men were captured
                    there.</p>
<p>On the 15th we marched to New Market, where we were repulsed by the enemy. During
                    the march I kept headquarters in communication with the advance, rear, and
                    flanks. The field of battle was too limited for signals to be of any use, but
                    the officers did what duty could be done in observing the enemy from every
                    accessible point, and some were permitted to act as aides to the general on the
                    field. When the retreat began (which was at first a panic) I used all my force
                    to stop and rally fugitives and to get them off the field in order. Indeed, for
                    a time the signal detachment and the headquarters escort (a squadron) were all
                    Gen. Sigel had to depend on to restore order among the fugitives, and
                    notwithstanding the men were mostly recruits, not one flinched under fire.
                    During the night of the 15th and 16th we fell back to Cedar Creek, where we
                    halted, and I posted stations of observation between us and the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 17th I opened the following stations of observation: At Round Hill, on the
                    right one and one-half miles beyond picket-line, and on the left outside of the
                    pickets to watch Luray Valley and Manassas Gap, and all to communicate direct to
                    headquarters. I also sent Lieut. Merritt and Brault, with twenty men, to Newtown
                    to open station of observation, and if possible, to find a place visible from
                    headquarters, otherwise to report by courier, and in certain events to use a
                    preconcerted rocket code, to go beyond Newtown at night, keep concealed, and
                    send scouts to Winchester, to fall back to Middletown at daylight.</p>
<p>On the 18th I opened an additional station at Round Top (being Strasburg),
                    sending Lieut.'s Jones and Fortney with a guard of two companies of infantry to
                    watch the Valley and to communicate with headquarters through Round Top.</p>
<p>On the 19th Gen. Sigel directed Round Top station to be discontinued to-night and
                    resumed in the morning. I procured fifty axes for the infantry to clear the
                    hill, and on the 20th at daylight the station was resumed. This night (20th)
                    Gen. Sigel again ordered the station discontinued, the party to fall back to
                    Fisher's Hill and return in the morning. I presume Gen. Sigel considered the
                    guard too weak to leave so far out in the night, and could not spare more troops
                    for the duty. He gave no reason for the order.</p>
<p>On the 20th I also placed additional stations at Cedar Creek on our right, and at
                    Front Royal, left front.</p>
<p>During all the time we lay at Cedar Creek, from the 16th to the 26th, I used
                    every opportunity for drilling officers and men, and the actual signal service
                    they had to perform was of benefit in their instruction. Under Maj.-Gen. Hunter,
                    preparations were commenced for our march on the 22d. On the 23d we sent to
                    Martinsburg all baggage, surplus transportation, and sick, but did not march
                    till the 26th.</p>
<p>On the 26th we marched to Pugh's Creek. During the march I kept communication
                    between headquarters and a cavalry column on a parallel road to the right, also
                    with advance and rear guard. I left a station at Round Top with a guard of two
                    companies of infantry, and after halting placed stations of observation at
                    extreme front on right and left. We remained at Woodstock till the 29th, when we
                    marched to Rude's Hill, and after halting opened a line to the front beyond New
                    Market. We remained here until June 2, when we marched to Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>This march was made on three parallel roads, and all the columns and our advance
                    and rear were kept in communication with headquarters during the march. We
                    skirmished with the enemy during most of this march. After halting I established
                    stations outside of our pickets in front. We remained at Harrisonburg during the
                    3d.</p>
<p>On the 4th the main column marched by a direct road to Port Republic, while a
                    feint was made on the enemy's front on the Valley pike by a cavalry force.
                    During this day communication was kept open between headquarters and the column
                    on the pike, and with our front, rear, and flanks, and from several points of
                    observation. We bivouacked after passing the town, and I made stations on right
                    and left front.</p>
<p>On the 5th, marching in the presence of the enemy, I kept out signal parties as
                    far as possible in front and on our flanks. We commenced skirmishing early in
                    the morning and drove the enemy to a point near Piedmont, where he had a line of
                    defense. This we took, driving him back to second line, where he stood. After
                    much fighting and unsuccessful attacks from each side alternately, the day was
                    decided by an attack of our infantry reserve on the enemy's right flank, where
                    he had massed in front of us. The enemy gave way, and the attack being followed
                    by the charge of a brigade of cavalry, he broke, and was routed with heavy loss.
                    During the fight the signal detachment was kept actively employed on the flanks
                    and in every position from which the enemy or the roads could be seen. Gen.
                    Hunter spoke in warmest terms of commendation of the service rendered by it. At
                    evening I sent Lieut. Muhleman, escorted by a squadron of cavalry, to
                    reconnoiter the enemy's position and report by signal, if practicable. He
                    returned, having been nearly at Staunton, finding no indications of the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 6th we marched to Staunton, and I established stations of observation on
                    the hills in rear of and flanking the city, and believing the enemy to be
                    between us and Waynesborough I established a station to overlook the roads in
                    that direction. It being reported that Gen. Averell was at Buffalo Gap, I sent
                    Lieut.'s Merritt, Ellis, and Muhleman, escorted by 200 cavalry, to meet him and
                    open signal communication with him.</p>
<p>On the 7th we marched on the Buffalo Gap road, and when two miles out, we met the
                    party returning from the gap. They had been through it and ten miles beyond,
                    above it. Averell had not been there, but rumor placed him at Goshen. The party
                    had passed through the camp of a brigade of cavalry, which had been abandoned on
                    their approach, they being undoubtedly mistaken by the enemy for the advance of
                    our main army. On this report Gen. Hunter decided to return to Staunton, and,
                    having returned, I established stations as before.</p>
<p>On the 8th Gen. Crook's column joined us.</p>
<p>On the 9th, at evening, in view of our march in the morning, I detailed Lieut.'s
                    Merritt and Butcher, with fifteen men, to report to Gen. Averell, and Lieut.'s
                    Muhleman and Fortney, with fifteen men, to report to Gen. Crook, it being
                    arranged that the column should march on four roads.</p>
<p>On the 10th we marched, and at night headquarters halted at Midway. During the
                    march the country was so broken that no points of communication between the
                    columns could be found.</p>
<p>On the 11th we marched to Lexington. During this march communication was opened
                    with Gen. Crook, who first found the enemy. There was some fighting in front of
                    the town, but the enemy was speedily driven out. Crook remained south of the
                    river, and stations were opened to the front and to Gen. Crook's headquarters.
                    We remained at Lexington till the 14th.</p>
<p>On the 12th Gen. Averell was sent to Buchanan, Lieut.'s Merritt and Butcher going
                    with him.</p>
<p>On the 14th the main force was marched to Buchanan on two parallel roads.
                    Communication was very much interrupted between the columns during the march,
                    owing to the ruggedness of the country. About three miles before reaching
                    Buchanan communication was established between all the separate commands.</p>
<p>On the 15th we marched toward Liberty and halted beyond the Peaks Otter. I had a
                    station of observation on the peak during the day, which was opened as soon
                    after daylight as our skirmishers could clear the peak of the enemy, and this
                    station I kept open during the night and until the last of the rear guard had
                    passed.</p>
<p>On the 16th we marched toward Lynchburg, and at night halted at Big Otter Creek.
                    There was much skirmishing to-day, and stations were established from every
                    point of observation during the march and at the front at night.</p>
<p>On the 17th we marched toward Lynchburg, meeting the enemy in some force and
                    having severe skirmishing all day, and at last lines of battle were formed and a
                    brisk action resulted in driving the enemy to his works, within two miles of
                    Lynchburg, when darkness ended the day's fighting and we bivouacked in line.
                    During the day signals were extensively used on the march, and many points of
                    observation were taken and reported from by the officers, and at night stations
                    were established at right, left, front, and rear.</p>
<p>On the 18th skirmishing opened at daylight and continued more or less severe,
                    with occasional demonstrations in force, till 1 p. m., when we found the enemy
                    in strong force, having been heavily re-enforced during the night of the 17th,
                    and occupying strong works, extending from the James River to an almost
                    impassable ravine, each bank strengthened by redoubts. Crook reconnoitered the
                    enemy's right, without finding any practicable point of attack. Lieut. Ellis was
                    sent with Gen. Duffie, who was detached to make a feint around the enemy's right
                    on the city. Lieut. Ellis kept headquarters constantly advised of his movements
                    and progress during his march through an intermediate station upon a house on
                    our left. At 1 o'clock we repulsed an attack in force and made afterward two
                    unsuccessful efforts to take their works. At dark we fell back toward Liberty.
                    Signals were used during the fighting on portions of the field, but principally
                    between headquarters and the detachment.</p>
<p>During the 19th and 20th we fell back, the enemy pursuing and pushing us hard and
                    passed Buford's Gap, where we halted. I threw out parties of observation on all
                    the mountains surrounding and to overlook the rear. The party on the left, under
                    Lieut. Muhleman, were attacked and compelled to fall back, losing Privates Best
                    and Cunningham captured, having straggled from camp. We continued our march all
                    the night of the 20th, and at 5 a. m. of the 21st reached Salem.</p>
<p>Our march was continued on the 21st after a short halt at Salem. This day
                    communication was kept between Gen. Duffie in Catawba Valley and Gen. Averell in
                    the Fort Lewis Valley by means of a station on Catawba Mountain under Lieut.
                    Merritt. After Averell's passage, I directed Lieut.'s Butcher and Muhleman to
                    remain on Catawba Mountain to observe the enemy on roads in our rear. Later I
                    withdrew Lieut. Butcher and sent him with Lieut. Merritt with Gen. Averell, and
                    sent Lieut. Ellis with Gen. Duffie on reconnaissance, and arranged a rocket code
                    to be used if needed.</p>
<p>On the 22d we marched to New Castle. I left Lieut.'s Muhleman and Fortney to
                    observe the enemy from Craig's Creek Mountain until the rear guard had passed,
                    keeping headquarters advised of movements. Once after passage of the rear guard,
                    before this station was recalled, it was driven in by the enemy, but a cavalry
                    detachment being sent to its aid it was re-established.</p>
<p>On the 23d we marched to Sweet Springs. During the passage of troops and trains
                    communication was maintained from Potts' to Peter's Mountain and thence to Sweet
                    Springs.</p>
<p>During the 24th and 25th we marched to Meadow Bluff by way of White Sulphur
                    Springs and Lewisburg. At White Sulphur Springs Sullivan with Duffie diverged
                    toward Beverly, while Crook with Averell marched toward Charleston. I sent
                    Lieut. Fortney with Sullivan and Ellis with Duffie.</p>
<p>On the 26th Gen. Hunter with his staff, having passed Meadow Bluff and the enemy
                    having ceased pursuit, rode on in advance with the escort (a squadron of
                    cavalry) and the reserve signal detachment, halting at night at Widow Jones'
                    house.</p>
<p>On the 27th headquarters reached Loup Creek by way of Gauley Bridge, where we
                    encamped to await the arrival of troops. The men and horses had suffered greatly
                    from want of supplies, which had been ordered to be sent from Gauley to them,
                    and a great deal of disorganization was the result. There I encamped what men
                    and officers I had and remained till the 30th, when we marched to Camp Piatt on
                    the Kanawha, and thence took a steamer to Charleston. By Gen. Hunter's order I
                    directed the signal detachment to remain at Camp Piatt till morning and then
                    march to Charleston, at which place the party arrived July 1.</p>
<p>On the 3d of July, after starting the detachment under charge of Lieut. Merritt
                    to march to Parkersburg, I accompanied Gen. Hunter and staff by steamer to
                    Parkersburg, where we arrived July 4, where Gen. Hunter learned of the enemy's
                    invasion of Maryland and made disposition to hasten forward troops.</p>
<p>On the 5th I opened communication with Blennerhassett Landing, having neither
                    officers nor equipments, and but one man who was able to read fairly, but he and
                    I kept open communication with apparatus improvised, until the detachment
                    arrived on the 6th.</p>
<p>On the 5th I opened communication with Blennerhassett Landing, having neither
                    officers nor equipments, and but one man who was able to read fairly, but he and
                    I kept open communication with apparatus improvised, until the detachment
                    arrived on the 6th.</p>
<p>On the 7th Gen. Hunter directed me to open a line to Buffington Bar. I took
                    Lieut.'s Ellis and Jones and Merritt and Sergeants Price and Burkhardt and
                    opened the line, stationing them in the following order, viz, Fortney, Price,
                    Burkhardt, Merritt, Ellis.</p>
<p>On the 9th I returned to Parkersburg and found that Gen. Hunter had gone to
                    Cumberland and sent telegraphic orders to me to call in all officers and men and
                    follow. Accordingly I sent a steamer down toward Buffington for the parties and
                    on the 10th forwarded what men and horses were at Parkersburg, and on the 11th
                    followed with the balance, overtaking the first train at Cumberland at 10.20 p.
                    m., where I reported to Gen. Hunter and he directed me to proceed with my party
                    to Martinsburg and report to Gen. Sullivan. I started at 12 o'clock midnight,
                    the first train having been sent on earlier, and on the morning of the 12th
                    arrived at Cherry Run, and thence marched to Martinsburg and reported to Gen.
                    Sullivan. Private Mateer, who had been captured and paroled, informed me that
                    Sergeant Brown and 1 or 2 other men had been captured.</p>
<p>Gen. Sullivan started at 3 p. m. on the 13th for Harper's Ferry. At 1 o'clock I
                    had sent Lieut.'s Merritt and Brault to Maryland. Heights, but they were
                    bushwhackers and driven back, but meeting the escort of Gen.'s Sigel and Stahel
                    they drove the enemy and got through and opened communication.</p>
<p>At 3 a. m. on the 14th I marched with my party to Harper's Ferry, arriving there
                    at 9.30 a. m. There I found Lieut. Thayer and Kennedy, from Department of the
                    Susquehanna, for temporary duty. I sent Lieut. Merritt to Stone Fort, on
                    Maryland Heights, Lieut.'s Jones to Bolivar Heights, Lieut. Butcher to Point of
                    Rocks, Lieut.'s Ellis and Brault to Sugar Loaf Mountain. Lieut. Kennedy, who had
                    been on Sugar Loaf Mountain, came in and reported a rebel wagon train heavily
                    guarded crossing to Virginia at White's Ferry.</p>
<p>On the 15th Gen. Hunter arrived at Harper's Ferry, and he made a new disposition
                    of troops to guard the Valley. Gen. Sullivan was sent toward Leesburg, and I
                    sent Sergeant Strong to him to communicate by way of Maryland Heights, having no
                    officer to send. Having heard that Gen. Wright was at Poolesville, I reported it
                    to Gen. Hunter, and suggested the practicability of opening communication with
                    him. Gen. Hunter desired me to do so, and at 3.30 p. m. I started with Lieut.
                    Fortney and twenty men, and reached Poolesville at 12.30 a. m. and opened
                    communication by way of Sugar Loaf Mountain, Point of Rocks, and Maryland
                    Heights.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th Gen. Wright requested me to carry some dispatches and
                    some verbal information to Gen. Hunter; so leaving Lieut. Fortney at
                    Poolesville, with orders to remain till Wright's corps had passed, and then when
                    he could to communicate with Wright to return to department headquarters, I
                    returned to Harper's Ferry. Gen. Crook having relieved Sullivan, occupied
                    Hillsborough, and we were in communication with him through the Maryland
                    Heights.</p>
<p>On the 17th Lieut. A. W. Bariteau, Fifth New York Artillery, having been detailed
                    by Gen. Howe, I had the order confirmed by Gen. Hunter. Gen. Wright having
                    crossed the Catoctin Mountain communicated direct with Maryland Heights, and I
                    discontinued the stations at Poolesville and Sugar Loaf.</p>
<p>Having had no communication with Wright during the 18th and 19th, Gen. Hunter
                    directed me to go with a party and learn his movements if possible. Accordingly
                    I started, and that night (19th) bivouacked at White's Ferry. On the 20th I
                    learned that he had gone through Snicker's Gap, and no communication could be
                    had with him, so I returned on the 21st. That day I sent Lieut.'s Jones and
                    Butcher to Gen. Crook, and Muhleman to Averell.</p>
<p>On the 22d I went to Martinsburg and got some stores, and that evening returned
                    to Harper's Ferry. Having got news of the death of a friend making my presence
                    necessary, I obtained leave of absence for four days (from the 23d).</p>
<p>On the 28th I reached headquarters on my return, having been delayed at Baltimore
                    by trains moving irregularly in consequence of rebel raids on the railroad. On
                    arrival I found that the enemy had driven our forces out of Martinsburg. All the
                    signal detachment but Lieut. Muhleman was at headquarters, under Lieut. Thayer,
                    who had them in good condition. I got all in readiness to march, drew stores,
                    and rearranged the working parties and the reserve. Gen. Wright's troops had
                    moved in and halted at Halltown.</p>
<p>On the 30th Gen. Hunter's whole command, which now included Wright's troops, was
                    put on march toward Frederick City. At Weverton, on his suggestion, I sent
                    Lieut. Thayer with Lieut. Jones and twenty men to Frederick, thence to go to the
                    Catoctin Mountain and get any news of the enemy. If no enemy was found this side
                    of the Catoctin, to go along the range in the morning in the direction of
                    Gettysburg and report often, by signal when practicable, and at other times by
                    courier. To-night headquarters halted at Knoxville.</p>
<p>On the 31st we reached Frederick, and the troops were encamped in front and rear
                    of city. Thayer reported from Frederick while on the march that no enemy was
                    there, and he would go on toward Emmitsburg. I sent Lieut. Ellis out from
                    Frederick to try to communicate with Thayer, and sent word to Thayer to go
                    toward Chambersburg and report often. Gen. Crook having diverged by way of
                    Middletown, I sent Lieut. Merritt to Middletown to report to Gen. Crook, and
                    Lieut. Fortney to Catoctin Mountain, near the road, to communicate with Merritt
                    and headquarters at Frederick. This line kept Gen. Crook in communication with
                    headquarters during his march toward Emmitsburg. The enemy being reported at
                    Noland's Ferry, Gen. Hunter desired a station at Sugar Loaf and directed Gen.
                    Emory to furnish a guard for it. Accordingly I sent Lieut. Brault, with twelve
                    men, with orders to keep very vigilant watch, and also to send out scouts and
                    report often. Lieut. Ellis reported from High Rock that Chambersburg was burned
                    yesterday; Couch gone to Carlisle; Averell has been at Greencastle and gone
                    toward Gettysburg.</p>
<p>On the 1st of August, Gen. Crook having moved out of sight of Fortney's station,
                    he moved three miles north on the range and reopened with him. Lieut. Brault
                    came in to-night, having left the mountain when a force of 250 cavalry (rebel)
                    had reached its foot (Sugar Loaf).</p>
<p>On the 2d headquarters were removed to Monocacy. Lieut. Ellis returned from
                    Emmitsburg, and I called in Fortney from Catoctin.</p>
<p>On the 3d I sent Lieut. Merritt to Point of Rocks to open station of observation
                    and to communicate with Sugar Loaf, which station I had re-established. I sent
                    Lieut. Brault with three sergeants and twenty-four men to patrol the river from
                    Noland's to Edwards Ferry, to divide the distance into three beats and assign a
                    sergeant with eight men to each beat, to report everything seen to Sugar Loaf. I
                    also sent Lieut. Fortney to Maryland Heights and Lieut. Ellis to McClellan
                    lookout, to start at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning, to report anything seen or
                    learned of the enemy. If Averell was within reach Ellis was to direct Lieut.
                    Muhleman to take McClellan station and proceed himself to Fairview.</p>
<p>On the 4th these parties started out, and the line was opened and worked
                    admirably to McClellan lookout. The following messages were received:</p>
<p>POINT OF ROCKS.</p>
<p>Citizens report Imboden at Leesburg with 1,500 men and four pieces of artillery.
                    Conscripting. No other force east of Blue Ridge. Mosby gone into the Valley.</p>
<p>MARYLAND HEIGHTS.</p>
<p>Column of the enemy approaching Charlestown.</p>
<p>MCCLELLAN--4 p. m.</p>
<p>Enemy approaching Harper's Ferry from Shepherdstown in force; four brigades of
                    cavalry and infantry; large wagon train.</p>
<p>I signaled Ellis to estimate enemy's force and report frequently.</p>
<p>MCCLELLAN--4.25 p. m.</p>
<p>Small party rebel cavalry in Sharpsburg.</p>
<p>MCCLELLAN--5.20 p. m.</p>
<p>Enemy still move toward Charlestown.</p>
<p>MCCLELLAN--5.40</p>
<p>I must leave; enemy very close to me.</p>
<p>Note.--Ellis had but six men and no guards.</p>
<p>I signaled Ellis to get a guard and remain. At 6 o'clock Maryland Heights
                    reported "Ellis gone." I signaled immediately to Maryland Heights to tell Ellis
                    we have a cavalry force at Antietam Furnace, to get a guard from it, and return
                    at once. At 11.30 p. m. Ellis, having resumed his station at McClellan lookout,
                    reported:</p>
<p>Large fire in Shepherdstown. Camp fires in the Valley.</p>
<p>On the 5th:</p>
<p>MARYLAND HEIGHTS--8.30 a. m.</p>
<p>Large body of infantry and cavalry, with ammunition train, north from
                    Shepherdstown.</p>
<p>Col. Vernon, commanding cavalry detachment, reports:</p>
<p>MCCLELLAN--9.15 p. m.</p>
<p>I attacked the enemy and drove him to Antietam Ford. He was re-enforced and drove
                    me into Lookout mountains. One wagon train moving toward Hagerstown; another
                    from Antietam Ford. A prisoner captured says Breckinridge is on this road.</p>
<p>The station at McClellan lookout was abandoned to-night, by reason of the enemy
                    getting between it and our lines.</p>
<p>On the 6th our forces marched to Harper's Ferry. Gen. Sheridan assumed command of
                    the military division, of which this department was a portion. Gen. Hunter's
                    staff was ordered to Cumberland.</p>
<p>On the 9th Gen. Crook, commanding Department of West Virginia, ordered me, in the
                    absence of any orders from Gen. Sheridan, to have my efficient officers and men
                    report to him, and with the others go to Cumberland and drill them, and when
                    well instructed join him them. Lieut. Thayer was directed with his party to
                    return to the Department of the Susquehanna. And with those officers and men
                    requiring instruction I marched to Cumberland, reaching there on the 12th. On
                    arrival at Cumberland, I placed Lieut. Eugene Clyde in arrest, and preferred
                    charges against him for absence without leave, fraud, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On the 13th I encamped my party at Cumberland, and remained there drilling
                    officers and men until the 27th.</p>
<p>On the 24th, having received orders to report to Gen. Sheridan with my party (by
                    telegraph from Washington), I made all haste, and marched on the 27th by way of
                    Williamsport, and reached Harper's Ferry on the evening of the 29th. I rested
                    the party till daylight, and on the morning of the 30th marched to Charlestown,
                    and reported to Gen. Sheridan.</p>
<p>On the 1st of September I received telegraphic orders to report at headquarters
                    Army of the Potomac, and on the 2d of September left Department of West
                    Virginia.</p>
<p>The officers and men of the detachment all did remarkably well in the field
                    considering the disadvantages under which they labored in regard to want of
                    instruction and want of proper equipment before starting, excepting Lieut.
                    Merritt, who was very inefficient and, I think, of doubtful habits, and Lieut.
                    Clyde, who absented himself very much from his proper post of duty, and was
                    guilty of gross frauds against the Government.</p>
<p>Lieut. Ellis especially deserved mention for his zeal and ability.</p>
<p>My officers and myself were uniformly treated with consideration by all the
                    general officers under whom we served, and though with better opportunities for
                    preparation we might perhaps have done more service, yet they spoke in
                    commendatory terms of what we did do, particularly Gen. Hunter.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>FRANKLIN E. TOWN,<br> Capt., Signal Corps, U. S. Army.<br> Chief
                        Signal Officer, Department of West Virginia.</p>
