<p>Brig.-Gen. Buford,<br> Comdg. Cavalry Division:</p>
<p>Manassas Gap, Va.,</p>
<p>July 21, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>Your dispatch of this date is received. I will use every endeavor to find the whereabouts of
     the enemy. Prisoners captured, among whom are 2 commissioned officers, seem to indicate by
     their statements that Lee has not crossed the Shenandoah. I have tried every means to get the
     truth from them. A strong infantry force is reported in my front. I can hold this position
     against odds. I am now well to the west mouth of the Gap.</p>
<p>All the prisoners thus far captured belong to the Seventeenth Virginia Infantry. Some report
     they come from Staunton (convalescents). From all I can gather, Lee appears to be in the
     direction of Bunker Hill or Winchester, as I can get no report of his having crossed the
     Shenandoah. All the prisoners hitherto captured report that they have waded. Corse's division,
     to which the prisoners belong, report that he (Corse) is about 10,000 strong. A member of the
     signal corps reports a large wagon train on the other side of the river, and a column of
     infantry and a battery on this side, moving this way. A regiment sent out to Front Royal
     reports within 2 1/2 miles of that place and no enemy. I can gain no further information up to
     this time.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>W. MERRITT,<br> Brig. Gen. of Volunteers, Comdg. Reserve Brigade.</p>
