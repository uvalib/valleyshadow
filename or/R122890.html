<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Major of Engineers W. H. C. Whiting reports on the defense of
                    Harper's Ferry in May, 1861. He mentions that a Union force is gathering in
                    Chambersburg to move on the town, and discusses the probable route of Federal
                    advance.</p>

<p>HARPER'S FERRY, VA.,</p>
<p>May 28, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consultation on the condition of Harper's Ferry and its defenses reduced to
                    writing.</p>
<p>The plan of the enemy, indicated by his movements, seems to be a cautious
                    approach to, and entrance of, disaffected district, securing his advance, if
                    possible, by securing the sentiments of the people. In the district to the
                    northwest of Harper's Ferry these tactics will be the best he can follow, on
                    account of known Union proclivities and the vicinity of the frontier.</p>
<p>Large bodies of troops are gathering at Carlisle and Chambersburg, the number
                    already reported (probably exaggerated) being fifteen thousand. When ready to
                    move they will occupy Martinsburg, crossing at Williamsport and Shepherdstown.
                    Martinsburg is well known to be disaffected. His line, established from
                    Martinsburg towards Shepherdstown, has an excellent base, and communications
                    very difficult to interrupt by the Hagerstown and Cumberland roads, and very
                    seriously threatens, not only Harper's Ferry, with its present forces and
                    conditions, but our whole line of operations. Martinsburg is nearer to
                    Winchester than the Ferry, and access easy. Our holding Winchester is necessary
                    to maintain the Ferry. To hold this post, then, either as a fortress, a point
                    d'appui, or as a condition of the defense of the Virginia Valley, we require a
                    force of from twelve to fifteen thousand men, of which two regiments should be
                    cavalry. The force now at the Ferry (about five thousand effectives) might
                    remain as at present, while the main body should be posted centrally, as at
                    Burns' Ford, on the Opequan, where a strong position might be selected, and, if
                    necessary, defended by lines. The strengthening and re-enforcement of this
                    force, as now constituted, seems to have ceased when most necessary. It is
                    essential that supplies of ammunition (especially of equipments of shoes) should
                    be forwarded in quantity, otherwise, without the arrangement designated, we are
                    so deficient in ammunition that this force must, on the advance of the enemy,
                    move out from the Ferry and maneuver, to prevent being shut up in a cul-de-sac.</p>
<p>The plan sketched above will absolutely force the enemy to very great delay and
                    vastly extended preparations. It continually (by way of Leesburg and the eastern
                    slope of the ridge) threatens the District of Columbia. If, however, he is
                    beforehand with us (besides the present disastrous results), he gains what may
                    take time, means, and men, on a similar scale, to recover.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>W.H.C. WHITING,<br> Maj. of Engineers.</p>
