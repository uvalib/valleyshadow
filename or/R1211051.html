<p>Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 5, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>A report from Col. Imboden, on the Shenandoah Mountains, states that the enemy,
                    who have recently been threatening Staunton, have fallen back beyond Beverly,
                    leaving a guard of about 200 men at that place. There are none of the enemy at
                    Moorefield, one company at Springfield, one at Paw Paw, one at the mouth of
                    Little Cacapon, and three at Oldtown, in Maryland. Milroy has retired to the
                    Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Gen. W. E. Jones, commanding in the valley, reports
                    that Gen.'s Cox and Milroy had marched from New Creek toward Martinsburg, and
                    that Gen. Geary, with his division, had advanced from Harper's Ferry to within 4
                    miles of Winchester on the evening of the 3d instant. Gen. Jones still held
                    Winchester on the 4th, having sent his trains to Strasburg. I have directed Gen.
                    Jones to call upon Col.'s Imboden and Davidson for re-enforcements, and directed
                    the latter officers to send to him all their available force. If Gen. Cox has
                    retired from the Kanawha Valley, our troops in the vicinity of Lewisburg could
                    operate to advantage under Gen. W. E. Jones. I request that Maj. Gen. Samuel
                    Jones be instructed accordingly, should the information communicated by Gen. W.
                    E. Jones be correct.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
