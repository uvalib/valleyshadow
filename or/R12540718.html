<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones writes Robert E. Lee in April, 1863, regarding
                    movements of troops to Staunton in preparation for General John Imboden's raid
                    into West Virginia.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Gen. R. E. LEE,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c., Camp near
                        Fredericksburg, Va.:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>April 13, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have just now received your letter of the 7th instant. I very much regret that
                    you cannot send the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Virginia Regiments to Imboden.
                    The Fiftieth Virginia, which I sent you to take the place of the Twenty-fifth
                    and Thirty-first, under the impression that you would send the latter to
                    Imboden, left here on the 7th, the date of your letter, and must have reached
                    your camp in time to enable you to send the two last-named regiments to Imboden,
                    as the latter does not move until the 15th instant, as I informed you in my
                    letter of the 8th instant. I hope, therefore, that notwithstanding your letter
                    of the 7th instant, the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first are before this en route
                    to Staunton.</p>
<p>Imboden's force was entirely too small to undertake the expedition, and I have
                    added about 1,400 men to it. I would have sent the Fiftieth Regt. to him also,
                    which would have increased my addition to the force by over 600 men, if I had
                    not supposed you would send the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Virginia
                    Regiments.</p>
<p>With great respect, general, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
