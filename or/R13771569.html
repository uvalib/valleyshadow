<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William Averell writes to General Darius Couch, commanding at
                    Chambersburg, concerning pursuit of raiding Confederate forces and fighting
                    around Hancock, Maryland, in August, 1864.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. COUCH, Chambersburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>HANCOCK, MD.,</p>
<p>August 1, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I overtook and attacked the enemy at this place last evening. An iron-clad car
                    had endeavored to prevent their crossing, but it was driven away with artillery.
                    Enemy sent over a party and destroyed the railroad buildings. I found them in
                    line of battle on a strong position on this side, from which they fled after a
                    short engagement. Controlling the ford with my guns the enemy could not cross,
                    but my small force could not prevent him taking the road to Cumberland, upon
                    which he kept up his flight during the night, felling trees and burning bridges,
                    rendering it impossible for my weary command to continue the pursuit with any
                    chance of success. I sent a messenger to Cacapon to telegraph to Gen. Kelley the
                    course taken, requesting that a railroad train be sent to take up my command
                    dismounted, but have received no reply. If my train has not been sent with
                    supplies, please forward it to Hagerstown, notifying me by telegraph at
                    McConnellsburg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
