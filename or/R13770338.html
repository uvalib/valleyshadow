<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this July, 1864, dispatch, Union Cavalry officer H. T. McLean reports from
                    Greencastle on his efforts to oppose Confederate forces raiding north of the
                    Potomac. He mentions plans to fall back on Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Maj. SCHULTZE.</p>
<p>GREENCASTLE,</p>
<p>July 6, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was being flanked at Muttontown and have fallen back to this place. I have all
                    the roads picketed here, and will try and hold out as long as I can. Lieut.
                    Torrence, Fourteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, and 20 of his men were
                    taken in consequence of his having gone farther than I directed; 1 corporal and
                    5 of my men were captured with him. The force pressed me very hard at
                    Hagerstown, and I was being surrounded when I left and fought them all the way
                    to Muttontown. If they come upon me here I will give them the best turn I can
                    and fall back upon Chambersburg if I am driven. Please send me rations for 100
                    men as soon as you can. I am completely out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. T. MCLEAN,<br> First Lieut., Sixth Cavalry.</p>
