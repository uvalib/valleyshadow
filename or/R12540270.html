<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Schenck writes Robert Milroy in April, 1863, concerning
                    movements in western Virginia. Schenck guesses that Confederate forces may be
                    stationed at Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. R. H. MILROY, Winchester, Va.:</p>
<p>BALTIMORE,</p>
<p>April 27, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have communicated with Gen. Halleck. He says:</p>
<p>I think Elliott should have full power to act at his discretion as he may learn
                    the movements of the enemy. He is capable and prudent.</p>
<p>You will instruct Gen. Elliott accordingly.</p>
<p>I telegraphed Gen. Halleck that I thought the movement you suggested to Woodstock
                    and Harrisonburg, though bold, yet practicable, and such as would probably prove
                    effective and successful. It would be necessary, however, to move quickly, and
                    to be guarded against the enemy, possibly now at Staunton and east of the Blue
                    Ridge.</p>
<p>My latest dispatch from the railroad to-day reports:</p>
<p>Telegraph and railroad at Cranberry destroyed. The rebels crossed at Cranberry
                    early this morning, from 800 to 1,000 strong, their destination Kingwood.</p>
<p>Gen. Jones has started a force to Fellowsville, thence to Tunnelton or Newburg.
                    This will completely surround Rowlesburg and cut off all communication.</p>
<p></p>
<p> ROBT. C. SCHENCK,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
