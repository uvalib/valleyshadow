<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Winfield Scott Hancock proposes plans for operations in the
                    Shenandoah Valley in this March, 1865, dispatch to Secretary of War Edwin
                    Stanton. Hancock plans to use Staunton as a meeting point and supply base for
                    his armies.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War</p>
<p></p>
<p>MARCH 24, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The cavalry is at present stationed as follows: One brigade near Fairfax
                    Court-house; about 2,500 with the Army of the Shenandoah; about 2,000 in the
                    Kanawha Valley; one regiment at Philippi, and one at New Creek, in West
                    Virginia.</p>
<p>The infantry to be drawn from the line of the railroad and the regiments at
                    Philippi and New Creek could move safely down between Rich and Cheat Mountains
                    toward Springs and effect a junction with the cavalry from Charleston., Va., the
                    combined force meeting the main body of the army at Staunton, where a supply of
                    rations would have to be accumulated. A sufficient force of cavalry would return
                    with the supply trains and be kept along the railroad to look after the small
                    parties of guerrillas left in rear.</p>
<p>The cavalry from Fairfax would be available for a demonstration on the left and
                    to look after Mosby, and could then return to its position in front of
                    Washington.</p>
<p>I would move from Staunton with about 4,000 cavalry.</p>
<p>Throughout the western part of the State I would seize every serviceable horse,
                    no matter to whom it belonged, and destroy the supplies on which the roving
                    bands of guerrillas are subsisting.</p>
<p>The following disposition of troops left on the line of the railroad and at
                    Washington would be made in case of an advance: All the cavalry, infantry, and
                    artillery at Washington would be left intact, except one or two light batteries
                    I might require and about 3,000 infantry; a strong garrison at Harper's Ferry
                    and Maryland Heights. There are about forty-five block-house along the railroad
                    to be garrisoned by about 2,000 men. One for at Parkersburg, one at the bridge
                    over the Cheat River, one at New Creek, and one at Cumberland in which suitable
                    garrisons would be left. Cavalry would be left to picket the river below Harper'
                    Ferry and a regiment in front of New Creek. No extensive raid could be carried
                    out, in my opinion, while the army is operating up the Valley if supplies are
                    effectually destroyed as the army moves down.</p>
