<p>Maj. PENDLETON, <br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Hdqrs.
                        Second Corps. </p>
<p></p>
<p>January 21, 1863</p>
<p>Maj.:</p>
<p>In obedience to orders received from corps headquarters, I respectfully submit
                    the following report of the operations of Jackson's division during the period
                    which I had the honor to command it, being from September &amp; to December
                    12, 1862:</p>
<p>BATTLE OF SHARPSBURG.</p>
<p>Resting for two hours in a grove a mile from Sharpsburg, the division was again
                    put in motion, and took up its position on the extreme left, its right resting
                    on the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike. A double line was formed, the front,
                    composed of Jones and Winder's brigades, placed in an open field, under the
                    immediate command of Col. Grigsby; Taliaferro's and Starke's brigades, forming
                    the reserve, places at the edge of a wood, under the immediate command of
                    Brig.-Gen. Starke; the whole under the command of Brig. Gen. J. R. Jones. This
                    disposition was placed in the road on the right. A battery of the enemy, about
                    500 yards in front and to the right, was playing upon the troops of Hood's
                    division, which was on my right. Poague opened briskly upon it and silenced it
                    in twenty minutes. The skirmishers were warmly engaged until night. The troops
                    lay on their arms all night, the silence of which was broken by occasional
                    firing by the skirmishers.</p>
<p>At the dawn of day on the 17th the battle opened fiercely. A storm of shell and
                    grape fell upon the division from several batteries in front, and at very short
                    range, and from batteries of heavy guns on the extreme right, which enfiladed
                    the position of the division and took it in reverse. These batteries were
                    gallantly replied to by the batteries of the division, Poague's, Carpenter's,
                    Brockenbrough's, Raine's, Caxke's, and Wooding's. It was during this almost
                    unprecedented iron storm that a shell exploded a little above my head, and so
                    stunned and injured me that I was rendered unfit for duty, and retired from the
                    field, turning over the command to Brig.-Gen. Starke, who a half an hour
                    afterward advanced his lines to meet the infantry of the enemy, which was
                    approaching. The infantry became at once engaged, and the gallant and generous
                    Starke fell, pierced by three balls, and survived but a few moments. His fall
                    cast a gloom over the troops. They never for a moment faltered, but rushed upon
                    the enemy and drove him back. The struggle continued for several hours, the
                    enemy all the while receiving re-enforcements, and the division, not numbering
                    over 1,600 men at the beginning of the fight, having no support, was finally
                    compelled to tune moment, Col. Grigsby, commanding the division, rallied its
                    shattered columns and joined Gen. Early, and drove the enemy half a mile from
                    the field, capturing many prisoners and covering the field with the dead and
                    wounded of the enemy. After this repulse, the division was ordered back to a
                    grove to rest and get ammunition, when in the evening it again advanced to the
                    support of a battery, but did not again become engaged with the enemy.</p>
<p>In this bloody conflict the "Old Stonewall Division" lost nothing of its fair
                    name and fame. Having won a world-wide fame by its valor and endurance in the
                    splendid campaign in the valley, it entered upon another series of fights,
                    commencing at Richmond and going through Ceder Run, Manassa, Harper's Ferry, and
                    Sharpsburg, entering the last weary and worn, and reduced to the numbers of a
                    small brigade, with its officers stricken down in its many fierce engagements,
                    closing with a colonel commanding the division, captains commanding brigades,
                    and lieutenants commanding regiments. In this fight every officer and man was a
                    hero, and it would be invidious to mention particular names.</p>
<p>Winder's brigade was commanded successively by Col. Grigsby and Major (now
                    Lieut.-Col.) Williams, Fifth Virginia Regiment; Jones' brigade by Capts. [John
                    E.] Penn, [A. C.] PAGE, and [R. W.] Withers, the first two losing a leg;
                    Taliaferro's brigade by Col. J. W. Jackson and Col. Sheffield; Starke's brigade
                    by Gen. Starke, Col. L. A. Stafford, Ninth Louisiana Regiment, and Col. Edmund
                    Pendleton, Fifteenth Louisiana Regiment.</p>
<p>Inclosed are reports of the various brigade commanders, which give more
                    particularly the parts take by their brigades.</p>
<p>The list of casualties has already been furnished, amounting to about 700, killed
                    and wounded.</p>
<p>This brief report is respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>J. R. JONES, <br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding. </p>
