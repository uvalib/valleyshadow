<p>General</p>
<p></p>
<p>April 27, 1863</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>I have the honor herewith to submit to you a report of the operations of my
                    command from August 15 to September 5, 1862, embracing the several engagements
                    of Manassas Junction, Bristoe Station, Ox Hill, and so much of the battle of
                    Groveton (on August 28, 29, and 30) as was fought by the troops under my
                    command:</p>
<p>The next morning (29th) I found that he had abandoned the ground occupied as the
                    battle-field, the evening before and had move farther to the east and to my
                    left, placing himself between my command and the Federal capital. My troops on
                    this day were distributed along and in the vicinity of the cut of an unfinished
                    railroad (intended as a part of the track to connect the Manassas road directly
                    with Alexandria), stretching from the Warrenton turnpike in the direction of
                    Sudley's Mill. It was mainly along the excavation of this unfinished road that
                    my line of battle was formed on the 29th--Jackson's division, under Brig.-Gen.
                    Starke, on the right, Ewell's division, under Brig.-Gen. Lawton, in the center,
                    and Hill's division of the left.</p>
<p>In the morning, about 10 o'clock, the Federal artillery opened with spirit and
                    animation upon our right, which was soon replied to by the batteries of Poague,
                    carpenter, dement, Brockenbrough, and Latimer, under Maj. [L. M.] Shumaker. This
                    lasted for some time, when the enemy moved around more to our left to another
                    point of attack. His next effort was directed against our left. This was
                    vigorously repulsed by the batteries of Braxton, Crenshaw, and Pegram.</p>
<p>About 2 p. m. the Federal infantry in large force advanced to the attack of our
                    left, occupied by the division of Gen. Hill. It pressed forward, in defiance of
                    our fatal and destructive fire, with great determination, a portion of it
                    crossing a deep cut in the railroad track and penetrating in heavy force an
                    interval of nearly 175 yards, which separated the right of Gregg's from the left
                    of Thomas brigade. For a short time Gregg's brigade, on the extreme left, was
                    isolated from the main body of the command; but the Fourteenth South Carolina
                    Regiment, then in reserve, with the Forty-ninth Georgia, left of Col. Thomas,
                    attacked the exultant enemy with vigor, and drove them back across the railroad
                    track with great slaughter. Gen. McGowan reports that the opposing forces at one
                    time delivered their volleys into each other at the distance of 10 paces.
                    Assault after assault was made on the left, exhibiting on the part of the enemy
                    great pertinacity and determination, but every advance was most successfully and
                    gallantly driven back.</p>
<p>Gen. Hill reports that six separate and distinct assault were thus met and
                    repulsed by his division, assisted by Hays' brigade, Col. Forno commanding.</p>
<p>By this time the brigade of Gen. Gregg, which from its position on the extreme
                    left was most exposed to the enemy's attack, had nearly expended its ammunition.
                    It had suffered severely in its men, and all its field officers except two were
                    killed or wounded. About 4 o'clock it had been assisted by Hays' brigade (Col.
                    Forno). It was now retired to the rear to take some repose after seven hours of
                    severe service, and Gen. Early's brigade, of Ewell's division, with the Eighth
                    Louisiana regiment, took its place. On reaching his position Gen. Early found
                    that the enemy had obtained possession of the railroad and a piece of wood in
                    front, there being at this point a deep cut, which furnished a strong defense.
                    Moving through a field he advanced upon the enemy, drove them from the wood and
                    railroad cut with great slaughter, and followed in pursuit some 200 yards; the
                    Thirteenth Georgia at the same timed advanced to the railroad and crossed with
                    Early's brigade. As it was not desirable to bring on a general engagement that
                    evening Gen. Early was recalled to the railroad, where Thomas, Pender, and
                    Archer had firmly maintained their position during the day. Early kept his
                    position there until the following morning.</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. Field and Col. Forno (commanding Hays' brigade) were severely wounded.
                    Brig.-Gen. Trimble was also seriously wounded.</p>
<p>During the day a force of the enemy penetrated the wood in my rear, endangering
                    the safety of my ambulances and train. Upon being advised of this by Gen. Stuart
                    I sent a body of infantry to drive them from the wood; but in the mean time the
                    vigilant Pelham had unlimbered his battery and dispersed that portion of them
                    which had reached the wood. At a later period Maj. [William] Patrick, of the
                    cavalry, who was by Gen. Stuart intrusted with guarding the train, was attacked,
                    and although it was promptly and effectually refused, it was not without the
                    loss of that intrepid officer, who fell in the attack while setting an example
                    of gallantry to his men well worthy of imitation. During the day the commanding
                    general arrived and also Gen. Longstreet with his command.</p>
<p>On the following day (30th) my command occupied the ground and the divisions the
                    same relative position to each other and to the field which they held the day
                    before, forming the left wing of the army, Gen. Longstreet's command forming the
                    right wing. A large quantity of artillery was posted upon a commanding eminence
                    in the center. After some desultory skirmishing and heavy cannonading during the
                    day the Federal infantry, about 4 o'clock in the evening, moved from under cover
                    of the wood and advanced in several lines, first engaging the right, but soon
                    extending its attack to the center and left. In a few moments our entire line
                    was engaged in a fierce and sanguinary struggle with the enemy. As one line was
                    repulsed another took its place and pressed forward as if determined by force of
                    numbers and fury of assault to drive us from our positions. So impetuous and
                    well sustained were these onset as to induce me to send to the commanding
                    general for re-enforcements, but the timely and gallant advance of Gen.
                    Longstreet on the right relieved my troops from the pressure of overwhelming
                    numbers and gave to those brave men the chances of a more equal conflict. As
                    Longstreet pressed upon the right the Federal advance was checked, and soon a
                    general advance of my whole line was ordered. Eagerly and fiercely did each
                    brigade press forward, exhibiting in parts of the field scenes of close
                    encounter and murderous strife not witnessed often in the turmoil of battle. The
                    Federals gave way before our troops, fell back in disorder, and fled
                    precipitately, leaving their dead and wounded on the field. During their retreat
                    the artillery opened with destructive power upon the fugitive masses. The
                    infantry followed until darkness put and end to the pursuit.</p>
<p>Our loss was heavy; that of the enemy, as shown by the battle-field, of which we
                    were in possession, much heavier. Among the losses was Col. Baylor, commanding
                    Winder's brigade, who fell in front of his brigade while nobly leading and
                    cheering it on the charge. We captured eight pieces of artillery, with their
                    caissons, and 6,520 small-arms were collected from the battle-field.</p>
<p>It being ascertained next morning that the Federal Army had retreated in the
                    direction of Centreville, I was ordered by the commanding general to turn that
                    position, crossing Bull Run at Sudley Ford; thence pursuing a country road until
                    we reached the Little River turn-pike, which we followed in the direction of
                    Fairfax Court-House until the troops halted for the night.</p>
<p>Early the next morning (September 1) we moved forward, and late in the evening,
                    after reaching Ox Hill, came in contact with the enemy, who were in position on
                    our right and front, covering his line of retreat from Centerville to Fairfax
                    Court-House. Our line of battle was formed, Gen. Hill's division on the right,
                    Ewell's division, Gen. Lawton commanding, in the center, and Jackson's division,
                    Gen. Starke commanding, on the left, all on the right of the turnpike road.
                    Artillery was posted on an eminence to the left of the road. The brigades of
                    Branch and Field, Col. [J. M.] Brockenbrough commanding the latter, were sent
                    forward to feel and engage the enemy. A cold and drenching thunder-shower swept
                    over the field at this time, striking directly into the faces of our troops.
                    These two brigades gallantly engaged the enemy, but so severe was the fire in
                    front and flank of Branch's brigade as to produce in it some disorder and
                    falling back. The brigades of Gregg, Thomas, and Pender were then thrown into
                    the fight. Soon a portion of Ewell's division became engaged. The conflict now
                    raged with great fury, the enemy obstinately and desperately contesting the
                    ground until their generals (Kearny and Stevens) fell in front of Thomas'
                    brigade, after which they retired from the field. By the following morning the
                    Federal Army had entirely disappeared from our view, and it soon appeared, by a
                    report from Gen. Stuart, that it had passed Fairfax Court-House and had moved in
                    the direction of Washington City.</p>
<p>On September 3 we left Ox Hill, taking the road by Dranesville and Leesburg, and
                    on the 4th bivouacked near the Big Spring between Leesburg and the Potomac.</p>
<p>The official reports of the casualties of my command in its operations from the
                    Rappahannock to the Potomac will show a loss of 75 officers killed and 273
                    wounded, 730 non-commissioned officers and privates killed, 3,273 wounded, and
                    35 missing, making a total loss of 4,387.</p>
<p>Col. S. Crutchfield, chief of artillery, discharged his duties well. The conduct
                    of officers and men during the various engagements described was such as to
                    entitle them to great praise. The wounded were skillfully cared for my medical
                    director Dr. Hunter McGuire.</p>
<p>In the transmission of orders I was greatly assisted during the expedition by the
                    following members of my staff: Col. A. Smead, assistant inspector-general; Maj.
                    E. F. Paxton, acting assistant adjutant-general; Capt. R. E. Wilbourn, chief
                    signal officer; First Lieut. H. K. Douglas, assistant inspector-general; First
                    Lieut. J. G. Morrison, aide-de-camp, and Col. William L. Jackson, volunteer
                    aide-de-camp. Capt. Wilbourn was so severely wounded at the battle of Groveton
                    as to be unable to go farther with the army. The ordnance, quartermaster's, and
                    commissary departments were well managed by their respective chiefs, Majs. G. H.
                    Bier, J. A. Harman, and W. J. Hawks.</p>
<p>For further information respecting the detailed movements of troops and the
                    conduct of individuals I would respectfully refer you to the accompanying
                    reports. For these great and signal victories our sincere and humble thanks are
                    due unto Almighty God. We should in all things acknowledge the hand of Him who
                    reigns in heaven and rules among the armies of men. In view of the arduous
                    labors and great privations the troops were called to endure and the isolated
                    and perilous position which the command occupied while engaged with
                    greatly-superior numbers of the enemy we can but express the grateful conviction
                    of our mind that God was with us and gave to us the victory, and unto His holy
                    name be the praise.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>T.J. JACKSON,<br> Lieut.-Gen. </p>
