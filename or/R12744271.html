<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June and July, 1863, New York State Militia troops participated in the defense
                    of Pennsylvania during Robert E. Lee's invasion of the state. In this dispatch,
                    Watson A. Fox, Colonel of the 74th New York National Guard Regiment, reports on
                    the role his men played in the campaign. Among other things, he mentions sending
                    prisoners to Chambersburg, and waiting with his men on the muddy sidewalks of
                    the town before departing to put down the New York City draft riots.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. Nelson Randall,<br> Comdg. Eighth Division, New
                        York National Guard.</p>
<p>Buffalo,</p>
<p>September 10, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>In compliance with your order of the 8th instant, issued in accordance with an
                    order of His Excellency Governor Seymour, dated June 17, I have the honor to
                    submit the following report concerning the part taken by the Seventy-fourth
                    Regt., under my command, in repelling the late rebel raid into Pennsylvania, in
                    obedience to orders from general headquarters, dated Albany, June 16, 1863, and
                    promulgated to me Thursday, June 18:</p>
<p>In compliance with such orders, I immediately ordered my command to assemble at
                    the State arsenal at 7 o'clock the following morning, June 19, for the purpose
                    of proceeding to Harrisburg, Pa., in accordance with your orders. The line was
                    formed at 9 o'clock, with seven companies, 374 officers and men, without arms or
                    accouterments, in the midst of an immense assemblage of citizens. We took up our
                    line of march, preceded by the Sixty-fifth Regt., Col. Jacob Krettner, for the
                    New York and Erie Railroad, and, in company with that regiment, embarked on the
                    cars, and took our departure from Buffalo at 10 a. m. We took with us 1,500
                    cooked rations, issued by Capt. Sheldon Sturgeon, U. S. Army, mustering and
                    disbursing officer.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving Buffalo, I ordered my adjutant, James M. Johnson, with Lieut.
                    Elisha T. Smith, to remain, for the purpose of providing for the sending forward
                    of Company R, cavalry, Capt. Alexander Sloan, who were ordered to remain until
                    the day following, as only about half of his command had assembled, and Company
                    I, Capt. George B. Knight, of Akron, who could not join us on so short notice,
                    it being impossible to get orders to his command until after we had left; also
                    for the purpose of making the necessary provision for sending to the regiment
                    such members as were unable to leave with us, but would follow soon after. We
                    arrived in Harrisburg on Saturday, 20th instant, at 4 p. m. I immediately
                    reported to Maj.-Gen. Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna, and
                    was ordered to Camp Curtin, distant about 2 miles, to report to Col. Beaver,
                    commanding the camp, where we arrived at 5 p. m.; reported; drew wall tents, and
                    encamped.</p>
<p>Sunday, 21st.--Our quartermaster, Clark Dodge, drew two days' rations, and the
                    day was spent in cleaning up and getting our camp in order, it having rained
                    heavily throughout the night, completely flooding the camp.</p>
<p>Monday, 22d.--I drew from U. S. Quartermaster's Department uniforms for 450 men,
                    together with camp equipage, and from U. S. Ordnance Department 450 Springfield
                    rifled muskets, in very bad order; not one musket in order, having been used by
                    nine-months' Pennsylvania Volunteers. The day was spent in issuing uniforms to
                    the men and packing up their cast-off clothing, which was returned to Buffalo.
                    Company R, cavalry, Capt. Alexander Sloan, with 40 officers and men, arrived at
                    12 m., and were immediately quartered in camp. Maj.-Gen. Couch informed me that
                    it would not be possible for the Government to furnish horses for the company,
                    and he would be under the necessity of ordering their return. Upon acquainting
                    Capt. Sloan of the facts, he informed me that his company would be unwilling to
                    return, and, if permitted to remain, would serve as infantry, whereupon I
                    ordered necessary uniforms, arms, and accouterments to be issued to his command;
                    and, upon consultation with Maj.-Gen. Couch, he approved of my action, and paid
                    a deserved compliment to Capt. Sloan and his command, and desired them to
                    remain.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 23d.--Company I, Capt. George B. Knight, with 41 officers and men,
                    arrived, and were quartered in camp. Clothing was immediately issued to the
                    company. I also issued arms and accouterments to my entire command. To-day and
                    the day following were spent in cleaning up our muskets and accouterments, and
                    putting them in order. Camp Curtin was under the command of Col. Beaver, to whom
                    we were under many obligations for his kind attention to all our wants, and the
                    gentlemanly and soldierly treatment received at his hands. We are also indebted
                    to Capt. Ball, his gentlemanly assistant, for many favors received from him.
                    There were 12,000 soldiers in camp, each commandant regulating his own camp, and
                    establishing his own camp guard, without reference to any other regiment.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 24th.--His Excellency Governor Curtin, in company with Col. Beaver,
                    paid us a visit, and complimented me highly upon the appearance of my command,
                    pronouncing our camp the cleanest, best laid out and regulated on the ground,
                    and the regiment the best disciplined and best appearing of any among the troops
                    in camp. I thanked His Excellency for the compliment paid us, and believe that I
                    had just cause to feel proud of the appearance of my command.</p>
<p>Thursday, 25th.--Having been placed in command of the Thirty-first Brigade,
                    comprising the Sixty-fifth and Seventy-fourth Regiments, Col. Krettner, of the
                    Sixty-fifth, having returned to Buffalo on account of sickness in his family, I
                    received an order from Maj.-Gen. Couch to proceed the following day, at 9 a. m.,
                    to Mount Union, Pa., there to report to Col. J. W. Hawley, Twenty-ninth
                    Pennsylvania, commanding the post.</p>
<p>Friday, 26th.--The brigade, under my command, left Harrisburg by the Pennsylvania
                    Central Railroad at 2 p. m., and arrived at Mount Union, distant 86 miles from
                    Harrisburg, at 7 p. m., where I reported to Col. Hawley, and encamped for the
                    night.</p>
<p>Saturday, June 27.--I ordered five companies of the Sixty-fifth Regt., under
                    command of Lieut. Col. William F. Berens, commanding the regiment, about 5 miles
                    distant, to Bell's Mills, near the Juniata River, there to establish his
                    headquarters and picket the country in that region, and to protect the fords of
                    the river. The remaining two companies of that regiment, Company A, Capt.
                    Seeber, and Company B, Capt. Louis Krettner, I sent to guard a bridge across the
                    Blue Juniata, about 2 miles distant; also the Pennsylvania Canal and locks to
                    the village of Mapleton, about 4 miles distant. Three companies of the
                    Seventy-fourth Regt. were, immediately on our arrival at Mount Union, sent out
                    on picket at different points, distant from 2 to 4 miles, the remaining six
                    companies held as a reserve at Mount Union. This number out during our stay,
                    then relieved every two days until July 5. Mount Union is 86 miles from
                    Harrisburg, on the Pennsylvania Central Railroad, which crosses the Blue Juniata
                    River by a bridge costing over $ 1,000,000. The aqueduct of the Pennsylvania
                    Canal also crosses this river at the same point. These structures were
                    threatened by the enemy, and their destruction would have cut off all
                    communication between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg; hence this place was held to be
                    very important, and the utmost vigilance enjoined to guard it, and at the same
                    time avoid surprise from the enemy, on the alert, and all about us. Mount Union
                    was occupied by the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Militia, Col. J. W. Hawley, who
                    was in command of the post, and one company of cavalry, under the command of
                    Capt. B. Mortimer Morrow.</p>
<p>Immediately on our arrival, five companies of the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania were
                    ordered to Orbisonia, Pa., about 30 miles distant. Col. Hawley had two brass
                    12-pounders sent to him by Maj.-Gen. Couch, one of which was manned by picked
                    men from my command, and placed in command of Private Edward M. Allen, an
                    experienced artillerist and member of Company C. We were joined at Mount Union
                    by our worthy chaplain, Rev. G. W. Heacock, D. D., and about 60 men sent to us
                    by Adjutant James M. Johnson and Lieut. Elisha T. Smith. It would be difficult
                    to enumerate all the duties my regiment performed while at Mount Union; officers
                    and men were constantly on duty. No regiment could have done more or better
                    under the circumstances. A generous spirit of rivalry pervaded the regiment as
                    to who should be most active in the performance of duty.</p>
<p>July 2.--At 7 p. m. Col. Hawley received a telegram from McConnellsburg,
                    notifying him that an iron structure known as Mill Creek railroad bridge was
                    threatened by the enemy, and that its destruction was anticipated that night by
                    500 of Imboden's cavalry. This bridge crosses the Juniata River 6 miles from
                    Mount Union. We had about 400 men in camp, all told. On consultation with Col.
                    Hawley, it was determined that I should make the advance and defend the bridge
                    with 150 men; whereupon Company D, Capt. George M. Baker, and Company A, Lieut.
                    John C. Nagel, with 50 men each, were detailed for this duty, and, under my
                    command, left Mount Union at 9 p. m. I was accompanied in this expedition by
                    Maj. Charles J. Wing and Surg. Jacob Whittaker, of the Seventy-fourth Regt. Our
                    route was by the bridge guarded by Company A, Sixty-fifth Regt., and Maj. Wing
                    was sent in advance, with orders to detach 25 men, under command of Lieut. Henry
                    Rudolph, from that company, to join us; also to go on to the village of
                    Mapleton, and call in the pickets of Company B, Sixty-fifth Regt., Capt. Louis
                    Krettner, which company joined us at that place. I was joined at Mapleton and
                    vicinity by 20 farmers, who volunteered their services as axmen. There were four
                    roads or passes leading over the mountains, through Bear Valley, to this bridge,
                    and I decided to blockade these roads in the narrow passes in the mountains.
                    Maj. Wing was sent with Capt. Krettner's company 1 mile north of Mapleton, with
                    instructions to blockade and defend Mill Creek road. I then moved on about 2
                    miles farther, and posted Company D, Capt. Baker, in Bear Valley Pass; about
                    one-half mile southeast, I posted 25 men of Company A, under command of Lieut.
                    Nagel; in another pass, one-half mile distant from this point, and half a mile
                    higher up the mountain, were posted 25 men of Company A, under command of Lieut.
                    William Bean. All of these points were the narrowest in the passes, barely
                    sufficient for 4 horsemen to ride abreast, and easily defended. All the roads
                    were blockaded by felling trees across them; trees were also cut nearly off at
                    different points 500 yards in advance, and axmen stationed to fell them as soon
                    as the enemy should pass, thus blockading them in. Men were also stationed on
                    the upper side of the roads and on the sides of the mountain between the two
                    points, prepared to meet them. It was impossible for a horseman to ride up or
                    down the mountain on either side of the roads. I held 20 men, under command of
                    Lieut. Henry Rudolph, of the Sixty-fifth Regt., at a convenient point as a
                    reserve. These dispositions were concluded at 1 a. m.</p>
<p>July 3.--At 2 a. m. 500 of Imboden's rebel cavalry appeared near Bear Valley
                    Pass, within 600 yards of the barricade, and immediately retreated, probably
                    notified by their spies of the reception prepared for them. Having left Mount
                    Union in great haste, we were unprovided with rations, but the farmers in the
                    vicinity brought us sufficient in the morning. We remained there until 12 m. of
                    the 3d, when we fell back to Mount Union, where we arrived at 2 p. m., the
                    distance being 7 miles.</p>
<p>Saturday, July 4.--The regiment was this day mustered into the United States
                    service by Lieut. William F. Fulton, Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania, appointed by
                    Maj.-Gen. Couch for that purpose, for thirty days from June 19.</p>
<p>Herewith I hand you a roster of my officers and muster-rolls of the several
                    companies of my command. The day was duly celebrated by the companies of the
                    Seventy-fourth in camp, and by a dinner given by the officers, at which were
                    present Col. Hawley and his field and staff officers as invited guests. The
                    utmost good cheer and good feeling prevailed throughout the day among officers
                    and men.</p>
<p>During our stay at Mount Union, we were constantly active, doing picket and
                    provost-guard duty. Our pickets captured, at sundry times, 58 prisoners from
                    Lee's army, who were sent to Maj.-Gen. Couch, at Harrisburg. Several
                    reconnaissances were made by Col. Hawley and myself, and by myself and officers,
                    with, of course, some degree of profit in gaining a knowledge and familiarity
                    with the topography of the country in that vicinity.</p>
<p>July 2.--I received from the Buffalo Board of Trade $ 500, and from Gen. Henry L.
                    Lansing $ 100, generously donated and placed in my hands to be disbursed for the
                    benefit of the brigade; but for this timely donation my command would have
                    suffered greatly in its subsequent marches, Government not providing at all
                    times adequate transportation and subsistence.</p>
<p>July 3.--My quartermaster, Clark Dodge, a valuable man in that department, was
                    ordered by the chief quartermaster of the Department of the Susquehanna to
                    report, with 5 competent men, at Harrisburg, for duty in that department. Five
                    men were accordingly detailed, and he left with them on the 5th instant.
                    Quartermaster-~ Sergeant S. Fred. Hartman performed the duties of quartermaster
                    to my entire satisfaction until we were rejoined by Quartermaster Dodge, at
                    Harrisburg, July 15.</p>
<p>July 5.--At 3 p. m., Col. Hawley received a telegram from Maj.-Gen. Couch, at
                    Chambersburg, ordering three companies of the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania and the
                    Seventy-fourth Regt. New York National Guard, to move immediately for
                    Chambersburg, with three days' cooked rations in our haversacks. At 6 p. m. we
                    left Mount Union with three companies of the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania, under
                    command of Col. J. W. Hawley, with one day's rations, not being able to get any
                    more, as the Government had no more rations at this place, and took the Shirley
                    road for Chambersburg. Our route led through Shirleysburg, Fannettsburg, Shade
                    Gap, Burnt Cabins, to Loudon, distant 52 miles from Mount Union, where we
                    arrived July 7, at 6 p. m., and encamped. Col. Hawley reported to Maj.-Gen.
                    Couch, by telegraph, at Chambersburg. In the meantime, Gen. Couch telegraphed
                    Col. Pierce, who was at Loudon, in command of the remains of Gen. Milroy's
                    division, instructing him to order us to Clear Spring, Md. When we arrived at
                    Loudon, we were entirely out of rations, and were only able to draw half a
                    ration of hard-tack for three days. We left Loudon July 8, at 4 p. m., and
                    arrived at Mercersburg, 7 miles at 7 p. m., where we encamped for the night.</p>
<p>July 9.--At 6 a. m. left Mercersburg, and arrived in Bear Valley, within 2 miles
                    of Clear Spring, at 2 p. m., where we encamped, distant from Loudon 26 miles.
                    When at Loudon we were joined by Capt. Nathaniel Payne's company of cavalry, of
                    Milroy's division.</p>
<p>July 10.--At 8 a. m., leaving the regiment, with the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania,
                    in camp, Col. Hawley and myself, with the advance guard of cavalry, under
                    command of Capt. Payne, made a reconnaissance toward Clear Spring, ascertaining
                    the position and strength of the enemy. At 10 a. m. I returned, and, with my
                    command and the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania, broke camp and moved forward.
                    Arriving within half a mile of Clear Spring, Col. Hawley rode up and informed me
                    that Capt. Payne's cavalry were at this moment having a skirmish with 500 rebel
                    cavalry.</p>
<p>Col. Hawley took his command and made a detour to the left, while I moved forward
                    at double-quick with my command, leaving the baggage train and guard in command
                    of Maj. Wing. Arriving at the Boonsborough road, where the skirmish was in
                    progress, the enemy made a precipitate retreat. Three of Capt. Payne's command
                    were severely wounded, one of whom died the following day. Four of the enemy
                    were wounded, and a rebel major's horse was shot from under him. We encamped by
                    a spring in the woods, 1 mile distant from the village and from the summit of
                    the mountain called Fairview. On our arrival at Clear Spring, we were entirely
                    out of rations, and were generously supplied by the citizens of the town, a
                    portion of which was paid for by the colonel. We ascertained that Lee's army had
                    just arrived at Williamsport, 7 miles distant, and (before the completion of the
                    pontoon bridges) had commenced crossing the Potomac in boats, at the rate of
                    three teams an hour. We also ascertained that Lee's pontoons were built with old
                    canal boats and pieces of houses and lumber. The rebel Gen. Imboden, and 10,000
                    cavalry, infantry, and artillery, were encamped within 2 1/2 miles. From the
                    summit of Fairview, Williamsport and a portion of the rebel forces were plainly
                    discernible. I posted four companies of my command on picket, and kept that
                    number out during our stay at the Spring, and the greatest vigilance was
                    exercised to guard against a surprise, having been ordered here to hold and
                    guard this pass (Boonsborough pike), Clear Spring, and Fairview, until the
                    arrival of Gen. Kelley's division, which took place during the night of the 11th
                    July, and, early on the morning of the 12th, Gen. Kelley posted a battery on the
                    summit of Fairview and below, near the village of Clear Spring, and commenced
                    shelling Imboden on the morning of the 12th. On the 12th, Capt. Hugh Swan
                    captured a rebel major and captain, who were not three hours from Lee's
                    headquarters. They were sent under guard to Maj.-Gen. Couch, at Chambersburg.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, July 12.--Col. Hawley received a dispatch from Col. Pierce, at
                    Loudon, ordering the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Regt. and my command to proceed
                    immediately to Loudon, as that division was to leave that morning to join Gen.
                    Kelley's division at Clear Spring. We left at 7 a. m., and arrived at
                    Mercersburg at 6 p. m., where we encamped for the night. At this place I
                    detached Company G, Capt. Harry Kester, who remained at Mercersburg as provost
                    guard.</p>
<p>July 13.--At 6 a. m. left Mercersburg, and, when about 1 mile distant from this
                    place, met Col. Pierce, with Milroy's division, on his way to Clear Spring;
                    arrived at Loudon at 10 a. m., and encamped. Col. Hawley reported by telegraph
                    to Maj.-Gen. Couch at Chambersburg.</p>
<p>Tuesday, July 14.--At 5 p. m., while inspecting my command, Col. Hawley received
                    a telegram from Maj.-Gen. Couch, ordering me to report with my command to
                    Maj.-Gen. Wool, in New York City, with all possible dispatch. Maj. Wing was sent
                    to Mercersburg, with orders to follow with Company G, Capt. Kester, and join us
                    as soon as possible. Government not being able to furnish transportation,
                    Lieut.-Col. Seely, Surg. Jacob Whittaker, and Quartermaster-Sergeant Hartman
                    were left to hire teams and bring on our camp equipage. Left Loudon at 8 p. m.,
                    and arrived at Chambersburg, 15 miles, at 2 a. m. July 15, where we rested on a
                    muddy sidewalk until 6 a. m., when we took up our line of march, and arrived at
                    Shippensburg, 12 miles from Loudon, at 12 m. Left Shippensburg at 2 p. m., and
                    arrived at Harrisburg at 5 p. m. same day, where we were joined by Lieut. Clark
                    Dodge, quartermaster, and his assistants, and Lieut. E. T. Smith, from Buffalo;
                    changed cars at Harrisburg, taking the road via Reading, Allentown, and Easton,
                    for New York City, where we arrived July 17, at 10 a. m.; marched up Broadway
                    and to Centre Market, the armory of eighth Regt. New York National Guard, where
                    we arrived at 1 p. m. I immediately reported to Maj.-Gen. Wool, who ordered me
                    to report to Brig. Gen. Harvey Brown, 300 Mulberry street, which I did at 2 p.
                    m. At 3 p. m. Gen. Brown ordered the following disposition of my command:
                    Company A, Lieut. John C. Nagel, and Company E, Capt. William Clingen, were
                    ordered to Hotchkiss' shell factory, Seventeenth street; Company B, Capt.
                    Theodore D. Barnum, at gas-works, Twenty-third street; Company C, Capt. John U.
                    Wayland, and Company R, Capt. Alexander Sloan, to Atlantic Dock, Brooklyn;
                    Company D, Capt. George M. Baker, to Fort Richmond; Company F, Capt. Hugh Sloan,
                    to Forts Hamilton and Lafayette; Company I, Capt. George B. Knight, to Jersey
                    City, to report to the mayor. Late in the evening of the 18th instant, Company
                    G, Capt. Harry Kester, arrived, and was ordered to join Capt. Knight, at Jersey
                    City. Various dispositions were made of the several companies remaining in the
                    city during their stay, and active participation in the suppression of the
                    rioters. They received high compliments from Gen. Brown for their efficiency,
                    good discipline, and faithful performance of all the duties assigned them.</p>
<p>July 19.--Company A, Lieut. John C. Nagel, and Company B, Capt. Theodore D.
                    Barnum, were sent up the Hudson River, stopping at all places on the way, to
                    Sing Sing, returning to New York City 21st instant, performing important duty at
                    these several points in quelling riots.</p>
<p>July 19.--Gen. Brown was relieved by Gen. Canby, who, on the 21st instant,
                    ordered me to proceed with my command to Buffalo. We left New York at 6 p. m.
                    this day, on special train, via Hudson River road, arriving in Albany 22d
                    instant, at 12 m., being detained by the washing away of a culvert on the road.
                    At Albany we were generously furnished with refreshments sent to the depot by
                    Messrs. Paige &amp; Dawson. Left Albany at 3 p. m., and arrived at Buffalo
                    at 10 a. m., July 23, when we met with a magnificent reception, the citizens
                    turning out en masse, crowding the streets to such an extent that it was with
                    the utmost difficulty we were able to get through them. We were escorted to the
                    State arsenal by the Union Continentals, Lieut. Asher P. Nichols; Sixty-fifth
                    Regt. New York State National Guard, Lieut. Col. William F. Berens; Eagle Hose,
                    No. 2; Neptune Hose, No. 5; Columbia Hose, No. 11; Lansing Zouaves, and
                    Ellsworth Guard, escort preceded by Union Cornet Band, the Seventy-fourth by
                    Miller's Band and drum corps. At the State arsenal we were welcomed, on behalf
                    of the city, by Alderman Charles E. Beckwith, mayor pro tempore, in a neat and
                    appropriate speech, which was responded to by the colonel, after which, in the
                    arsenal drillroom, we partook of a bountiful collation prepared and tendered by
                    the ladies of Buffalo. We remained on duty at the State arsenal from this date
                    until August 3, when we were mustered out by Capt. Sheldon Sturgeon, First
                    Infantry, U. S. Army, mustering and disbursing officer. While being mustered out
                    of the service of the United States, an order was placed in my hand from the
                    mayor pro tempore, calling us into the service of the city, for the purpose of
                    preserving the public peace during the impending draft. We entered at once upon
                    this duty, and were relieved August 22.</p>
<p>During our absence, and while in command of the brigade, the command of the
                    regiment devolved upon Lieut. Col. Walter G. Seely. To this officer, as well as
                    Maj. Charles J. Wing, and my staff and line officers, too much praise and credit
                    cannot be accorded for their faithful attention to duty, and readiness to second
                    me in every effort to render my command efficient and acceptable to my
                    superiors.</p>
<p>I cannot close this without a just and deserved tribute to the men, who, at an
                    hour's notice, left their homes and friends, business pursuits and pleasures,
                    and, throughout this campaign, were ever ready to perform any duty, however
                    arduous, without a murmur or complaint. My regiment is made up for the most part
                    of middle-aged and young men, engaged in active business pursuits, and the
                    personal sacrifices made by them cannot be estimated, and are not appreciated by
                    the community. I am happy to say they were cheerfully made from conviction of
                    duty, and would as cheerfully be made again when occasion requires it, from the
                    same patriotic conviction. I am proud of my regiment, and esteem it an honor to
                    command such a body of soldiers, who, by their strict devotion to duty, have
                    reflected so much credit upon themselves, their noble city, and the State which
                    they so faithfully represent. For the purpose of encouraging this spirit, I beg
                    to suggest that the State troops responding to the late order should be awarded
                    some testimonial of appreciation of their patriotism and self-sacrificing spirit
                    of devotion to the call of duty.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WATSON A. FOX,<br> Col., Comdg. 74th Regt. New York National Guard.</p>
