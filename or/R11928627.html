<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Lee's aid de camp, Walter Taylor, writes General Gustavus Smith in late
                    September, 1862, as the Maryland campaign drew to a close. He discusses removal
                    of sick and wounded from the front. Taylor instructs Smith to use Staunton and
                    the Valley as the primary line of communication with Lee's army. He also
                    suggests moving supplies from Culpeper Court-House to Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. GUSTAVUS W. SMITH,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>Camp on the Opequon,</p>
<p>September 25, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I am directed by Gen. Lee to say that it has been reported to him by Dr. Herndon,
                    who is just from Warrenton, that the removal of the wounded and sick from that
                    place had been stopped by order of Dr. Fisher on his arrival there. Only about
                    400 had been removed, and there are still remaining some 1,400. The commanding
                    general desires that the work of removal shall proceed until all are carried to
                    some place of security, inasmuch as Warrenton is not considered a safe place for
                    them, and is liable to be visited at any time by the enemy's cavalry. There may
                    be some whose condition will not permit their being moved; of this the surgeons
                    will judge. The general instructs me to add that, as the route from Rapidan and
                    Culpeper Court-House is not altogether secure from the raids of the enemy's
                    cavalry, he deems it advisable to forsake that route of communication and adopt
                    the one by Staunton, Harrisburg, and down the valley. He wishes this route
                    pursued hereafter, and moreover, that all stores that may be at Culpeper
                    Court-House be removed to Gordonsville or sent around to Staunton, to be drawn
                    from for the use of this army.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. H. TAYLOR,<br> Maj. and Aide-de-Camp.</p>
