<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Henry Halleck responds to General Grant in May, 1864. He says that
                    despite Grant's request that General Franz Sigel advance on Staunton, Sigel was
                    actually retreating with his men to Strasburg.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> Near Spotsylvania, Va.:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>May 17, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sheridan has anticipated your orders, and moves to-day on his return to the Army
                    of the Potomac. All the horses we can collect will be put in the hands of
                    veteran cavalrymen and sent to the Army of the Potomac. I have sent the
                    substance of your dispatch to Gen. Sigel. Instead of advancing on Staunton he is
                    already in full retreat on Strasburg. If you except anything from his you will
                    be mistaken. He will do nothing but run. He never did anything else. The
                    Secretary of War proposes to put Gen. Hunter in his place. Send him up
                    immediately. Bridges at Harper's Ferry carried away. I have sent pontoons to-day
                    to replace them. Butler has fallen back to-day. Do not rely on him. Sherman is
                    doing well. I will push forward railroad from Aquia Creek with all possible
                    dispatch. More re-enforcements will leave here to-morrow. I will run them up in
                    a few days from 25,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. W. HALLECK,<br> Maj.-Gen. and Chief of Staff. </p>
