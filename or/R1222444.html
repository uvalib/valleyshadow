<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In early July, 1861, Union General George B. McClellan defeated Confederates
                    under Robert S. Garnett in what is now West Virginia. In this dispatch, Major
                    Michael G. Harman, commanding at Staunton, reports to Jefferson Davis on the
                    situation, including steps taken to prevent a total disaster.</p>

<p>President DAVIS:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>July 15, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our force has retreated to Monterey. We have no certain knowledge that the enemy
                    have taken possession of Cheat Mountain in force. We hope that by prompt action
                    it can be taken and held by our troops with suitable re-enforcements. Certainly
                    they can hold other mountains west of Monterey. The enemy is it possession Cheat
                    Mountain, and still more at Monterey will find free passage to the Central
                    Railroad, and to the valley in rear of Gen. Johnston, unless vigorously opposed.
                    There is a turnpike road from Huttonsville to Huntersville, and thence to the
                    Warm Springs, and thence to the Central Railroad at Milborough, as well as to
                    Jackson's River and Lewisburg, from Monterey to the Warm Springs, and to Hardy
                    County. There are turnpike roads to prevent the enemy coming from the direction
                    of Warm Springs, or northeastwardly into the valley. We should hold Cheat
                    Mountain, or be as near it as possible, so as to threaten his rear and flank in
                    any movement he makes, besides checking his advance in this direction, and
                    keeping command of several roads for the advance of our troops. A force may be
                    sent also to Jackson's River, by the Central Railroad, or by canal and turnpike
                    from Lynchburg. A piece or two of artillery, with powder, lead, and buckshot,
                    for the militia, should be sent with this force. They cannot be brought in this
                    county. Without prompt action a local reverse may become a general disaster.
                    Excuse these suggestions.</p>

<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Commanding.</p>
