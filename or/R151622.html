<p> WM. H. RICHARDSON,<br> Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>Richmond,</p>
<p>May 30, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. The address of many persons proposing to raise companies, &amp;c., for
                    service in the Virginia Line commanded by Maj. Gen. John B. Floyd, has not been
                    left with the Adjutant-Gen. of the State. The authority to do so, if not
                    forwarded to said persons, can be had at the officer of the Adjutant-Gen. of the
                    Virginia Forces, Richmond.</p>
<p>2. The persons to whom such authority is given are hereby constituted recruiting
                    and mustering officers for said service.</p>
<p>3. Such officers will swear and muster into service immediately after their
                    enlistment such persons as enlist. The men thus sworn and mustered will be
                    entitled to commutation of rations at the rate of 75 cents per day until rations
                    can be furnished them in kind.</p>
<p>4. The point of general rendezvous for the troops of this command are Wytheville,
                    Wythe County, Va., and Goodson, Washington County, V. To these places they will
                    be sent as soon after they have been sworn and mustered, and in such numbers as
                    may seem best to the recruiting officer. Transportation will be furnished them
                    upon the certificate of the recruiting officer that they have been sworn and
                    mustered into service.</p>
