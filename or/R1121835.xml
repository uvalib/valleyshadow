                <p>General Jacob Cox commanded Union forces in the Kanawha Valley in what is now
                    West Virginia during the spring of 1862. In this March letter, he informs
                    General John C. Fremont of the situation in his sector, including troop
                    strengths and enemy positions. The importance of Staunton as a rail center
                    becomes evident when Cox mentions the frequent fluctuation of Confederate
                    strength at Jackson Station, linked by rail to Staunton, VA.</p>

                <p>My latest information is that only a small force of 400 or 500 men hold
                    Lewisburg, and these are ordered to collect the cattle of that vicinity and
                    drive them to Jackson River Station, and to burn the forage in Greenbrier County
                    which they cannot carry off. Some force is reported at Jackson Station, but
                    nothing definite. From its railroad connection with Staunton the number of
                    troops there is variable, according to apparent exigencies. The roads are
                    rapidly settling now, and a week of good weather will make them tolerably good,
                    except at the extremities, where they have been constantly used during the
                    winter.</p>
                <p>On the Newbern and Wytheville roads my reports are as follows. At mouth of Blue
                    Stone, 250 men; at 3 miles up Blue Stone, 200 men and one iron 6-pounder; both
                    camps with breastworks and abatis. On Flat Top Mountain French's company of
                    cavalry, and a few cavalry and infantry at Princeton. These are manifestly mere
                    posts of observation and will make no serious resistance.</p>
                <p>At Newbern it is supposed the forces in that vicinity, with such re-enforcements
                    as can be spared from Lynchburg, will be concentrated with a view to hold the
                    railroad. The road from Gauley Bridge to Raleigh is bad; from Raleigh to
                    Gladesville pretty good; from Gladesville to Wytheville it is very rough, and
                    broken in places by land slides and passes through very hard defiles, but from
                    Gladesville, via Princeton and Pearisburg, to Newbern it is reported passable.</p>
                <p>Humphrey Marshall is reported to have concentrated his troops at Moccasin Gap,
                    northwest of Abingdon. I cannot learn his number, but suppose them to be about
                    2,000.</p>
                <p>I greatly regretted to hear of Gen. Garfield's removal from Eastern Kentucky. He
                    is one of our best officers and was very desirous of serving under your command.
                    I do not believe the rebels have 5,000 men under arms from Abingdon to
                    Lewisburg. If the roads get once well settled I am confident the Lewisburg and
                    Newbern routes can both be used by pretty heavy columns.</p>
                <p>Both Gauley Bridge and Fayette Court-House are safe depots now for stores, and as
                    the roads this side of those places are the worst, I suggest the accumulation of
                    supplies there at an early day. Sibley tents are the only ones we have except a
                    few common tents, and not over two-thirds of the command are supplied with any.</p>
                <p>Not knowing who is your adjutant-general, I address you directly, and am most
                    happy to report to you for orders.</p>
