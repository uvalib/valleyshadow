<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott writes General Robert Patterson concerning
                    troop movements and orders for his command in Pennsylvania and Maryland in July,
                    1861. Scott tells Patterson to expect to receive troops from Wisconsin via

<p>Maj.-Gen. PATTERSON, Martinsburg:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>July 5, 1861</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your letter of the 4th is received. Orders were sent this morning to Madison for
                    the Third and Fourth Regiments from Wisconsin to repair to Williamsport via
                    Chambersburg and report to you. The Nineteenth and Twenty-eighth New York
                    Regiments leave here for Hagerstown to-morrow at half past 2 p. m. You will have
                    to provide transportation for them thence to the post you may order them to. If
                    any three-months' men will re-engage for the long term, designate a Regular
                    officer of your command to muster them, provided a sufficient number to form a
                    regiment can be obtained. Having defeated the enemy, if you can continue the
                    pursuit without too great hazard, advance via Leesburg (or Strasburg) towards
                    Alexandria; but consider the dangerous defiles, especially via Strasburg, and
                    move with great caution, halting at Winchester and threatening a movement by
                    Strasburg; or the passage of the Potomac twice, and coming down by Leesburg, may
                    be the more advantageous movement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WINFIELD SCOTT.</p>
