					<salute>SIR:</salute>
				</opener>
				<p>In reply to your communication of to-day I would say that after receiving your
					orders on the 23rd instant to visit the scene of action and report, I went at
					once. On my arrival I found we had on our left wing a battery and one of two
					regiments. The center and right wing were composed of three batteries and about
					five regiments of infantry, with a considerable force of cavalry. A high and
					commanding position on our right was occupied by the enemy at about 3 o'clock
					p.m. and a severe fire opened on our center, which compelled the withdrawal of a
					portion of our force into a more secure position.</p>
				<p>At about 3.30 p.m. Col. Tyler was ordered to attack the enemy's new position on
					our right and to take their battery. He moved immediately forward with three or
					four regiments, a battery, and about 400 left wing. In about half an hour after
					Col. Tyler's movements his skirmishers exchanged shots with the enemy, who were
					posted behind high stone walls, a rocky hill, and some woods a quarter of a mile
					in front of his battery. The enemy reserved his fire until our line was very
					near. They then arose and poured in a very heavy volley. The suddenness and
					strength of their fire caused our lines to falter, and the extreme left,
					composed mainly of the One hundred and tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, broke and
					ran. The rest of the line soon rallied and maintained a steady fight (falling
					back on the right and advancing on the left) for at least half an hour, when two
					regiments came to their assistance up the left flank and through a very severe
					fire. They advanced steadily, and soon gained a position from which they could
					flank the enemy, delivering their fire. When they received this new fire the
					enemy fell back rapidly, but still fighting, to the woods nearest to the hill,
					from which the battery had been in the mean time withdrawn.</p>
				<p>Having in vain attempted to rally the One hundred and tenth Pennsylvania
					Volunteers (which, with such company officers, as I could see, was in a shameful
					rout), I joined the advance on the first field which the enemy had held, where
					there were many dead and wounded. I questioned such as could answer, and learned
					that Jackson was present with about 6,000 men, having arrived with the largest
					part of his command at 3 p.m. He had posted about 3,000 in the first field, and
					had reserved 3,000 more in position behind the offensive battery and in the
					woods half a mile to the front. Before communicating this to Col. Tyler I took
					the liberty of ordering the cavalry to advance by a side road toward the near of
					the enemy's reserve, and then communicated to Col. Tyler, who was advancing his
					force so as to support Cols. Kimball's and Sullivan's forces, which were nearest
					the enemy, and moved slowly forward.</p>
				<p>The enemy now opened on our line with a heavier fire than before. We maintained
					our position from the first, and soon drove them in utter confusion down the
					hill, but the near approach of night forbade farther pursuit, and a halt was
					ordered. Our troops commenced preparations for bivouacking and for removing our
					dead. I rode over the field and saw that the enemy could not have lost less than
					100 killed and 200 wounded, and judged that our loss was about the same. The
					wounds of the enemy seemed generally more severe than ours. The cavalry came
					around the hill at a very good time, and captured about 150 prisoners. On the
					side of the woods in the rear of the enemy's battery there were one cannon and
					two overturned caissons. There were large numbers of muskets strewed about in
					the different fields, which I ordered to be stacked for future removal. Also the
					enemy seemed to have in many cases thrown aside their equipments to expedite
					their flight.</p>
				<p>As there seemed no further reason to expect attack, I returned to the city and
					reported myself to your headquarters. I afterward learned that the enemy had
					twenty-eight pieces of artillery in reserve at Kernstown, which were removed as
					soon as the day seemed to be unfavorable. The report amongst the people along
					the road is that Jackson carried back 1,000 less than what went to Winchester.</p>
				<p>In regard to the enemy at present, I believe he is near Staunton. Ashby and a
					considerable amount of cavalry, with two pieces of artillery, are about 3 miles
					from here. The infantry, it is believed, are entirely worn-out and demoralized,
					but are too far for us to overtake.</p>

					<salute>I am, general, with much respect, your most obedient servant,</salute>
