<p>Capt. T. MELVIN,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>Hancock, Md.,</p>
<p>August 3, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of yesterday,
                    inclosing a dispatch from Brig.-Gen. Kelley. This is the first communication I
                    have received from your headquarters since the 28th July, I sent to you last
                    night a report of my operations since that date. When I left Chambersburg I
                    requested Gen. Couch to notify Gen. Kelley of the threatened movement of the
                    enemy upon Cumberland and at McConnellsburg. On the morning of the 31st I
                    notified Gen. Kelley that I was driving the enemy in the direction of Hancock,
                    and I had reason to hope when I attacked him at Hancock that between Gen.
                    Kelly's forces and my own he would be captured. Nothing but an iron-clad car and
                    a company of National Guards appeared, which were driven away by the enemy's
                    artillery. My artillery controlling the ford prevented his crossing, but with my
                    small and worn-out command I could not prevent his escape by the Cumberland
                    pike, upon which he kept up his flight during the night, felling trees and
                    burning bridges in his rear, rendering pursuit with any chance of success
                    impossible. I sent a messenger to Great Cacapon with a telegram to Gen. Kelley,
                    informing him of the course taken by the enemy, and requesting that a train of
                    cars be sent to take up my command dismounted to Green Spring Run or Cumberland
                    to assist in case of need, to which I receive the reply that my command was not
                    needed.</p>
<p>I remained at this point for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First. The impassibility of the road taken by the enemy and the impracticability
                    of the Old Town road.</p>
<p>Second. The inability of my command to move, owing to the worn-out condition of
                    my horses, and their want of shoes. The enemy was mounted upon good horses with
                    which he had recently supplied himself. During the entire pursuit to this place,
                    not a horse of the enemy had been abandoned, except when his rider had been
                    killed or wounded, while 300 of mine had been left ten miles behind from utter
                    exhaustion. When the head of my column attacked the enemy at this place, the
                    enemy numbered about 3,000; I had but 1,000, and although I drove him, killing
                    and wounding 15, I could not capture him without the assistance I had expected.
                    I am not permitted to take horses, and I have not received a fresh supply. The
                    enemy, clearing the country in his front, left nothing for me in his rear. Had
                    the road been open, I could have gone no farther without rendering the pursuit
                    ruinous to my command and fruitless.</p>
<p>Third. Until it was known to me what course the enemy had taken after
                    encountering Gen. Kelley's forces this was the best point for me to occupy. If
                    he defeated Gen. Kelley, and continued westward by taking the Bedford turnpike
                    and impressing horses, I could again reach him upon his right flank. If he
                    turned southward, either from defeat or success, he would probably move in the
                    direction of Winchester, when I would have a chance of intercepting him after
                    resting here.</p>
<p>Fourth. In my attack at McConnellsburg, a portion of the enemy--from 200 to
                    500--were cut off and scattered, and are now endeavoring to reach the river. The
                    available force of one of my brigades has been and is engaged in trying to
                    intercept them.</p>
<p>I have detailed the most prominent rebel sympathizers in this country, and send
                    them under guard to cut out the blockade and rebuild the bridges on the
                    Cumberland pike. Telegraphic communication with Gen. Kelley has been
                    interrupted. Since yesterday at 11 a. m. I have sent couriers, patrols, a hand
                    car, and a locomotive to obtain information of the operations near Cumberland,
                    and the direction taken by the enemy, if he has escaped. The latest intelligence
                    I have received is that he is coming down the river.</p>
<p>I have the honor to request that you will lay the above report, with the inclosed
                    dispatches, before the major-general commanding the department, and that they be
                    sent to the War Department, together with my report of yesterday. I cannot
                    believe that they are fully informed of the condition of my command at
                    Washington, if they expect me to overtake and capture a force double my own and
                    better mounted. If such is their expectation, it is impossible that they can
                    know that this command has marched 1,400 miles since the 1st of May, without a
                    remount, and without a half sufficiently long to set the shoes on my horses.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
