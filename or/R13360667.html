<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, writes Pennsylvania governor Andrew Curtin in March, 1864, to
                    discuss rumors of a Confederate raid into the state.</p>

<p>His Excellency Governor A. G. CURTIN,<br> Harrisburg,
                        Pa.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>March 11, 1864.</p>
<p>DEAR GOVERNOR:</p>
<p>Maj. Burt has informed me of what you told him to-day in reference to the rebels
                    organization an expedition for this valley, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I have heard of various rumors to the same effect for perhaps two weeks past, and
                    in consequence have given the matter serious consideration. I cannot, however,
                    but believe that the rebel authorities are the authors of these stories, for the
                    purpose of preventing our people from moving forward, and making us put
                    ourselves on the defensive. My reasons are these: With a small party-a few
                    thousand-they would be liable to be cut off, for, Sigel's troops being in their
                    rear, and [sic] leisurely, they could not carry off enough spoils to make it an
                    object, and I do not think that they will come with their whole army, as last
                    summer. Still, I shall be on the lookout, and if they do come will try and do
                    the best.</p>
<p>Hoping that all will be well with us, I am, very respectfully,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
