<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Ulysses S. Grant orders General David Hunter to join in destroying
                    the Virginia Central Railroad in June, 1864. Grant orders Hunter to proceed east
                    from Staunton through Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. D. HUNTER,<br> Cmdg. Department of West
                        Virginia:</p>
<p>COLD HARBOR, VA.,</p>
<p>June 6, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Gen. Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning with instructions to proceed to
                    Charlottesville, Va., and to commence there the destruction of the Virginia
                    Central Railroad, destroying this way as much as possible. The complete
                    destruction of this road and of the canal on James River is of great importance
                    to us. According to the instructions I sent to Gen. Halleck for your guidance,
                    you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence there. It would be of great value
                    to us to get possession of Lynchburg for a single day; but that point is of so
                    much importance to the enemy that in attempting to get it such resistance may be
                    met as to defeat your getting into the road or canal at all. I see in looking
                    over the letter to Gen. Halleck on the subject of your instructions that it
                    rather indicates that your route should be from Staunton via Charlottesville. If
                    you have so understood it you will be doing just what I want. The direction I
                    would now give is, that if this letter reaches you in the Valley between
                    Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediately turn east by the most practicable road
                    until you strike the Lynchburg branch of the Virginia Central road. From there
                    move eastward along the line of the road, destroying it completely and
                    thoroughly until you join Gen. Sheridan. After the work laid out for Gen.
                    Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done, proceed to join the Army of the
                    Potomac by the route laid out in Gen. Sheridan's instructions. If any portion of
                    your force, especially your cavalry, is needed back in your department you are
                    authorized to send it back. If on receipt of this you should be near to
                    Lynchburg, and deem it practicable to reach that point, you will exercise your
                    judgment about going there. If you should be on the railroad between
                    Charlottesville and Lynchburg, it may be practicable to detach a cavalry force
                    to destroy the canal. Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> U. S. GRANT,<br> Lieut.-Gen.</p>
