<p> ADJUTANT-Gen.:</p>
<p>BEVERLY, W. VA.,</p>
<p>June 13, 1864.<br> (Received 9.30 a. m. 14th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have the honor to report my arrival from Staunton, which place I left on the
                    morning of the 10th, under orders from Maj.-Gen. Hunter, to collect and organize
                    at Martinsburg, W. Va., all the troops that can possibly be spared from this
                    department, except the 100-days', and bring them forward to join Gen. Hunter in
                    the field. A copy of the order, together with a letter to Maj.-Gen. Halleck,
                    chief of staff, has been forwarded, After consultation with the commanding
                    officer of this post, I have concluded that the troops stationed here are not
                    needed, and have accordingly requested Maj.-Gen. Sigel to order them to
                    Martinsburg. I will leave here to-morrow noon for Grafton, and will be at
                    Cumberland on the 15th and Martinsburg on the 16th. One thousand prisoners,
                    including 60 officers, captured by Gen. Hunter at Piedmont, will arrive here
                    to-morrow morning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>JUL. STAHEL,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
