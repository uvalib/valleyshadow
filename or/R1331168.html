<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Jubal A. Early, commanding in the Shenandoah Valley in
                    February, 1864, writes a letter expressing his poor opinion of General John D.
                    Imboden's cavalry command. Early mentions the murder in the streets of Staunton
                    of one of Imboden's sergeants as partial justification.</p>

<p>Respectfully forwarded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>February 12, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The extent of my remarks in regard to Gen. Imboden's command is very greatly
                    exaggerated. I have not spoken of the command in public, but have mentioned on
                    several occasions in private the condition in which, I am sorry to say, I have
                    found it, and I have said more to Col. Smith, who has commanded it for the
                    greater part of the time I have been in the valley, than to any one else, and
                    more on the occasion of a very recent murder of one of the sergeants of the
                    command in the streets of Staunton by a lieutenant than at any other time. I am
                    sorry to say that I have found the command generally in a very bad state of
                    discipline, and from what I have seen and heard of it, I should feel great
                    reluctance to have to rely on it in any emergency. I had intended to call Gen.
                    Imboden's attention to the condition of his command, and urge upon him the
                    necessity of improving its discipline and efficiency. No injury has been done
                    this command in public estimation by any remarks that I have made, or am reputed
                    to have made, for I have found the opinion very generally prevailing in all
                    parts of the country where I have been and the command has operated that it is
                    inefficient and undisciplined. What is the cause of this state of things I can
                    only conjecture, but I think it due in great part to the fact that a large
                    number of the men have been recruited from deserters from other parts of the
                    army. I hope that the inquiry asked for may be granted, and that it may result
                    in materially improving the condition of the command.</p>
