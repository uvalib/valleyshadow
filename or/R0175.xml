                <p>In compliance with instructions from headquarters Army of the Potomac, I have the
                    honor to submit the following report of the operations of this corps during the
                    movement of the 5th, 6th, and 7th instant:</p>
                <p>At 1 o'clock on the morning of the 5th I received the circular order from
                    headquarters of the army, directing me to hold my command "in readiness to move
                    at short notice, anticipating that the movement to be ordered will consist of
                    the withdrawal of all the troops, except the minimum number necessary to
                    maintain the picket-line and the garrison of the works."</p>
                <p>At this time our front extended from the Appomattox to Battery 24, and was held
                    by the First and Second Divisions, with the Third Division in reserve. All the
                    preparations were at once made for the movement. At 1.45 p.m. of the 5th I
                    received an order to send Gen. Hertranft's division (the Third) down the Vaughan
                    road to report to Maj.-Gen. Humphreys at Hatcher's Run. Gen. Hartranft moved his
                    division as rapidly as possible and reported to Maj.-Gen. Humphreys at 8 p.m.
                    Gen. Hartranft's report is forwarded herewith. In compliance with instructions
                    Col. Brainerd, commanding Engineer Brigade, at City Point, reported to me with
                    his command during the evening of the 5th, and was posted as a reserve in the
                    vicinity of the Avery house. On the following day this brigade was moved to the
                    left and directed to Maj.-Gen. Getty, commanding Sixth Corps.</p>
                <p>The Third Division, Gen. Hartranft commanding, returned during the night of the
                    10th and took up their old position. On the following morning the divisions
                    holding the front lines were extended the left as far as Fort Howard, and are
                    now holding the line from the Appomattox to that point.</p>

                        servant,</salute>
