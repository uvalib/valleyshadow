<p><b>Summary:<br></b>After the battle of Gettysburg, the Union Army of the Potomac prepared to follow and attack
     Lee. In this letter, Union railroad expert Herman Haupt writes Quartermaster-General Montgomery
     C. Meigs concerning logistics for the planned advance. Haupt believes that heading Lee's army
     off at Staunton would do the most to force a surrender by depriving it of supplies.</p>

<p>M. C. Meigs,<br> Quartermaster-Gen.:</p>
<p>Frederick,</p>
<p>July 8, 1863.<br> (Received 3.40 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The difficulty here arose from the detention of twenty trains at Frederick, while fifteen
     more were on the road, bound west. Gen. French should have allowed the first trains to be
     unloaded and sent back, and taken others for troops when he was ready for them. The Cumberland
     Valley road is now becoming an important route. I am needed here no longer. The blockade is
     relieved. Fifteen or more trains have been returned, and I anticipate no further trouble. I
     will return immediately, go to Harrisburg, and push through the line to Hagerstown as fast as
     we can get possession. We should be able to capture many prisoners and take wagons and
     ambulances, and perhaps artillery, before the enemy can cross the river. The late rains and bad
     roads will help us, but I do not believe we can prevent Lee's army from crossing. I could build
     trestle-bridges of round sticks, and floor with fence rails. It is too much to assume that the
     rebels cannot do the same.</p>
<p>If they get across, we should not follow at their heels, but strike at once for White Plains,
     use the railroad from that point, and head them off at Staunton. It seems to me that every
     effort must be made by the rebels to save Lee by sending him supplies via the Shenandoah
     Valley.</p>
<p>If we could find force enough to occupy the passes of the Blue Ridge, we could capture supply
     trains, and reduce the rebels to such a state of destitution as would compel a surrender. Our
     course seems to me to be a clear one, and, if you concur in this opinion, I hope you will talk
     it over with Gen. Halleck.</p>
<p>In making your arrangements, if it becomes necessary to send troops from this vicinity to be
     transported south over the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, much time and confusion will be
     saved by marching to White Plains. They should not be sent through Washington by rail. I have
     mentioned this to Ingalls, and he concurs in the opinion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. HAUPT.</p>
