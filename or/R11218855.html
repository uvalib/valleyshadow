<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this April, 1862, letter, Robert E. Lee, acting as military advisor to
                    Jefferson Davis and functioning as a Chief of Staff, gives movement orders to
                    Confederate General Henry Heth. Lee fears Union troops will occupy Staunton and
                    suggests that, in that event, Heth use the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad for
                    communications. Lee's fear illustrates the importance of Staunton as a center of
                    railroad communication.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Brig. Gen. HENRY HETH,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Lewisburg, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>April 18, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The report of the strength of the enemy in Shenandoah Valley renders it probable
                    that he may succeed in occupying Staunton. Your communication by that route will
                    in that event be cut, and you must rely on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.
                    It will depend upon the ability of the enemy and his further movements whether
                    you may not be obliged to fall back toward Lynchburg. In that event you must
                    endeavor to hold the passage of the Blue Ridge. To this end have your army in a
                    movable condition, and keep in communication with Gen. Edward Johnson, who, if
                    compelled, will retire through Waynesborough to the Blue Ridge. All surplus
                    ammunition and stores should be sent to Lynchburg, the movements of the enemy
                    carefully watched, and every preparation made to make your army effective and
                    formidable. You must also keep Gen. H. Marshall advised of your movements and of
                    the necessities which govern them, who, under similar contingencies, will move
                    to Abingdon, and, if unable to form a junction with you, will retire east of the
                    Blue Ridge into North Carolina, probably through Taylorsville. Should you have
                    any suggestions to make as to the proposed movements under the necessity
                    supposed, I shall be pleased to receive them.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
