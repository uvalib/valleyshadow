<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Richard Ewell concerning July, 1863, troop movements
                    in the Valley. Lee reports that he ordered Imboden's cavalry from Staunton to
                    Winchester.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gen. R. S. Ewell,<br> Comdg. Corps:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 20, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>Unless I receive contrary information to what I now possess, Gen. A. P. Hill's
                    corps will move in the morning for Rappahannock County.</p>
<p>Gen. Stuart has been directed with his cavalry to continue in the Valley until he
                    finds the forces of the enemy sufficiently reduced; then to withdraw, and
                    interpose his forces between the enemy and the portion of the army east of the
                    Blue Ridge. He will notify you of all movements of the enemy of any importance.</p>
<p>I have directed Gen. Imboden to return to Winchester with his troops from
                    Staunton.</p>
<p>Col. Imboden with his cavalry will remain with you until you leave the Valley,
                    and you must give directions to all the other troops.</p>
<p>I think it probable that you will be required to follow me in a few days, so be
                    prepared with provisions, &amp;c., to move at short notice.</p>
<p>I have directed Col. Wharton, who commands such troops from Gen. Sam. Jones as
                    have arrived, to occupy Winchester and to receive your instructions.</p>
<p>Should you not require Col. James B. Terrill (now in Winchester, belonging to
                    Early's division), I suggest that he be directed to move to Front Royal, to
                    guard the pontoon bridge, which I will leave there for you.</p>
<p>I suggest that you move higher up the Valley, in the direction of Berryville or
                    Milwood, so as to be prepared to vacate the Valley if pressed by superior
                    numbers, or to join me, as circumstances may require.</p>
<p>Should your line of march by Chester Gap be cut off, you can proceed west of the
                    Massanutten Mountain, and go by Thornton's or Swift Run Gap.</p>
<p>I will march with A. P. Hill's corps. Please send me any information of the
                    enemy's movements which you may deem important.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
