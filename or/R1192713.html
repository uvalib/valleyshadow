<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this October, 1862, report, Union Quartermaster-General Montgomery C. Meigs
                    discusses supplying General George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac. He
                    mentions supplies destroyed by Confederate Cavalry behind the army at
                    Chambersburg.</p>

<p></p>
<p>OCTOBER 12, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was informed yesterday that everything called for in the way of clothing from
                    this department, except blankets, had gone forward. There had been some delays
                    for want of cars at this point. As we had not enough blankets and shelter-tents
                    at this point, I ordered by telegraph,a day or two since, 20,000 blankets and a
                    sufficient supply of shelter-tents to be sent direct from New York to Harper's
                    Ferry.</p>
<p>All the power of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and of the Cumberland Valley
                    Railroad has been used, under the direction of Brig.-Gen. Haupt, invested by the
                    Secretary with special and full powers to do anything necessary to expedite the
                    forwarding of supplies to the army under Gen. McClellan. It is nearly impossible
                    to supply such an army, having over 30,000 animals to feed, by means limited to
                    two railroads. The canal will be repaired and ready for use in a few days. It
                    was hoped that water could have been admitted to it to-day. This, if boats can
                    be found to navigate it, will increase the power of this department to forward
                    supplies considerably. I understand, however, that everything called for has
                    gone forward. What has been intercepted and destroyed by the rebel cavalry in
                    rear of the army at Chambersburg and on the railroad I have not yet learned.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>M. C. MEIGS,<br> Quartermaster-Gen.</p>
