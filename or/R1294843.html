<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones writes to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper
                    regarding cavalry movements in western Virginia during August, 1863. Jones,
                    sending his letter via Staunton, reports Jenkins' cavalry operating in the
                    Staunton area.</p>

<p>General S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector
                        General.</p>
<p>WARM SPRINGS, VIA STAUNTON,</p>
<p>August 30, 1863.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>The enemy that fought us on the 26th and 27th retreated very rapidly by
                    Huntersville, and passed Greenbrier Bridge at Marling's Bottom early yesterday
                    morning. My cavalry pursued them to that point, and a small force still
                    following them. A part of Colonel Wharton's brigade arrived here yesterday.
                    Jenkins' cavalry was about 3 miles west of Staunton last evening, coming on to
                    this place. From what I hear of Imboden he was probably at Monterey last night,
                    with the intention of moving on to Huntersville. I fear he cannot reach there in
                    time to intercept the retreating enemy. They have been severely punished, and
                    when they reach Beverly will not, I think, be fit for service for several weeks.
                    A captain of artillery, whom I have prisoner, says they started from Moorefield
                    with between 4,000 and 5,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Major-General.</p>
