                <p>In December, 1863, Confederate General Jubal Early headed a detachment of the
                    Army of Northern Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley with orders to oppose a Union
                    raid on western Virginia led by William Averell. In this dispatch, Early reports
                    to Lee's Assistant Adjutant Walter Taylor on his movements after arriving in
                    Staunton.</p>

                <p>On reaching Staunton at 1 o'clock on the morning of the 16th, I found it
                    difficult to find out anything with accuracy, and the first correct information
                    I got of Averell's movements was from General Lee from Richmond. The rains on
                    the night of the 16th prevented any passage of troops westward, and I had,
                    therefore, to send Fitzhugh Lee and Imboden by Lexington, and on the morning of
                    the 19th they were at Williamstown, 18 miles from Clifton Forge, and would have
                    reached that evening the point on Jackson's River where Averell crossed before
                    he got there, but for the fact that two telegrams from General Echols were
                    received on the 18th, containing the information that Averell had on that
                    morning returned to Salem, and this caused me to send Fitzhugh Lee and Imboden
                    to Buchanan, as I supposed Averell, returning to Salem, would only intend to
                    endeavor to make his escape by the way of Buchanan to Lexington, and thence
                    around Staunton, or by the way of Blacksburg and Salt Pond Mountain. But for
                    this erroneous information, he would certainly have been captured by Fitzhugh
                    Lee and Imboden.</p>
                <p>When I directed Fitzhugh Lee to Lexington, I determined to move one brigade of
                    infantry to Warm Springs, on Jackson's River, if I could get there, but the
                    railroad trains were so badly managed that I reached Millborough not until after
                    night on the 19th, and there learned by telegraph from Jackson that Averell was
                    crossing with his main body toward Covington, and ascertained during the night
                    that he had made good his escape with most of his force. I also learned at same
                    place that the force which had been at Strasburg had entered Harrisonburg, and
                    next morning I hastened back to Staunton, having previously telegraphed to
                    Walker to move toward Harrisonburg, and I followed him and came up with a small
                    party of the enemy's cavalry near Harrisonburg on the morning of the 21st, the
                    main body having commenced to retreat the night before. I pursued on to this
                    place, making a very heavy march, but having no regular cavalry could do
                    nothing. This body moved back in a great hurry, and has gone down the valley to
                    Harper's Ferry, as I suppose, it having passed Strasburg.</p>
                <p>On yesterday morning a body of cavalry, said to be Buford's, went into Luray--in
                    pursuit of Rosser, I suppose; but finding him gone burned Burt's tannery, and
                    his and Britton's shops, and one or two forges in the neighborhood, and then
                    went back toward Sperryville, so that the upper valley is now clear.</p>
                <p>Jackson reported having captured some 200 of Averell's men, and that 200 or 300
                    were drowned, and Fitzhugh Lee reports that Averell burned and destroyed most of
                    his wagons and artillery, but I have no accurate information.</p>
                <p>Rosser's horses were broken down and his men a good deal scattered, he having
                    accomplished nothing toward interrupting the enemy's communications. I await
                    further orders, which you will please send immediately.</p>
