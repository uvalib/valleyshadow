<p>Gen. S. Cooper,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.,
                        Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>Hdqrs. Army of Northern Virginia,</p>
<p>July 31, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following outline of the recent operations of this
                    army, for the information of the Department:</p>
<p>The position occupied by the enemy opposite Fredericksburg being one in which he
                    could not be attacked to advantage, it was determined to draw him from it. The
                    execution of this purpose embraced the relief of the Shenandoah Valley from the
                    troops that had occupied the lower part of it during the winter and spring, and,
                    if practicable, the transfer of the scene of hostilities north of the Potomac.
                    It was thought that the corresponding movements on the part of the enemy to
                    which those contemplated by us would probably give rise, might offer a fair
                    opportunity to strike a blow at the army then commanded by Gen. Hooker, and that
                    in any event that army would be compelled to leave Virginia, and, possibly, to
                    draw to its support troops designed to operate against other parts of the
                    country. In this way it was supposed that the enemy's plan of campaign for the
                    summer would be broken up, and part of the season of active operations be
                    consumed in the formation of new combinations, and the preparations that they
                    would require. In addition to these advantages, it was hoped that other valuable
                    results might be attained by military success. Actuated by these and other
                    important considerations that may hereafter be presented, the movement began on
                    June 3. McLaws' division, of Longstreet's corps, left Fredericksburg for
                    Culpeper Court-House, and Hood's division, which was encamped on the Rapidan,
                    marched to the same place. They were followed on the 4th and 5th by Ewell's
                    corps, leaving that of A. P. Hill to occupy our lines at Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>The march of these troops having been discovered by the enemy on the afternoon of
                    the 5th, on the following day he crossed a force amounting to about one army
                    corps to the south side of the Rappahannock, on a pontoon bridge laid down near
                    the mouth of Deep Run. Gen. Hill disposed his command to resist their advance,
                    but as they seemed intended for the purpose of observation rather than attack,
                    the movements in progress were not arrested.</p>
<p>The forces of Longstreet and Ewell reached Culpeper Court-House by the 8th, at
                    which point the cavalry, under Gen. Stuart, was also concentrated.</p>
<p>On the 9th, a large force of Federal cavalry, strongly supported by infantry,
                    crossed the Rappahannock at Beverly and Kelly's Fords, and attacked Gen. Stuart.
                    A severe engagement ensued, continuing from early in the morning until late in
                    the afternoon, when the enemy was forced to recross the river with heavy loss,
                    leaving 400 prisoners, 3 pieces of artillery, and several colors in our hands.</p>
<p>Gen. Jenkins, with his cavalry brigade, had been ordered to advance to
                    Winchester, to co-operate with the infantry in the proposed expedition into the
                    lower Valley, and at the same time Gen. Imboden was directed with his command to
                    make a demonstration in the direction of Romney, in order to cover the movement
                    against Winchester, and prevent the enemy at that place from being re-enforced
                    by the troops on the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Both of these
                    officers were in position when Gen. Ewell left Culpeper Court-House on the 10th.
                    Crossing the Shenandoah near Front Royal, he detached Rodes' division to
                    Berryville, with instructions, after dislodging the force stationed there, to
                    cut off the communication between Winchester and the Potomac. With the divisions
                    of Early and Edward Johnson, Gen. Ewell advanced directly upon Winchester,
                    driving the enemy into his works around the town on the 13th. On the same day
                    the troops at Berryville fell back before Gen. Rodes, retreating to Winchester.</p>
<p>On the 14th, Gen. Early stormed the works at the latter place, and the whole army
                    of Gen. Milroy was captured or dispersed. Most of those who attempted to escape
                    were intercepted and made prisoners by Gen. Johnson. Their leader fled to
                    Harper's Ferry with a small party of fugitives.</p>
<p>Gen. Rodes marched from Berryville to Martinsburg, entering the latter place on
                    the 14th, where he took 700 prisoners, 5 pieces of artillery, and a considerable
                    quantity of stores. These operations cleared the Valley of the enemy, those at
                    Harper's Ferry withdrawing to Maryland Heights. More than 4,000 prisoners, 29
                    pieces of artillery, 270 wagons and ambulances, with 400 horses, were captured,
                    besides a large amount of military stores. Our loss was small.</p>
<p>On the night that Ewell appeared at Winchester, the Federal troops in front of A.
                    P. Hill at Fredericksburg recrossed the Rappahannock, and the next day
                    disappeared behind the hills of Stafford. The whole army of Gen. Hooker withdrew
                    from the line of the Rappahannock, pursuing the roads near the Potomac, and no
                    favorable opportunity was offered for attack. It seemed to be the purpose of
                    Gen. Hooker to take a position which would enable him to cover the approaches to
                    Washington City. With a view to draw him farther from his base, and at the same
                    time to cover the march of A. P. Hill, who, in accordance with instructions,
                    left Fredericksburg for the Valley as soon as the enemy withdrew from his front,
                    Longstreet moved from Culpeper Court-House on the 15th, and, advancing along the
                    east side of the Blue Ridge, occupied Ashby's and Snicker's Gaps. His force had
                    been augmented, while at Culpeper, by Gen. Pickett, with three brigades of his
                    division. The cavalry under Gen. Stuart was thrown out in front of Longstreet,
                    to watch the enemy, now reported to be moving into Loudoun.</p>
<p>On the 17th, his cavalry encountered two brigades of ours under Gen. Stuart, near
                    Aldie, and was driven back with loss. The next day the engagement was renewed,
                    the Federal cavalry being strongly supported by infantry, and Gen. Stuart was,
                    in turn, compelled to retire. The enemy advanced as far as Upperville, and then
                    fell back. In these engagements, Gen. Stuart took about 400 prisoners and a
                    considerable number of horses and arms.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a part of Gen. Ewell's corps had entered Maryland, and the rest
                    was about to follow. Gen. Jenkins, with his cavalry, who accompanied Gen. Ewell,
                    penetrated Pennsylvania as far as Chambersburg. As these demonstrations did not
                    have the effect of causing the Federal Army to leave Virginia, and as it did not
                    seem disposed to advance upon the position held by Longstreet, the latter was
                    withdrawn to the west side of the Shenandoah, Gen. Hill having already reached
                    the Valley. Gen. Stuart was left to guard the passes of the mountains and
                    observe the movements of the enemy, whom he was instructed to harass and impede
                    as much as possible, should he attempt to cross the Potomac. In that event, Gen.
                    Stuart was directed to move into Maryland, crossing the Potomac east or west of
                    the Blue Ridge, as, in his judgment, should be best, and take position on the
                    right of our column as it advanced.</p>
<p>By the 24th, the progress of Ewell rendered it necessary that the rest of the
                    army should be within supporting distance, and Longstreet and Hill marched to
                    the Potomac. The former crossed at Williamsport and the latter at Shepherdstown.
                    The columns reunited at Hagerstown, and advanced thence into Pennsylvania,
                    encamping near Chambersburg on the 27th.</p>
<p>No report had been received that the Federal Army had crossed the Potomac, and
                    the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate
                    information. In order, however, to retain it on the east side of the mountains,
                    after it should enter Maryland, and thus leave open our communication with the
                    Potomac through Hagerstown and Williamsport, Gen. Ewell had been instructed to
                    send a division eastward from Chambersburg to cross the South Mountain. Early's
                    division was detached for this purpose, and proceeded as far east as York, while
                    the remainder of the corps proceeded to Carlisle.</p>
<p>Gen. Imboden, in pursuance of the instructions previously referred to, had been
                    actively engaged on the left of Gen. Ewell during the progress of the latter
                    into Maryland. He had driven off the forces guarding the Baltimore and Ohio
                    Railroad, destroying all the important bridges on that route from Cumberland to
                    Martinsburg, and seriously damaged the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. He
                    subsequently took position at Hancock, and, after the arrival of Longstreet and
                    Hill at Chambersburg, was directed to march by way of McConnellsburg to that
                    place.</p>
<p>Preparations were now made to advance upon Harrisburg; but, on the night of the
                    28th, information was received from a scout that the Federal Army, having
                    crossed the Potomac, was advancing northward, and that the head of the column
                    had reached the South Mountain. As our communications with the Potomac were thus
                    menaced, it was resolved to prevent his farther progress in that direction by
                    concentrating our army on the east side of the mountains. Accordingly,
                    Longstreet and Hill were directed to proceed from Chambersburg to Gettysburg, to
                    which point Gen. Ewell was also instructed to march from Carlisle.</p>
<p>Gen. Stuart continued to follow the movements of the Federal Army south of the
                    Potomac, after our own had entered Maryland, and, in his efforts to impede its
                    progress, advanced as far eastward as Fairfax Court-House. Finding himself
                    unable to delay the enemy materially, he crossed the river at Seneca, and
                    marched through Westminster to Carlisle, where he arrived after Gen. Ewell had
                    left for Gettysburg. By the route he pursued, the Federal Army was interposed
                    between his command and our main body, preventing any communication with him
                    until his arrival at Carlisle. The march toward Gettysburg was conducted more
                    slowly than it would have been had the movements of the Federal Army been known.</p>
<p>The leading division of Hill met the enemy in advance of Gettysburg on the
                    morning of July 1. Driving back these troops to within a short distance of the
                    town, he there encountered a larger force, with which two of his divisions
                    became engaged. Ewell, coming up with two of his divisions by the Heidlersburg
                    road, joined in the engagement. The enemy was driven through Gettysburg with
                    heavy loss, including about 5,000 prisoners and several pieces of artillery. He
                    retired to a high range of hills south and east of the town. The attack was not
                    pressed that afternoon, the enemy's force being unknown, and it being considered
                    advisable to await the arrival of the rest of our troops. Orders were sent back
                    to hasten their march, and,in the meantime, every effort was made to ascertain
                    the numbers and position of the enemy, and find the most favorable point of
                    attack. It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance
                    from our base, unless attacked by the enemy, but, finding ourselves unexpectedly
                    confronted by the Federal Army, it became a matter of difficulty to withdraw
                    through the mountains with our large trains. At the same time, the country was
                    unfavorable for collecting supplies while in the presence of the enemy's main
                    body, as he was enabled to restrain our foraging parties by occupying the passes
                    of the mountains with regular and local troops. A battle thus became, in a
                    measure, unavoidable. Encouraged by the successful issue of the engagement of
                    the first day, and in view of the valuable results that would ensue from the
                    defeat of the army of Gen. Meade, it was thought advisable to renew the attack.
                    The remainder of Ewell's and Hill's corps having arrived, and two divisions of
                    Longstreet's, our preparations were made accordingly. During the afternoon,
                    intelligence was received of the arrival of Gen. Stuart at Carlisle, and he was
                    ordered to march to Gettysburg and take position on our left. A full account of
                    these engagements cannot be given until the reports of the several commanding
                    officers shall have been received, and I shall only offer a general description.</p>
<p>The preparations for attack were not completed until the afternoon of the 2d. The
                    enemy held a high and commanding ridge, along which he had massed a large amount
                    of artillery. Gen. Ewell occupied the left of our line, Gen. Hill the center,
                    and Gen. Longstreet the right. In front of Gen. Longstreet the enemy held a
                    position from which, if he could be driven, it was thought our artillery could
                    be used to advantage in assailing the more elevated ground beyond, and thus
                    enable us to reach the crest of the ridge. That officer was directed to endeavor
                    to carry this position, while Gen. Ewell attacked directly the high ground on
                    the enemy's right, which had already been partially fortified. Gen. Hill was
                    instructed to threaten the center of the Federal line, in order to prevent
                    re-enforcements being sent to either wing, and to avail himself of any
                    opportunity that might present itself to attack. After a severe struggle,
                    Longstreet succeeded in getting possession of and holding the desired ground.
                    Ewell also carried some of the strong positions which he assailed, and the
                    result was such as to lead to the belief that he would ultimately be able to
                    dislodge the enemy. The battle ceased at dark.</p>
<p>These partial successes determined me to continue the assault next day. Pickett,
                    with three of his brigades, joined Longstreet the following morning, and our
                    batteries were moved forward to the positions gained by him the day before. The
                    general plan of attack was unchanged, excepting that one division and two
                    brigades of Hill's corps were ordered to support Longstreet.</p>
<p>The enemy, in the meantime, had strengthened his lines with earthworks. The
                    morning was occupied in necessary preparations, and the battle recommenced in
                    the afternoon of the 3d, and raged with great violence until sunset. Our troops
                    succeeded in entering the advanced works of the enemy, and getting possession of
                    some of his batteries, but our artillery having nearly expended its ammunition,
                    the attacking columns became exposed to the heavy fire of the numerous batteries
                    near the summit of the ridge, and, after a most determined and gallant struggle,
                    were compelled to relinquish their advantage, and fall back to their original
                    positions with severe loss.</p>
<p>The conduct of the troops was all that I could desire or expect, and they deserve
                    success so far as it can be deserved by heroic valor and fortitude. More may
                    have been required of them than they were able to perform, but my admiration of
                    their noble qualities and confidence in their ability to cope successfully with
                    the enemy has suffered no abatement from the issue of this protracted and
                    sanguinary conflict.</p>
<p>Owing to the strength of the enemy's position, and the reduction of our
                    ammunition, a renewal of the engagement could not be hazarded, and the
                    difficulty of procuring supplies rendered it impossible to continue longer where
                    we were. Such of the wounded as were in condition to be removed, and part of the
                    arms collected on the field, were ordered to Williamsport.</p>
<p>The army remained at Gettysburg during the 4th, and at night began to retire by
                    the road to Fairfield, carrying with it about 4,000 prisoners. Nearly 2,000 had
                    previously been paroled, but the enemy's numerous wounded that had fallen into
                    our hands after the first and second days' engagements were left behind.</p>
<p>Little progress was made that night, owing to a severe storm, which greatly
                    embarrassed our movements. The rear of the column did not leave its position
                    near Gettysburg until after day light on the 5th. The march was continued during
                    that day without interruption from the enemy, excepting an unimportant
                    demonstration upon our rear in the afternoon when near Fairfield, which was
                    easily checked. Part of our train moved by the road through Fairfield, and the
                    rest by way of Cashtown, guarded by Gen. Imboden. In passing through the
                    mountains in advance of the column, the great length of the trains exposed them
                    to attack by the enemy's cavalry, which captured a number of wagons and
                    ambulances, but they succeeded in reaching Williamsport without serious loss.</p>
<p>They were attacked at that place on the 6th by the enemy's cavalry, which was
                    gallantly repulsed by Gen. Imboden. The attacking force was subsequently
                    encountered and driven off by Gen. Stuart, and pursued for several miles in the
                    direction of Boonsborough. The army, after an arduous march, rendered more
                    difficult by the rains, reached Hagerstown on the afternoon of July 6 and
                    morning of the 7th.</p>
<p>The Potomac was found to be so much swollen by the rains that had fallen almost
                    incessantly since our entrance into Maryland as to be unfordable. Our
                    communications with the south side were thus interrupted, and it was difficult
                    to procure either ammunition or subsistence, the latter difficulty being
                    enhanced by the high waters impeding the working of the neighboring mills. The
                    trains with the wounded and prisoners were compelled to await at Williamsport
                    the subsiding of the river and the construction of boats, as the pontoon bridge
                    left at Falling Waters had been partially destroyed. The enemy had not yet made
                    his appearance, but as he was in condition to obtain large re-enforcements, and
                    our situation, for the reasons above mentioned, was becoming daily more
                    embarrassing, it was deemed advisable to recross the river. Part of the pontoon
                    bridge was recovered and new boats built, so that by the 13th a good bridge was
                    thrown over the river at Falling Waters.</p>
<p>The enemy in force reached our front on the 12th. A position had been previously
                    selected to cover the Potomac from Williamsport to Falling Waters, and an attack
                    was awaited during that and the succeeding day. This did not take place, though
                    the two armies were in close proximity, the enemy being occupied in fortifying
                    his own lines. Our preparations being completed, and the river, though still
                    deep, being pronounced fordable, the army commenced to withdraw to the south
                    side on the night of the 13th. Ewell's corps forded the river at Williamsport.
                    Those of Longstreet and Hill crossed upon the bridge. Owing to the condition of
                    the roads, the troops did not reach the bridge until after daylight on the 14th,
                    and the crossing was not completed until 1 p. m., when the bridge was removed.
                    The enemy offered no serious interruption, and the movement was attended with no
                    loss of Materiel excepting a few disabled wagons and two pieces of artillery,
                    which the horses were unable to move through the deep mud. Before fresh horses
                    could be sent back for them, the rear of the column had passed. During the slow
                    and tedious march to the bridge, in the midst of a violent storm of rain, some
                    of the men lay down by the way to rest. Officers sent back for them failed to
                    find many in the obscurity of the night, and these, with some stragglers, fell
                    into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. Pettigrew was mortally wounded in an attack made by a small body of
                    cavalry, which was unfortunately mistaken for our own, and permitted to enter
                    our lines. He was brought to Bunker Hill, where he expired a few days afterward.
                    He was a brave and accomplished officer and gentleman, and his loss will be
                    deeply felt by the country and the army.</p>
<p>The following day the army marched to Bunker Hill, in the vicinity of which it
                    encamped for several days. The day after its arrival, a large force of the
                    enemy's cavalry, which had crossed the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, advanced
                    toward Martinsburg. It was attacked by Gen. Fitz. Lee, near Kearneysville, and
                    defeated with heavy loss, leaving its dead and many of its wounded on the field.</p>
<p>Owing to the swollen condition of the Shenandoah, the plan of operations which
                    had been contemplated when we recrossed the Potomac could not be put into
                    execution, and before the waters had subsided, the movements of the enemy
                    induced me to cross the Blue Ridge and take position south of the Rappahannock,
                    which was accordingly done.</p>
<p>As soon as the reports of the commanding officers shall be received, a more
                    detailed account of these operations will be given, and occasion will then be
                    taken to speak more particularly of the conspicuous gallantry and good conduct
                    of both officers and men.</p>
<p>It is not yet in my power to give a correct statement of our casualties, which
                    were severe, including many brave men, and an unusual proportion of
                    distinguished and valuable officers. Among them I regret to mention the
                    following general officers: Maj.-Gen.'s Hood, Pender, and Trimble severely, and
                    Maj.-Gen. Heth slightly wounded.</p>
<p>Gen. Pender has since died. This lamented officer had borne a distinguished part
                    in every engagement of this army, and was wounded on several occasions while
                    leading his command with conspicuous gallantry and ability. The confidence and
                    admiration inspired by his courage and capacity as an officer were only equaled
                    by the esteem and respect entertained by all with whom he was associated for the
                    noble qualities of his modest and unassuming character.</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen.'s Barksdale and R. B. Garnett were killed, and Brig.-Gen. Semmes
                    mortally wounded, while leading their troops with the courage that always
                    distinguished them. These brave officers and patriotic gentlemen fell in the
                    faithful discharge of duty, leaving the army to mourn their loss and emulate
                    their noble examples. Brig.-Gen.'s Kemper, Armistead, Scales, G. T. Anderson,
                    Hampton, J. M. Jones, and Jenkins were also wounded. Brig.-Gen. Archer was taken
                    prisoner.</p>
<p>Gen. Pettigrew, though wounded at Gettysburg, continued in command until he was
                    mortally wounded, near Falling Waters.</p>
<p>The loss of the enemy is unknown, but from observation on the field, and his
                    subsequent movements, it is supposed that he suffered severely.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
