<p><b>Summary:<br></b>This June, 1864, notice from Lee discusses Confederate General Echols relief from
                    command due to sickness, the need for an active commander in the Valley, and the
                    expected arrival of General W. E. Jones in Staunton.</p>

<p>HDQRS. ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,</p>
<p>June 3, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Respectfully forwarded.</p>
<p>It is requested that Gen. Echols be relieved from the command of his brigade in
                    this army on account of ill-health. From his condition, as represented by the
                    Hon. Mr. Caperton, I do not think he will be able to take command of the
                    Department of Western Virginia at this time. The condition of affairs there now
                    requires an active, energetic, and strong commander. Gen. W. E. Jones is, I
                    hope, by this time with his troops at Staunton. I think he is senior to Gen.
                    Echols. The Department must judge who is the most proper for the supreme
                    command.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
