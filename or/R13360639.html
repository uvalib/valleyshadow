                    by a scout in March, 1864. The scout reported Confederate General Thomas
                    Rosser's brigade to be stationed near Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. GEORGE G. MEADE,<br> Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>March 4, 1864.--10 a. m. (Received 11.20 a. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scouts sent out have returned. They brought with them the scout sent to cut
                    the telegraph. On Sunday night at 11 o'clock he disconnected the wires at
                    Frederick's Hall Station. Next day at 10 a. m. he saw Dahlgren come in there.
                    The telegraph station was destroyed, road torn up, and other damage done, but
                    the artillery, distant 500 yards, was not seen, and was not disturbed. The scout
                    saw a very large fire in the vicinity of Hanover Junction Monday at 3 p. m. and
                    in the evening a larger one lower down. On his way back the scout was taken
                    prisoner by the rebels, who told him they had been beaten at Hanover Junction
                    and the bridge there destroyed. The rebel soldiers also reported that Kilpatrick
                    had struck the Central train on its way to Gordonsville, and had taken Gen. Lee
                    a prisoner. The scout escaped near Chancellorsville. Hampton is in pursuit of
                    Kilpatrick with 1,800 men. The scout reports large forces of infantry about
                    Chancellorsville and all roads very closely picketed and the river patrolled by
                    infantry. The old man has a letter from his daughter showing that Rosser was
                    then near Staunton. The reconnaissance sent out this morning not heard from yet.
                    The following dispatch just received from Kilpatrick.</p>
