<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this May, 1862, letter, Union General Nathaniel P. Banks informs General
                    Williams of movements in the Valley. He speculates that Confederate forces

<p>Gen. S. WILLIAMS:</p>
<p>STRASBURG,</p>
<p>March 26, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>The enemy has retreated to Mount Jackson, possibly to Staunton. Our cavalry
                    advancing as far as Woodstock. No troops. The advance brigade has taken a strong
                    position 4 or 5 miles in advance of the town, and when intrenched will command
                    absolutely the valley from mountain to mountain. The movement of the brigades of
                    Williams' division to Manassas by reconstruction of the bridges is
                    impracticable, on account of their great height and the want of timber. The only
                    course in that direction is to bridge the forks of the river on the country road
                    above the railway, and follow the roads in that direction to Manassas. To make
                    this safe, we ought to be supported from Manassas by occupation of Warrenton and
                    the roads leading from that point to the railway. The other and safer is to
                    follow the route by Snicker's Ferry; this should be selected. I think we can
                    occupy Front Royal and Chester Gap from this side. You can judge better which is
                    our true course and when we should move, and I will be glad to receive
                    instructions. The enemy is broken, but will rally. Their purpose is to unite
                    Jackson's and Longstreet's forces--some 20,000--at New Market, below Mount
                    Jackson or at Washington, in order to operate on either side of the mountain,
                    and will desire to prevent our junction of the forces at Manassas. At present
                    they will not attack here. When the First Division moves is uncertain. It would
                    relieve me greatly to know something of Rosecrans' movements, and how far the
                    enemy will be pressed in front of Manassas. Our cavalry and artillery, with
                    infantry supports, are kept well in front of our advanced position here, and the
                    enemy harassed continually.</p>
