<p>Colonel</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 3, 1865.</p>
<p>COL</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the Third
                    Division, Ninth Army Corps, in the operations in front of Petersburg, Va., from
                    March 30 to April 9:</p>
<p>On the night of March 30, in compliance with orders from corps headquarters, the
                    First Brigade of my command, consisting of the Two hundredth, Two hundred and
                    eighth, and Two hundred and ninth Regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers, under
                    command of Lieut. Col. W. H. McCall, Two hundredth Regt. Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, was massed near the Avery house, and the Second Brigade, consisting
                    of the Two hundred and fifth, Two hundred and seventh, and Two hundred and
                    eleventh Regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers, under command of Col. J. A. Mathews,
                    Two hundred and fifth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, near Fort Prescott, with
                    a view of forming an assaulting column in front of Fort Sedqwick at daylight on
                    the following morning, but at 2,45 a.m. March 31 orders were received
                    countermanding the movement, and the troops were accordingly sent back to their
                    respective camps. The division was held in readiness in camp during March 31 and
                    April 1 ready to meet any emergency.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m. on the night of April 1 my troops were massed in the manner heretofore
                    mentioned, and at 3 o'clock on the morning of April 2 an assaulting column was
                    formed in front of Fort Sedgwick, to the right of the Jerusalem plank road and
                    between our main line of works and the picket-line. The First Brigade, First
                    Division, Ninth Army Corps, Col. Samuel Harriman, Thirty-eighth Regt. Wisconsin
                    Volunteers, commanding, consisting of the Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth
                    Regiments Wisconsin Volunteers, Eighth and Twenty-seventh Regiments Michigan
                    Volunteers, and One hundred and ninth Regt. New York Volunteers, reported to me
                    for orders at Fort Sedgwick at 2 o'clock on the morning of April 2, in
                    compliance with orders from Maj.-Gen. Parke, commanding corps, and was put into
                    position on the right of the Third Division.</p>
<p>The assaulting column was formed in column of regiments, with the left resting on
                    the Jerusalem plank road, in the following order: Two hundred and seventh
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers, Col. Cox commanding; Two hundred and fifth Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, Maj. Morrow commanding; Two hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, Col. Dodd commanding; Two hundred and eighth Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, Lieut.-Col. Heintzelman commanding. The Two hundred and ninth and
                    Two hundredth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, of the Third Division, were held in
                    reserve behind the works. Three regiments of Harriman's brigade, of the First
                    Division, also formed in column of regiments on the right of the Third Division
                    in the following order: Thirty-eighth Regt. Wisconsin Volunteers, Col. Bintliff
                    commanding; One hundred and ninth Regt. New York Volunteers, Lieut. Col. C. K.
                    Pier [Thirty-eighth Wisconsin, commanding]; Eighth Regt. Michigan Volunteers,
                    Maj. R. N. Doyle commanding. The Twenty-seventh Michigan and Thirty-seventh
                    Volunteers were held in reserve in rear of the line of entrenchments. Strong
                    engineer parties were formed in front of the assaulting columns. These parties
                    were divided into squads and one squad placed on the right of each division of
                    the leading regiments to cut away the abatis and chevaux de-frise in front of
                    the enemy's works.</p>
<p>Potter's division was formed on the left of the Jerusalem plank road and facing
                    Fort Mahone. Gen. Griffin, commanding Second Brigade Second Division, was to
                    make the advance, and my movement was to conform with his advance, and to this
                    end one of my staff officers remained on the left of the first regiment of my
                    assaulting column and communicated with an officer of Gen. Griffin's command.</p>
<p>At 4.30 a.m., just at dawn of day, the assault was made. My command moved forward
                    in the most handsome and gallant manner, capturing the enemy's picket-line, and
                    advanced to his main line, carrying all his works from a point a little to the
                    left of the Jerusalem plank road, and for a distance of 400 yards to the right
                    of the Jerusalem plank road (the line carried by my troops was known, by the
                    enemy as Miller's Salient), capturing --- pieces of artillery, 3 battle-flags,
                    and a considerable number of prisoners. As soon as the line was carried the four
                    reserve regiments were pushed forward to support the assaulting columns, which
                    were much broken under the heavy fire of the enemy, and in passing through the
                    enemy's abatis, &amp;c. These regiments also suffered greatly from the fire
                    of the enemy's artillery on the left of the works captured by the Second
                    Division and from a two-gun battery of 8-inch howitzers in the rear of the lines
                    captured.</p>
<p>The pioneer parties did their work most nobly and effectually; the wires
                    connecting and binding together the section of chevaux-de-frise were cut and the
                    sections pulled back inthe manner of opening a gate . This was very difficult to
                    accomplish, and my men, suffering very much from the enemy's fire, grew
                    impatient, and with a will large numbers of them seized the sections, and by
                    main force opened passages as above indicated.</p>
<p>The guns captured were immediately turned upon the enemy, using their ammunition,
                    and worked with effect by my men until artillerists, which were promptly
                    forwarded, were sent to man them.</p>
<p>Seeing that farther advance was impracticable, the troops being much exhausted in
                    advancing, and the enemy still holding a strong position in the covered ways and
                    traverses and having possession of a two-gun 8-inch mortar battery, and one
                    8-inch columbiad battery, I placed my troops in the most advantageous position
                    along the line of captured works and put them to work to make them tenable.
                    Works were also thrown up in rear of the enemy's field-works to protect the
                    artillerists who worked the guns. The ammunition left by the enemy was soon
                    exhausted, but the demand was promptly supplied from time to time during the day
                    by Brevet Brig.-Gen. Tidball, chief of artillery, and carried to the front under
                    severe fire by troops of Col. Carruth, commanding Thirty-fifth Massachusetts
                    Volunteers, and by detachments of my men.</p>
<p>Three determined charges to retake the works were made by the enemy during the
                    day, one at 11.15 a.m., the second at 1.05 p.m., and the last at 3 p.m. In the
                    latter charge the left of the line held by my command was forced to retire for a
                    short time, owing to the fact that part of the works held by the Second Division
                    were retaken by the enemy, giving him a sweeping flank fire on my left, but upon
                    the advance of new troops on the left my men regained confidence, and the line
                    was re-established. At 4. 45 p.m. the Second Brigade, First Division, Sixth
                    Corps, Bvt. Brig. Gen. J. E. Hamblin commanding, reported to me at Fort Sedgwick
                    and was immediately ordered to the front to support the left of my line, and, of
                    possible, occupy part of the line farther to the left; the latter was
                    impossible, owing to the enfilading fire of the enemy from the covered way
                    leading from Fort Mahone, and this brigade was then held as a support to the
                    left of my line.</p>
<p>Immediately after dark a skirmish line was pushed forward, and the
                    chevaux-de-frise taken from the rear and put our in front, of the line of my
                    division. A line of works which had been commenced during the day connecting
                    Miller's Salient with our picket-line on the right was completed and occupied,
                    and much work was done during the night along the entire line held to put it in
                    the most defensible position. The Two hundred and fifth, Two hundred and
                    seventh, and Two hundred and eleventh Regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers were
                    withdrawn to our old picket-line as a reserve, and Gen. Hamblin's troops placed
                    in the position occupied by these regiments.</p>
<p>At 3 a.m. of the 3d of April I ordered the officer of the day to advance his
                    skirmishers and feel for the enemy, and at the same time all the troops of my
                    command were half in readiness for movement. The enemy having retired from my
                    immediate front at 3.30 a.m., I moved my division forward in column of
                    regiments, and at the same time ordered Col. Harriman to move forward in the
                    same manner on the right and Gen. Hamblin on the left, and advanced to the
                    suburbs of Petersburg without opposition, reaching it at a few minutes before 5
                    a.m. My line of skirmishers reached the city at about 3.15 a.m.</p>
<p>Immediately upon arriving in the city the Two hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, Col. Dodd commanding was sent to the river to secure the bridges and
                    prevent them from being destroyed, and picket the river, and the Two hundred and
                    ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers was sent to the left to communicate with troops of
                    the Sixth Corps, and Col. McCalmont, with the Two hundredth and Two hundred and
                    eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, was ordered to take possession of the city, but
                    upon arriving at the court-house he was met by Col. Ely, commanding a brigade in
                    First Division, who claimed that the surrender of the city had been formally
                    made to him, whereupon Col. McCalmont withdrew his command to the outskirts of
                    the city, where the balance of the division was stationed. I am satisfied that
                    my skirmishers were the first Union troops in the city, and that Col.
                    McClamont's brigade was the first which entered the limits of the city in a
                    body.</p>
<p>I ordered Col. Dodd as soon as relieved by troops which were to occupy the city,
                    also Lieut.-Col. Frederick, commanding Two hundred and ninth Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers after receiving his report that he had communicated with troops of
                    the Sixth Corps, to return to their original camps. Harriman's Hamblin's
                    brigades were ordered to rejoin their divisions. I then marched my division to
                    the vicinity of the Avery house and got it in readiness for immediate movement.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from speaking in the highest terms of the conduct of the
                    officers and men of my command for their brave, gallant, and heroic conduct in
                    this engagement and for the tenacity with which they held every inch of the
                    captured works, and met and repulsed the stout and determined charges of the
                    enemy during the entire day. They are deserving of the greatest praise. I would
                    call particular attention to the conduct of Col. J. A. Mathews, Two hundred and
                    fifth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanding Second Brigade; Lieut. Col.
                    W. H. H. McCall, Two hundredth Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanding First
                    Brigade, and Col. Samuel Harriman, commanding First Brigade First Division, for
                    their promptness and energy in disposing of and advancing the columns. To Col.
                    T. C. Cox, two hundred and seventh Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Col. James
                    Bintliff, Thirty-eighth Regt. Wisconsin Volunteers, who commanded the leading
                    regiments of the charging column, and who by their bravery skill, and
                    determination pushed their commands through the enemy's abatis, and captured the
                    works, I am much indebted for the brilliant success which attended this
                    movement. Great credit is due to Col. L. A. Dodd, Two hundred and eleventh
                    Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Col. R. C. Cox, Two hundred and seventh
                    Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers, for their energy and skill in disposing of their
                    commands and for the determination with which they met every advance of the
                    enemy. These regiment were on the most exposed portion of the line and were put
                    to the severest test. To Bvt. Brig. Gen. J. E. Hamblin, brigade, for the
                    gallantry with which he led his brigade into position and for his promptness and
                    the efficiency of his command while it under my orders.</p>
