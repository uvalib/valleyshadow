                <p>In compliance with orders from headquarters Middle Military Division, I have the
                    honor to submit the following report of the operations of this command from the
                    time of the formation of the Middle Military Division up to the 10th instant:</p>
                <p>On the 6th day of August this corps arrived at Halltown from the Monocacy River
                    and took position there on the right, the Second Division, Brig.-Gen. Getty,
                    resting near to and on the right of the pike, connecting with the Nineteenth
                    Corps, the Third Division, Brig.-Gen. Ricketts, on the right of the Second, and
                    the First Division, Brig.-Gen. Russell, on the right and rear of the Third,
                    extending almost to the Potomac, with the picket-line reaching to that river.
                    The corps remained in this position until the morning of the 10th, when it moved
                    at 5 a. m., under directions from headquarters Middle Military Division, through
                    Charlestown, and thence to a point on the Berryville and Middleway pike about
                    one mile and a half from its junction with the Winchester and Berryville pike,
                    and designated in the order of march as Clifton. It encamped here that night,
                    the Nineteenth Corps being on its left, and Col. Lowell's brigade of cavalry at
                    Summit Point. On the morning of the 11th, at 5 a. m., the march was resumed, the
                    corps moving to the ford of the Opequon Creek on the Winchester and Berryville
                    pike. The enemy held the crossing on the previous evening, citizens, reporting
                    that Breckinridge's corps was there, with some cavalry. The infantry fell back
                    during the night, and upon our advance a small force of cavalry only was found,
                    and this immediately withdrew. After halting about three hours orders were
                    received to move up the right bank of the creek to its crossing on the Millwood
                    pike. This point was reached about 5 p. m. and the corps encamped there for the
                    night, moving at 6 the next morning, by the way of Newtown and Middletown, to
                    the crossing of Cedar Creek on the Strasbrug pike. Gen. Crook had arrived with
                    his command before the arrival of mine, and found the enemy's skirmishers on the
                    south side of the creek. Upon the arrival of my corps skirmishers from the two
                    commands were sent over the creek; those from Gen. Crook on the left of the
                    pike, mine on the right. A slight skirmish fire was dept up from about 4 in the
                    afternoon until 8.</p>
                <p>The enemy withdrew before daylight of the 13th, at 7 a. m. of that day this corps
                    received orders and moved toward Strasbrug. The enemy was found in position at
                    Fisher's Hill, about two miles south of Strasburg. At night, in consequence of
                    reports of the enemy being largely re-enforced, the corps was withdrawn to the
                    north side of Cedar Creek, the troops occupying their camps of the day before,
                    and the picket-line being well advanced on the south side. The enemy was found
                    the next morning in his position of the 12th, with a picket-line in front of
                    ours. In the afternoon, by direction of the major-general commanding, I advanced
                    my line, the First Brigade, First Division (Jersey brigade), moving in support.
                    The enemy's line was forced back after some little firing. On the afternoon of
                    the 15th the enemy made an attack on Gen. Crook's pickets on the left of the
                    pike, and his having moved back, my left, being unsupported, fell back a short
                    distance, but was ordered to push forward, and at once regained its former
                    position. At 8 p. m. of the 16th the army commenced withdrawing. This corps
                    covered the movement, marching all night, and reaching Winchester about 5
                    o'clock the next morning, when it halted for break-fast, thence moving to the
                    crossing of the Opequon, on the Berryville and Winchester pike, and there going
                    into camp. The First Brigade, First Division (Jersey brigade), was left at
                    Winchester, reporting to Gen. Torbert, chief of cavalry, at that place, and was
                    attacked on the afternoon of the 17th, losing about 150, mostly prisoners. Of
                    this affair no report has been received. On the morning of the 18th the corps
                    moved to Welch's Spring, on the Charlestown and Middleway pike, about two miles
                    from Charlestown, arriving there at 6 p. m. It then went into camp, the First
                    Division on the right of the pike, the Second on the left, and the Third in
                    reserve, and remained in quiet until Sunday, the 21st. On the morning of this
                    day information came that our cavalry at Middleway had been attacked and driven
                    off. I immediately sent staff officers to the division commanders with
                    directions for them to have their troops on the alert, and be ready for an
                    attack by the enemy. Before these officers could reach the division commanders
                    firing was heard on our picket-line. The enemy developed rapidly, mainly on the
                    south side of the road, and kept up a sharp fire, driving in our line on that
                    side of the pike. It was not supposed that driving in our line of that side of
                    the pike. It was not supposed that an advance in force could be made, without
                    notice from our cavalry in front, hence this sudden attack of the enemy was
                    almost a surprise, but the troops were soon ready, and the Third Division
                    (Brig.-Gen. Ricketts) was transferred from its potion in reserve to the left of
                    the line, where Gen. Crook afterward connected within him. Our original position
                    was regained, and the corps ready to repulse any further attack or make one if
                    ordered. The First Division of the Nineteenth Corps moved about noon, and
                    connected with my right. The loss of the corps here was about 260 killed and
                    wounded, a large proportion being from the Second Division, whose conduct on
                    this occasion cannot be too highly praised. At midnight, by orders from the
                    major-general commanding Middle Military Division, the corps moved to its old
                    position at Halltown, covering the infantry movement, reaching that place a
                    little after daylight on the morning of the 22d. It remained here until the
                    28th, there being no skirmishing or firing in my front, though some on the front
                    of the rest of the army.</p>
                <p>At 7 a. m. of the 28th the corps moved without opposition, and took up about the
                    same position occupied by it before on the pike from Charlestown to Middleway,
                    with the Nineteenth Corps connecting on the left. On the 29th, in the afternoon,
                    the cavalry being pushed back from Middleway and toward the position occupied by
                    this corps, the Third Division was moved out and advanced, in conjunction with
                    the cavalry, to Middleway. A few shots only were fired. The division remained at
                    Smithfield until dark, when it was withdrawn to a position about two miles in
                    rear.</p>
                <p>The corps remained at its position near Charlestown until the morning of
                    September 3, when it moved to the position heretofore spoken of, designated as
                    Clifton. On the 13th a reconnaissance was made by the Second Division,
                    Brig.-Gen. Getty, in conjunction with the cavalry, to Gilbert's Ford, on the
                    Opequon. Getty's division reached the creek after Gen. Custer had ascertained
                    that the enemy's infantry was there, and after he had opened fire upon it. The
                    enemy's infantry was found in some force. A few men pushed over developed a
                    still stronger force, till the exhibition of strength showed that the enemy was
                    the in strong force. My orders being not to bring on an engagement, I did not
                    attack. The division remained there until after dark, when it returned to camp,
                    the losses having been ten or twelve wounded. With he exception of this
                    reconnaissance the corps September until the 19th, when it moved across the
                    Opequon and took part in the battle near Winchester. As directed by orders from
                    headquarters Middle Military Division, a special report of the operations of
                    this corps in that engagement and the one at Fisher's Hill, which succeeded,
                    accompanies this report.</p>
                <p>On the night of the 19th the corps encamped at Winchester, and the next day moved
                    to near Strasburg. On the 21st, toward evening, we took an advanced position
                    held by the enemy on our right, with some brief but sharp fighting, parts of the
                    Second and Third Divisions being engaged. On the next day Fisher's Hill was
                    captured and the enemy pursued all night by the Nineteenth Corps and the Sixth,
                    the former in advance. The command of the two corps had been committed to me by
                    Maj.-Gen. Sheridan. The troops reached Woodstock and were established in camp a
                    little after daylight. The head of the column was fired into once on the route,
                    which occasioned a momentary disturbance, but everything was soon right, and the
                    column moved on without further attempt at opposition. The command rested at
                    Woodstock until 1 p. m., when we moved about a mile to the south of Edenburg;
                    and the next morning I was ordered to move with the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps
                    against the enemy, who was reported to have made a stand at Mount Jackson. His
                    skirmishers were found at this place, driven through the town, and they then
                    fell back to a line of battle which had been formed by him on Rude's Hill. My
                    advanced batteries commenced shelling his position. Before the troops could be
                    formed to attack, the enemy abandoned the position; we followed--this corps on
                    the left, the Nineteenth on the right of the pike, Gen. Devin, with a small part
                    of his brigade of cavalry, in advance. The pursuit was continued for the whole
                    day. Every attempt was made to engage the enemy but without success.
                    Notwithstanding the great labors and fatigues brought about by battles and
                    marches since the morning of the 19th, there was no lack of disposition on the
                    part of the officers and men to bring the enemy to fight. One stretch of
                    thirteen miles was made without a halt on the part of the infantry. Battery G,
                    First Rhode Island Light Artillery, Capt. G. W. Adams commanding, and the First
                    new York Independent Battery, Lieut. Van Etten commanding, moved with the
                    skirmish line of the cavalry most of the time, and whenever the slightest show
                    of a stand was made by the enemy, opened upon him. The infantry skirmish line
                    was not engaged until almost dark, and then for a short time only. Nothing could
                    induce the enemy to favor us with an engagement, and the troops, very much
                    exhausted, went into camp at dark about four miles south of New Market.</p>
                <p>September 25 we moved to Harrisonburg, went into camp, and remained there until
                    the morning of the 29th, when I proceeded, by direction of the major-general
                    commanding Middle Military Division, with the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps to
                    Mount Crawford to support the cavalry in case of a movement in force upon it by
                    the enemy in its return from the operations in which it had been engaged at
                    Staunton and elsewhere. The next day we returned to Harrisonburg and resumed our
                    old camps, nothing worthy of note having occurred on the trip. We remained in
                    camp at Harrisonburg until morning of October 6, when, breaking camp, at 5.30 a.
                    m., we started for Strasburg, reaching that place October 8, having marched on
                    the 6th to Rude's Hill, thence on the 7th to about two miles north of Woodstock,
                    on the 8th to Strasburg. The corps remained on the 9th at the last-named place.
                    This brings us to the time indicated by the order directing this report to be
                    made.</p>
                <p>From the length of time embraced this report is necessarily general, is little
                    more than a mere record of the events which have taken place, but I cannot close
                    it without saying in how great a degree my thanks are due to the officers and
                    men of this corps for the patient endurance and bravery displayed in the
                    occurrences mentioned herein. I desire or new the recommendations heretofore
                    made to the major-general commanding, and if it is decided to confer brevets for
                    any grade less than that of general officer, I shall take pleasure in hereafter
                    forwarding the names of officers particularly deserving notice and advancement.</p>
