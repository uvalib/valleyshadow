<div id="mainResults">
<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon responds to John Baldwin at Staunton
                    concerning his July, 1864, request that Shenandoah Valley slaves be excused from
                    military fortification duty to help bring in the crop. Seddon assures Baldwin he
                    will make every effort to provide men for farming in the Valley.</p>

<p>Hon. J. B. BALDWIN,<br> Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>July 29, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 20th instant, urging the
                    importance of restoring the slaves and free negroes of the Valley District to
                    aid in saving the large crop of that section. I entirely agree with you in
                    reference to the importance of retaining all the labor which can be spared
                    consistently with more pressing and immediate necessities. Recent triumphs of
                    our army in the Valley will probably prevent the necessity of any immediate call
                    on the reserves, and it is hoped they, together with the slave labor, will
                    suffice to secure the crop.</p>
<p>In relation to the power of impressment of slave labor, I have examined the laws
                    and had the benefit of Judge Campbell's counsel on the points presented by you.
                    It seems to me clear, to prevent the operation of the Confederate law, it would
                    be necessary the States should have provided laws of impressment coextensive
                    with the necessity intended to be met. As such is confessedly not the
                    legislation of Virginia, the Confederate law in regard to impressment must, on
                    just principles of construction, be held applicable to the slaves of that State.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JAMES A. SEDDON,<br> Secretary of War.</p>
