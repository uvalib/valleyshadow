<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Phil Sheridan writes to General John Rewlins concerning possible
                    November, 1864, Confederate troop movements in the Staunton area.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Brig. Gen. JOHN A. REWLINS,<br> Chief of Staff, City
                        Point, Va.:</p>
<p>KERNSTOWN, VA.,</p>
<p>November 21, 1864--9 a. m.<br> (received 8.30 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have not any positive information. Reports are very conflicting. It was
                    reported to me on the 17th that Early's whole army moved from New Market to
                    Staunton. On the 18th I heard that only one division moved (Breckinridge's old
                    division, command by Wharton), and it moved to East Tennessee. On the 18th I
                    received a letter from Early at New Market. Yesterday I heard that Early's army
                    was moving to Richmond; then again I heard that he was going to Staunton to go
                    into winter quarters. None of my scouts sent out have returned; they must have
                    been captured. I move out this morning all the cavalry, and will be able to
                    ascertain definitely. Kershaw's division, I think, is not more that 5,000
                    strong. It must have made very fast time to have gotten to Richmond. It was at
                    Middletown on the 12th, and left that place on the night of the 12th. From
                    Middletown to Staunton is seventy-seven miles, which it had to march. My
                    impression is that Early has gone to Staunton, and will probably go to Richmond
                    with a portion of his troops. If such is the case I will move the Sixth Corps as
                    rapidly as possible. I would like to be a little more certain that I am at
                    present before I send it off.</p>
