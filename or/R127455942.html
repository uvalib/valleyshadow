<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch reports to General in Chief Henry Halleck in July,
                    1863, on the state of the Cumberland valley road in the aftermath of the
                    Gettysburg campaign. Couch says his men can repair it to Chambersburg, where
                    supplies can then be sent.</p>

<p>Received 10 p. m.<br> Maj.-Gen. Halleck, Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 7, 1863 </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Cumberland Valley road will be in order to-morrow as far as Scotland, 28
                    miles from Hagerstown. It is so badly destroyed between these two points that it
                    will take a week to transport iron and ties to rebuild it. The company may not
                    have it for the present, and I have not deemed it advisable to order it to be
                    rebuilt. Likely the company will put it in order to Chambersburg, where supplies
                    can be thrown in case the Army of the Potomac requires them. Do you think more
                    should be done by Government? Please reply in cipher.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
