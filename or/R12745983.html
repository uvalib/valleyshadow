<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General George Pickett regarding efforts to defend the
                    retreat from Gettysburg. Lee instructs Pickett to send prisoners and wounded to
                    Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett,<br> Comdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 8, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have received your letter of the 7th instant, and hope the arrangements you
                    have made may secure the safety of the trains on the other side of the river.
                    The present storm will place the Potomac beyond fording stage, and I fear you
                    will have to rely upon the boats to pass over the wounded and prisoners. In
                    sending forward the officers, send with them such a guard as will secure their
                    safety, and Garnett's brigade might not be too large to take them to Winchester,
                    but from that point to Staunton I should think a smaller guard would be
                    sufficient. You can use the rest of your division in guarding the remaining
                    prisoners to Winchester, with one of the batteries, unless you think both
                    necessary; but I do not wish the division to go farther than Winchester. You
                    must halt there, collect all your stragglers, convalescents, &amp;c., and
                    use every exertion to resuscitate the command.</p>
<p>You will assume command at Winchester. I wish you to make every exertion to aid
                    this army, by protecting its trains and coming to its assistance, if necessary.</p>
<p>I do not think Corse can be spared at this time from his present position, and
                    for the present you must rely for recruits upon your convalescents and
                    absentees, which I hope you will gather in.</p>
<p>After reaching Winchester with the prisoners, you can arrange a guard to take
                    them to Staunton, and to Richmond, if necessary.</p>
<p>Establish your headquarters at Winchester for the present, and get together your
                    men as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
