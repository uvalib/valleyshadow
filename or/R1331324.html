<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General John Echols writes General John C. Breckinridge in April,
                    1864, to inform him that a large Union force is gathering at Beverly, West
                    Virginia, with the intention of moving on Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:</p>
<p></p>
<p>April 28, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of my scouts and spies, perfectly reliable, is just in. Averell's command
                    reached Camp Piatt on Monday evening. Three or four infantry regiments have also
                    reached the valley. The force now there is estimated at 8,000 men. My impression
                    is that the main force will go through Raleigh, as large quantities of hard
                    bread have been taken to Fayette Court-House in last few days. Their intention
                    is to strike Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. This information was obtained
                    direct from one of Averell's colonels. Large force at Beverly collecting; their
                    object is Staunton. I will write you fully.</p>
