<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Provost Marshal George Eyster writes James B. Fry in June, 1863, concerning
                    resistance to the draft in Bedford County. Eyster reports that one enrolling
                    officer was shot and that many others wished to resign out of intimidation.
                    Eyster says that he resolves to use citizen guards to help enforce
                enrollment.</p>

<p>Col. JAMES B. FRY:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG,</p>
<p>June 11, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch received. Bedford County continues disturbed. An enroller shot
                    yesterday. Assailant not know. Very little open resistance. Demonstrations
                    confined to this assassination and act of incendiarism intended to intimidate.
                    An exhibition of force could do little besides quiet public apprehension. I have
                    permitted resignations only because I believed officers effectually intimidated.
                    I shall direct the employment of special citizen guards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEORGE EYSTER,<br> Provost-Marshal Sixteenth District.</p>
