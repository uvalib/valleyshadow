<p>Maj. Gen. M. C. MEIGS,<br> Quartermaster-Gen. U. S.
                        Army, Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>CLEVELAND, OHIO,</p>
<p>September 1, 1865.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit to your department, through Col. A. Stager, chief,
                    &amp;c. (pursuant to General Orders, No. 39, Quartermaster-Gen.'s
                    Department), my annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865. My
                    annual report for 1864 was rendered to your department through Col. A. Stager,
                    chief of U. S. Military Telegraphs, in the letter part of October, 1864.</p>
<p>It has been my duty during the past year to act as assistant superintendent of U.
                    S. Military Telegraphs within the Department of West Virginia and the State of
                    Ohio, and to be chief purchasing officer for the supplies required by the
                    different officers connected within this branch of the public service for the
                    operations and construction of U. S. military telegraphs within the several
                    departments. My headquarters have been at Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>Military operations have not been extensively active within the Department of
                    West Virginia during the last year, and, with the exception of two or three
                    important movements, the operations have been confined to maintaining a line of
                    military posts adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and along the Kanawha
                    River.</p>
<p>Whenever our troops have been dispatched upon expeditions or raids within the
                    enemy's lines cipher operators have generally been furnished to accompany such
                    movements. The expedition of Maj.-Gen. Crook in May, 1864, was not referred to
                    in my report for that year, and allusion to the same is therefore made herein. A
                    portion of Gen. Crook's command, comprising three brigades of infantry and about
                    300 cavalry, left Fayetteville, W. Va., during the first week of May and
                    proceeded to Lexington, where they destroyed the camp and garrison equipage of
                    two rebel regiments which had been left in charge of rebel guards. On the
                    evening of the 8th the expedition arrived at Shannon's Cross-Roads, ten miles
                    from Dublin Depot. At Shannon's Cross-Roads a rebel telegraph line was
                    intercepted by the cipher operator accompanying the expedition, but owing to the
                    precaution of the rebel operators but little information of interest to our
                    forces was obtained beyond the fact that a considerable rebel force was posted
                    at Cloyd's Mountain, on our line of march. On the morning of the 9th our forces
                    reached Cloyd's Mountain, five miles from Dublin Depot, and Gen. Crook at once
                    made and attack upon the rebels, who were protected by earth-works; but after
                    two hours; determined resistance the enemy fled in utter confusion, leaving
                    their dead and wounded. During this engagement the telegraph operator acted as
                    aide-de-camp to the general, and received a complimentary notice from that
                    officer in his official report of the affair. Gen. Crook pushed on for Dublin
                    Depot, and when within three miles of the town met a force of Morgan's men,
                    numbering about 1,000, who had come from Saltville to re-enforce the rebels at
                    Cloyd's Mountain, but were not in time to effect a junction. After a skirmish
                    the rebels retreated, and our forces entered Dublin Depot, on the Virginia and
                    Tennessee Railroad, about 3 p. m. on the 9th. The depot buildings, rebel
                    government property, and telegraph office here were destroyed, and Gen. Crook
                    pushed on to destroy the long railroad bridge ten miles from Dublin Depot,
                    which, after an engagement of two hours, was accomplished. The object of the
                    expedition having been attained, the command started upon its return via Salt
                    Pond and Peter's Mountain, through Union, across Greenbrier River to Meadow
                    Bluff, reaching there May 23, having marched about 300 miles. At Meadow Bluff we
                    were in telegraphic communication, and cipher massagers detailing operations,
                    &amp;c., were forwarded to headquarters, Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>On the 1st of June following Gen. Crook started with him command for Staunton,
                    Va., via Lewisburg, Hot and War Springs, through Panther Gap, into Augusta
                    Valley. At Panther Gap a soldier in rebel uniform was captured, claiming to
                    belong to Imboden's command, but upon being brought to headquarters was found to
                    be the bearer of cipher messages from Gen. Hunter ordering Gen. Crook to join
                    him at Charlottesville. The order, however, was afterward countermanded, and our
                    forces joined the other command at Staunton. From Staunton the expedition moved
                    via Lexington and Buckhannon, crossing the Blue Ridge at the foot of Peaks of
                    Otter via Liberty, for Lynchburg. On arriving in the vicinity of Lynchburg we
                    encountered the rebel force and whipped it during the first day's engagement. At
                    night the rebels were re-enforced by troops under Gen. Early. After successfully
                    resisting the rebel attack on the second day our forces fell back under cover of
                    the night and started for the Shenandoah Valley; but finding that the rebels
                    were pursuing actively, and that probably we could not get out in the direction
                    taken, our column turned toward the Kanawha Valley and marched out via Salem,
                    Sweet Springs, and Lewisburg to Gauley Bridge. At the latter place orders were
                    received to move the troops on to Charleston, where they took transports for
                    Parkersburg, and from thence by railroad to Martinsburg, Va. From Martinsburg
                    the troops were ordered to Harper's Ferry and into Maryland after Gen. Early,
                    who had come down the Shenandoah Valley and crossed the Potomac into Maryland.
                    At Hillsborough it was ascertained that Early had fallen back, going toward
                    Snicker's Gap and Winchester, Va. Near Hillsborough the Sixth Corps joined us
                    and the command moved to Snicker's Gap. The Sixth Corps moved from here to
                    Washington and Gen. Crook's forces from Winchester. At Kernstown, three miles
                    from Winchester, Gen. Crook fought Gen. Early on the 24th of July. Crook was
                    defeated and at night retreated to Bunker Hill. The cipher operator was employed
                    all night in putting the general's official dispatches into cipher for
                    transmission from the nearest telegraph station to Washington, through
                    Shepherdstown to Pleasant Valley, and from there to Frederick, and thence to
                    Harper's Ferry and up the Shenandoah Valley to Strasburg, but again fell back to
                    Halltown. After remaining at Halltown five days the command again moved up the
                    valley to Berryville, at which place the cipher operator received orders to
                    return to the Department of West Virginia.</p>
<p>On the 26th of September, 1864, the military telegraph line from Clarksburg, Va.,
                    to Weston was intercepted at Weston by a rebel operator, who under the pretense
                    of being the regular U. S. military telegraph operator stationed at that post,
                    transmitted a telegram in the name of the commandant of that post, addressed to
                    the commandant of the post at Clarksburg, stating that 3,000 rebels under Gen.
                    Basil Duke were advancing on Weston, and asking how many troops were at
                    Clarksburg and how many could be sent to Weston. The military operator at
                    Clarksburg felt satisfied from the peculiarity of the manipulation of the
                    telegraph key at Weston that the telegram was a fraud and that it had been
                    transmitted by a rebel operator, and so informed Col. Wilkinson, then in command
                    at Clarksburg. This suspicion, however, was kept from the rebel operator, and an
                    answer regularly transmitted to Weston stating that 2,000 troops had just
                    arrived by railroad and that more were expected during the night. Subsequent
                    facts proved that the rebels were under command of Col. Witcher, 900 strong, who
                    retreated after plundering Weston and its inhabitants, although the original
                    intention of the rebels had been to capture Clarksburg and destroy the large
                    amount of Government property at that depot, which they could very easily have
                    accomplished, only two companies of troops being stationed at Clarksburg at that
                    time. Whether the subterfuge resorted to on our part was the means of saving
                    Clarksburg and its supplies or not is unknown.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 27, 1864, the rebels under Col. Witcher, about 900
                    strong, captured the town of Buckhannon, burned bridges and several dwellings,
                    and plundered the inhabitants. Most of the small garrison stationed at this
                    place eluded the capture.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 29, 1864, a force of rebel infantry, 300 strong, under
                    Capt. Hill, attacked the Federal forces at Beverly, Va., but after a sharp
                    contest were repulsed. After the rebels had retreated, the military telegraph
                    repairer stationed at Beverly, having a thorough knowledge of the country, took
                    the lead of our pursuing force, and, by taking a short by-road, got to the front
                    of the rebels, when a charge was made, driving the rebels across a creek, taking
                    93 prisoners and recapturing about 40 of our own men taken in the attack on
                    Beverly. The telegraph employee was complimented in the official report of the
                    affair.</p>
<p>At about 11 a. m. November 28 the rebels, in U. S. uniform, under Gen. Rosser,
                    surprised the Federal force at New Creek, Va., and took possession of the place.
                    The rebel force consisted of a division of cavalry. Much Government property was
                    destroyed. The military telegraph office was seized so quickly that the operator
                    had not time to escape and was carried off by the retreating rebels. He was
                    robbed of his valuables and clothing, compelled to march barefoot to
                    Harrisonburg, given nothing to eat until the third day of his captivity, and
                    then merely three-quarters of a pound of fresh beef, which had to suffice until
                    the evening of the fifth day, was confined in Castle Thunder, Richmond, and by
                    sharing the blanket of a prison camp was kept from freezing.</p>
<p>On the 11th of January, 1865, at about 5 o'clock in the morning, a rebel force of
                    about 600, under command of Gen. Rosser, surprised and captured the picket-post
                    at Beverly, Va.; passed quietly toward the Federal camp, surprised it, and
                    captured the whole force, numbering some 800 men, under command of Col. Youart,
                    Eighth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry. A very humiliating affair.</p>
<p>Herewith will be found my property statement A, embracing all the property which
                    has come into my possession during the year.</p>
<p>I have nothing to report on From B.</p>
<p>Herewith will also be found my statement of public moneys received, &amp;c.,
                    during the year. Out of the total amount expended, $149,799.76 was applied to
                    purchases, and $124,564.76 to service account.</p>
<p>Have nothing to report on Forms C, CC, nor D.</p>
<p>Herewith will be found Form E, showing the articles of property which the enemy
                    had captured during the year while in my possession, and the estimated value
                    thereof.</p>
<p>Have no use for Form F, nothing having been captured from the enemy and come into
                    my possession.</p>
