<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson's Assistant Adjutant Fitz-John Porter writes from
                    Chambersburg to Colonel Charles Stone in June, 1861. Porter asks for cooperation
                    as Patterson's force advances on Harper's Ferry.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>Col. CHARLES P. STONE,<br> Commanding, near Leesburg,
                        Va.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa., </p>
<p>June 14, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>The commanding general instructs me to inform you that as soon as he can move his
                    force, so as to strike a blow on the enemy's left, at Harper's Ferry, and follow
                    it up with success, he will inform you, to obtain your co-operation, if
                    circumstances, in your judgment, will permit. He desires to be informed of your
                    position, and whether you can most advantageously threaten the Maryland or
                    Virginia Heights opposite Harper's Ferry. He will not necessarily rely upon your
                    cooperation, though glad to receive it. Can you stop supplies passing from
                    Frederick County, Maryland, into Harper's Ferry?</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
