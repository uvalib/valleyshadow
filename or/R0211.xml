                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by my regiment
                    in the operations at Fort Stedman on the 25th instant:</p>
                <p>Upon hearing the firing on the line in front at dawn of day I immediately formed
                    my regiment and held it under arms awaiting orders, and in a few minutes I
                    received an order from Gen. Willcox, through one of his staff, to report at the
                    Friend house (Gen. Willcox's headquarters) with my regiment, but upon arriving
                    within about half way from my camp to his headquarters I saw a number of men
                    retreating from the front, when I immediately halted my regiment and moved it
                    forward a short distance, with my right resting near the Dunn House Battery, and
                    attempted to drive back the men who had retired from the front. A few moments
                    after this Gen. Hartranft appeared on the ground in person, and ordered my
                    regiment forward, at the same time advancing with it to the camp of the
                    Fifty-seventh Massachusetts Volunteers, driving back the enemy's skirmishers,
                    who had advanced beyond the camp, and at the same time charging the enemy, but
                    finding him too strong and suffering terribly from this fire my men were driven
                    back to an old line of works a few rods in rear and right of the camp of the
                    Fifty-seventh Massachusetts Volunteers, where my regiment was reformed. Another
                    attack was ordered by Gen. Hartranft, and my regiment moved forward handsomely
                    and gained a position quite near the enemy. This position was held fifteen or
                    twenty minutes, with a large loss, when the regiment again retired to the cover
                    of the old line, where a connection was formed with the Two hundred and ninth
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers on the right. Here the left wing of my regiment
                    inflicted severe injury on the enemy by its fire, and prevented any farther
                    advance.</p>
                <p>Gen. Hartranft now directed me to hold this position, which I did, against any
                    farther advance of the enemy. I remained in this position some time, when Maj.
                    Berlolette, assistant adjutant-general, of Gen. Hartranft's staff, who had been
                    rendering valuable assistance all the time informed me that an assault would
                    soon be made by the division to retake the works, and that my regiment, with the
                    Two hundred and ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, would conform to the movement of
                    the Second Brigade, which was several hundred yards to my left, and that the
                    signal for the assault would be the advance of the Two hundred and eleventh
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers from the high ground in rear of Stedman and the
                    regiments on my right. I immediately prepared my command for the movement, and
                    when the advance of the Two hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers and the
                    troops on my left was made, Maj. Bertolette ordered the charge, which was made
                    instantaneously, the men moving forward in the most gallant style, charging the
                    right corner of Stedman and the main line of works leading from it. My regiment
                    alone captured at least 350 prisoners and a like number of small-arms, but my
                    men were so eager to regain the fort and works that they paid but little
                    attention to the prisoners, telling them to pass to the rear, where they were
                    picked up by troops of the First Division, and claimed by that division, when
                    they were really captured by and passed to the rear through my command.</p>
                <p>The officers and men of my command all behaved with the greatest daring and
                    bravery. Capt. F. A. Hoffman seized the colors in the hand of a rebel color
                    bearer, but was short through the hand and knocked down with a musket, retaining
                    a piece of the flag, which he tore from the standard.</p>
                <p>Private Levi A. Smith, Company E, deserves particular mention. After the color
                    bearer had been shot down I grasped the colors and called for some one to take
                    them, this boy sprang forward and asked me to permit him to carry the flag,
                    which he did throughout the action.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>All of which is respectfully submitted.</salute>
