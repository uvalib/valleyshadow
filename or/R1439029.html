<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Phil Sheridan reports to Grant on September, 1864, actions in the

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT.</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG,</p>
<p>September 25, 1864--11.30 p. m.<br> (Received 27th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pressed the enemy hard yesterday; at the same time pushed forward Col. Powell's
                    cavalry through Timbervile, and struck the Valley pike in his rear. This latter
                    movement stampeded him so badly that late last evening he gave up the Valley
                    pike and struck off toward Keexletown and Port Republic, leaving the entire
                    valley way free. All my infantry arrived at Harrisonburg at 4 p. m. to-day. Col.
                    Powell's cavalry reached Mount Crawford to-night. Torbert's cavalry overtook me
                    this evening. Its operations in the Luray Valley, on which I calculated so much,
                    were an entire failure. They were held at Milford by two small brigades of Fitz
                    Lee's cavalry, and then fell back toward Front royal until after they had
                    learned of our success at Fisher's Hill. They then proceeded up the valley
                    again, encountering the enemy's cavalry at Luray, capturing some 75 or 80 men
                    and horses; then joined me, via New Market. Powell's cavalry whipped a portion
                    of the enemy's cavalry near Harrisonburg yesterday; captured and burned 9
                    wagons. I find at this place 104 miles from Harper's Ferry. I will send a column
                    of cavalry to Staunton to-morrow morning, and will probably follow the enemy in
                    the direction of Port Republic with the infantry. Every hour brings me
                    additional information of the demoralization of Early's army. Reports late this
                    evening say that he is moving toward Charlottesville; other reports are that he
                    is going to Waynesborough. The part that I expected the cavalry to accomplish at
                    Fisher's Hill was a complete failure. I have relieved Averell from his command.
                    Instead of following the enemy when he was broken he went into camp, and let me
                    pursue the enemy for a distance of fifteen miles with infantry during the night.
                    Early burned quite a number of wagons on his way up the Valley. He also
                    abandoned two caissons on the Keezletown road not far from this place.</p>
