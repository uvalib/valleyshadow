<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In July, 1861, General George B. McClellan's Federals won several victories over
                    Confederate forces in what is now West Virginia. In this dispatch, Confederate
                    Major Michael G. Harman, commanding at Staunton, reports to Robert E. Lee on
                    what he has heard of the engagements.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. LEE:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>July 15, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lieut. Smith, of Lee's Rifles, just arrived, reports that the fight commenced
                    about 4 p. m., and lasted about one hour and a half. The enemy outnumbered us
                    ten to one. We repulsed them three times. We lost forty killed and prisoners.
                    Among the killed, Capt. De Lagnel. We killed quite one hundred and fifty of the
                    enemy. Capt. Curry, who was wounded, came down the hill to the fort, and was the
                    only one who did. The men in the engagement were not reenforced from Heck's
                    command, because he was fearing an attack from the front, the enemy being in
                    view. Heck brought his regiment out of the fortifications to retreat, about 11
                    o'clock at night, by order of Pegram, who had returned from the battle-field,
                    hurt from a fall from his horse. Heck formed in the road, Lilley's company in
                    front, and started through the mountains in the dark, and soon got separated,
                    about three having arrived at Monterey. Nearly the whole of Pegram's regiment
                    are safe. It is supposed that the missing will yet reach the camp. Heck left his
                    four cannon, and about twenty teams and ordnance. Curry and Pegram were not in
                    condition to leave the fort, and insisted on being left, and are supposed to be
                    prisoners.</p>
