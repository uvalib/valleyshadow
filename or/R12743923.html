<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Cavalry General John Buford reports on his June, 1863, arrival in
                    Gettysburg. He mentions sending men towards the enemy at Chambersburg, and news
                    of General Lee signing a pass for a citizen there. He also discusses the
                    availability of supplies in the area.</p>

<p>Gen. Pleasonton.</p>
<p>Gettysburg,</p>
<p>June 30, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I entered this place to-day at 11 a. m. Found everybody in a terrible state of
                    excitement on account of the enemy's advance upon this place. He had approached
                    to within half a mile of the town when the head of my column entered. His force
                    was terribly exaggerated by reasonable and truthful but inexperienced men. On
                    pushing him back toward Cashtown, I learned from reliable men that R. H.
                    Anderson's division was marching from Chambersburg by Mummasburg, Hunterstown,
                    Abbottstown, on toward York. I have sent parties to the two first-named places,
                    toward Cashtown, and a strong force toward Littlestown. Col. Gamble has just
                    sent me word that Lee signed a pass for a citizen this morning at Chambersburg.
                    I can't do much just now. My men and horses are fagged out. I have not been able
                    to get any grain yet. It is all in the country, and the people talk instead of
                    working. Facilities for shoeing are nothing. Early's people seized every shoe
                    and nail they could find.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. BUFORD,<br> Brig.-Gen. of Volunteers.</p>
