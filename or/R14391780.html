<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Phil Sheridan writes Grant in December, 1864, to discuss the
                    situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Sheridan reports that Confederates near
                    Staunton are taking trains for Richmond, and mentions General Jubal Early's
                    possible movement to Staunton.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT:</p>
<p>KERNSTOWN,</p>
<p>December 13, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your telegram of yesterday received to-day. I strongly advise the withdrawal of
                    more of the infantry force of this command. One division can now be spared and
                    perhaps two in a very short time. It is impossible to do anything toward the
                    Central road until the present inclement weather is over. The snow is now seven
                    inches deep and the cold intense. It is very wintry. I will break the railroad,
                    if possible, as soon as the weather will permit. Two deserters from Gordon's
                    division came in to-day. They are from the Tenth Louisiana (rebel) Infantry.
                    They report that they left the division at Harrisonburg on last Tuesday, the 8th
                    instant; that this division (Gordon's) with Pegram's was marching to
                    Fishersville, a point between Staunton and Waynesborough, as they were to take
                    the cars for Richmond. My information goes to prove that no supplies go from the
                    north side of the Central road or from the Shenandoah Valley, and I usually
                    question refugees and prisoners myself. I saw more supplies growing in the Neck
                    down about King and Queen Court-House, north of the Mattapony River, last summer
                    than in any other section of Virginia. If that country could be cleaned out it
                    would be important. In reference to what troops should go from here to join you,
                    I would advise the removal of the troops known as the Western Virginians. They
                    are too near their homes, and should go among strangers. The New Creek affair
                    and at every point where guerrillas have given any annoyance it was from a
                    surprise of these troops of the border. If you prefer the Nineteenth Corps I
                    will send it by divisions. I believe that everything should be used this winter
                    to give no rest to the enemy, and if it causes a concentration of troops on the
                    part of the enemy at Richmond it only causes greater embarrassment in their
                    supplies. We are a long way from Richmond here, and for any permanent occupation
                    at vital points a very large portion of my command would have to be used in
                    protecting the line of communication. The movement of Early to Staunton with the
                    balance of his force is not yet confirmed.</p>
