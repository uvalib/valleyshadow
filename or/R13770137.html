<p>Capt. JAMES L. BOTSFORD,<br> A. A. G., Army of the Kanawha,
            Charleston, W. Va.</p>
<p>Camp Piatt, W. Va.,</p>
<p>July 6, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the marching done and part taken by
          the First Independent Kentucky Battery under my (Capt. D. W. Glassie) command during the
          month of June, 1864, on the raid to Lynchburg and return:</p>
<p>Agreeable to instructions from division headquarters received on the 30th day of May "to
          move at 7 a. m. the next morning," after mustering out forty-nine men the command moved
          with men enough to drive the teams, arriving at Bunger's Mills that day, where I was
          joined by nine men detailed by the surgeon of the Twelfth Ohio Volunteer Infantry from men
          who were unable to march. Moving from thence through Lewisburg to White Sulphur Springs,
          thence to Callaghan's Station, where I was again joined by twenty-seven infantrymen unused
          to artillery service or the use of horses, and again the next morning after starting was
          joined by thirty-two more men from third and Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Reserve Corps,
          making a total of 155. From thence we moved through Hot and Warm Springs across the
          Alleghany to Middlebrook, thence to Staunton, arriving on the 8th instant without firing a
          shot. Here we lay by for two days for rest, and again on the 10th instant received an
          order to march, as also to report one section of guns to Gen. Averell. (I sent the third
          section under Lieut. Hattersley, a trustworthy officer.) Moving out the Lexington pike for
          Lexington, Va., after about ten miles from Staunton one section was ordered to the front,
          and marched in rear of the advance guard all day, arriving at Lexington, Va., a little
          town on the North Branch of the James River, at 10 o'clock on the 11th instant, where the
          enemy had artillery in position which they opened on our column. About 12 m. my (First
          Kentucky) battery was ordered to take a position on the right of the road to cover the
          crossing of the Second Brigade, commanded by Col. White. Here we fired a few rounds and
          crossed the river at what is known as the lower ford and camped in Lexington, Va.; there
          we remained two days resting the men and recruiting the stock.</p>
<p>Moved again on the 14th instant on the Buchanan pike, arriving at and camping in Buchanan
          the same evening.</p>
<p>On the 15th crossed the Blue Ridge at Otter Mountain Pass, camping at Fancy Farm,
          distance sixteen miles; thence through Liberty, Va., crossing the railroad to Welsh's
          farm; thence to Lynchburg, Va., arriving on the battle-field at 3 p. m. on the 17th
          instant. Here the section under Lieut. Hattersley reported from Gen. Averell with empty
          ammunition chests, having had several skirmishes. As our lines advanced toward Lynchburg,
          Va., the enemy opened his batteries. Four of my guns were then thrown forward on the left
          of the artillery line. At the same time the left section, under Lieut. Hattersley, was
          thrown forward about 600 yards, forming the new artillery line of fire. My remaining four
          guns were brought forward on the new line, were I received an order from Capt. McMullin to
          send one section still farther to the front. Mistaking the order, I moved my whole battery
          forward into and on the pike until I was obliged to open on the enemy's infantry to save
          my men, throwing two guns forward in an orchard to the right of the road and in advance of
          the works abandoned by the enemy, placing the other four guns in position to the left and
          rear about fifty yards, opening the six guns, two with canister and four with shell. Two
          men temporarily disabled, 1 horse killed and 2 wounded, 1 seriously; darkness compelled us
          to cease firing. I then moved my four guns forward into park and camped for the night; no
          grain or feed for the horses for two days.</p>
<p>On the 18th instant, at 3 a. m., I was ready to move, but seeing the enemy in position
          ordered my caissons to the rear under cover, the same time calling the attention of Capt.
          McMullin, chief of artillery, to the fact, and asked for orders. He ordered me to remain
          till he could see the general, in the mean time moving the First Ohio Battery, which had
          parked on my right. Deeming the position a poor one, I limbered to the rear, and moved
          back about twenty yards. As soon as I had taken my new position the enemy opened on my
          battery with his artillery. As soon as possible we returned the fire, and succeeded in
          silencing their battery. I was then ordered to retire, and again to report to Capt. Du
          Pont, chief of artillery, who placed me in position to cover the center and operate with a
          flank movement on the enemy's left. Again changing my position he ordered me to the
          extreme left of the line to draw the fire from Capt. Snow's (First Maryland) battery,
          supported by the Eighteenth Connecticut Infantry. I moved under cover of a hill about 500
          yards to the left of the position occupied by Capt. Snow, in a plowed field, were my guns
          were well covered until I was ready to open. Moving up in line through an orchard, I ran
          my guns up by hand and opened directly on the enemy's flank, surprising and driving them
          from their guns. Again I was ordered back to the center, where I fired a few shots; from
          thence to the right, taking position on the right of Battery B, Fifth United States, where
          we remained until dark. During the engagement, and while on the right 3 wheels disabled
          and 1 trail hand-spike shot away; 1 horse killed, and 5 wounded during the day.</p>
<p>Marched all night, and camped for breakfast. Continued the march through Liberty, Va.,
          where we halted and remained for the night in harness. Lost during the night 5 wounded
          horses, 3 sets of artillery harness, the horses having been abandoned, and no means of
          transportation.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 19th one section of guns ordered to report to Gen. Duffie, the
          other four guns lying in column in the road till 3 a. m. Marched all day and night, halted
          for a rest at Buford's Gap, lay in position, fired a few shots, broke camp, marched out at
          dark, marched all night, arriving at Salem, Va., for breakfast, thence through to
          Greenbrier, via New Castle and Sweet Springs; rested one day at Sweet Springs. From
          Greenbrier, via Lewisburg, Meadow Bluff, Sewell Mountain, Gauley Bridge, to Camp Piatt, W.
          Va., arriving June 30, 1864.</p>
<p>My men behaved nobly, both on the battle-field and on the march, exerting themselves to
          the utmost to keep the stock on their feet, working many hours in the night when others
          were resting, grazing and grooming their horses. The men of the Third and Fourth
          Pennsylvania Volunteer Reserve Corps have behaved themselves like veteran artillerists.</p>
<p>My losses are as follows: John Smith, run over, wounded in the head and hand; William
          Overbeck, slightly in abdomen; Lieut. R. C. Steen, slightly; 2 horses killed and 7
          wounded; 5 wheels disabled, and 1 shot to pieces; 1 trail hand-spike and ring shot away,
          and 1 axle split; 3 sets of artillery harness, 2 sets of transportation harness, and 9
          wounded horses, 2 of whim were wounded at Salem, Va., abandoned on road; 16 horses worn
          out and abandoned.</p>
<p>Ammunition expended on the round trip, 700 rounds.</p>
<p>Hoping the above will prove satisfactory, I have the honor to remain, captain,
            very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>DANL. W. GLASSIE,<br> Capt., Cmdg. Glassie's (First Independent Kentucky) Batty.</p>
