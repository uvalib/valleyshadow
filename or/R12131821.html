<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Franz Sigel forwards a December, 1862, scouting report to General
                    Burnside. The report, made by one Joseph Snyder, describes all manner of
                    Confederate activity. He reports sick being sent to Staunton, gives a
                    description of the industry, hospitals, and defenses of the town, and reports
                    that it forms the only telegraph link between Winchester and Richmond. Snyder
                    also reports on the farming and wheat production of Valley citizens.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. BURNSIDE,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Fairfax Court-House, Va.,</p>
<p>December 3, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The following is a report of Joseph E. Snyder, one of the best scouts in this
                    corps. He was, as he says, taken prisoner and conveyed to Richmond. His report
                    is full of interesting details and valuable information, and indicates that he
                    is a close and accurate observer of objects and movements. I regard him as a
                    very reliable man, but desire that his report be not published in the
                    newspapers, as he is still a scout, and might be tried as a spy in case he was
                    again made a prisoner.</p>
<p>I forward it for your examination.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your most obedient servant</p>
<p>F. SIGEL,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Eleventh Corps.</p>
