                <p>At dawn the morning following the battle of South Mountain, September 15,
                    Hartsuff's skirmishers, supported by his brigade, were thrown forward, when it
                    was ascertained that the enemy had fallen back from our front, leaving his dead
                    and wounded in our hands, toward Boonsborough, and from thence had taken the
                    road to Sharpsburg.</p>
                <p>Soon after Hartsuff's advance, Gen. Richardson, with his brigade of Sumner's
                    corps, was ordered to take the place of Hartsuff, and to proceed in vigorous
                    pursuit, with no other instructions than not to engage the enemy it he overtook
                    him, but await my arrival. Meantime my corps were ordered to make a little
                    coffee and eat their breakfasts, which they had not been able to do since the
                    beginning of their march from the Monocacy, the morning previous. Pleasonton's
                    cavalry followed in the footsteps of Richardson's brigade, and soon after the
                    First Corps resumed its march in pursuit of the enemy.</p>
                <p>About 10 o'clock a.m. word was received that he had made a stand a mile or more
                    in front of Sharpsburg, and about that distance from Richardson's command. As
                    Gen. Richardson was without artillery, he had borrowed a section from
                    Pleasonton, and had already opened on the enemy when I reached the field. The
                    rebels appeared to be ostentatiously deployed in two lines, perpendicular to the
                    road leading to Sharpsburg, with his batteries posted to resist the passage of
                    our forces over the bridge which crosses that stream. All of his troops appeared
                    exposed to view, and numbered, as nearly as I could estimate, about 30,000 men.
                    Fully conscious of my weakness in number and morale, I did not feel strong
                    enough to attack him in front, even after the arrival of the First Corps, and it
                    was only after the left of the enemy was observed to break into column and march
                    to the rear, behind a forest, on which appeared to be the Williamsport road,
                    that Maj. D.C. Houston, of the Engineers, was dispatched up the river to find
                    practicable fords, by the means of which my troops might be thrown across the
                    Antietam River to attack the enemy, and perhaps cut off his artillery, as soon
                    as his numbers were sufficiently reduced to justify the movement. A bridge was
                    found, and also two fords, which with little labor on the banks were rendered
                    practicable for the passage of infantry and artillery. At 5 o' clock p.m. about
                    one-half of the enemy's infantry force had passed to the rear, when I deemed it
                    too late to make the detour, in order to come up with the enemy, without a night
                    march through a country of which we were profoundly ignorant.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the bulk of the army was arriving in the valley of Antietam, and all
                    the enemy's artillery, with a considerable portion of his infantry, remained in
                    the position in which we had found them in the morning.</p>
                <p>Between 1 and 2 o'clock the day following, I received instructions from the
                    major-general commanding the Army of the Potomac to cross the river with the
                    First Corps, and attack the enemy on his left flank, Meade's and Ricketts'
                    divisions crossing the ridge near Keedysville, and Doubleday's division at the
                    ford just below it.</p>
                <p>As soon as my command was under way, I rode to the headquarters of the commanding
                    general for any further orders he might have to give me, when I was informed
                    that I was at liberty to call for re-enforcements if I should need them, and
                    that on their arrival they would be placed under my command, and I returned and
                    joined my troops on their march. Our direction was nearly perpendicular to the
                    river we had crossed, my object being to gain the high ground or divide between
                    the Potomac and Antietam Rivers, and then incline to the left, following the
                    elevation toward the left of the rebel army. Two regiments of Meade's division
                    were thrown forward as skirmishers, followed by a squadron of Owen's cavalry,
                    and all supported by Meade's division. We had not proceeded over a half a mile
                    before the commanding general with his staff joined me, apparently to see how we
                    were progressing. Among other subjects of conversation, I said to the general
                    that he had ordered my small corps, now numbering between 12,000 and 13,000 (as
                    I had just lost nearly 1,000 men in the battle of South Mountain), across the
                    river to attack the whole rebel army, and that if re-enforcements were not
                    forwarded promptly, or if another attack not made on the enemy's right, the
                    rebels would eat me up. Pretty soon after this interview, my skirmishers became
                    engaged with the enemy's advanced post, and the firing was continued incessantly
                    until dark, we advancing slowly, and the enemy retiring before us. During the
                    last part of the time the resistance became formidable, and we all slept on our
                    arms that night. The cleared space between the forests necessitated a change in
                    my front from a division to a brigade, and Seymour's command held the advance
                    when night overtook us, and bivouacked in advance of my corps when operations
                    were suspended.</p>
                <p>The night becoming dark and drizzly, I sought shelter in Miller's barn, a few
                    wards to the left of the Hagerstown pike (facing the south), and directly in the
                    rear Seymour's brigade. Desultory firing was kept up between the pickets almost
                    throughout the night, and about 9 o'clock p.m. I visited them in order to
                    satisfy myself concerning this firing, and found that the lines of pickets of
                    the two armies were so near each other as to be able to hear each other walk,
                    but were not visible to each other. I found Seymour's officers and men alive to
                    their proximity to our enemy, and seemed to realize the responsible character of
                    their services for the night. Indeed, their conduct inspired me with the fullest
                    confidence, and on returning to the barn I immediately dispatched a courier
                    informing the commanding general of my surroundings, and assuring him that the
                    battle would be renewed at the earliest dawn, and that re-enforcements should be
                    ordered forward in season to reach me before that moment.</p>
                <p>Gen. Mansfield, with his corps, did cross the creek that night, and encamped his
                    command about 1 mile in rear of my own, and in the morning participated actively
                    in the battle. We were now 3 or 4 miles in advance of where we had crossed the
                    Antietam Bridge. At daylight we were fully prepared to renew our march, which
                    lay through orchards, corn-fields, and over plowed ground, skirted on either
                    side by forests, the cleared space between which averaging not more than 400 or
                    500 yards in width, the field and the object in view narrowing my front to quite
                    a limited degree. Doubleday's division was posted on the right, Ricketts' on the
                    left, and Meade's in reserve. At daylight Gibbon's and Hartsuff's brigades were
                    thrown forward, supported with the brigades of their respective divisions, while
                    Meade followed them up in the center, instructed to spring to the assistance of
                    either, as circumstances might require. Seymour continued to hold the advance,
                    with the utmost firmness and resolution, until our troops had passed him. With
                    these dispositions completed, the battle was soon renewed on the morning of the
                    17th. My object was to gain the high ground nearly three-quarters of a mile in
                    advance of me, and which commanded the position taken by the enemy on his
                    retreat from South Mountain; to prevent which he had been re enforced by
                    Jackson's corps during the night, and at the same time had planted field
                    batteries on high ground on our right and rear, to enfilade our lines when
                    exposed during the advance.</p>
                <p>We had not proceeded far before I discovered that a heavy force of the enemy had
                    taken possession of a corn-field (I have since learned about a thirty-acre
                    field) in my immediate front, and from the sun's rays falling on their bayonets
                    projecting above the corn could see that the field was filled with the enemy,
                    with arms in their hands, standing apparently at "support arms." Instructions
                    were immediately given for the assemblage of all of my spare batteries, near at
                    hand, of which I think there were five or six, to spring into battery, on the
                    right of his field, and to open with canister at once. In the time I am writing
                    every stalk of corn in the northern and greater part of the field was cut as
                    closely as could have been done with a knife, and the slain lay in rows
                    precisely as they stood in their ranks a few moments before. It was never my
                    fortune to witness a more bloody, dismal battle-field.</p>
                <p>Those that escaped field in the opposite direction from our advance, and sought
                    refuge behind the trees, fences, and stone ledges nearly on a line with the
                    Dunker Church, &amp;, as there was no resisting this torrent of
                    death-dealing missives. I have since been informed by a division commander of
                    Jackson's corps that the latter was waiting for some stragglers to arrive which
                    had been left during his night march from Harper's Ferry, in anticipation of
                    delivering an attack on my command. The whole morning had been one of usual
                    animation to me and fraught with the grandest events. The conduct of my troops
                    was sublime, and the occasion almost lifted me to the skies, and its memories
                    will ever remain near me. My command followed the fugitives closely until we had
                    passed the corn-field a quarter of a mile or more, when I was removed from my
                    saddle in the act of falling out of it from loss of blood, having previously
                    been struck without my knowledge. While my wound was being examined by the
                    surgeons, Sumner's corps appeared upon the field on my immediate right, and I
                    have an indistinct recollection of having seen Sedgwick's division pass to the
                    front. I do not think that I examined my watch that morning, but feel confident
                    as to the time-10 o'clock a.m. I was carried to the rear at once, to the house
                    of Mr. Pry, on the left bank of Antietam Creek.</p>
                <p>Throughout the foregoing operations all of my officers and men of all arms, as
                    well as the officers composing my staff, without a solitary exception, seemed to
                    be emulous of each other in their eagerness to learn my wishes and execute my
                    orders.</p>
