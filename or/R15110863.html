<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Richard E. Byrd writes General Robert E. Lee in April, 1861, to discuss important

<p>Gen. ROBERT E. LEE;</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, VA.,</p>
<p>May 1, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Though personally unknown to you, I take the liberty of addressing you this
                    letter. There is now, it is said, under arms at Chambersburg, Pa., a large
                    military force, designed, it is thought, to act upon the nearest important
                    points in Virginia. Martinsburg, the seat of justice for the county of Berkeley,
                    Va., is such a point. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad passes through or
                    immediately by it, and has there one of its most important stations for the
                    repair, &amp; C., of its engines, &amp; C. The military occupation of
                    that place would in a material degree give a hostile force the control of that
                    great work. There is a railroad from Chambersburg to Hagerstown, and the latter
                    place is distant from Martinsburg only about fourteen or fifteen miles, and the
                    entire distance from Chambersburg to Martinsburg, even if from the former place
                    to Hagerstown there was not a railroad, does not much, if any, exceed a days'
                    march. In consideration of the motive which prompts it, I trust you will pardon
                    the liberty I take in addressing this communication to you.</p>
<p>With highest respect, I remain, your obedient servant, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>RICAHRD E. BYRD.</p>
