<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch reports to General George Meade on efforts to harass
                    Lee's retreat from Gettysburg in this July, 1863, dispatch. Couch mentions
                    orders to strike at Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Copy received, War Department, 8 p. m.<br> Gen. George
                        G. Meade:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 6, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Smith, on the 4th and 5th, received your order to join him. At 1 a. m.
                    to-day I directed him to obey your orders, unless he found the enemy in retreat
                    and could operate effectually where he had been ordered to strike--at Cashtown
                    or Chambersburg. He should have nearly 10,000 men, but one-half are very
                    worthless, and 2,000 cavalry, with a battery, can capture the whole party in an
                    open country. This is why I put them in or near the mountains; there they could
                    do service.</p>
<p>I have 2,000 men here; 500 that ran so rapidly from Gettysburg, much demoralized,
                    and one regiment New York troops that won't march; 3,000 men nearly equipped,
                    and probably 5,000 at Reading are being equipped. Between Bedford and Milroy's
                    men (Mercersburg) there may be 4,000, 1,500 of when are reported by the
                    commander as utterly worthless. I have about 1,000 men that I did not march,
                    having been demoralized at York. Have six guns and six mountain howitzers in the
                    field. In a day or two will have ten.</p>
<p>I shall strictly carry out any order you may give, having been notified by the
                    War Department to that effect days ago, and do it with pleasure. My dispositions
                    have been made in reference to the character of my troops, topography of the
                    country, and to assist your heroic army.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
