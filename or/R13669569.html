<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Henry Halleck writes General Grant on the overall strategic
                    situation in June, 1864. He mentions General Crook's intention to join General
                    David Hunter at Staunton, among other movements.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> In the Field:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C.,</p>
<p>June 4, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the month of May we sent to the Army of the Potomac 6,683 cavalry horses, in
                    addition to the cavalrymen remounted here. About 1,000 more cavalry horses are
                    being shipped to White House. Not hearing from you in regard to the Ohio
                    militia, I am preparing ten regiments for the field, and will send them as fast
                    as transportation can be procured. The Fifth Maryland Regt. Volunteers has been
                    ordered from Fort Delaware. Gen. Gillmore thinks that 5,000 more men can safely
                    be withdrawn from Department of the South. Gen. Hatch, on the contrary, is
                    asking for re-enforcements. Gen. Crook, at Lewisburg, May 31, expected to join
                    Gen. Hunter at Staunton in about six days. Gen. Canby has sent forces to Memphis
                    to protect Sherman's communications. I doubt if he will be able to do much on
                    Mobile at present. Moreover, the movement would be too late to help Sherman. The
                    latter is in possession of Allatoona Pass, and is moving against Marietta.</p>
