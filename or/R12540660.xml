                <p>You will find on the first page of this a copy of a letter which I received
                    to-day from the Secretary of War. You will see that he directs me to send you a
                    copy of his letter in the event of my giving my sanction to the expedition
                    proposed by Capt. McNeill.</p>
                <p>I fully approve of the expedition, and have had it in contemplation for some
                    time, but have been unable to carry it out because of the want of cavalry,
                    having been obliged to send off all of my cavalry horses to a distance from the
                    railroad, to be foraged. You are in position to know better than I do the
                    obstacles to the east of Beverly in the way of Capt. McNeill's expedition. I
                    cannot be able to send a cavalry expedition to Cheat River until the grass has
                    put up sufficiently to support the horses, and though I am anxious to send an
                    expedition to accomplish the object proposed, I desire to give every assistance
                    in my power to any one who is prepared to undertake it sooner than I can. If I
                    understand the construction of the bridge, its destruction, even when we have
                    quiet possession of it, will be a difficult operation. An engineer officer on
                    duty with me, who understands the structure of the bridge, is provided with
                    tools and implements for its destruction. I will send him, with 10 men who
                    understand the business, with the tools, to join the expedition as soon as it is
                    ready to move.</p>
                <p>There are but 300 or 400 troops at Beverly, so far as I can ascertain. If you can
                    capture them or engage their attention while Capt. McNeill is making his
                    expedition, it will contribute to his success.</p>
                <p>Please keep me promptly informed of what is done or proposed to be done in this
                    matter. Capt. McNeill will send a special messenger to inform me when he is
                    ready to start.</p>
