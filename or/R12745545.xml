                <p>In this July, 1863, dispatch, Union General William French requests
                    reinforcements from General in Chief Henry Halleck to help cut off Lee's retreat
                    from Gettysburg. He mentions that The Army of Northern Virginia is massing at
                    Chambersburg and Williamsport.</p>

                <p>Your dispatch of this date is just received. Meade's instructions to me require
                    the force sent back from Harper's Ferry. No time is to be lost. Buford is
                    passing through to-day. I have destroyed the bridge at Williamsport, and am
                    fortifying the South Mountain passes. Lee, it is reported, has massed at
                    Chambersburg, and will rest his right on the river at Williamsport. Should he
                    find his passage there impracticable, as the river is rising, he will endeavor
                    to seize the passes. I have one good brigade holding them. I also hold the
                    Monocacy bridges, and have only a few unreliable infantry in reserve. Should you
                    send me re-enforcements, they should come direct by rail. The cavalry is broken
                    down. I have issued a proclamation for horses, and will remount as fast as they
                    are brought in. It was reported to me that artillery was being placed on the
                    heights at Shepherdstown Ford, and a bridge in readiness to swing across. Buford
                    will visit that place to-night.</p>
                <p>To reoccupy Maryland Heights will require time, and probably the holding for
                    awhile the opposite side of the river. The enemy can get nothing by having them,
                    and a small force without a depot would be in a cul-de-sac.</p>
                <p>I have just received the following dispatch from headquarters Army of the
                    Potomac, dated July 4, 10.30 a. m.:</p>
                <p>Maj.-Gen. French:</p>
                <p>More recent developments indicate that the enemy may have retired to take a new
                    position, and await an attack from us. The general commanding countermands his
                    dispatch requiring you to reoccupy Maryland Heights and seize the South Mountain
                    passes, resuming the instructions of July 3, making your movements contingent
                    upon those of the enemy.</p>
                <p>DANL. BUTTERFIELD,<lb/> Chief of Staff.</p>
                <p>Latest dispatch.</p>
                <p>July 5--7 a. m.<lb/> Gen. French:</p>
                <p>The enemy appear to be in full retreat, and you can act upon the contingencies
                    provided for in previous dispatches.<lb/> DANL. BUTTERFIELD.</p>
                <p>I will, therefore, require the re-enforcements.</p>
