<p>Maj. Gen. N. A. MILES,<br> Cmdg. Reconnaissance:</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 9, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A deserter from Gordon's division, of Early's corps, came in this morning. He
                    says the division he belongs to left the Valley near Staunton yesterday morning,
                    coming by railroad to Petersburg, arriving there before sunset last evening, and
                    marching to the intrenchments near Boisseau's, and relieving the troops there.
                    He says Pegram's division, of Early's corps, was to follow Gordon's division.
                    Gordon has no doubt relieved Heth's division and perhaps Wilcox's, and they are
                    moving against Warren. Mahone's division moved against him yesterday morning.
                    Heth's and Wilcox's would move through Dinwiddie Court-House, or may march
                    toward Stony Creek, passing nearer Hatcher's Run than Dinwiddie Court-House. In
                    either case, hearing of your movement, one or both may strike at you; so look
                    out after you cross Hatcher's Run. If you find the run strongly defended at
                    crossing of Vaughan road there is a crossing at Armstrong's Mill, one mile and a
                    half above, by which you might turn the first.</p>
