<p>The Hon. SECRETARY OF WAR:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>July 31, 1864</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>The undersigned, appointed a Committee of Safety by the citizens of Harrisburg,
                    state that they believe it necessary for the successful defense of this city and
                    vicinity from the threatened advance of the enemy of have a more efficient
                    military organization than can be made under the present commander of this
                    department. Gen. Couch arrived here yesterday morning from Chambersburg. Soon
                    after he left that place it was entered by a comparatively small force of
                    cavalry, and the town plundered and a large portion of it burned, without any
                    defense being made. Gen. Cadwalader reached here this morning, but without
                    authority to command. We unanimously consider that the interests of the service
                    and safety of this place and of the Cumberland Valley require that Gen.
                    Cadwalader or some other efficient officer be placed in command of this
                    department immediately. The people will organize for defense under the command
                    of an officer in whom they have confidence.</p>
