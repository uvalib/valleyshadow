<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Major Michael G. Harman, commanding at Staunton, writes to Assistant Adjutant
                    George Deas in the wake of July, 1861, Confederate defeats in West Virginia.
                    Harman reports on the state of Staunton's telegraph, and on his plans to open a
                    pony express from Staunton to Monterey and Winchester. He also asks that any
                    ammunition for the front be sent to Staunton.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>July 16, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>Inclosed is a communication sent you by telegraph, after waiting hours for the
                    office to open. It is most important that the telegraph offices should be open
                    night and day, and that we should have a through connection between Richmond and
                    Staunton, instead of having a relay at Gordonsville, and thereby creating great
                    delay. The instrument at this office is nearly worn-out, as I months ago
                    informed the superintended of the telegraph line at Richmond in person. See that
                    these matters are corrected.</p>
<p>Yours, very respectfully,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Commanding.</p>
