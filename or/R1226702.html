<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Adjutant Fitz-John Porter, stationed with the Department of Pennsylvania at
                    Chambersburg, writes Colonel George Thomas in June, 1861. Porter gives Thomas
                    instructions for an advance into Maryland and Virginia, including how to deal
                    with unionists and Confederate opposition.</p>

<p>Col. GEORGE H. THOMAS, U. S. A.,<br> Second Cavalry,
                        Comdg. First Brigade, Greencastle, Pa.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>June 7, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>The commanding general does not wish to make any movement forward tending to
                    permanent occupation till he is prepared with all his force to sustain the
                    advance. He wishes every precaution taken against precipitate action and nursing
                    ill-feeling, both by political discussions and improper conduct of the men. The
                    Army must have no enemies in the rear. On your prudence and judgment he relies
                    to maintain the present status.</p>
<p>Appeals may be made to cross into Virginia to protect Union people under
                    assurance that a small force only is required to present itself for disunion to
                    hide its head and loyal people to flock to your banners. They must not be
                    heeded. If, however, inroads are made into Maryland within your reach, the
                    commanding general desires you to meet the invaders with a force which will ride
                    down all opposition, and in all cases to return to your present camp. When
                    practicable, the surprise of armed parties ill be effected. Brig.-Gen. William
                    will be immediately in your rear, and is directed to sustain you in all cases.</p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
