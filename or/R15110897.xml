                <p>Confederate Michael Harman, quartermaster at Staunton, writes Virginia Governor
                    Letcher concerning efforts to equip Virginia's troops, and a May, 1861,
                    expedition to the northwest corner of the state. Harman discusses buying guns,
                    including a number of shotguns purchased for the city of Staunton. He also
                    mentions repairing muskets in the town. Harman reports he has bought uniforms
                    for the men, suggests calling out the militia, and discusses the importance of
                    reinforcing troops in western Virginia for the purpose of destroying Union
                    sentiment.</p>

                    <salute>MY DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I inclose you letters from Lieut. J. H. Chenowith, from Beverly, which convince
                    me of the importance of re-enforcing the expedition to the northwest, just
                    starting from here under command of Col. R. Turk, until it reaches Beverly, when
                    he will report to Col. Goff. If the three companies of cavalry, viz, Bath,
                    Rockbridge, and Greenbrier, can be armed, Lieut.-Col. Echols will send them out
                    to join the expedition as fast as they can be armed. I telegraphed the other day
                    to know if I should purchase the sixty double-barrel shot-guns. Not getting an
                    answer, I purchased them for the town of Staunton. I have directed Mr. Dodamead
                    to purchase thirty more. Now, if that State will take them, I can easily arrange
                    to get them. I also see from lieutenant Chenowith's letter that he states that
                    Gen. Lee had ordered that the 600 rifles should be delivered to Col.
                    Porterfield, at Grafton. My understanding, when I conferred with Col. Smith, was
                    that when he got to Richmond he would send up all the arms he could get, and arm
                    the troops to be recruited on the route. You will see from the letters of Col.'s
                    Turk and Christian and Capt. Hull that troops enough will be named before the
                    expedition arrives at Beverly to take nearly all the arms sent, viz, 600 rifled
                    from Richmond and 400 muskets from here. I hope you will write me and indorse
                    all that I have done, which would otherwise appear as if I was acting without
                    authority, and Maj.-Gen. Lee might censure me. I have ordered plain hunting
                    shirts and caps to uniform the men recruited on the route, at a cost of less
                    than $3 per man. Is it right that I should send them out to the men? I would
                    suggest that you call out 500 to 600 of our militia from the country, arm them
                    with muskets, and send them immediately to the northwest. In my judgment, the
                    way to prevent a Union spirit from gaining ground in that country is to
                    re-enforce them, and that speedily. I am now having the locks of all the muskets
                    here taken off and put in complete order, as many of them are gummed up and need
                    oiling. Those we have had fixed work elegantly. It would not be miss to send
                    1,000 men from here and Rockbridge and Rockingham of the militia, and arm them
                    with muskets. I am having cartridge-boxes and bayonet scabbards made for the
                    muskets. If you have them at Richmond, write me by Mr. Getty and I will stop
                    having them made. Our people, on your requisition, will come immediately to your
                    call. Do me the favor to write me fully by Mr. Getty, and instruct me specially
                    in regard to all these matters. I m no military man, and I fear may take too
                    much responsibility and get myself into trouble.</p>
