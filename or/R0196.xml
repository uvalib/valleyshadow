                <p>I have the honor to state the following with regard to the movements of my
                    command during the engagement of this a.m.:</p>
                <p>At -- a.m. I was instructed by Lieut. Webbert, of Gen. Hartranft's staff, that
                    the general desired me to report, with my command, at division headquarters
                    without a moment's delay. I immediately dispatched a staff officer to bring down
                    the Two hundred and eleventh Regt. (which is encamped some two miles from my
                    headquarters), and with the remaining two regiments of my brigade reported
                    promptly at the point mentioned. From thence I was conducted by yourself to the
                    ravine, situated about two-thirds of a mile in front of your headquarters. I
                    there halted my command about one hour, awaiting orders. Through Capt. Hodgkins,
                    of Gen. Hartranft's staff, I was notified to prepare for a charge against Fort
                    Stedman, and further notified that when the Two hundred and eleventh Regiment
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers, of my brigade, then under the general's own
                    supervision, made its appearance of the brow of the hill in my rear, I was to
                    charge with the Two hundred and fifth and Two hundred and seventh against the
                    fort. This was done. I ordered Col. Cox, with his (Two hundred and seventh)
                    regiment, to charge the west corner of the fort, at the same time charging the
                    remaining two regiments (the Two hundred and eleventh had by this time come up)
                    directly against the rear of the fort.</p>
                <p>In this charge my men behaved most handsomely. The Two hundred and seventh Regt.
                    (Col. Cox) did their share of the work most effectually, completely cutting off
                    the enemy's line of retreat, while the Two hundred and fifth and Two hundred and
                    eleventh entered the fort and aided the Two hundred and seventh in capturing all
                    the enemy who had remained inside.</p>
                <p>In this charge I was aided very much by Capt. Hodgkins, of Gen. Hartranft's
                    staff, who assisted me in keeping my line formed and hurrying my men across the
                    plain in rear of the fort. My brigade at once advanced to the front of the fort,
                    and by a brisk fire drove the enemy inside their works. My entire loss was but
                    42-3 of whom were killed and 39 wounded; no commissioned officers killed and but
                    one wounded. It is impossible for me to state the exact number of prisoners
                    captured by my command, but as near as I can judge their number amounted to 850.
                    My command also captured between 300 and 400 stand of small-arms, which were
                    left by or taken from the enemy in Fort Stedman.</p>
                <p>One enlisted man from each of my regiments claims to have captured a battle-flag,
                    but two state that they were taken from them by some field officers with whom
                    they were not acquainted. The third is hereby sent to you, with the statement of
                    the man who captured it. Their statements are substantiated by their several
                    company and regimental commanders.</p>
                <p>No further orders for an advance having been received, my command occupied the
                    fort until evening, when two of the regiments were relieved by Gen. Hartranft's
                    order, and sent to camp. One regiment was left behind to garrison the fort.</p>
                <p>It would be invidious in me to distinguish between the many who discharged their
                    whole duty, I cannot refrain from speaking in the highest terms of praise of my
                    entire staff, as well as the commanding officers of each of the regiments
                    composing my brigade. Maj. Morrow, of Two hundred and fifth, refers to the
                    conduct of Privates John J. Levi and George Dull, of his regiment, to which I
                    invite the attention of the commanding general.</p>
                <p>All of which I have the honor respectfully to submit.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
                    <signed>J. A. MATHEWS,<lb/> Col. 205th Pennsylvania Volunteers, Cmdg. Brigade.</signed>
