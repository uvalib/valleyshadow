<p><b>Summary:<br></b>As the war dragged on, Confederate supply problems became more severe. Often,
                    army officials had to resort to impressment of goods, and the Shenandoah Valley
                    proved one of the richest bases of supply. In this December, 1863, letter,
                    Robert E. Lee orders Major H. M. Bell, quartermaster at Staunton, to assist
                    Jubal Early in procuring supplies from the countryside. Lee orders Bell to buy
                    or, if necessary, take, supplies, especially cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, cloth,
                    and leather, from Valley farmers.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Maj. H. M. BELL,<br> Quartermaster of the Post,
                        Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 22, 1863.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>I have written to Gen. Early to endeavor, while the troops are in the valley, to
                    get all the supplies of cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, cloth, leather, and other
                    quartermaster's stores from those parts of the country that are easily
                    accessible to the enemy. I have directed him to call upon you for
                    transportation, and desire you to furnish all you can, and aid him in getting
                    any more he may require from the people. I wish you to render all the assistance
                    in your power in this work; send your agents with the army, and wherever you can
                    buy supplies belonging to your department--particularly horses, horse-shoes,
                    cloth, and leather--do so, but where they cannot be bought they must be taken,
                    giving certificates to the owners. The horses should be driven back as fast as
                    they are procured. In taking any of the articles referred to, you will instruct
                    your agents that while nothing must be left that can be made use of by the
                    enemy, a sufficient supply for the necessities of the people must be course
                    remain in their hands.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
