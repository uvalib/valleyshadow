<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Assistant Adjutant William Russell writes General Isaac Duval in May, 1865,
                    to order him to march to Staunton, VA. Russell orders Duval to parole all
                    Confederate soldiers there according to the terms Grant gave Lee at Appomattox,
                    and to arrest any who refuse to surrender.</p>

<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>In pursuance of orders from headquarters Middle Military Division, the commanding
                    general directs that you move with your command, expecting the Thirteenth West
                    Virginia Infantry, with twenty-five days' rations in wagons and three days'
                    rations in haversacks, on the morning of the 4th instant, as soon after daylight
                    as possible, for Staunton, Va., for the purpose of paroling such officers and
                    men of the so-called C. S. Army who may wish to avail themselves of the terms
                    granted by Gen. Grant to Gen. Lee, of bringing in as prisoners of war all you
                    may be able to capture who refuse to surrender, and of administering the oath of
                    allegiance to such as may wish to take it.</p>
