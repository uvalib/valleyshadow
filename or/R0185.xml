                <p>In obedience to your order of to-day, I have the honor to make the following
                    report of the operations of my regiment in the late great movements, resulting
                    in the surrender of Gen. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, under his
                    command:</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>At an early hour April 6 the Fifth Corps moved north toward Amelia Court-House,
                    where the enemy was supposed to be, with a view of attacking him. It was soon
                    ascertained, by deserters and stragglers of the enemy coming into our lines,
                    that Lee's army had decamped during the night, on parallel roads farther west,
                    and our order of march was immediately changed with a view of pursuit. Our
                    column turned southwest, and took the Paineville road in the direction of
                    Farmville. The Second and Sixth Corps pursued upon other roads, and came in
                    contact with the enemy, capturing prisoners, artillery, and trains in large
                    numbers. Our march to-day was supposed to be about thirty miles, and the troops
                    were much exhausted. We encamped at a point within about three miles of the high
                    and long bridge, where the South Side Railroad passed the Appomattox toward
                    Lynchburg, and within three miles of Farmville. To-day our corps was on the
                    right of the army.</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>In closing this, which will doubtless be the last and final report of battles for
                    this regiment, I would express my gratitude to a kind and ever merciful
                    Providence that He has permitted us to pass through the many exposures,
                    hardships, and great perils of this last great and closing campaign of an
                    unprecedented was with comparatively so little sacrifice of life and blood, and
                    that the lives and the health of so many brave officers and men of the regiment
                    have been preserved, under the shield of His almighty power during the past
                    three eventful years, to return to their homes to dwell in peace and rejoice
                    over violated laws vindicated, a righteous Government preserved, the Union
                    restored, and the old flag re-established with more than its original power,
                    beauty, and significance, in some honorable degree through their
                    instrumentality.</p>
