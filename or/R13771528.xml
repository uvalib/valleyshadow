                <p>It appears from Gen. Averell's reports that while Gen. Hunter was collecting his
                    forces at Harper's Ferry to attack the enemy on the south side the rebel army
                    crossed on the morning of the 29th near Williamsport, and moved, by Hagerstown,
                    into Pennsylvania. Their cavalry captured and partly destroyed Chambersburg
                    yesterday. We have no reliable information of the main body, but, if it crossed
                    and moved as reported by Averell, it would be nearer Baltimore, Harrisburg, and
                    York than Hunter was at Harper's Ferry. I consequently directed him to move east
                    of South mountain toward Emmitsburg, and sent last night, by railroad, to the
                    Monocacy such of Emory's command as had arrived, where he would come immediately
                    under Hunter's orders. They will probably effect a junction to-night. The
                    weather is so intensely hot that marches will be very slow. It is possible that
                    the enemy's infantry is merely covering his cavalry raid. Enemy's cavalry force
                    said to be very large. Ours is so weak and poor that it gives us very little
                    information. A very intelligent artificer of the Sixth Corps, captured at the
                    battle of Monocacy, and who effected his escape in the Shenandoah Valley, has
                    just come in. He says he had several good opportunities to estimate Early's
                    force and actually counted forty-two pieces of artillery on their retreat, and
                    thinks that, as compared with our army corps, which he has frequently seen on
                    reviews, they numbered at least I do not hear that Early received any large
                    re-enforcements in the Valley, but it is said he greatly increased his cavalry
                    by remounts, stolen in Maryland.</p>
