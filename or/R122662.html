<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Adjutant Fitz-John Porter reads an address to the troops in Chambersburg in
                    June, 1861. By the order of General Robert Patterson, the address prepares the
                    troops for battle and reminds them of the reasons for which they are
                fighting.</p>

<p></p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>June 3, 1861.</p>
<p>To the United States Troops of this Department:</p>
<p>The restraint which has necessarily been imposed upon you, impatient to overcome
                    those who have raised their parricidal hands against our country, is about to be
                    removed. You will soon meet the insurgents.</p>
<p>You are not the aggressors. A turbulent faction, misled by ambitious rulers in a
                    time of profound peace and national prosperity, have occupied your forts and
                    turned the guns against you; have seized your arsenals and armories, and
                    appropriated to themselves Government supplies; have arrested and held prisoners
                    your companions marching to their homes under State pledge of security; have
                    captured vessels and provisions voluntarily assured by State legislation from
                    molestation, and now seek to perpetuate a reign of terror over loyal citizens.</p>
<p>They have invaded a loyal State and intrenched themselves within its boundaries
                    in defiance of its constituted authorities.</p>
<p>You are going on American soil, to sustain the civil power, to relieve the
                    oppressed, and to retake that which is unlawfully held.</p>
<p>You must bear in mind you are going for the good of the whole country, and that
                    while it is your duty to punish sedition, you must protect the loyal, and,
                    should occasion offer, at once suppress servile insurrection.</p>
<p>Success will crown your efforts; a grateful country and a happy people will
                    reward you.</p>
<p>By order of Maj.-Gen. Patterson:</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
