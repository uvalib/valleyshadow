<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In mid-June, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson's Valley campaign drew
                    to a close. In this dispatch to Cavalry Colonel Thomas Munford, Jackson issues
                    orders, and inquires if certain arms had been sent to Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Col. T. T. MUNFFORD,<br> Cmdg. Cavalry, Valley District:</p>
<p>NEAR WEYER'S CAVE,</p>
<p>June 17, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>The arms you spoke of sending have not yet been received. Did you send them here
                    or to Staunton? It is important that you picket from the Blue Ridge to the
                    Shennandoah Mountain or to the mountain west of Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>Until further orders send your dispatches to Brig. Gen. C. S. Winder, near
                    Weyer's Cave.</p>
<p>Do all you can to cut off communication across the lines between us and the
                    enemy. Also let there be as little communication as practicable between your
                    command and that of our infantry. Let your couriers be men whom you can trust,
                    and caution them against carrying news forward, as it may thereby reach the
                    enemy.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>T. J. JACKSON,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
