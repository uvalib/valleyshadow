<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General John Imboden writes Robert E. Lee in March, 1864, to discuss
                    the possibility of a Union raid on the Shenandoah Valley. Imboden fears that
                    Staunton may be one of the targets.</p>

<p>Gen. R. E. LEE,<br> Cmdg. Army of the Northern Virginia:</p>
<p></p>
<p>March 10, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I inclose copy of a dispatch to Gen. Rosser from one of his scouts, received last
                    night, which coincide with reports sent to me by my own men. I have little or no
                    doubt that we shall have a big raid here some time this month. I have sent 350
                    men to work on the line of fortifications in the mountain passes. I can't put up
                    all those works in time to resist the next raid and at the same time keep an
                    adequate force below Staunton. Would it not be well to notify Gen. Breckinridge
                    of these significant preparations of the enemy, and call upon him to put up the
                    works south of Millborough and require Col. Jackson to do the work at
                    Millborough? If Averell comes with 5,000 to 6,000 men and threatens two or three
                    places at once, say Staunton, Lexington, and the Virginia and Tennessee
                    Railroad, we shall be sorely put to meet him unless these works are finished and
                    other troops sent to the district.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
