<p><b>Summary:<br></b>United States Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas writes Secretary of War Edwin
                    Stanton in November, 1862, concerning efforts to raise Pennsylvania regiments.
                    He discusses opposition to placing drafted men in existing regiments, and
                    mentions rendezvous camps at Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>November 1, 1862--6 p. m.<br> (Received 7 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Arrived here at 2 p. m. and had an interview with the Governor, who does not
                    approve of filling the old regiments with the drafted men, believing it their
                    right to elect their own officers and have distinct organizations. He fears I
                    will meet with difficulty in carrying out your order, but says he will render me
                    every assistance, and hopes I may succeed. I shall as far as possible fill
                    regiments raised in any locality with the drafted men from that locality, which
                    will be satisfactory to the men. The principal places of rendezvous are
                    Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburg, with the minor camps at Reading, York,
                    Gettysburg, and Chambersburg. The number to be collected here and at the minor
                    camps is about 20,500. Only 8,000 of the 12,000 for this place have as yet
                    arrived. I judge Gen. McClellan has few or no spare arms, and arms should be
                    sent here. A partial supply might be sent until I can obtain more definite
                    information. There is an ample supply of clothing here.</p>
