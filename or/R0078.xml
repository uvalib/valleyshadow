                <p>This indorsement is not dated, but from the handwriting and the ink used I take
                    it to have been made about 1865, before the evacuation of Richmond. The fact is
                    as clear in my memory to-day as ever. The order was given at the Harris house
                    shortly before sunset of the 11th. The above is a true copy.</p>

                <p>-----------</p>
                <p>Itinerary of Hardaway Light Artillery Battalion.</p>
                <p>Since last must (April 30, 1864) this battalion (formerly known as First Regt.
                    Virginia Artillery) has marched from camp near Barboursville, Orange County,
                    Va., via Verdierville, Mine Run, and Locust Grove, to the Wilderness, and
                    encamped near the line of battle, but was not engaged.</p>
                <p>May 7.--Received orders to move toward Spotsylvania Court-House via Shady Grove
                    Church. Reached Spotsylvania Court-House morning of</p>
                <p>May 9, and encamped near what is known as the New Court-House. Put Smith's
                    battery into position on Brig.-Gen. Walker's (Third Corps) line at night. The
                    battery was afterward withdrawn. Next morning put Jones' and Smith's guns in
                    position on Gen. Rodes' line and Capt. Dance's battery on Gen. Johnson's line.
                    Capt. Dance's guns were afterward relieved by Capt. Milldge, of Nelson's
                    battalion, and he remained in reserve just in rear of the line the balance of
                    the day. Smith's battery was engaged in shelling the enemy's skirmishers, who
                    were very troublesome, and in replying to one of his batteries nearly all day.
                    Jones' battery fired a few shot. About 6 p.m. the enemy charged and succeeded in
                    breaking our line to Smith's right. Maj. David Watson was with this battery and
                    Lieut.-Col. Hardaway with Jones'. Smith's guns were worked until the enemy was
                    entirely in rear of the battery and when its fire would have been more fatal to
                    friend than foe. The guns were then abandoned by Maj. Watson's order, and the
                    majority of officers and men succeeded in making their escape. Capt. Smith and
                    24 of his men were captured, 3 killed, and 12 wounded. The enemy never succeeded
                    in getting as far to the left of our line as Jones' position, and they were soon
                    charged by Ramseur's and other brigades of Rodes' and Johnson's divisions and
                    driven back beyond Smith's guns. As soon as the enemy were driven from the guns
                    Col. Hardaway and Maj. Watson, with what men could be gotten together, commenced
                    working two of them upon the enemy with good effect. After about an hour or two
                    the enemy were finally dislodged and driven back to his own line. Maj. Watson
                    was wounded while working one of Smith's guns and died of his wounds some four
                    or five days after.</p>
