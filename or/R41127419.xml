                <p>Virginia Governor John Letcher writes Secretary of War Leroy P. Walker in July,
                    1861, on the muster of troops into Confederate service. Letcher establishes a
                    camp of instruction at Staunton at which troops can rendezvous and muster in,
                    and discusses a controversy between the states and the Confederate government

                    <salute>SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I received yesterday (through the mail) your letter dated June 30, making a
                    requisition on me for 3,000 men, that being the quota of Virginia in the reserve
                    army corps proposed to be raised to serve for and during the war. My
                    proclamation calling for this force will be issued in the morning, and every
                    proper effort will be made to have the number raised as speedily as practicable.
                    Richmond and Staunton will be designated as the accessible points for the camps
                    of instruction, where the companies will rendezvous and be mustered into
                    service.</p>
                <p>I regret that I cannot concur in the principle asserted in the latter part of
                    your communication, that "the President shall organize these companies into
                    battalions or regiments, as he may prefer, and appoint the field officers and
                    the staff." On reference to the Constitution I find that the right of appointing
                    the officers of the militia is reserved "to the States respectively." The
                    question seems to me, therefore, to resolve itself into this: Are the troops
                    called for militia? If so, it seems plain to my mind that the right to officer
                    them is with the State. If not militia, what description of troops are they? Can
                    they be considered regulars? If so, under what authority can the State be called
                    upon to furnish regulars? If the militia are called into service by companies,
                    the States may be deprived of the power to appoint field officers of all grades.
                    If by battalions, then they may be deprived of the power of appointment of all
                    field officers of higher grade than major. Surely it cannot be that the framers
                    of the Constitution contemplated such results. I earnestly, therefore, but at
                    the same time most respectfully, protest against the exercise of this power.</p>
