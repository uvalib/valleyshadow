<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this July, 1863, dispatch, Union cavalry Colonel L. B. Pierce reports to
                    General Darius Couch on efforts to harass Lee's retreat from Gettysburg. He
                    mentions sending forces to Chambersburg and taking prisoners near
                Greencastle.</p>

<p>Gen. Couch:</p>
<p>Loudon,</p>
<p>July 5, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch just received. Sent a cavalry force to Williamsport and Hagerstown
                    this morning; balance of my cavalry sent to Chambersburg and Greencastle to-day.
                    Will do all I can to harass them. My infantry is of no account.</p>
<p>It has rained all the time for the past two days. The little ammunition I had is
                    worthless. I have some on the way here; will not get here until to-morrow. Am
                    having an inspection of ammunition; will go forward with all the men that have
                    10 rounds of good. Cavalry just sent in 33 prisoners, taken near Greencastle.</p>
<p>I am as anxious to press forward as any one can be. Citizen just from the
                    Potomac, 6 miles below Hancock, says river too high to ford, and rising fast.
                    Have the rebels any pontoons?</p>
<p></p>
<p>L. B. PIERCE,<br> Col. Comdg.</p>
