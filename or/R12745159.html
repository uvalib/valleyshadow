<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Schenck writes to General in Chief Henry Halleck in June,
                    1863, to speculate that Pennsylvania civilians confused a Union supply train
                    escorted by cavalry en route to Chambersburg for Confederate troops, and a panic
                    broke out as a result.</p>

<p>Received 9.25 p. m.<br> H. W. Halleck,<br>
                        Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p>Baltimore, Md.,</p>
<p>June 16, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will intermit no possible preparations or exertions, but I still have some
                    suspicion that it was my wagon train, sent from Martinsburg with some cavalry,
                    via Williamsport, Hagerstown, and Chambersburg, that has alarmed all
                    Pennsylvania and the country. I have been suggesting this since yesterday
                    morning to Gen. Couch, from whom I now hear that the advance of the train has
                    reached Harrisburg, and that the remainder--some 200 wagons--is now between
                    Carlisle and Harrisburg. Tyler begins to think there is no force of the enemy at
                    Halltown.</p>
<p>May not the body of them, having cleared the Valley and broken the railroad, have
                    gone back to help fight Gen. Hooker? I submit the suggestion for what it is
                    worth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ROBT. C. SCHENCK,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
