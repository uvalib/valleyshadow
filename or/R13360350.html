<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Andrew Humphreys writes to General Alfred Pleasonton regarding
                    Confederate deserters captured by Wesley Merritt who reported that two
                    Confederate divisions moved to Gordonsville and Staunton in January, 1864.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. PLEASONTON,<br> Cmdg. Cavalry Corps:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 5, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Merritt reported yesterday that four deserters from Fourth Alabama had come
                    in, stating that Heth's and Johnson's divisions had gone to Gordonsville and
                    Staunton. It was and is important that these deserters should be here as soon as
                    practicable, yet they have not yet reached here. I have telegraphed Gen. Merritt
                    direct to learn if the deserters are certain they belong to the Fourth, or if it
                    is the Fourteenth Alabama, and to what brigade and division they belong.</p>
<p>The major-general commanding directs that Gen. Merritt's attention be called to
                    the orders requiring the forwarding of deserters with all possible dispatch to
                    headquarters, and to report the cause of delay in this instance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. A. HUMPHREYS,<br> Maj.-Gen., Chief of Staff.</p>
