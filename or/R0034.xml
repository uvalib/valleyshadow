                <p>Col. S. Crutchfield was Chief of Artillery in the Staunton Artillery of the Army
                    of Northern Virginia. Crutchfield states the artillery's role was to check the
                    enemy's advance, but he notes that the artillery suffered from defective
                    ammunition.</p>

                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
                    artillery of this corps in the engagement near Fredericksburg on December 13,
                    1862:</p>
                <p>On the right the enemy, after furiously cannonading Lieut.-Col. Walker's position
                    till they imagined his batteries crippled, advanced their infantry. One body
                    moved toward the point of woods in our center, and the other, with its front
                    parallel to the road from Hamilton's Crossing, to the river road. When distant
                    about 800 yards, Lieut.-Col. Walker's batteries opened upon them with great
                    effect, and at the same time fifteen guns-composed of sections from the
                    batteries of Capt. Poague [Lieut. A. Graham, commanding] Watson, Smith, Garber,
                    one gun of Capt. Dance's battery, and the Louisiana Guards Battery [three
                    guns]-were thrown into position into the plain to our right, so as to cross
                    their fire with that of the guns of Lieut.-Col. Walker, being specially designed
                    to check the advance of the enemy toward the road from Hamilton's Crossing to
                    the river road. These pieces were under the immediate command of Maj. [John]
                    Pelham, and were admirably managed and bravely fought, and perfectly
                    accomplished their object. All these batteries did not go in at once, but were
                    added as the weight of the enemy's fire seemed to require it.</p>
                <p>I cannot close this report without calling your attention to the great defect in
                    the ammunition we used, by which few of our shells burst. My own observation
                    entirely confirmed the numerous complaints made to me from the batteries. Much,
                    if not most, of this difficulty is, I made satisfied, justly attributable to the
                    fuses.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
