<p>FORT OR WATERS, HIGHLAND COUNTY,</p>
<p>September 21, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This letter has been handed to me as the officer commanding the line between
                    Moterey and Petersburg. I forward it according to its address, and with it the
                    following extracts from the report of Capt. George Jackson, former commandant of
                    the post at Monterey:</p>
<p>John W. Overman; lives in Preston County, five miles west of West Union. Was
                    arrested without arms and confined in the guard house August 23, 1861, on the
                    charge of being a Union man. Says that he was a Union man until his arrest, but
                    has since changed and is now willing to stand by the South.</p>
<p>It is proper to state here that all of those persons mentioned in the above list
                    as arrested on the charge of disloyalty, other than those caught in arms against
                    the South, were arrested upon representations of numbers of the most
                    substantial, reliable and loyal citizens of Hardy County, to the effect that
                    they were actively engaged in giving aid and comfort to the enemy.</p>
<p>These extracts give all the information I have about Overman, except that I was
                    informed by two gentlemen from Hardy that he was taken up as a spy. He is sent
                    to the Staunton jail by order of Gen. H. R. Jackson.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>JOHN B. BALDWIN,<br> Col. Fifty-second Virginia Regt.</p>
