                    in the Valley. He mentions sending spies to the Charlottesville and Staunton

                <p>General Orders, Nos. 5 and 6, received, and instructions concerning Luray Valley.
                    I have ordered a strong expedition from Thornton's Gap to Cave Hill and
                    Honeyville and across the Shenandoah Valley toward New Market.</p>
                <p>The enemy has some cavalry and artillery between Harrisonburg and New Market, but
                    no strong force. Different reports lead me to believe that no re-enforcements
                    have been sent to Harrisonburg. Our position here is unchanged. Col. Cluseret is
                    stationed between Hazel River and the Madison road; has sent a strong scouting
                    party 15 miles southwest of Hazel River without encountering any force of the
                    enemy except a few bushwhackers. He made two of them prisoners, and also sent in
                    a deserter from Ewell's division. His name is John Malloull. He is from
                    Baltimore formerly, and left Ewell's division on the march from Port Republic to
                    Richmond some four or five weeks ago. He says that Ewell had 8,000 or 9,000 men.
                    They were First Maryland, Sixteenth Mississippi, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh
                    Louisiana, Tenth and Thirteenth Virginia, Thirteenth Tennessee, and some other
                    regiments, also five or six batteries. The Sixteenth Mississippi had 800 men,
                    the First Maryland 800 to 900, all well armed. The Ashby Cavalry is from 2,500
                    to 3,000 strong. He learned from some of the enemy's cavalry that Jackson would
                    cross at Raccoon Ford, on the road from Orange Court-House to Culpeper
                    Court-House.</p>
                <p>I will send Malloull to Gen. Wadsworth at Washington, to be disposed of there, as
                    he wishes to go to Baltimore, where he has a brother, at No. 287 Franklin
                    street. He wishes to enlist in a Maryland regiment. He says that the bridge at
                    Rockingham, on the Shenandoah, is burned. Col. Koltes, who crossed the
                    Shenandoah on the road from Luray to New Market, reports that there is no bridge
                    at that point and that the ford is pretty deep. There is a bridge at Front
                    Royal, unless destroyed by the last freshest. I will send a more special report
                    in regard to the bridges and fords as soon as I am enabled to do so. Spies have
                    gone in the direction of Charlottesville and Staunton. The cavalry regiment
                    mentioned by you has not arrived yet. Please inform me if I can appoint the
                    examination board and the military commission. I can hardly get on without them.</p>
