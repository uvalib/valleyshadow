<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June, 1863, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia invaded Pennsylvania in
                    what became the Gettysburg campaign. In this dispatch, dated June 20, Lee
                    reports to Jefferson Davis on the progress and locations of his troops. He
                    reports that General Richard Ewell's advance cavalry is at Chambersburg.</p>

<p></p>
<p>His Excellency Jefferson Davis,<br> Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>Berryville,</p>
<p>June 20, 1863.</p>
<p>Mr. President:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report, for the information of Your Excellency, that Gen.
                    Imboden has destroyed the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, over
                    Evart's Creek, near Cumberland; the long bridge across the Chesapeake and Ohio
                    Canal, below Cumberland; the iron bridge across the North Branch of the Potomac,
                    with the wooden trestle adjoining it; the double-span bridge across the mouth of
                    Patterson's Creek; the Fink's patent iron bridge across the mouth of the South
                    Branch of the Potomac, three spans of 133 1/3 feet each, and the wooden bridge
                    over Little Cacapon.</p>
<p>All the depots, water-tanks, and engines between the Little Cacapon and
                    Cumberland are also destroyed, with the block-houses at the mouth of the South
                    Branch and Patterson's Creek.</p>
<p>The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, about 2 miles above Old Town, where the embankment
                    is about 40 feet high, has been cut, and Gen. Imboden reports that when he left
                    it the entire embankment, for about 50 yards, had been swept away.</p>
<p>A similar crevasse, with like results, was also made in the canal, about 4 miles
                    below Old Town.</p>
<p>Lieut.-Col. White, of the cavalry, has also cut the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                    east of the Point of Rocks.</p>
<p>Gen. Milroy has abandoned the south side of the Potomac, occupying Harper's Ferry
                    with a picket, and holds the Maryland Heights with about 8,000 men.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell's corps is north of the Potomac, occupying Sharpsburg, Boonsborough,
                    and Hagerstown. His advance cavalry is at Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
<p>The first division of Gen. A. P. Hill's corps will reach this vicinity to-day;
                    the rest follow.</p>
<p>Gen. Longstreet's corps, with Stuart's cavalry, still occupy the Blue Ridge,
                    between the roads leading through Ashby's and Snicker's Gaps, holding in check a
                    large force of the enemy, consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery.</p>
<p>The movement of the main body of the enemy is still toward the Potomac, but its
                    real destination is not yet discovered.</p>
<p>I have thought this a favorable time for Gen. Sam. Jones to advance into Western
                    Virginia, and have so informed him. Should he not be able to accomplish anything
                    more, he will fix the attention of the enemy in that region, and prevent
                    re-enforcements being sent to other points. If any of the brigades that I have
                    left behind for the protection of Richmond can, in your opinion, be spared, I
                    should like them to be sent to me.</p>
<p>I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
