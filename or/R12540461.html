<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Milroy writes Robert Schenck on May, 1863, action in the
                    Valley. He discusses the number of troops in the Valley, the lack of Confederate
                    resistance as far as Staunton, and equipment abandoned by Confederate General
                    Jones.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, VA.</p>
<p>May 10, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I can hear nothing that is going on east, west, or south. I would like much to
                    know what is going on in Western Virginia. Elliott returned yesterday. My
                    dispatch to him to return, in obedience to your order, reached him at New
                    Market. There were not more than 250 troops in the Valley, and he could have
                    gone on to Staunton without resistance. It is a pity he could not have been
                    allowed to have gone on as far as Harrisonburg, where Jones had left all his
                    wagons, tents, and camp equipage, which could have been taken. I did not think
                    there was any utter madness in the movement. Thirty prisoners were brought in.</p>
