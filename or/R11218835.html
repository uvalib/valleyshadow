<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Thomas J. Jackson commanded Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley during
                    the spring of 1862. In this March report he informs General Joseph E. Johnston
                    of intelligence gathered in the Valley. He mentions Union plans to pursue him to
                    Staunton, as well as the Union generals' conciliatory policy toward Valley
                    civilians.</p>

<p>Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,<br> Cmdg. Department of
                        Northern Virginia:</p>
<p>MOUNT JACKSON,</p>
<p>March 21, 1862.</p>
<p>MY DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>Yours of yesterday is at hand.</p>
<p>Ashby reports that a reliable man from Strasburg this morning reports that
                    Shields is in command there and that the Federals claim to have at that place
                    20,000, but that he does not believe that they exceed 10,000. This last I am of
                    the opinion is a full estimate. He further states that they say that they intend
                    pursuing me to Staunton.</p>
<p>From what I have seen of Federal prisoners their troops know but little
                    respecting their destination.</p>
<p>My spies have not yet returned. The enemy do not appear to have committed
                    depredations on their march. Their policy is conciliatory. My headquarters will
                    be at or near Woodstock.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours,</p>
<p>T. J. JACKSON,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
