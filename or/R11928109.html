<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Army of the Potomac cavalry commander Alfred Pleasonton informs General Randolph
                    Marcy of intelligence gathered by pickets in October, 1862. He reports that the

<p>Gen. R. B. MARCY.</p>
<p>Purcellville,</p>
<p>October 29, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>A citizen of Maryland, from Winchester to-day, has just been brought in by my
                    pickets, who states that he escaped from prison this morning, as they were
                    releasing some Federal prisoners, and crossed the Shenandoah below Snicker's
                    Gap. He reports the rebel army moving from Winchester to Staunton; that there
                    are only 200 infantry and three regiments of cavalry now in Winchester, doing
                    provost duty over prisoners. The rebel army, he says, is in wretched condition;
                    that provisions are very high, and bread and beef are the only issues.</p>
<p>I think this man is a deserter from Stuart's cavalry, who probably joined him in
                    his late raid and is tired of his bargain.</p>
<p>A Union gentleman from Waterford told me to-day that he was in Winchester some
                    ten days ago, and that he saw a provost guard called to arrest a suspected
                    person, and that out of the 10 men of the guard 6 were barefooted, and that this
                    was the average condition of their army. He thought the soldiers looked
                    dispirited.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>A. PLEASONTON,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
