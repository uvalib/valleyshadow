<p><b>Summary:<br></b>On July 11, 1861, Union General George B. McClellan won the battle of Laurel
                    Mountain, West Virginia, resulting in withdrawal of Confederate forces from the
                    area. In the aftermath, Confederate Major Michael G. Harman, commanding at
                    Staunton, received news of the defeat and retreat. In this dispatch from
                    Staunton, Harman tells Robert E. Lee what he knows, and announces that he has
                    met with Augusta County militia officers in preparation for calling out the
                    entire force.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. ROBERT E. LEE:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>July 14, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I have received the inclosed from W. C. Scott, of the Forty-fourth Regiment
                    Virginia Volunteers. I telegraphed you the same, but send it, for fear it has
                    reached you. Have the offices kept open night and day. I have had all the
                    colonels of the militia of the county summoned to be here at 7 o'clock this
                    morning, and will, according to your orders, have the whole militia of county
                    called out to-day. Every exertion shall made to have all pushed up with
                    promptness and dispatch. I will advise you by telegraph as further information
                    reaches me. I cannot yet tell the extent of the disaster, but fear, from Col.
                    Scott's retrograde movement, that it is serious, and also much fear that Gen.
                    Garnett will at least lose all his wagons and baggage going through Hardy.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes, a member of the Convention, from the county of Randolph, I think, was
                    sent by Col. Scott to Col. Pegram, and was killed by our own men. Capt. De
                    Lagnel was dangerously wounded, and reported left on the field. Give my orders
                    by telegraph as anything occurs. Please see the Quartermaster-Gen. I wrote to
                    him by to-day's mail, and you will see, from his letter, that I need
                    instructions to purchase horses for the transportation required. I have asked to
                    be furnished with $20,000. My letter will give you particulars. The cars are
                    waiting.</p>
<p>Hastily and respectfully,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Commanding.</p>
