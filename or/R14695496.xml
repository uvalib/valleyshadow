                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of operations of this brigade
                    from the 27th day of February to the 18th day of March, 1865:</p>
                <p>February 27, brigade broke camp at Camp Russell, va., at 5 a.m., and marched up
                    the Valley pike, through Newtown, Middletown, Strasburg, and Woodstock, and
                    encamped one mile and a half from that place. February 28, marched at 6 a.m. up
                    the pike, through Mount Jackson, and encamped at Lacey's Spring. March 1,
                    marched at 6 a.m. up the pike, and encamped within five miles of Staunton. At 8
                    p.m. I received orders to go through Staunton out on the Waynesborough road and
                    burn the railroad bridge across Christian's Creek, five miles from Staunton. I
                    was detained until after midnight by one of my regiments, which was on picket. I
                    met with but slight opposition, although I found the enemy in small force within
                    1,000 yards of our lines. I intrusted the destruction of the bridge to Lieut.
                    Col. G. R. Maxwell, First Michigan Cavalry, who with a dismounted force piled
                    fence rails on the bridge. He being fearful the flames would not consume the
                    timbers, as it was beginning to rain, cut the timbers with axes until the heat
                    drove him away. After remaining here about an hour and a half I returned to
                    Staunton. The corps then came up, and I moved with the division to near
                    Fishersville and encamped. March 3, brigade moved at 7 a.m. through
                    Waynesborough and across the Blue Ridge at Rockfish Gap to Ivy Station and
                    encamped. Before starting in the morning the Twenty-fifth New York Cavalry was
                    detached, together with other regiments, to guard at Winchester the prisoners
                    and guns taken the previous day by Gen. Custer's division from Gen. Early at
                    Waynesborough. March 4, I moved with my brigade at 8 a.m., escorting army and
                    corps headquarters wagons to Charlottesville and encamped. March 5, with my
                    brigade and two regiments of the Second Brigade I destroyed three miles of
                    railroad on the Orange and Alexandria road toward Lynchburg. March 6, marched at
                    8 a.m. through Scottsville, on the James, to Howardsville. Lieut. Col. G. R.
                    Maxwell, First Michigan Cavalry, with 300 men, moved at the same time down the
                    Rivanna and destroyed the bridge at Palmyra, 1 flouring mill, 1 cotton mill, 500
                    bushels of wheat, 400 barrels flour, 2 tons of cotton, and 1,500 pounds wool.
                    March 7, marched at 11 a.m.; after partially destroying the aqueduct across
                    Rockfish River, and cutting the canal bank, moved up the canal to New Market,
                    destroying all the locks, seven in number. March 8, moved up the canal to
                    Duguidsville and back to New Market, destroying 4 canal locks, 2 boats, 2
                    bridges, and 1 flouring mill. March 9 and 10 were consumed in guarding the train
                    from New Market to Columbia. From Scottsville to Columbia the brigade destroyed
                    8 locks, 13 canal bridges, 4 flouring mills, 1 warehouse, 60 hogsheads tobacco,
                    1 boat-house and lumber yard. March 11, destroyed 4 warehouses, 1 mill, 50 bales
                    of cotton, and moved across the Rivanna River. March 11 (12), moved across the
                    South Anna River and encamped at Walnut Grove Gold Mine. March 12 (13), moved to
                    Tolersville Station, on the Virginia Central Railroad, and destroyed one mile
                    and three-quarters of track toward Frederick's Hall Station, where we encamped
                    for the night. March 13 (14), moved at 7 a.m. to Taylorsville Station, on the
                    Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad and encamped after burning the
                    railroad bridge across the Little River on the Virginia Central road.</p>
                <p>March 14 (15), destroyed the railroad bridge across the North Anna and the
                    trestle bridges at Hanover Junction. The brigade then moved to the South Anna.
                    The First Michigan Cavalry moved down and occupied Hanover Court-House until 5
                    p.m., when they returned to the South Anna, but not before the bridge across the
                    river was burned. With great difficulty they succeeded in fording the river and
                    joining the command, which moved at 5 p.m. across the North Anna at Oxford Ford.
                    At Hanover Court-House Col. Maxwell captured two of the enemy's commissary
                    wagons and destroyed a railroad bridge 150 feet in length. March 15 (16), began
                    to move down the north side of the North Anna River toward White House, where we
                    arrived on the 18th.</p>
                <p>The following is a synopsis of property destroyed: 4 3/4 miles of railroad, 4
                    railroad bridges, 400 feet of trestle-work, station at Hanover Junction, 3
                    breaks in canal, 1 aqueduct, 19 canal-locks, 19 canal and road bridges, 4 canal
                    boats, 1 boat-house and lumber yard, 7 flouring mills, 1 cotton mill, 500
                    bushels of wheat, 400 barrels flour, 3 tons of cotton, 1,500 pounds wool, 60
                    hogsheads tobacco, and 5 warehouses.</p>
