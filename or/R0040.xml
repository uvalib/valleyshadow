                <p>In accordance with orders just issued from Col. A. R. Root, commanding First
                    Brigade, I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my
                    regiment, One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, in the late
                    operations of the Army of the Potomac:</p>
                <p>At 12 o'clock noon on the 28th day of April, 1863, we broke up our camp near
                    Fletcher Chapel, where we had been in winter quarters since early in January
                    last. The line was soon formed, and our march directed toward Gen. Hooker's
                    headquarters, by way of the White Oak Church. My men started out on this march
                    each provided with eight days' rations and 60 rounds of cartridges, all of which
                    they were required to carry on their person. We encamped this evening, after
                    having marched about 8 miles (greater part of the time in a rain-storm), in a
                    wood near the Rappahannock, some 3 miles below the city of Fredericksburg.</p>
                <p>At 2.30 o'clock on the morning of the 29th, we were aroused from our bivouac for
                    the march, but did not move until daylight, and by this time the firing had
                    commenced at the river, and the First Division of the corps was pressing over,
                    and had already taken the rifle-pits of the enemy, with over 100 prisoners. We,
                    with the other division of the corps, marched to support the movement of the
                    First Division, and were massed near the river, in full view of all the
                    operations, ready to cross when it might be necessary. Here we bivouacked for
                    the night. On the 30th, we remained in the same position, while more or less
                    fighting was going on in our front. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the regiment,
                    with the others composing the brigade, was drawn up in square, in order to have
                    appropriate religious observance of this day, in compliance with the
                    proclamation of the President of the United States. These services were
                    appropriate, interesting, and deeply impressive. About 5 o'clock, the enemy
                    opened his batteries on us, and continued to throw shot and shell at and into
                    our massed troops until after night, during which, for better protection, we
                    were placed along the road, farther in the rear. During this warm artillery
                    fire, quite a number were killed and wounded in other regiments, but I have the
                    pleasure, thanks to a kind Providence, of having it in my power to report no
                    serious casualties, as only 1 soldier was slightly wounded in my regiment.</p>
                <p>During May 1, we remained in the same position, being in constant readiness to
                    move at a moment's notice.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 2d, the enemy again opened his batteries opposite, and
                    about the same time, our division being relieved by part of the Sixth Corps, we
                    took up the line of march toward and beyond Fredericksburg, and continued in
                    this direction until we reached the United States Ford, where the greater part
                    of the army had crossed to attack the enemy on their left flank. Having crossed
                    the river, and in the act of preparing to encamp for the night, it being after
                    dark, and our men excessively wearied, having already marched about 20 miles, we
                    were ordered under arms immediately, to move to the front, to take position
                    occupied by the Eleventh Army Corps, it having been defeated and driven by the
                    enemy. The march was, therefore, continued for 3 or 4 miles to the front of the
                    line, where the battle had then been raging for several days. The First Army
                    Corps, of which we form a part, was placed on the right of the army, and on the
                    road leading from Fredericksburg to Gordonsville. At the time we were taking up
                    our position, a most terrific battle was raging on our immediate left and front,
                    then near 12 o'clock at night, but moonlight. An attack was hourly expected on
                    the position we occupied, and our wearied men at once began to fortify, and
                    continued to labor during the night and the next day.</p>
                <p>At the dawn of the 3d (Sunday), the battle again opened on our left, and raged
                    with terrible fury until nearly noon. Desultory firing was continued during the
                    day and night, we being held ready for the conflict momentarily expected on our
                    part of the line. During this time we continued to strengthen our works, in
                    doing which we were frequently directed personally by Brig. Gen. J. C. Robinson,
                    commanding the division, and Col. A. R. Root, commanding the brigade. This day
                    (May 4), at 2 p.m., my regiment was ordered out to the front and left, to
                    relieve the One hundred and fourth Regt. New York Volunteers on the picket line.
                    This was the most dangerous and arduous picket duty that we had ever been called
                    upon to perform, and it taxed the powers of endurance of officers and men to the
                    utmost degree, and the exigency was such that the regiment was continued on this
                    duty for two nights and the greater part of two days, one half of the sentinels
                    having no relief, and the last night a drenching rain fell, adding to its
                    horrors. We were occasionally fired on by the enemy's pickets and scouts during
                    the second evening and night. The many incidents and movements, and everything
                    of any moment that occurred, were at once reported by telegraph to the general
                    commanding the division, who returned such instructions and advice as were
                    deemed necessary.</p>
                <p>At the dawn of day on the morning of the 6th, Maj. Lee, of the division staff,
                    came out to the lines, and communicated to me the fact that our army had
                    evacuated our works three hours before, and were now recrossing the
                    Rappahannock, and that I was immediately to withdraw the pickets, fall back
                    quietly to the fortifications, and aid in covering the movement by deploying my
                    men to the rear and right flank. I fully realized the danger involved in this
                    movement, and at once proceeded to carry out the instructions received. Arriving
                    at the fortifications, I was joined by Col. R. Coulter, with his regiment, the
                    Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, who had been on similar duty, connecting with
                    the One hundred and seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers on the left. We lost no time
                    in moving toward the ford, reached it safely, crossed the river on the upper
                    pontoon bridge, and continued our march toward Falmouth, without finding any
                    part of the division, and until the men becoming much exhausted, we encamped for
                    the night. The men could not have refreshing rest on account of the heavy rains
                    in the night. The next morning we continued the march in direction of Gen.
                    Hooker's headquarters, near where we found the other regiments of the brigade
                    and the division. After a short rest, and during the same afternoon, we marched
                    to and encamped in our present position. I am happy to have it in my power to
                    say that, during these nine days' arduous services, the officers and men of my
                    regiment conducted themselves with their usual zeal and courage. The commanders
                    of the division and the brigade know from personal observation how well and
                    faithfully they served the good cause of our country in this important crisis,
                    and, I feel assured, will do them full justice.</p>
                <p>I would embrace the occasion of this report to express my appreciation of the
                    services of Capt.'s Whitman, of Twelfth Massachusetts Volunteers; Parsons and
                    Whiteside, Ninety-fourth New York Volunteers, and their respective companies,
                    the first two of which performed outpost and vedette duty in front of the center
                    of the picket line on the road, while the latter performed good service on the
                    picket reserve. I would also express my sense of the faithful and efficient
                    services rendered, while on this duty, by Lieut. James B. Thomas, the acting
                    adjutant of my regiment, to whom I feel much indebted for the prompt assistance
                    he rendered in the varied and responsible duties devolving upon me during the
                    operations of which the foregoing is but a very brief account.</p>
