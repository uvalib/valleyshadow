<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson writes to Army Adjutant Edward D. Townsend in May,
                    1861, concerning the build-up of forces at Chambersburg. Patterson announces he
                    will go to the town, and outlines plans for an advance on Confederate

<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the
                        Army, Washington City:</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pa.,</p>
<p>May 30, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2d proximo I shall leave for Chambersburg, where my
                    headquarters will be located till the troops are in advance of Hagerstown. By
                    that date will be encamped at Chambersburg ready to advance six, perhaps seven,
                    regiments from this State, three or four awaiting accounterments, and the two
                    New York regiments. Four more regiments will be in motion to the same place. I
                    am assured accounterments for the other regiments will be provided at the time
                    promised, and pressed forward as rapidly s received. If, as I anticipate, the
                    movement be made I shall at once throw the regiments beyond Hagerstown,
                    establish a camp stretching toward Clear Spring, threaten Harper's Ferry, and,
                    while holding the force ready to act instantly as circumstances shall develop,
                    prepare a force to move toward Cumberland.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
