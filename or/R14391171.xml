                <p>I pressed the enemy hard yesterday; at the same time pushed forward Col. Powell's
                    cavalry through Timberville, and struck the Valley pike in his rear. This latter
                    movement stampeded him so badly that late last evening he gave up Valley pike
                    and stuck off toward Keezletown and Port Republic, leaving the entire Valley way
                    free. All my infantry arrived at Harrisonburg at 4 p. m. to-day. Col. Powell's
                    cavalry reached Month Crawford to-night. Torbert's cavalry overtook me this
                    evening. Its operations in the Luray Valley, on which I calculated so much, were
                    an entire failure. They were held at Mildford by two small brigades of Fitz
                    Lee's cavalry, and then fell back toward Front Royal until after they had
                    learned of our success at Fishers' Hill. They then proceeded up the valley
                    again, encountering the enemy's cavalry near Harrisonburg yesterday; captured
                    and burned nine wagons. I find at his place 450 wounded. I am now ninety-four
                    miles from Martinsburg and 104 miles from Harper's Ferry. I will send a column
                    of cavalry to Staunton to-morrow morning, and will probably follow the enemy in
                    the direction of Port Republic with the infantry. Every hour brings me
                    additional information of the demoralization of Early's army. Reports late this
                    evening say that he is moving toward Charlottesville. Other reports are that he
                    is going to Waynesborough. The part that I expected the cavalry to accomplish at
                    Fisher's Hill was a complete failure. I have relived Averell from his command.
                    Instead of following the enemy when he was broken at Fisher's Hill, so that
                    there was not a cavalry organization left, he went into camp, and let me pursue
                    the enemy for a distance of fifteen miles with infantry during the night. Early
                    burned quite a number of wagons on his way up the Valley. He also abandoned two
                    caissons on the Keezletown road not far from this place.</p>
