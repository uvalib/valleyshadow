<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General J. E. B. Stuart on July 9, 1863, on the aftermath of
                    the battle of Gettysburg. He mentions Union forces attacking supply trains, and
                    expresses doubt that enough shoes could be found at Chambersburg to make the
                    town worth capturing.</p>

<p>Gen. Stuart, Comdg. Cavalry:</p>
<p>Hdqrs.,</p>
<p>July 9, 1863</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have received your note of to-day, and regret very much to learn your loss was
                    so great yesterday. I hope your parties that you have sent out may gain us
                    information of the enemy. It is much needed. I hope you will secure all the
                    flour and forage on Beaver Creek. It is very scarce, and the enemy in the Clear
                    Spring Valley are attacking all our wagon trains. Yesterday they captured 11
                    wagons and to-day I have heard of 1. Imboden's cavalry is on that side. They are
                    unsteady, and, I fear, inefficient. I think it more important to clear them away
                    than to take Chambersburg. I doubt whether a shoe could be found there. They are
                    all hidden or carried off.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
