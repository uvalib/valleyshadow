<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General T.J. Jackson commanded the First Brigade, which included the Fifth
					Virginia Infantry in the Army of the Shenandoah. Gen. Jackson reports his
					brigade's advance and standoff with the enemy, while Gen. Bee's forces fell
					back. Through these actions Jackson earned the nickname "Stonewall."</p>

<p>Major</p>
<p>Camp near Manassas, Va.</p>
<p>July 23, 1861</p>
<p>MAJOR:</p>
<p>have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my brigade on
					the 21st:</p>
<p>About 4 in the morning I received notice from Gen. Longstreet that he needed a
					re-enforcement of two regiments, which were accordingly ordered.</p>
<p>Subsequently I received an order from Gen. Beauregard to move to the support of
					Gen. Bonham, afterwards to support Gen. Cocke, and finally to take such position
					as would enable me to re-enforce either, as circumstances might require.</p>
<p>Whilst in the position last indicated I received a request from Gen. Cocke to
					guard the stone bridge, and immediately moved forward to effect the object in
					view.</p>
<p>Subsequently ascertaining that Gen. Bee, who was on the left of our line, was
					hard pressed, I marched to his assistance, notifying him at the same time that I
					was advancing to his support; but, before arriving within cannon range of the
					enemy, I met Ge n. Bee's forces falling back. I continued to advance with the
					understanding that he would form in my rear. His battery, under its dauntless
					commander, Capt. Imboden, reversed and advanced with my brigade.</p>
<p>The first favorable position for meeting the enemy was at the next summit, where
					at 11.30 a.m., I posted Capt. Imboden's battery and two pieces of Capt.
					Stanard's, so as to play upon the advancing foe. The Fourth Regiment, commanded
					by Col. James F. Pr eston, and the Twenty-seventh Regiment, commanded by Lieut.
					Col. John F. Preston, and the Twenty-seventh Regiment, commanded by Lieut. Col.
					John Echols, were posted in rear of the batteries; the Fifth Regiment, commanded
					by Col. Kenton Harper, was posted on the right of the batteries; the Second
					Regiment, commanded by Col. James W. Allen, on the left, and the Thirty-third
					commanded by Col. A. C. Cummings, on his left. I also ordered forward the other
					two pieces of Capt. Stanard's and all those of Col. Pen dleton's battery. They,
					as well as the battery under Lieut. Pelham, came into action on the same line as
					the others; and nobly did the artillery maintain for hours against the enemy's
					advancing thousands. Great praise is due to Col. Pendleton and the othe r
					officers and men.</p>
<p>Apprehensive lest my flanks should be turned, I sent an order to Cols. Stuart and
					Radford, of the cavalry, to secure them. Col. Stuart and that part of his
					command with him deserve great praise for the promptness with which they moved
					to my left and se cured the flank by timely charging the enemy and driving him
					back.</p>
<p>Gen. Bee, with his rallied troops, soon marched to my support; and as
					re-enforcements continued to arrive Gen. Beauregard posted them so as to
					strengthen the flanks of my brigade. The enemy not being able to force our lines
					by a direct fire of artiller y, inclined part of his batteries to the right, so
					as to obtain an oblique fire; but in doing so exposed his pieces to a more
					destructive fire from our artillery, and one of his batteries was thrown so near
					to Col. Cummings that it fell into his hands in consequence of his having made a
					gallant charge on it with his regiment; but owing to a destructive small-arm
					fire from the enemy he was forced to abandon it.</p>
<p>At 3.30 p.m. the advance of the enemy having reached a position which called for
					the use of the bayonet, I gave the command for the charge of the more than brave
					Fourth and Twenty-seventh, and, under commanders worth of such regiments, they,
					in the ord er in which they were posted, rushed forward obliquely to the left of
					our batteries, and through the blessing of God, who gave us the victory, pierced
					the enemy's center, and by co-operating with the victorious Fifth and other
					forces soon placed the field essentially in our possession.</p>
<p>About the time that Col. Preston passed our artillery the heroic Lieut.-Col.
					Lackland, of the Second Regiment, followed by the highly meritorious right of
					the Second, took possession of and endeavored to remove from the field the
					battery which Col. Cum mings had previously been forced to abandon; but after
					removing one of the pieces some distance was also forced by the enemy's fire to
					abandon it.</p>
<p>The brigade, in connection with other troops, took seven field pieces in addition
					to the battery captured by Col. Cummings. The enemy, though repulsed in the
					center, succeeded in turning our flanks. But their batteries having been
					disabled by our fire, and also abandoned by reason of the infantry charges, the
					victory was soon completed by the fire of small-arms and occasional shots from a
					part of our artillery, which I posted on the next crest in rear.</p>
<p>By direction of Gen. Johnston I assumed the command of all the remaining
					artillery and infantry of the Army near the Lewis house, to act as circumstances
					might require. Part of this artillery fired on the retreating enemy. The colors
					of the First Michi gan Regiment and an artillery flag were captured-the first by
					the Twenty-seventh Regiment and the other by the Fourth.</p>
<p>Lieut. Col. F. B. Jones, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieut. T. G. Lee,
					aide-de-camp, and Lieut. A. A. Pendleton, brigade ordnance officer, and Capt.
					Thomas Marshall, volunteer aide, rendered valuable service. Cadets J. W.
					Thompson and N. W. Lee, also volunteer aides, merit special praise. Dr. Hunter
					H. McGuire has proved himself to be eminently qualified for his position-that of
					medical director of the brigade. Capt. Thomas L. Preston, though not of my
					command, rendered valuable service during t he action.</p>
<p>It is with pain that I have to report as killed 11 officers, 14 non-commissioned
					officers, and 86 privates; wounded, 22 officers, 27 non-commissioned officers,
					and 319 privates; and missing, 1 officer and 4 privates.</p>
<p>I respectfully call attention to the accompanying reports of the commanders of
					the regiments and battery composing this brigade.*</p>
<p>Your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>T.J. JACKSON,<br> Brig.-Gen., Provisional Army, Confederate States</p>
