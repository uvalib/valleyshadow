                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by this command
                    in the recent raid:</p>
                <p>In obedience to orders left camp Mill Creek on the morning of the 1st June, and
                    by easy stages reached Staunton on the 8th.</p>
                <p>At 11 a. m. on the 11th instant was ordered in position to engage the enemy's
                    battery that was posted on the south side of North River at Lexington, and after
                    being engaged three hours succeeded in driving them from their position. Our
                    loss in this engagement was 1 man killed, Private George W. Tank.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the 17th, in obedience to orders, took a position and engaged
                    the enemy near Lynchburg, fought till dark, advanced our line one mile, and
                    encamped for the night.</p>
                <p>At 11 a. m. on the morning of the 18th became hotly engaged with the enemy's
                    guns, posted in strong earth-works. This engagement lasted forty-five minutes,
                    and the fire very severe. Casualties, 4 slightly wounded.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 21st one piece in position on a hill, under command of
                    Lieut. C. H. Fee, one and one-half miles east of Salem, to check a heavy line of
                    the enemy's skirmishers that were advancing on our right flank; remained in
                    position thirty minutes, using canister until the battery had passed and
                    overtaken support.</p>
                <p>I have the honor to report a loss of 6 artillery wheels, 14 horses, and 1 set of
                    lead harness.</p>
                <p>By order of Capt. James R. McMullin, acting chief of artillery, 528 rounds of
                    ammunition (fixed) and 12 tarpaulins were destroyed at Meadow Bluff on the 26th
                    instant.</p>
                <p>Twenty-six artillery horses have been transferred to the post acting
                    quartermaster at Charleston as unserviceable since reaching this place.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
