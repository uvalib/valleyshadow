                <p>In late May, 1862, Lincoln ordered Shields division back into the Valley to help
                    deal with Stonewall Jackson. By early June, Shields and Fremont's forces engaged
                    in chasing Jackson southward. In this letter, Shields reports to General
                    McDowell on his movements. He mentions burned bridges in the Valley and a
                    possible advance on Staunton or Charlottesville with the intent of destroying
                    the railroad.</p>

                <p>The route from here to New Market is impracticable. The rebels burned down the
                    bridges on the route; one called the Columbia Bridge, 10 miles from here, over
                    the river, the other the White House Bridge, on the direct route over the river.
                    The rains have so swelled the river that every effort to construct a bridge of
                    boats has proved impracticable. My only chance now is to push on to Conrad's
                    Store. The bridge there I expect to find burned also, but by going higher up we
                    may find a ford. This would bring us out at Harrisonburg. If the river rises as
                    at present it is doing I cannot hope to ford even there.</p>
                <p>My next move will be to push on to Stanardsville, destroy there railroad and
                    depot, and if possible to Staunton or Charlottesville. I have no cavalry. The
                    Rhode Island cavalry has broken down and I must send it back, keeping only a few
                    for orderlies. This cavalry has been sadly neglected. Can you not send me
                    cavalry that can work, forage, &amp; c.? If I cannot take the enemy in
                    reverse at Rude's Hill, look to it. You cannot carry it in front without loss,
                    and perhaps heavy loss. Rude's Hill is between Mount Jackson and New Market. I
                    drove him out by a flank movement on the west side of the turnpike, but I fear
                    the river is too high now to effect this. With good cavalry I could stampede
                    them to Richmond. I will destroy their means of escape somehow. Send my cavalry
                    that can march and know how to take care of themselves.</p>
