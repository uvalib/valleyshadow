<p><b>Summary:<br></b>May, 1865, Union orders establishing post offices in towns returned to United
                    State's authority, including the soon to be garrisoned Staunton, VA.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Col. MARKLAND,<br> Superintendent of Mails for the Army
                        of the United States:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 1, 1865.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I am instructed by the major-general commanding the department to say that he
                    deems it important that post offices be opened with as little delay as possible
                    in the towns recently restored to the possession of the United in this
                    department in order that the citizens may have facilities for resuming and
                    carrying on their business. It is specially important that this be done at once
                    in Richmond and Petersburg. Fredericksburg, Bowling Green, Columbia,
                    Charlottesville, and Yorktown, are already occupied by U. S. forces, and
                    garrisons will shortly be established at Lynchburg, Staunton, Gordonsville, and
                    Danville. He requests that arrangements be made for the regular transmittal of
                    mails to and from all these places. At those points where garrisons are
                    established these arrangements may be made at once, and at the other points
                    named as soon as the troops reach them.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>ED. W. SMITH,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
