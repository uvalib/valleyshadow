<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson's early May, 1862, Valley offensive took
                    Federals by surprise. In this late April letter, Union General John C. Fremont
                    reports to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton of scouting near Staunton, Virginia,
                    and the apparent retreat of Confederate forces in the area. He also discusses an
                    engagement between foragers and guerrillas at Bull Pasture.</p>

<p>Hon. E.M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>WHEELING, VA.,</p>
<p>April 30, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dispatch of to-day just received. I repeat the following report, sent yesterday
                    morning, viz: Gen. Milroy reports that his scouts have been within 7 miles of
                    Staunton. Johnson was still retreating, and was said to be on his way to join
                    Jackson. A foraging party of 26 wagons sent out by Gen. Milroy six days ago to
                    Bull Pasture, 12 miles from McDowell, became water-bound, and was attacked by
                    guerrillas and destroyed, only 10 horses escaping. Three soldiers are thus far
                    known to have been badly wounded. A detachment has been sent to Bull Pasture.
                    The advance of Gen. Cox's forces under Col. Scammon found intrenchments on the
                    east side of the New River, opposite. The rebels had strong breastworks and
                    rifle pits. They retreated on the approach of Col. Scammon, whose pickets are
                    now within 2 miles of Flat Top. No change since yesterday's report. I have heard
                    nothing further from Milroy. Streams along the Moorefield and Franklin road
                    continue impassable. Hope to have Blenker's division at Moorefield by end of the
                    week. Will hereafter number all telegrams sent to yourself, this being No. 1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>J.C. FREMONT,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
