<p>Hon. SECRETARY OF WAR: </p>
<p></p>
<p>May 12, 1864. (Received Hanover Junction, 13th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>This morning at dawn the enemy broke through that part of our line occupied by
                    Johnson's division and gained possession of a portion of our breast-works, which
                    he still holds. A number of pieces of artillery fell into his hands. The
                    engagement has continued all day, and, with the exception indicated we have
                    maintained our ground. In the beginning of the action we lost a large number of
                    prisoners, but, thanks to a merciful Providence, our subsequent casualties were
                    not large. Maj.-Gen. Johnson and Brig.-Gen. Steaurt were taken prisoners. The
                    brave Gen. Perrin was killed, and Gen.'s Walker (of the Stonewall Brigade) and
                    Daniel severely wounded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. E. LEE, Gen.</p>
