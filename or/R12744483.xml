                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the action of Hoke's brigade
                    in the late campaign from Fredericksburg into Maryland and Pennsylvania, and
                    back into Virginia:</p>
                <p>From the commencement of the campaign to the night of July 2, the brigade was
                    commanded by Col. I. E. Avery, Sixth Regt. North Carolina troops, Gen. Hoke not
                    having recovered from the effects of a severe wound received at the battle of
                    Chancellorsville. Col. Avery left no memoranda of the operations of his command,
                    and this fact must serve to account for the meager and imperfect details of this
                    report.</p>
                <p>Leaving camp near Hamilton's Crossing on June 4, the brigade reached Culpeper
                    Court-House on the 8th; encamped near Gaines' Cross-Roads on the 11th, and, by a
                    forced march on the 12th, passed through Chester Gap to Front Royal, and forded
                    both branches of the Shenandoah.</p>
                <p>On June 13, the division having reached the vicinity of Winchester, via Newtown,
                    a position was taken in front of the enemy on the left of the Valley turnpike,
                    Gordon's brigade on the right, Hays' brigade in the center, Smith's brigade on
                    the left, the right of Gordon's brigade resting on the turnpike.</p>
                <p>Sharp skirmishing ensued, and was kept up along the lines throughout the day. The
                    action of Hoke's brigade consisted in moving rapidly from right to left of the
                    line already established, and back again to a position about 600 yards in rear
                    of Gordon's brigade. Night coming on, the brigade was faced by the rear rank,
                    and further instructions received to establish a line of pickets in our late
                    rear, to guard against any approach of the enemy in that quarter. Arms were
                    stacked, and the men bivouacked on their lines.</p>
                <p>At daylight on the morning of the 14th, the Fifty-fourth Regt. North Carolina
                    troops was left on picket duty in the rear, and the brigade, now composed of the
                    Sixth, Twenty-first, and Fifty-seventh Regt.'s, moved up within supporting
                    distance of Gordon's brigade later in the day.</p>
                <p>The plan of attack having been changed, Gen. Gordon was left to divert the
                    attention of the enemy in front, while the rest of the division were marched
                    silently and rapidly by a circuitous route to a range of wooded hills running
                    parallel with the line of intrenchments occupied by the enemy in rear and
                    northwest of the town.</p>
                <p>The command having been allowed time to rest, the division was formed in three
                    lines of battle, Hays' brigade in front, Hoke's brigade 75 yards in rear, and
                    Smith's brigade a like distance in rear of Hoke's. The artillery was placed in
                    position on the flanks of the division, and at 6 p. m. opened a furious fire
                    upon the enemy, very much to his surprise and confusion. He promptly returned
                    the fire, with but little effect, however, and fifteen minutes later Gen. Hays
                    commenced to advance. Hoke's brigade moved forward at the same moment, but had
                    scarcely gained 10 paces when the Fifty-seventh Regt. was ordered to move off by
                    the left flank to the support of the batteries on the left, and a few moments
                    later the two remaining regiments, viz, Sixth and Twenty-first, were ordered to
                    move by the right flank to the support of the batteries on the right. Gen. Hays
                    soon succeeded in driving the enemy from his intrenchments, and the batteries on
                    the left were immediately hurried forward to the position he had just gained.
                    The Fifty-seventh Regt. then advanced in line of battle across the intervening
                    valley, and was halted, by order of Maj.-Gen. Early, in rear of Hays' brigade.
                    Some loss was sustained in this position by the shells from the fort, which were
                    directed at the troops upon the hill.</p>
                <p>At sunset, by order of Maj.-Gen. Early, this regiment was ordered to advance upon
                    the works on the extreme right of the enemy's line. The order was executed
                    without loss, the enemy retiring without firing a shot. Night put an end to
                    further movements, and by the morning the enemy had evacuated their stronghold
                    and inner line of fortifications.</p>
                <p>At sunrise, Col. Avery moved forward in pursuit with the Sixth and Twenty-first
                    Regt.'s. By order of Maj.-Gen. Early, the Fifty-seventh Regt. was left to hold
                    the intrenchments against any attack which might be made by re-enforcements to
                    the enemy from the direction of Romney.</p>
                <p>Following the movements of the division, the brigade forded the Potomac at
                    Shepherdstown on the 22d, entered Pennsylvania on the 23d, and on the 28th
                    occupied the town of York.</p>
                <p>On July 1, we advanced upon Gettysburg, along the Heidlersburg road, and, when
                    distant one mile and a half from the town, line of battle was formed on the left
                    of the road, the right resting on Hays' brigade. The brigade at this time
                    consisted of three regiments--the Sixth (commanded by Maj. Samuel McD. Tate),
                    the Twenty-first (by Col. W. W. Kirkland), and the Fifty-seventh (by Col.
                    Godwin), the Fifty-fourth having been sent back to Staunton with Federal
                    prisoners captured at Winchester.</p>
                <p>Skirmishers were deployed in front of our lines, and at 3 p. m. the order to
                    advance was received. The enemy had formed line of battle on the hillside in
                    front of the town, under cover of a strong fence, portions of which were made of
                    stone. Our advance was made with great deliberation until we approached a
                    sluggish stream, or slough, about 200 yards in front of the enemy's lines, when
                    the batteries opened upon us with grape and canister, seconded by a very
                    destructive fire from the infantry.</p>
                <p>Col. Avery now gave the order to double-quick, and the brigade gallantly dashed
                    through the stream and up the hill to the fence, the enemy stubbornly holding
                    their position until we had climbed over into their midst. Two Napoleon guns
                    were taken by the Sixth North Carolina. A large number of prisoners taken at
                    this point were sent to the rear. The enemy now fled into the town, many of them
                    being killed in the retreat.</p>
                <p>The brigade continued to advance toward the town, but, while yet in the
                    outskirts, was wheeled to the left and reformed on the railroad. The enemy had
                    now succeeded in planting a battery upon a high, sloping spur on the mountain
                    side immediately in our front. Under cover of the railroad cut, we were moved by
                    the left flank about 400 yards to the left, and again moved forward. The shells
                    from the enemy proving very effective, we were soon after halted in a depression
                    on the hillside, and the men ordered to lie down. Skirmishers were thrown
                    forward, and this position held through the night and until 8 p. m. on the next
                    day, July 2, when the brigade moved forward to the attack.</p>
                <p>As soon as the summit of the hill was gained, it was discovered that the
                    batteries which we had been ordered to take were in front of Hays' brigade, and
                    considerably to the right of our right flank. We continued to advance, however,
                    under a terrific fire, climbed a rail fence, and still farther beyond descended
                    into a low bottom, and dislodged a heavy line of infantry from a stone wall
                    running parallel with our front. The enemy's batteries now enfiladed us, and a
                    destructive fire was poured into our ranks from a line of infantry formed in
                    rear of a stone wall running at a right angle with our line of battle and
                    immediately below the batteries.</p>
                <p>Col. Avery now ordered a change of front, and succeeded in wheeling the brigade
                    to the right, a movement which none but the steadiest veterans could have
                    executed under such circumstances. In swinging around, three stone walls had to
                    be surmounted. The ground was rocky and uneven, and these obstacles prevented
                    that rapidity of movement and unity of action which might have insured success.
                    The men now charged up the hill with heroic determination, and drove the enemy
                    from his last stone wall. In this charge, the command had become much separated,
                    and in the darkness it was now found impossible to concentrate more than 40 or
                    50 men at any point for a farther advance. Maj. Tate, with a portion of the
                    Sixth North Carolina Regt., aided by a small number of the Ninth Louisiana
                    Regt., succeeded in capturing a battery on the right. No supports were at hand,
                    and the approach of the enemy in overwhelming force compelled him to retire. The
                    scattered fragments of the brigade now withdrew, and were reformed near the
                    position which it had occupied through the day.</p>
                <p>Here I learned for the first time that our brigade commander (Col. Isaac E.
                    Avery), had been mortally wounded. In his death the country lost one of her
                    truest and bravest sons, and the army one of its most gallant and efficient
                    officers.</p>
                <p>In the desperate struggle through which we had just passed, the officers and men
                    of Hoke's brigade fulfilled all the expectations which their gallantry on former
                    occasions had excited. No body of men of equal number could have accomplished
                    greater results against such overwhelming odds.</p>
                <p>The command of the brigade now devolved upon me, and before daylight, by order of
                    Maj.-Gen. Early, I moved into position in the railroad cut on the outskirts of
                    the town. Later in the day, I was ordered to form on the left of Hays' brigade,
                    in one of the upper streets of the town, and in advance of the position on the
                    railroad.</p>
