<p>Gen. Couch:</p>
<p>Chambersburg,</p>
<p>July 7, 1863 </p>
<p></p>
<p>Just arrived here from Waynesborough. Have 44 prisoners. Enemy falling back to
                    Hagerstown and Williamsport. Have captured, since I left Harrisburg, 7 wagons,
                    29 mules, 52 horses, and 165 prisoners.</p>
<p>Capt. Firey, of the Maryland Brigade, wishes to join his battalion. Shall he go?
                    Has my consent, if you say so. My regiment will be home to-day. Shall I report
                    to it? Where is Gen. Smith, that I may communicate with him?</p>
<p>Wagon train is pushing for Williamsport. I was in their midst this morning, near
                    Waynesborough.</p>
<p>Answer by telegraph.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WM. H. BOYD,<br> Capt. First New York Cavalry.</p>
