<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs writes Colonel Tolles regarding
                    the October, 1864, supply situation facing General Sheridan's armies in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. Meigs reports on the availability of forage in the Staunton
                    area, and the destruction of supplies in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. TOLLES,<br> Chief Quartermaster, Middle
                        Military Div., Martinsburg, Va.:</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.,</p>
<p>October 2, 1864--11 a. m.<br> (Received 12 m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch of 1st received. Latest dispatches received from Gen. Sheridan
                    evening of 29th, Harrisonburg. Movements not determined. Should he follow Early
                    to Charlottesville, he will be supplied by the railroad which is now being
                    reconstructed to the Rappahannock, beyond which river we will not pass until
                    advised from him of his disposition and need. He reports that the country from
                    Harrisonburg to Staunton is well supplied with forage, and that his cavalry
                    destroyed large quantities of grain, harness, and property at Staunton and
                    Waynesborough. For the present keep Winchester well stocked, according to his
                    orders, and be guided by his instructions. Unless advised that you positively
                    need them, I will not send you more wagons and mules to consume forage. We have
                    them ready here.</p>
