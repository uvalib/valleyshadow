<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In late summer and fall, 1864, General Grant ordered Phillip Sheridan to clear
                    the Shenandoah Valley of Confederate forces, and destroy the vital food and
                    supplies in the region. In this September dispatch, Sheridan reports to Grant on
                    his progress. He discusses his cavalry's destruction of arms, food, and
                    buildings in Staunton.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT.</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG,</p>
<p>September 29, 1864--7.30 p. m.<br> (Received October 2.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In my last dispatch I informed you that I pressed Early so closely through New
                    Market, at the same time sending cavalry around his flank, that he gave up the
                    Valley and took to the mountains, passing through Brown's Gap. I kept up the
                    pursuit to Port Republic, destroying 75 wagons and 4 caissons. I sent Gen.
                    Torbert, who overtook me at Harrisonburg, to Staunton with Wilson's division of
                    cavalry and one brigade of Merritt's. Torbert entered Staunton on the 26th, and
                    destroyed a large quantity of rebel Government property--harness, saddles,
                    small-arms, hard bread, flour, repair shops, &amp;c. He then proceeded to
                    Waynesborough, destroying the iron bridge over the South Branch of the
                    Shenandoah, seven miles of track, the depot buildings, Government Tanery, and a
                    large amount of leather, flour, and stores, &amp;c., at that place. He found
                    the tunnel defended by infantry, and retired via Staunton, destroying, according
                    to your original instructions to me. This morning I sent around Merritt's and
                    Custer's division, via Piedmont, to burn grain, &amp;c., pursuant to your
                    instructions. My impression is that most of the troops which Early had left
                    passed through the mountains to Charlottesville. Kershaw's division came to his
                    assistance, and, I think, passed along the west base of the mountains to
                    Waynesborough. The advance of my infantry is at Mount Crawford, eight miles
                    south of Harrisonburg. I will go on and clean out the Valley. I am getting
                    twenty-five to forty prisoners daily, who come in form the mountains on each
                    side and deliver themselves up. From the most reliable accounts, Early's army
                    was completely broken up and is dispirited. It will be exceedingly difficult for
                    me to carry the infantry column over the mountains and strike at the Central
                    road. I cannot accumulate sufficient stores to do so, and think it best to take
                    some position near Front Royal, and operate with the cavalry and infantry. I
                    will, however, stay here for a few days. Kershaw had not reached Richmond, but
                    was somewhere in the vicinity or Gordonsville, when he received orders to rejoin
                    Early. The destruction of the grain and forage from here to Staunton will be a
                    terrible blow to them. All the grain, forage, &amp;c., in the vicinity of
                    Staunton was retained for the use of Early's army; all in the lower part of the
                    Valley was shipped to Richmond for the use of Lee's army. The country from here
                    to Staunton was abundantly supplied with forage and grain, &amp;c.</p>
