<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Army of the Potomac commander George Meade writes to General Darius Couch in
                    Chambersburg in July, 1863, to report on efforts to pursue the retreating Army
                    of Northern Virginia after the battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. Couch,<br> Chambersburg:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 14, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>The enemy evacuated last night the very strong position he occupied yesterday. I
                    was only able to overtake his rear guard at Falling Waters, where we captured
                    over 2,000 prisoners, several guns, standards, &amp;c. The rest of the army
                    had crossed during the night.</p>
<p>I am about moving down the river to cross at Berlin, and move down the Loudoun
                    Valley. I wish to take every available man with me now with my army. At the same
                    time I think Hagerstown ought to be occupied and the river watched, till we know
                    what has become of Lee.</p>
<p>If you can do this with the forces under your command, you will render me an
                    essential service. I have directed Gen. Smith to report to you for instructions,
                    as the time of his men is so nearly out.</p>
<p>Please let me know by telegram whether you can comply with my wishes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. G. MEADE,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
