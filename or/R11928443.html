<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General in Chief Henry Halleck lays out October, 1862, plans. He discusses
                    fortifying Harper's Ferry to serve as a base for advances on Staunton,
                    Lynchburg, and Richmond.</p>

<p>Washington,</p>
<p>October 19, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This project of extensively fortifying Harper's Ferry, and constructing a
                    permanent bridge at that point, involves a very considerable expenditure of
                    money, a larger garrison, and a long delay, perhaps extending into winter,
                    before Harper's Ferry can be made a prepared base for, at best, an exterior line
                    of operations upon our proper objective point-Staunton, Lynchburg, or Richmond.
                    Either of these points may be more surely reached by an interior line of
                    operations behind and east of the Blue Ridge, at the same time covering
                    Washington, our proper base, and threatening the enemy's communications,
                    compelling him thus to evacuate the vicinity of Herper's Ferry; in which event
                    field defenses, with a moderate garrison, would suffice to hold that point
                    against any probable attack to be made upon it; and the permanent railroad
                    bridge, now being built, would suffice for all our wants, without the one
                    proposed to be erected by Gen. McClellan about 1 1/2 miles above.</p>
