<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Arnold Elzey reports to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on his
                    efforts to form the Maryland Line at Staunton, Virginia. He reports that the

<p> Gen. S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>June 13, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that up to this time my efforts to organize the
                    Maryland Line have been fruitless. I found about fifty of Gilmor's dismounted
                    men at Staunton, and only about thirty transferred men reported to me at Camp
                    Maryland. They were sent from Charleston, and were men who had been confined in
                    jail. When Gen. Imboden was pressed in the Valley I sent this detachment of
                    about eighty men, under Capt. Stith, to join his forces. My experience goes to
                    prove the impossibility and impracticability of forming the Maryland Line, and I
                    would respectfully recommend that the order be revoked. I repaired to Gen. Lee's
                    headquarters on Saturday last to report to him, but he informed me that he had
                    no command to give me and nothing for me to do. I now respectfully report myself
                    to you for duty.</p>
<p>With great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>ARNOLD ELZEY,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
