<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In July, 1861, Union forces under George B. McClellan won a series of victories
                    in what is now West Virginia. In this letter to Assistant Adjutant Edward
                    Townsend, McClellan reports that all opposing Confederate forces have retreated
                    to Staunton.</p>

<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND:</p>
<p>CAMP NEAR HUTTONSVILLE,</p>
<p>July 14, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have just returned from Cheat River, having crossed the mountain with a strong
                    advanced guard. The enemy have no doubt retreated to Staunton, and I have the
                    pleasure to announce that, with the exception of the Kanawha, the part of
                    Western Virginia included in my department is now free from the presence of the
                    enemy. I expect every day to hear that the measures taken to drive Wise out of
                    the Kanawha have proved successful. I shall now proceed to scour the country
                    with small columns, unless the moral effect of our successes has sufficed to
                    disperse the guerrilla bands. The three-months' regiments are to be reorganized,
                    and some time will be required to prepare this hastily-reorganized army for
                    further operations.</p>
<p>The general's kind telegraph is received. Offer him my thanks for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. McCLELLAN.</p>
