                <p>In compliance with orders from headquarters Second Corps, received the afternoon
                    of February 4, I have the honor to report that this division marched from camp
                    at 7 a.m. on the 5th instant in the following order: First Brigade, Col.
                    Olmstead; Second Brigade, Col. Murphy; Tenth Massachusetts Battery; and Third
                    Brigade, Lieut. Col. F. E. Pierce. The command was massed at the McDougall
                    house, and a squadron of cavalry ordered to report to me was ordered to the
                    front as an advance guard, supported by the Nineteenth Massachusetts Volunteers,
                    belonging to the First Brigade. Upon the advance arriving at the road leading to
                    the Armstrong house, the cavalry drove the enemy's vedettes across Stony Creek
                    Run, where they were checked. The Nineteenth Massachusetts then charged and
                    drove the enemy across Hatcher's Run. The Nineteenth Maine, of the First
                    Brigade, and the Seventh West Virginia Volunteers, of the Third Brigade, crossed
                    the run (Hatcher's) and occupied the ground on the opposite side. The rest of
                    the division was then marched up the road leading to the Armstrong house, and
                    placed in line of battle beyond said house, in the following order; the Second
                    Brigade, with two regiments of the Third Brigade, on the right; the First
                    Brigade, with two regiments of the Third Brigade, on the left; the remaining
                    regiments of the Third Brigade being on the extreme left. The right of the line,
                    after being formed, rested upon Stony Creek, and the left upon Hatcher's Run,
                    after which disposition I ordered the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers,
                    Sixty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, and the One hundred and sixty Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, across Stony Creek, in order to make connection with McAllister's
                    brigade, of the Third Division of this corps. Four guns of the Tenth
                    Massachusetts Battery were placed in position, in rear of my line, upon an
                    elevated piece of ground. The enemy opened upon them after being placed in
                    position, but were not replied to as it was evident that they were only feeling
                    our position. About 3 p.m. the enemy made an attack on the left of the R.
                    Armstrong house also on the left of the line, which was also a feint to cover
                    their movement on the right. About 4.30 p.m. they made a vigorous attack upon
                    the right of my line, driving in my skirmishers, when I took the One hundred and
                    eighth New York Volunteers and the Fourth Ohio Volunteers, of the Third Brigade,
                    across the run to support them; at the same time I ordered the Fourteenth
                    Connecticut Volunteers, of the same brigade, to change front on the edge of the
                    swamp. Upon making the above-mentioned dispositions I found McAllister's
                    brigade, of the Third Division, filing in to occupy the ground that I intended
                    to occupy with those regiments, after which I ordered the Tenth Massachusetts
                    Battery to change front and open upon the enemy, who were by this time engaged
                    with my right and McAllister's (of the Third Division) left. After three attacks
                    the enemy was repulsed.</p>
                <p>About 4 o'clock of the 6th instant the Fifth Corps advanced on the left of this
                    division, and soon afterward appeared to be hotly engaged with the enemy; and
                    observing that they appeared to be giving away I ordered a section of Roder's
                    battery, Fourth U. S. Artillery, commanded by Lieut. Smith, of the same
                    regiment, to open, and ordered two regiments of the Third Brigade, which I had
                    in reserve, into position on the left, covering the bridge across Hatcher's Run.</p>
                <p>On the 7th instant the division was not engaged, with the exception of some
                    artillery, which opened in compliance with instructions received from
                    headquarters Second Corps and at the request of an officer belonging to the
                    Fifth Corps, which corps, at that time, was advancing.</p>
                <p>On the 8th, 9th, and 10th instant nothing of importance transpired. At daylight
                    on the 11th instant the division moved to the position it now occupies.</p>
                <p>Herewith please find inclosed the reports of the brigade commanders.</p>
                <p>The conduct of both officers and men was good.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Respectfully submitted.</salute>
