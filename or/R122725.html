<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson writes Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin in
                    June, 1861, to notify him that planned military movements would leave the
                    Pennsylvania border unprotected. He designates Chambersburg as a town of
                    military importance and suggests the Governor post state troops in the town for
                    an adequate defence. Patterson also discusses the possibility of federalizing
                    state troops in case of an emergency.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>His Excellency A. G. CURTIN,<br> Governor of
                        Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>Hagerstown, Md.,</p>
<p>June 25, 1861.</p>
<p>GOVERNOR:</p>
<p>As in the course of the military operations of the command now in this department
                    this force may be withdrawn form this vicinity and that of Frederick and
                    Cumberland, leaving the frontier of Pennsylvania unprotected, I consider it my
                    duty to notify you, that you may take such steps as may appear to you proper to
                    be prepared to defend your State from encroachment should the offensive be
                    assumed by the insurgents. As you now have a considerable force of reserve
                    troops, which at any moment the General Government might wish to use for common
                    defense, I trust you will pardon me for suggesting that they be posted at points
                    on the frontier of Pennsylvania which to my mind are the most exposed, and from
                    which at any moment, if the Government desired their services, they could be
                    pushed as Federal troops into this State, or sent by rail to other threatened
                    parts of our country. The places of importance in a military point of view are
                    Bedford, Chambersburg, Hanover or Gettysburg, and York. State troops at these
                    points would sustain U. S. forces in Maryland, and check, in case of their being
                    withdrawn, encroachments from Virginia. York has the additional advantage of
                    supporting Hanover, and of being on an easy line of communication with
                    Washington. At all of them a Federal officer, authorized by the Government, can
                    speedily turn the State into Federal troops, and throw them where they may be
                    required.</p>
<p>I respectfully present this subject to your consideration, trusting my views may
                    meet your approbation, and be found to coincide with State policy in authorizing
                    a reserve of State troops.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
