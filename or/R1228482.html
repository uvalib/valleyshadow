<p>His Excellency JOHN LETCHER, Governor of Virginia:</p>
<p>Staunton,</p>
<p>May 15, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>By direction of Maj.-Gen. Lee, I will start to-day the arms, &amp;c.,
                    intended for the Northwest, under escort of Capt. F. F. Sterrett's company of
                    cavalry. I have also, in furtherance of the plan concurred in by Col. F. H.
                    Smith, ordered Capt. Felix H. Hull, who is now here, to proceed at once to
                    Highland and gather two hundred men, including his company, to accompany Capt.
                    Sterrett's command. I have further issued the following orders: to Capt.
                    Moorman, of Pendleton, to repair at once to Monterey with two hundred men, if
                    possible, including his company; to Capts. Stover and McNeil, of Pocahontas, to
                    repair to Huttonsville, each with one hundred and fifty men, if possible,
                    including his company; they severally to unite their commands with Capt.
                    Sterrett's and proceed to Beverly. I have ordered Col. Goff, of the last-named
                    place, to collect the volunteer forces of Randolph and such other force of men
                    as he can gather, and I have directed each and all of these officers to bring
                    with them such supply of arms and ammunition as they could without delay
                    procure. I now respectfully invite you to issue at once to Col. Goff, or such
                    other person as may seem good to you, such orders and directions, with regard to
                    this expedition in aid of the Northwest, as may appear expedient. My aim is that
                    it shall reach its destination (Grafton, of thought proper) at least by the day
                    of election; at this last point it will be in communication by rail with
                    Harper's Ferry and may from thence be re-enforced or vice versa.</p>
<p>I shall also send with the expedition at least a wagon load of bacon, to avoid a
                    possibility of a want of provisions.</p>
<p>Hoping that my action in this matter may meet with your approval, I am,
                        very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN.</p>
