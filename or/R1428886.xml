                <p>A lieutenant and private from the First Confederate Battalion, Davis'
                    (Mississippi) brigade, Heth's division, of Hill's corps, deserted and came into
                    our lines at 3 o'clock this a. m. The substance of their information is as
                    follows: That there are four divisions of the enemy on the south side of the
                    Appomattox River-Anderson's old division and Heth's division, of Hill's corps,
                    and Hoke's and Bushrod Johnson's division, of Beauregard's command; that they
                    are posted from the enemy's right to left as follows: right-Mahone's division, a
                    brigade of which (Finegan's) extends to the left of the Jerusalem plank road;
                    the right of the division extending to the lead-works on the Weldon railroad;
                    next, Heth's division, extending from the left of Mahone's division (a point to
                    the left of and nor far from the Jerusalem plank road) to Clingman's brigade, of
                    Hoke's division, of Beauregard's command; next, Hoke's division, of Beauregard's
                    command, with Clingman's brigade on the right; left-Bushrod Johnson's division,
                    of Beauregard's command; that since the recent fight (July 30) the above
                    disposition of forces was made; that the corps of Longstreet, or two divisions,
                    Field's and Kershaw's, have not returned to our front, and it was understood
                    that all or the greater part of them had been sent to re-enforce Early or Hood;
                    that it was understood in the rebel lines that mining was being done in the
                    vicinity of the position occupied by our colored troops, information of which
                    informant has given to Gen. Warren. The lieutenant saw late Richmond papers
                    giving accounts of our attack on Mobile. They admit the sinking of two of their
                    gunboats; also accounts of the occupation and destruction of Milledgeville, Ga.,
                    by a raiding party from Sherman's army.</p>

                        Staunton, Va. (Friday, July 29), via Lynchburg; also that no trains are
                        running on the Virginia Central Railroad from Richmond Beyond Beaver Dam
