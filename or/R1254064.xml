                <p>Union General Robert Milroy writes Robert Schenck in February, 1863. He proposes
                    moving through Staunton to attempt to capture and destroy Confederate General
                    John Imboden's raiders. Milroy also discusses various aspects of irregular
                    warfare in the Valley, and his desire to deal harshly with guerrillas.</p>

                    <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I omitted to report to you that I did not go to Washington City, for the reason
                    that I received word from the recorder of the McDowell court that the evidence
                    in the case was closed before I received your order, which was detained by Gen.
                    Kelley a day or two.</p>
                <p>The Thirteenth Pennsylvania reported to me for duty a few days ago, and the two
                    companies of the First New York Cavalry, with the two sections of artillery,
                    that were at Romney, reported here two days ago.</p>
                <p>The rebel cavalry still annoy us some. A squad of 15, captured the stage 7 miles
                    from this place, on the road to Martinsburg, on Friday night last, soon after
                    dark. Capt. Charles W. Dietrich, assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut. William
                    Burchard, aide-de-camp of Gen. Cluseret, 2 soldiers, and 3 citizen, including 2
                    females, were in the stage. Lieut. Burchard fortunately escaped soon after his
                    capture; came on, and let me know what had happened, and I made such a
                    disposition of my cavalry as to intercept them; killed 1, wounded 1, and
                    captured 2, and rescued all our prisoners, horses, plunder, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>I learned yesterday by a deserter from Imboden's camp that he has been to
                    Richmond recently, and been commissioned brigadier-general, and that he had got
                    the old Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first Virginia Regiment, raised in Western
                    Virginia (and which I met several times there), and has been assigned command of
                    the country east of the Shenandoah Mountains, and its preparing for a campaign
                    into West Virginia. I respectfully ask to be permitted to interfere with this
                    arrangement. If Gen. Moor will advance on Imboden by way of Huntersville and
                    Warm Springs, and Mulligan will advance from New Creek, by way of Petersburg, to
                    Franklin, and I move on him up the Valley, by Staunton (brushing Jones out of
                    the way), his forces can all be gobbled up, the base of guerrillas and raids
                    into West Virginia effectually cut off, and permanent peace given to that
                    region.</p>
                <p>I respectfully ask that my whole command may be assembled at this place, and that
                    the injunction on my movements be moved. If this cannot be done soon, I will be
                    compelled to resign, as I would much prefer being a private in an active
                    fighting army to being kept in command of the stationary advance of a railroad
                    guard under a brigadier-general not of a very hostile or pugnacious disposition
                    toward traitors.</p>
                <p>My scouts captured a rebel conscripting lieutenant yesterday, who has been a
                    notorious bushwhacker, horse-thief, and murderer, known to have killed 2 of
                    Banks' men in cold blood. What shall I do with him? I would like to hang him if
                    Jefferson Davis and Halleck did not make too big a fuss about it. He richly
                    deserves it.</p>
                <p>I would be pleased if I could be trusted to regulate the trade with the citizens
                    of this place and vicinity.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,</salute>
