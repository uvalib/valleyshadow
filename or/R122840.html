<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Staunton, VA, served as a Confederate recruiting and supply center early in the
                    war. In this May, 1861, letter, Robert E. Lee writes General Thomas J. Jackson
                    concerning recruiting in western Virginia. Lee also promises to send Jackson
                    arms and ammunition from Staunton.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Col. T. J. JACKSON, Commanding, &amp;c., Harper's
                        Ferry, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 14, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>I am very much concerned at the condition of things and the failure to procure
                    volunteers for the service of the State in the country west of you. One thousand
                    stand of arms and some ammunition will be sent to-morrow, under the charge of
                    troop of cavalry, from Staunton to Beverly, Randolph county, for the use of Col.
                    Porterfield. This troop is to collect together volunteers from the well-affected
                    portions of the country through which it passes. If your condition is such as to
                    allow it, I would like you to send some aid to Col. Porterfield; but I am
                    unwilling for you to send a man, if by so doing you endanger yourself in the
                    least. Re-enforcements are being sent to you.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
