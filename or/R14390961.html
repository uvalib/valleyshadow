<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Assistant Adjutant John Schultze writes from Chambersburg in August, 1864,
                    to Captain William Burgess, stationed with his volunteer state militia on roads
                    throughout Pennsylvania. Schultze notifies Burgess of a Confederate withdrawal
                    from the Potomac, and authorizes him to disband his command.</p>

<p>Capt. WILLIAM BURGESS,<br> Loudon, Pa.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>August 29, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>The commanding general directs me to inform you that present indications are that
                    the enemy are falling back from the Potomac River. If you have an organization
                    of men on the roads, as suggested in my last communication to you, you can
                    relieve it from duty at present. If you can do it, it would be advisable to keep
                    your organization up, subject to be called out at short notice. We will keep you
                    informed of any movements of the rebels in that direction.</p>
<p>I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. S. SCHULTZE,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
