<p>Capt. GEORGE EYSTER:</p>
<p>SAINT CLAIRSVILLE, BEDFORD COUNTY, PA.,</p>
<p>June 5, 1863.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I must inform you that I commenced enrolling yesterday and I met with resistance.
                    The first half day that I was out four men declined to give me the age of their
                    sons, and said that there was no law to make another draft, and that it was
                    unconstitutional, and if they were drafted they would use powder and lead. The
                    same night my saw-mill was set on fire and burned to ashes, which is a loss to
                    me of at least $600 with the other property that was on it.</p>
<p>I have declined to make the enrollment for the reason that I think that my family
                    and the balance of my property would not be safe. I think the Government should
                    make up my loss, as I was employed by it. I would not risk my life and property
                    and make the enrollment for $1,000.</p>
<p>Please write soon and direct to Saint Clairsville, Bedford County, Pa.</p>
<p>Yours, truly,</p>
<p>HENRY ICKES,<br> Esquire.</p>
