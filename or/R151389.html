<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Major R. G. Cole writes General Henry Jackson in November, 1861, concerning troop
                    movements in the Staunton vicinity.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HDQRS. NORTHWEST ARMY,</p>
<p>Gen. H. R. JACKSON,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Warm Springs, Va.,</p>
<p>November 25, 1861.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I am directed by the commanding general to say that he is this moment in receipt
                    of your letter advising of the telegram to move four regiments to Manassas. A
                    letter of recent date informed him that they would be moved only when it was
                    deemed that they could be spared from this army. Information of their approach
                    so near to Staunton for the purpose of going to Winchester has probably
                    determined the telegram. In view of the necessity of troops at Manassas he
                    thinks it best to order the regiments at once. You will therefore direct the
                    four regiments now at Monterey to proceed to Manassas, taking with them the
                    necessary camp equipage and ammunition.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. G. COLE,<br> Maj., &amp;c.</p>
