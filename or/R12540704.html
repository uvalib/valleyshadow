<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones writes General John Imboden, commanding at
                    Staunton, regarding Imboden's plans for an April, 1863, raid into West Virginia.
                    Jones reports sending an engineer to Staunton to assist Imboden's planned
                    attempt to destroy the Cheat River bridge.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Shenandoah Mountain:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>April 4, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 1st instant was received only a few moments since.</p>
<p>The necessary orders will be immediately given to Col. Patton. The Fifty-fourth
                    and Fiftieth Virginia Regiments having been ordered out of my department (the
                    Fiftieth will go to Gen. Lee as soon as transportation is provided), I shall not
                    be able to send George M. Edgar's battalion with Col. Patton. As the Fiftieth,
                    which is as large as the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first together, goes to Gen.
                    Lee, I take it for granted he will send the two latter to you. I have written to
                    him that he may count with certainty on receiving the Fiftieth. Col. W. L.
                    Jackson has a regiment collected, and the field officers will be elected and the
                    organization completed before you start. Something over 200 of his men are now
                    in the lower end of Pocahontas; most of them are of the Virginia State Line, are
                    armed, and have seen service. I will direct Col. Jackson to join you and act
                    under your orders. I saw him yesterday, and told him of my intention to send him
                    with you on the expedition. He is at the Warm Springs, and I wish you to
                    communicate with him.</p>
<p>Inform me if Gen. Lee has sent the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first to you. If he
                    has not, write and urge him to do so. The Fiftieth will be with him before
                    Hooker will move.</p>
<p>My engineer and his party will leave here for Staunton on the 9th or 10th
                    instant.</p>
<p>Very respectfully and truly,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
