<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Benjamin F. Kelley writes to Chief of Staff Cullum concerning
                    November, 1863, plans for an advance into the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. CULLUM,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>CUMBERLAND, MD.,</p>
<p>November 29, 1863--9 p. m.<br> (Received 10.25 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Gen.-in-Chief's telegram of this date received. I have been anxiously
                    awaiting the movements of Gen. Meade, hoping that he would be able to drive
                    Lee's army from Gordonsville and Charlottesville, in which event I could move my
                    force up the Valley of the South Branch of the Shenandoah and occupy Staunton,
                    and hold a line west from that point running through Covington, in Alleghany
                    County, and Lewisburg, in Greenbrier County, and thence to the mouth of Gauley,
                    and thereby shorten my present line several hundred miles; but if you deem your
                    information reliable, and think it best to do so, I can send Gen. Averell, with
                    his whole force, by way of Franklin, Monterey, Covington, and Fincastle, and
                    strike the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at Salem, in Roanoke, or Bonsack's
                    Station, in Botetourt, or both points. I can also, if you approve, send Gen.
                    Duffie, with his two regiments of cavalry, from Kanawha, via Fayetteville and
                    Raleigh Court-House, and strike the railroad at points between Wytheville and
                    Christiansburg at the same time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>B. F. KELLEY,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
