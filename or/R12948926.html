<p> Capt. T. MELVIN, Assistant Adjutant-General.</p>
<p>Martinsburg, W. Va.,</p>
<p>December 31, 1863.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my brigade
                    since the date of its arrival at New Creek, W. Va., November 18:</p>
<p>Having been notified by the brigadier-general commanding the department that
                    active service would be expected of me very soon, measures were at once taken to
                    place the command in as good condition as possible, but owing to the meager
                    supplies of horse-shoes, nails, coal, and forges furnished, and the shortness of
                    the time allowed, the mounted forces of the brigade were but poorly prepared to
                    make a long march on the 6th of December, when I received orders to move on the
                    8th. A copy of my instructions is appended to this report. My orders did not
                    contemplate the movement of any co-operative forces, excepting a small force
                    under Colonel Thoburn, but after representing to the department commander the
                    importance of such movements, and my desire that they should be made, he kindly
                    invited me to accompany him to his headquarters at Cumberland, and arrange a
                    plan for them. I went with him to Cumberland on the evening of the 6th, and drew
                    up a plan which was, briefly, as follows, viz:</p>
<p>Brigadier Scammon, commanding forces in the Kanawha Valley, to be at Lewisburg on
                    Saturday, December 12; to look out northward and endeavor to intercept the enemy
                    from that direction; to remain until 18th, taking advantage of any opportunity
                    to strike the enemy in the direction of Union or elsewhere. Colonel Moor to be
                    at Marling's Bottom, Friday, December 11; to feel the enemy in the direction of
                    Lewisburg on the 12th and 13th; to remain near Frankford until the 18th, and on
                    his return to bring off the wounded left after the battle of Droop Mountain.
                    Brigadier-General Sullivan, commanding forces in the Shenandoah Valley, to be at
                    Woodstock on Friday, December 11; to make careful demonstrations until the 18th,
                    when he was to move toward Staunton, and threaten the same boldly on the 20th
                    and 21st. The command of Colonel Thoburn was to turn off at Monterey, and,
                    moving toward Staunton, keep the attention of the enemy fixed upon the
                    Parkersburg pike.</p>
<p>A copy of the above plan was given to the department commander, and I received
                    his promise that his orders should be given in accordance with it, with the
                    exception of Moor's and Thoburn's commands, which were to receive orders from
                    me. It was thought that between the two demonstrations of the Kanawha and
                    Shenandoah forces, I might pass the enemy's lines without delay, and that the
                    threatening of Staunton on the 20th and 21st, with the operations in the
                    direction of Union, would divert the enemy from offering any great resistance to
                    the return of my fatigued command.</p>
<p>The Second West Virginia Mounted Infantry, Lieutenant Colonel Scott; Third West
                    Virginia Mounted Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson; Eighth West Virginia
                    Mounted Infantry, Colonel Oley; Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Lieutenant
                    Colonel Blakely; Major Gibson's battalion of cavalry, and Ewing's battery set
                    out from New Creek on the morning of the 8th of December, with fair weather, but
                    with many misgivings on account of our poor condition to overcome the weary
                    distances and confront the perils incident to such an expedition.</p>
<p>During the march of two days to Petersburg, constant exertions were made to
                    complete the shoeing of the horses, but lack of means and material rendered it
                    impracticable to attain the desired object. At Petersburg, on the 10th, the
                    command of Colonel Thoburn, about 700 strong, joined mine, and together we
                    proceeded southward, arriving nearly at Monterey on the 11th. The most of my
                    train was placed in charge of Colonel Thoburn, and, on the morning of the 12th,
                    my command and his started in a severe and discouraging rain-storm, Thoburn
                    toward McDowell and my command down Back Creek.</p>
<p>The secluded road which runs along and across this now swollen stream was pursued
                    the ensuing day without any incident worthy of note until our arrival at
                    Gatewood's, where the rear guard of Jackson's forces, flying from the advance of
                    Moor, was encountered and dispersed, and 4 wagons destroyed, loaded with
                    ammunition and stores.</p>
<p>The storm continued on the 14th, and Jackson's River was found hardly fordable.
                    Upon arriving at Callaghan's, reports reached us that Scammon had advanced and
                    occupied Lewisburg, and that the rebel forces, commanded by General Echols, had
                    retired toward Union, under orders from Maj. Gen. Sam. Jones. We halted a few
                    hours to rest and feed the animals, and to make a false advance in the direction
                    of Covington.</p>
<p>At 2 a. m., December 15, the column was in motion upon a dark and difficult road,
                    which runs up Dunlap Creek to the pike, connecting the White with the Sweet
                    Sulphur Springs. We reached the beautiful valley of the Sweet Sulphur about 10
                    a. m., and halted two hours, availing ourselves of the plentiful forage found
                    there.</p>
<p>It may not be unimportant to note that all the springs in Western Virginia are
                    excellently well suited for quartering troops; the buildings are numerous,
                    spacious, and symmetrical; the main roads approaching them are reliable at all
                    seasons. At each of the springs I have visited (Warm Springs, Hot Springs, White
                    Sulphur, Red Sulphur, and Sweet Springs), at least 5,000 troops may find
                    comfortable, even elegant quarters. The grade upon the Virginia Central Railroad
                    is nearly finished from Millborough to the Greenbrier River. When rails are laid
                    upon that portion, and a few small bridges built, forces at the springs could be
                    easily and conveniently supplied via Charlottesville.</p>
<p>At the Sweet Springs it was learned that Echols' forces were encamped 4 miles
                    from Union, to the northward, and that General Scammon had retired from
                    Lewisburg. The road to New Castle was taken at 1 p. m., and near the summit of
                    the Sweet Springs Mountain a rebel quartermaster met us and was captured, which
                    assured me that our advance was unknown as yet to the enemy.</p>
<p>From the top of this mountain a sublime spectacle was presented to us. Seventy
                    miles to the eastward the Peaks of Otter reared their summits above the Blue
                    Ridge, and all the space between was filled with a billowing ocean of hills and
                    mountains, while behind us the great Alleghanies, coming from the north with the
                    grandeur of innumerable tints, swept past and faded in the southern horizon.</p>
<p>When within 12 miles of New Castle another halt was made to feed and rest, while
                    a squadron advanced toward Fincastle, conveying to the enemy a false impression,
                    and bringing to us 60 horses and some prisoners. New Castle was passed during
                    the night, and efforts were made to reach Salem by daylight in the morning. A
                    party of rebels, under Captain Chapman, reconnoitered our advance during the
                    night, and all were captured except their leader, who, declining to surrender,
                    was killed.</p>
<p>The head of my column was preceded by vigilant scouts, armed with repeating
                    rifles, mounted upon fleet horses, who permitted no one to go ahead of them. We
                    approached Salem unheralded, and the whistling of locomotives could be heard
                    from that point long before it was reached by us.</p>
<p>Four miles from Salem, a party of rebels from the town, in quest of information
                    concerning the Yankees, met us. From some of these it was learned that the
                    division of General Fitzhugh Lee had left Charlottesville on the 14th to
                    intercept my command, and that a train loaded with troops was momentarily
                    expected at Salem to guard the stores at that point. I hastened with my advance,
                    consisting of about 350 men and two 3-inch guns, through the town to the depot.
                    The telegraph wires were first cut--the operator was not to be found, the
                    railroad track torn up in the vicinity of the depot, one gun placed in battery,
                    and the advance dismounted and placed in readiness for the expected train of
                    troops. An inspection and estimate of the stores contained in the depot and two
                    large buildings adjacent were made, and upon a subsequent comparison of notes
                    taken, found to be as follows:</p>
<p>Two thousand barrels of flour, 10,000 bushels of wheat, 100,000 bushels of
                    shelled corn, 50,000 bushels of oats, 2,000 barrels of meat, several cords of
                    leather, 1,000 sacks of salt, 31 boxes of clothing, 20 bales of cotton, a large
                    amount of harness, shoes, saddles, equipments, tools, oil, tar, and various
                    other stores, and 100 wagons.</p>
<p>A train from Lynchburg, loaded with troops, soon approached. My main body was not
                    yet in sight, and it was necessary to stop the train; a shot was fired at it
                    from one of the guns, which missed; a second went through the train diagonally,
                    which caused it to retire, and a third and last shot hastened its movements. My
                    main body arrived, and parties were sent 4 miles to the eastward and 12 miles to
                    the westward, to destroy the road.</p>
<p>The depots with their contents were burned; three cars standing upon the track,
                    the water-station, turn-table, and a large pile of bridge timber and repairing
                    material destroyed. Five bridges were burned, and the track torn up and
                    destroyed as much as possible in six hours. The "yanks" with which we had
                    provided ourselves proved too weak to twist the U-rails, and efforts were made
                    to bend them, by heating the centers, with but partial success. A few small
                    storehouses, containing leather and other valuable articles, were destroyed in
                    the vicinity. The telegraph wires were cut, coiled, and burned for over half a
                    mile.</p>
<p>Private property was untouched by my command, and the citizens received us with
                    politeness. It was intimated to some inquisitive ones that we were going back by
                    Buchanan, but about 4 p. m. my command quitted the work of destruction and
                    returned upon the road it came some 7 miles, when it halted for the night. The
                    last 80 miles had been marched in about thirty hours. Little sleep had been
                    enjoyed by my men during five days and nights; it was necessary to pause and
                    collect our energies for the return. During the night of the 16th it rained
                    heavily, and also the ensuing day and night. My column was caught in the many
                    windings of Craig's Creek, which was now swollen to a dangerous torrent, which
                    uprooted trees and carried them away. Heavy caissons were swept down the stream,
                    and great exertion and skill were required to save them. In the river and in the
                    rain forty-eight hours, it was impracticable to keep our ammunition dry, and my
                    command, drenched, muddy, and hungry, arrived at New Castle about sundown on the
                    18th, in miserable condition to make the march before us.</p>
<p>Information that Fitzhugh Lee was at Fincastle reached me at New Castle, and that
                    Jones was between me and the Sweet Springs. At 9 p. m., while a false advance
                    was made toward Fincastle, my column took the road to the Sweet Springs. We soon
                    encountered and drove the enemy's pickets about 12 miles to the junction of the
                    road with the Fincastle pike to the Sweet Springs. The command halted and built
                    camp fires.</p>
<p>The condition of my ammunition made it prudent for me to avoid a fight. It was
                    evident from a survey of the enemy's positions that I could not get to the Sweet
                    Springs without a contest, and that with Lee only a few miles to my right and
                    rear. Two ways were left, both difficult and obscure; one to the southwest,
                    leading around Jones' right, through Monroe and Greenbrier Counties; the other,
                    northeast to the Covington and Fincastle pike, which I took, as it was the most
                    direct and dangerous, consequently the safest, if I could only make the march.</p>
<p>We left our camp fires burning and went forward in the darkest and coldest night
                    we had yet experienced. Thirty miles through the forest and frost brought us to
                    the Fincastle pike about noon of the 19th. It was yet 15 miles to the bridge.
                    The river was reported unfordable on account of the depth of the water and the
                    obstructions formed by the ice. I had carefully calculated the possible marches
                    of the enemy, and felt certain that we could make the march through the points
                    they deemed most secure, but no halt could be made.</p>
<p>When 8 miles from the river a force of 300 mounted rebels opposed our advance. As
                    soon as they were broken they were closely pursued at a gallop to the first
                    bridge, 5 miles below Covington, and thence to the bridge at Covington, both of
                    which were saved from destruction, although faggots had been piled upon them
                    ready to burn. The head of my column reached the first bridge about 9 p. m., and
                    3 officers and 6 orderlies were sent back to keep it closed up.</p>
<p>The approach to the river is through a gorge which opens to the stream a mile
                    below the first bridge. There the pike from Covington passes along the right
                    bank to Clifton Forge and Jackson's River Depot, where Jackson was supposed to
                    be with about 1,000 men. I sent a company upon the road to Clifton Forge, with
                    orders to dismount and move out three-fourths of a mile, and hold the road until
                    the column had passed.</p>
<p>A captured dispatch from Maj. Gen. Sam. Jones to Major-General Early, at
                    Millborough, confirmed my opinion with regard to the position of the enemy, and
                    gave me the information that General Early's division had been added to the
                    forces opposed to my return.</p>
<p>The dispatch is as follows:<br> ON TOP OF THE SWEET SPRINGS MOUNTAIN,<br>
                    December 19, 1863---7 a. m.<br> GENERAL:</p>
<p>The enemy drove in the pickets about 12 miles from here, near Mrs. Scott's, in
                    the direction of New Castle, about 2 o'clock this morning General Echols has a
                    strong position here, and I think can effectually block this way to them. To
                    avoid him, I think it probable that the enemy may attempt to escape by Covington
                    or by Clifton Forge. Colonel Jackson's troops are at Clifton Forge. I would
                    suggest, instead of keeping any force at the Warm Springs, you would place it at
                    Morns Hill, and picket at Callaghan's. I presume that you are in communication
                    with Colonel Jackson, and he may be able to give you information of the enemy's
                    movements. I expect to ascertain the enemy's movements in the course of the
                    morning. If he attempts to avoid Echols here, and escape by Callaghan's, we can
                    reach Callaghan's before he can. Echols will hold this place here until he
                    ascertains the enemy's movements. It is possible that they will attempt to pass
                    Echols' right by Gap Mills, by passing one of the many gorges in these mountains
                    to the south of this position between Echols and McCausland, who is at Newport,
                    in Giles County. If he does that, he will pass out by the western portion of
                    Monroe and Greenbrier; if he does so, you cannot touch him.</p>
<p>Under all the circumstances of the case, as I see them now, I think that you
                    should have a force at Morris Hill and a strong picket at Callaghan's. The enemy
                    were certainly at New Castle at sundown yesterday. They cannot pass Echols here.
                    They may escape by Clifton Forge or by Covington, if you do not prevent them.
                    Echols will give you all the aid that he can. We are closer to the enemy than
                    you are, and will be more likely to know their movements. I will endeavor to
                    keep you informed. A portion of our small mounted force has been directed, if
                    the enemy attempts to pass from New Castle direct to Covington or by Clifton
                    Forge, to fall back in front of them, so as to give to Colonel Jackson and you
                    the earliest information.<br> SAM. JONES,<br> Major-General.</p>
<p>The operator at Jackson's River will use every effort to get the above to General
                    Early and a copy to Colonel Jackson. Colonel Jackson must have a copy of
                    it.<br> SAM. JONES,<br> Major-General.</p>
<p>I relied somewhat upon the demonstration which was to be made against Staunton on
                    the next day. I also thought that General Scammon might divert the force under
                    Echols from interfering with mine. In both these trusts I was at fault. From all
                    the information I have been able to collect, I believe the Kanawha force retired
                    from Lewisburg on the 13th, without waiting until the 18th, as prearranged, and
                    without making an effort in the direction of Union. The detachment sent from the
                    command of General Sullivan was too feeble to make the threat upon Staunton of
                    sufficient avail to keep Early from besetting my command upon its return.
                    Instead of approaching Staunton on the 20th and 21st, it was retiring through
                    New Market on the 20th.</p>
<p>The dispositions of the rebels had been prompt and skillful; Rosser's brigade had
                    crossed the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg, on the 14th, made some
                    demonstrations upon the Orange and Alexandria Railroad near Bull Run; thence
                    passed the Blue Ridge through Ashby's Gap; were stopped by the high water in the
                    Shenandoah, and moved up by Front Royal to cut off the detachment from Harper's
                    Ferry. The division of Early left Hanover Junction on the 15th; arrived at
                    Staunton the same night; marched to Buffalo Gap the ensuing day, and thence to
                    the Warm Springs and Millborough. Fitzhugh Lee's division, leaving
                    Charlottesville on the 14th, came diverted by the detachment from Sullivan's
                    command, for a day or two, when it set out for Buchanan.</p>
<p>At Jackson's River, though trusting in the co-operation of the Kanawha and
                    Shenandoah forces, I acted as though they would be of no assistance to me, which
                    was indeed the case. My column, nearly 4 miles long, was hastened across the
                    first bridge. When all had passed but my ambulances, a few wagons, and a
                    regiment in the rear, an attack was made by Jackson's force.</p>
<p>The company on the Clifton Forge road was driven away; three ambulances were
                    captured, and an effort was made to take the bridge, which was unsuccessful. A
                    night attack is always appalling, even to experienced troops. Unavailing efforts
                    were made to open communication with the regiment cut off until morning, when it
                    appeared that the enemy was determined to maintain his position upon the high
                    cliffs which overlooked the bridge.</p>
<p>During the night the balance of my command had been concentrated at Callaghan's,
                    and an efficient defense established upon all the roads approaching that point.
                    Finding it impossible to dislodge the enemy as long as the bridges remained, I
                    directed them to be destroyed. The enemy at once left the cliffs and endeavored
                    to reach the flank and rear of the regiment which remained on that side.</p>
<p>Orders were sent to the regiment to swim the river or come to me over the
                    mountain, around the bend; and, after destroying the train, it swam the river,
                    with the loss of 4 men drowned. When nearly across, a formal demand from General
                    Early was received by the officer commanding the rear guard to surrender,
                    addressed to the commanding officer of the United States forces. As my column
                    was then in motion over the Alleghanies, no formal reply was returned to the
                    demand.</p>
<p>During the night attack, 5 officers and 119 men were lost by being captured. It
                    was thought that had the regiment in rear been advanced steadily forward, these
                    captures might have been mostly prevented, and we should not have been obliged
                    to destroy our wagons and ambulances the following day.</p>
<p>The road over the Alleghanies led us to Antony's Creek, between the White Sulphur
                    Springs and Huntersville.</p>
<p>A force of the enemy was reported at Gatewood's, which is 12 miles east of
                    Huntersville. My command was yet 30 miles from that point. If I could cross the
                    Greenbrier and reach Marling's Bottom before the enemy, my command would be
                    safe. By a very obscure road the Greenbrier was reached and crossed on the 21st
                    opposite Hillsborough, and we encamped for the night at the northern base of
                    Droop Mountain. My scouts thrown out kept me informed of the enemy's movements
                    and positions. For thirty hours after my column left Callaghan's, the enemy made
                    great efforts to intercept my force, but they generally took wrong roads. The
                    citizens who knew the country best regarded our capture as unavoidable. It was
                    expected, as may be seen from the orders given Colonel Moor by me, that he would
                    remain near Droop Mountain until the 18th, but owing to orders he received from
                    the general commanding the department, subsequent to the reception of mine, he
                    also retired on the 14th, thus leaving no co-operative forces, except Colonel
                    Thoburn's, in the positions I had reason to expect them to be on the 20th and
                    21st. Unaided, with a weary command of 2,500 men, I had marched through a
                    difficult country, in which not less than 12,000 rebels were maneuvered to
                    effect my capture.</p>
<p>On the way to Edray my rear guard experienced some trifling attacks on the 22d.
                    The road thence to Beverly was a glacier, which was traversed with great
                    difficulty and peril. The artillery was drawn almost entirely by dismounted men
                    during the 23d and 24th.</p>
<p>Couriers had been sent forward to Beverly to bring out subsistence and forage,
                    which we succeeded, after extreme hardships, in meeting on the 24th.</p>
<p>The officers and men undertook all that was required of them, and endured all the
                    sufferings from fatigue, hunger, and cold with extraordinary fortitude, even
                    with cheerfulness. The march of 400 miles, which was concluded at Beverly, was
                    the most difficult I have ever seen performed. The endurance of the men and
                    horses was taxed to the utmost, yet there was no rest for them.</p>
<p>Believing that some retaliatory operations would be at once inaugurated by the
                    enemy, I telegraphed to the general commanding department that I thought it
                    advisable to get my command into the valley as soon as possible, and set out for
                    Webster, whence, by means of the railroad, I arrived at Martinsburg just in time
                    to confront the enemy, who was advancing toward this place.</p>
<p>I desire to mention the names of my staff officers, to whom I am greatly indebted
                    for their thoughtful and untiring aid to me throughout this expedition: Capt.
                    Will. Rumsey, assistant adjutant-general and aide-de-camp; Lieut. L. Markbriet,
                    acting assistant adjutant general; Capt. W. H. Brown, assistant quartermaster;
                    Lieut. H. N. Harrison, acting assistant engineer; Capt. L. A. Myers, provost
                    marshal; Lieut. H. Koenigsberger, acting commissary of subsistence; Lieut. G. H.
                    North, ordnance officer, and Surg. W. D. Stewart, medical director. The services
                    of Lieut. J. R. Meigs, Engineers, and of his assistant, Henry Topping, esq.,
                    were invaluable to me.</p>
<p>In concluding my report, I beg leave to thank the honorable Secretary of War for
                    his kindness in directing the Quartermaster's payment to furnish the men of my
                    command, engaged in the recent expedition, with a suit of clothing gratis. No
                    necessity was ever more pressing, or more promptly supplied; no charity more
                    timely, or more gratefully received.</p>
<p>I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brigadier-General.</p>
