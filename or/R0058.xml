                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this corps
                    at the battle of Gettysburg and subsequently, until its arrival at Warrenton
                    Junction:</p>
                <p>July 1.--The operations of this day are fully set forth in Maj. Gen. Abner
                    Doubleday's report, who commanded the corps in the bloody and important battle
                    which inaugurated the three days' fighting at Gettysburg.</p>
                <p>July 2.--In obedience to an order from Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac, dated July 1,
                    I reported in person to the general commanding, at the cemetery gate, early in
                    the morning of this day, and assumed command of the First Corps. I found the
                    First Division (Brig.- Gen. Wadsworth) occupying the high wooded hill and slopes
                    immediately on the right of Gen. Howard's position on Cemetery Hill, an
                    important position, from which it was not detached during the subsequent
                    operations at Gettysburg. Maj.-Gen. Doubleday's (Third) division was in reserve
                    behind the Eleventh Corps on Cemetery Hill. Brig.-Gen. Robinson's (Second)
                    division was likewise posted on the Cemetery Hill, but on the left of the
                    Eleventh Corps, and facing to the left in the position afterward occupied by the
                    Second Corps. The artillery of the corps, except one battery with the First
                    Division, was posted on Cemetery Hill, and was not detached from this position
                    during all the subsequent fighting. Beyond an occasional shot at the moving
                    columns of the enemy, everything remained quiet until the afternoon, when the
                    enemy opened a brisk cannonade on my position, which was vigorously and
                    effectively returned.</p>
                <p>Near sundown I was summoned to move my troops in haste to fill a gap in the line
                    on the left of the Second Corps, into which the enemy was on the point of
                    entering. Notwithstanding the inconvenient positions of the Second and Third
                    Divisions, these were quickly filed into the new position in time to stay the
                    progress of the enemy, who relinquished their attempt on our appearance. I was
                    deeply gratified at the promptitude with which these divisions moved at this
                    critical period, their movement not consuming one-half the time it would have
                    taken on drill. During this movement, the right wing of the Thirteenth Vermont,
                    under Col. Randall, charged upon the enemy, retook four of our guns, and
                    captured two guns and 80 prisoners from them. Two more of our guns were retaken
                    by the Second Brigade, Third Division.</p>
                <p>Night coming on, and active operations closing here for the day, parties were
                    sent to the front to bring in such guns as had been left. They were successful
                    to some extent, but the number thus reclaimed has never been reported. The
                    Second Division was sent back to Cemetery Hill, to support the Eleventh Corps,
                    which was threatened by the enemy. The First Division was vigorously attacked
                    about sundown by the enemy, who were handsomely repulsed. One brigade of the
                    Twelfth Corps, on their right, participated in this action. The position of the
                    Eleventh Corps was attacked about the same time, the enemy succeeding in some
                    instances in getting into the batteries, from which they were driven by the
                    cannoneers themselves.</p>
                <p>July 3.--The dawn of day found the position of the First Corps as follows: The
                    First Division as before reported; the Second Division on Cemetery Hill, ready
                    to support the Eleventh Corps or the Second Corps; the Third Division on the
                    left center and adjoining the left of Gen. Hancock's position. Between the left
                    of the Third Division and Gen. Sykes' position on the left (an interval by my
                    estimate of over half a mile), there were no troops in position. I reported this
                    fact immediately to the general commanding, who authorized me to go to Gen.
                    Sedgwick, on the extreme left, and obtain troops from him to fill this gap.
                    While proceeding on this mission, I encountered Caldwell's division, of the
                    Second Corps, not then forming part of Gen. Hancock's line of battle, and with
                    this officer's consent I put it in position on the left of the Third Division,
                    First Corps. Gen. Sedgwick could only spare me the First New Jersey brigade
                    (Gen. Torbert), which was placed in position on the left of Gen. Caldwell. My
                    own batteries, occupying important positions in the center and right center,
                    might not with propriety be removed, and I therefore applied and obtained
                    permission to call upon the Artillery Reserve for batteries.</p>
                <p>By about 12 o'clock I considered my line between the left of Gen. Hancock's and
                    the right of Gen. Sykes' as very secure, having in position the infantry above
                    mentioned, batteries from the Artillery Reserve, from the Third Corps, and one
                    battery from the Sixth Corps.</p>
                <p>I must mention that the Third Corps, under Maj.-Gen. Birney, which had suffered
                    severely in the previous day's fight, I found posted directly in rear of my line
                    of battle, and I made arrangements with Gen. Birney to draw upon him for such
                    support as might be needed; and I take advantage of this opportunity to express
                    my obligations for the cheerful and handsome manner in which he responded to
                    every call made upon him.</p>
                <p>Near 1 p. m. the enemy opened with about one hundred and twenty guns upon the
                    position of the army, and kept up an incessant fire for a long period. This was
                    intended to demoralize our troops and to cover the onset of their assaulting
                    columns. They failed in their first object, our troops sustaining this terrific
                    fire with admirable equanimity. At length their columns of attack began to move;
                    one heavy column, a division, by Gen. Stannard's report, marching by battalion
                    front, directed itself upon the front of the Third (Doubleday's) Division, First
                    Corps, but meeting with a warm fire from his front line of battle, composed of
                    the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Sixteenth Vermont Regt.'s, the Twentieth New
                    York State Militia, and the One hundred and fifty-first Pennsylvania Volunteers,
                    swerved to the right to attack Gen. Hancock. Gen. Stannard immediately changed
                    front forward, and, falling upon their flank, routed them, ttaking a large
                    number of prisoners. This had hardly been done, when another column, attempting
                    the left of Gen. Doubleday's front, was attacked in flank in a similar way and
                    nearly the whole column killed, wounded, or captured. For these brilliant
                    episodes of the battle, I respectfully call the attention of the general
                    commanding to the reports of Maj.-Gen. Doubleday and Brig.-Gen. Stannard.</p>
                <p>I wish to call particular attention to the conduct of the regiments above
                    mentioned, and to the skillful manner in which they were handled on this day, as
                    being greatly instrumental in overthrowing the enemy's grand attack and in
                    gaining for us a glorious victory. Brig.-Gen. Stannard, who was wounded the day
                    before, refused to quit the field, and highly distinguished himself by his
                    coolness and skill. Maj.-Gen. Doubleday narrowly escaped with his life, having
                    suffered a severe contusion from a fragment of a shell.</p>
                <p>With the first movement of the assaulting column of the enemy, I called upon Gen.
                    Birney for troops to form a reserve, first for one and subsequently for another
                    division, which were promptly sent. With a portion of these troops I re-enforced
                    Gen. Hancock, who was severely pressed by heavy masses of the enemy, holding the
                    remainder in readiness to fall upon the enemy should they succeed in penetrating
                    our lines--a contingency which fortunately did not occur. The Second Division,
                    under Gen. Robinson, was moved to sustain Gen. Hancock's right, but did not
                    become engaged. The First Division was also not engaged. The batteries of the
                    corps, in common with the other batteries in position, vigorously and
                    effectively replied to the enemy's cannonading on this day. After the repulse of
                    the enemy's attack (Gen. Hancock having been wounded), I was placed in command
                    of the line connecting Gen. Sykes with Gen. Howard.</p>
                <p>I conclude this report of the battle of Gettysburg by paying my tribute to the
                    gallant and efficient conduct of the staff: Capt. Craig W. Wadsworth, additional
                    aide-de-camp; Capt. John S. Bliss, Sixty-seventh New York Volunteers,
                    aide-de-camp, severely wounded; Lieut. H. W. Jackson, Fourth New Jersey
                    Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Lieut. Col. H. C. Bankhead, assistant
                    inspector-general; Lieut.-Col. Sanderson, commissary of subsistence, and First
                    Lieut. H. C. Egbert, Twelfth U. S. Infantry, commissary of musters. Col.
                    Wainwright, the chief of artillery of the corps; Capt. Stevens, Fifth Maine
                    Battery; Capt. Reynolds, Battery L, First New York Artillery; Capt. Cooper,
                    Battery B, First Pennsylvania; Capt. Hall, Second Maine Battery, and Lieut.
                    Stewart, Battery B, Fourth U. S. Artillery, all displayed the greatest gallantry
                    throughout the engagements of the three days.</p>
                <p>Surg. J. Theodore Heard, medical director, and Surg. T. H. Bache, medical
                    inspector, remained in the town of Gettysburg during its occupation by the
                    enemy, and deserve the highest praise for their zealous and unremitting
                    attention to the wounded.</p>
                <p>July 4, the troops maintained the same position. The day was devoted to
                    collecting and caring for the wounded.</p>
