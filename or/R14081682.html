<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Lewis Harvie, President of the Danville and Richmond Railroad, writes Confederate
                    Secretary of War James Seddon in June, 1864, to express his fear that Federal
                    troops will be able to take the railroad. He reports on the inadequate defenses
                    at Staunton and other places.</p>

<p>Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON:</p>
<p>CHULA,</p>
<p>June 22, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unless troops are sent to the protection of the railroad I consider it as
                    completely at the mercy of the enemy. There will be some show of fight at ---,
                    but with 300 men and such guns as are there it could only last a short time. At
                    Flat Creek nothing of any moment has been done for its protection. At Staunton a
                    few days since there were only 250 men, and they reserves, and six guns only
                    carrying shot 1,000 yards, and the earth-works in a very incomplete state.
                    Without aid from headquarters the probability is that transportation will cease
                    over the road within twenty-four hours. It is for the authorities in Richmond to
                    protect it; we cannot. I shall be in town to-night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>LEWIS E. HARVIE,<br> President Richmond and Danville Railroad.</p>
