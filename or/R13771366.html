<p>Lieut. Gen. U. S. GRANT:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>December 6, 1864.</p>
<p>DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>I inclose you one of the telegrams received from Gen. Halleck on the 17th of
                    July, referred to in my last note. You can very readily imagine that the
                    reception of such a dispatch, after I had been working hard, night and day, for
                    two months, would have a very depressing tendency. When I relieved Sigel I found
                    his command very much disorganized and demoralized, from his recent defeat at
                    New Market, and the three generals with it, Sigel, Stahel, and Sullivan, not
                    worth one cent; in fact, very much in my way. I supposed, however, that you were
                    busily engaged with Lee, and that it was important that I should try and create
                    a diversion in your taken it, if it had not been for the stupidity and conceit
                    of that fellow Averell, who unfortunately joined me at Staunton, and of whom I
                    unfortunately had at the time a very high opinion, and trusted him when I should
                    not have done so.</p>
<p>As for occupying all the gaps, so as to prevent the enemy getting between me and
                    Washington, it was a perfect impossibility; I supposed you were fighting Lee
                    before Richmond, and that it was all important that I should push on. I was not
                    informed that I had any thing to do with the defense of Washington, and supposed
                    Gen. Halleck had made ample provision for this purpose. I hope, general, you
                    will do me the justice to say that I have done my whole duty, and I beg that you
                    will give me a command of some kind. If I am, not deemed worthy of a corps, give
                    me a division, a brigade, or a regiment. I have tried to do my whole duty, and
                    if I have failed, I am much mortified.</p>
<p>Sincerely, your friend,</p>
<p>D. HUNTER.</p>
