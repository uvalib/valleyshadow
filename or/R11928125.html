<p>Brig. Gen. R. B. MARCY,<br> Chief of Staff, Army of the
                        Potomac.</p>
<p>Camp near Warrenton, Va.,</p>
<p>November 17, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations
                        of this command from the crossing of the Potomac in the vicinity of
                        Warrenton, Va., and the relinquishment of the command of he army by
                        Maj.-Gen. McClellan:</p>
<p>On the morning of October 26, I crossed the Potomac at Berlin, with the Second
                    Cavalry Brigade and Pennington's horse battery, and took up a position in front
                    of Purcellville, on the 27th, having occupied Hillsborough with two squadrons of
                    the Sixth Cavalry. After some skirmishing with the rebels, and having driven
                    them out of Purcellville, they were followed up by Col. Davis, with the Eighth
                    New York Cavalry, as far as Snicker's Gap, at which point they opened with shell
                    and showed themselves in strong force.</p>
<p>From this time until November 1 the brigade was occupied in scouting the country
                    to Leesburg, Aldie, Middleburg, Philomont, and in gaining information of the
                    enemy's movements.</p>
<p>On November 1, the command moved forward and occupied Philomont, several hundred
                    of Stuart's cavalry leaving about the time we entered. Colonel Gregg, with the
                    eighth Pennsylvania and Third Indiana Cavalry, pursued this cavalry and drove it
                    very handsomely from some woods it attempted to hold, but, the enemy bringing up
                    his artillery, no farther advance was made, except to silence the rebel guns by
                    the fire of Pennington's battery.</p>
<p>The rebels left 5 dead on the field. Our loss was 1 killed and 1 officer and 13
                    men wounded.</p>
<p>On November 2, my advance came up with the enemy at Union, they had some infantry
                    supporting their guns, and very soon some sharp fighting began, which resulted
                    in the blowing up of one of their caissons, by which a number of their men were
                    killed, and their retreat for several miles on the road to Upperville.</p>
<p>Lieut.-Col. Hofman, with a small brigade of infantry and a battery, reported to
                    me for duty this morning from Doubleday's division.</p>
<p>The fighting did not cease until after dark, the rebels giving way at every
                    point. Their loss must have been considerable. One of their officers was left
                    dead on the field, and 10 wounded fell into our hands, besides a number of
                    prisoners. My loss in my own brigade was 1 man killed and 26 wounded. The
                    infantry brigade lost 5 men killed and 30 wounded.</p>
<p>Several companies of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry proceeded to Bloomfield
                    to-day and captured a number of rebel horses, arms, equipments, &amp;c., and
                    released Maj. O'Neill, of Gen. Meagher's staff, before the rebels had paroled
                    him; in fact, they ran away so quickly as to leave several hundred dollars of
                    their paper money behind.</p>
<p>On November 3, Brig.-Gen. Averell, having reported for duty with the First
                    Cavalry Brigade and Tidball's battery, was given the advance, and the infantry
                    brigade and Second Cavalry brigade moved to the left. The infantry brigade and
                    Second Cavalry Brigade soon came up with the enemy, and drove them on the road
                    to Upperville. Averell soon joined, and the whole command moved forward and took
                    possession of Upperville, driving the enemy through the town toward Ashby's Gap,
                    as well as toward Piedmont. Gen. Averell, with his brigade, moved after the
                    column toward Piedmont, and the Second Brigade followed to Ashby's Gap. The
                    infantry brigade was recalled to its proper division this evening. On reaching
                    Ashby's Gap the enemy opened a 10-pounder Parrott from the mountain side, and
                    showed some force, which afterward retreated through the gap. Averell occupied
                    Piedmont and took some prisoners.</p>
<p>On the 4th, Averell moved toward Markham, and soon engaged a force there. The
                    skirmishing was kept up during the day, and in the afternoon, at his request, he
                    was re-enforced by the Eighth Pennsylvania and Sixth Cavalry, under Col. Gregg.
                    The enemy fell back from Markham through Manassas Gap, and also toward Barbee's
                    Cross-Roads. As no detailed report has been received from Gen. Averell, I cannot
                    state his losses during the time his brigade was with me.</p>
<p>On November 5, I moved, with the Second Brigade and Pennington's battery, through
                    Markham, toward Barbee' Cross-Roads, Averell's brigade remaining at Markham, to
                    cover Manassas Gap, by the orders of the major-general commanding. On
                    approaching Barbee's Cross-Roads, the enemy opened with a couple of guns from an
                    eminence commanding the road, and displayed a large force of cavalry on the left
                    of the road, toward Chester Gap. I replied with a section of Pennington's
                    battery, and immediately sent the Eighth Pennsylvania and Sixth Cavalry, under
                    Col. Gragg, to our left, to occupy some woods to the front and turn their flank,
                    a section, under Pennington, taking a position to the front and right of the
                    road, supported by the Eighth New York Cavalry, under Col. Davis, while the
                    Eighth Illinois and Third Indiana Cavalry, under Col. Farnsworth, moved up the
                    road to the front. Gregg, with great skill and activity, soon outflanked the
                    rebel lines and caused them to withdraw their guns. They attempted to charge
                    him, but did not succeed. Farnsworth moved rapidly up the road, receiving
                    several rounds of canister, but driving the enemy before him, until he came to a
                    barricade, beyond which the enemy covered their retreat. By this time I had
                    advanced two sections of artillery to the position held by the rebels, where
                    they first opened, and I soon discovered that Col. Davis, of the Eighth New York
                    Cavalry, had a much superior force to his own to contend with, and that they
                    were about to charge him, in a column of squadrons. I ordered the Third Indiana
                    to re-enforce Davis, and opened a fire on the enemy's squadrons. Before,
                    however, much was effected, Davis saw his situation and dismounted one of his
                    squadrons behind a stone wall, while he gallantly led the remainder of his
                    regiment against the enemy, to meet their charge. The result was very
                    successful. The carbines of the dismounted squadron gave a galling flank and
                    front fire, while the attack of the Eighth New York routed the enemy and sent
                    them flying in all directions. Thirty-seven of the rebel dead were left on this
                    field, and more than that number of arms, horses, and prisoners were captured.
                    This part of their command retreated toward Chester Gap, and that from Barbee's
                    Cross-Roads took the Warrenton road.</p>
<p>On this occasion the Second Brigade had contended with two rebel brigades
                    (Hampton's and Lee's), the whole commanded by Stuart, and had driven them in
                    confusion from all their positions with a severe loss. My own loss was 5 killed
                    and 8 wounded.</p>
<p>On November 6, finding that the enemy was in force in Chester Gap and beyond
                    (Jackson's corps holding that position), and Averell having joined me, I moved
                    in the direction of Orleans, intending to proceed to Springville and Little
                    Washington by that route. I halted for the night near Waterloo, where my advance
                    was fired upon by the enemy.</p>
<p>On November 7, moved, with the First and Second Brigades, to Amissville, and was
                    opened on by the rebels with artillery, on the Little Washington road, and also
                    on the Jefferson road. Drove the rebels out of Jefferson, and captured two guns;
                    also 3 officers and 10 men.</p>
<p>On November 8, moved to Newby's Cross-Roads. A squadron of the Fifth Cavalry had
                    a skirmish on the Little Washington road, and Lieut. Ash, of that regiment, was
                    badly wounded. Col. Farnsworth then drove the rebels beyond Little Washington
                    with the Eighth Illinois and Third Indiana Cavalry. The Fifth Cavalry, besides
                    Lieut. Ash, had 6 men wounded and took 6 rebel prisoners. The Sixth Cavalry
                    captured a rebel wagon and 12 horses from the rebel cavalry, besides taking 1
                    officer and 1 man prisoner.</p>
<p>On November 9, the division occupied a position at Corbin's Cross-Roads, 1 mile
                    from Amissville, covering all the approaches from Culpeper, and also those from
                    Chester Gap and Luray. A squadron of the Eighth New York Cavalry last night
                    pushed as far as Flint Hill, paroled a number of wounded rebels, and retook 2 of
                    my men captured, wounded, at Barbee's. A squadron of the Sixth Cavalry went
                    inside of the enemy's lines last night, toward Culpeper, and captured a captain
                    of the Fourth Virginia Cavalry and 5 men on picket; also a four-horse wagon, out
                    for forage.</p>
<p>On November 10, the enemy from Culpeper attacked me in force with a brigade of
                    infantry, one of cavalry and artillery, and at Corbin's Cross-Roads drove in my
                    pickets, and compelled me to concentrate my whole force to resist him. Several
                    prisoners taken say it was Longstreet, making a reconnaissance to find out where
                    our army lay. He did not succeed, as he was repulsed late in the afternoon with
                    severe loss. Our loss was 2 men mortally and 2 severely wounded. Gen. Sturgis,
                    who was stationed at amissville, quickly sent several of the regiments of his
                    division to the right of the enemy to outflank them. This movement, doubtless,
                    had great effect in inducing the enemy to withdraw. This action closed the
                    campaign of the cavalry in Loudoun and Fauquier Counties, as orders were then
                    received directing no farther advance toward Culpeper, and informing the army
                    that Maj.-Gen. Burnside had relieved Maj.-Gen. McClellan from the command of it.</p>
<p>At this time, and from the 7th instant, my advance pickets were on Hazel River,
                    within 6 miles of Culpeper, besides having my flank pickets toward Chester and
                    Thornton's Gaps extended to Gaines' Cross-Roads and Newby's Cross-Roads, with
                    numerous patrols in the direction of Woodville, Little Washington, and
                    Springville. The information gained by these parties, and also from deserters,
                    prisoners, contrabands, as well as citizens, established the fact of Longstreet,
                    with his command being at Culpeper, while Jackson and D. H. Hill, with their
                    respective commands, were in the Shenandoah Valley, on the western side of the
                    Blue Ridge, covering Chester and Thornton's Gaps, and expecting us to attempt to
                    pass through and attack them.</p>
<p>As late as November 17, a contraband, just from Strasburg, came into my camp and
                    reported that D. H. Hill's corps was 2 miles beyond that place, on the railroad
                    to Mount Jackson. Hill was tearing up the road and destroying the bridges, under
                    the impression that we intended to follow into that valley, and was en route for
                    Staunton. Jackson's corps was between Strasburg and Winchester. Ewell and A. P.
                    Hill were with Jackson. Provisions were scarce, and the rebels were obliged to
                    keep moving to obtain them.</p>
<p>In closing this report, it is but justice to the troops I have had the honor to
                    command that I should mention the results of their laborious exertions and
                    chivalrous gallantry, constantly exhibited under many adverse circumstances.
                    From the time the army left Washington to the end of the campaign at Warrenton,
                    the cavalry of my command had taken from the enemy 6 pieces of artillery, 4
                    stand of colors, and 1,000 prisoners of war, without losing a single gun or
                    color. These facts show that the officers and men of our cavalry have the
                    energy, the intelligence, the courage, and enterprise to make them superior to
                    any cavalry they have to contend with, and yet no one is more painfully
                    conscious than myself that the opinion is entertained that our cavalry has been
                    deficient in its duty in the present rebellion. I will, therefore, mention a few
                    facts to show that, wherever there exists a foundation for such an opinion, the
                    fault does not rest with the cavalry. The rebels have always had more cavalry in
                    the field than we, and whenever we have fought them their numbers were two to
                    three to one of ours. Such a difference is always an encouragement to brave
                    soldiers, for they never stop to inquire their number; but such a difference
                    tells fearfully upon the hard service the horses have to perform. Good horses
                    are broken down by it; inferior ones are literally thrown away in such service.
                    The rebel cavalry are mounted on the best horses in the South, while our cavalry
                    are furnished a very inferior animal, bought by contract, and which is totally
                    unfit for efficient service. The best horses in my command are the horses my men
                    have captured from the rebel cavalry, in their different engagements with them.
                    As instance, one of my companies has 22 rebel horses out of 53, and these horses
                    are the best in the company. Out of 18 horses furnished this same company by the
                    quartermaster's department at Knoxville, only 2 are left in the company, and
                    these are very inferior. Does not this show that the officers and men who thus
                    wrest the elements of success from the hands of the enemy are superior to the
                    circumstances surrounding them, and are not responsible for those failures which
                    are used as illustrations against them?</p>
<p>I respectfully submit to the favorable consideration of the major-general
                    commanding and the Government the following-named officers for distinguished
                    gallantry and good conduct throughout the campaign: Col. J. F. Farnsworth,
                    Eighth Illinois Cavalry; Col. D. McM. Gregg, Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry; Col.
                    B. F. Davis, Eighth New York Cavalry; Maj. Chapman, Third Indiana Cavalry, and
                    Capt. W. P. Sanders, Sixth U. S. Cavalry. These officers each commanded
                    regiments. Of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry, Maj.'s Beveridge and Medill, and
                    Capt.'s Hynes and Forsyth; of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Maj. Peter
                    Keenan; of the Eighth New York Cavalry, Maj. Markell, Capt.'s Pope, Barry, and
                    Moore; of the Third Indiana Cavalry, Capt. Lemmon; of the Sixth U. S. Cavalry,
                    First Lieut. James F. Wade and First Lieut. Spangler, Second Lieuts. Albert
                    Coats and Joseph Kerin; of Pennington's battery, First Lieuts. A. C. M.
                    Pennington, jr., Robert H. Chapin, and Frank B. Hamilton.</p>
<p>Of Brig.-Gen. Averell's brigade, no reports have been received, as it was soon
                    after detached on other service. As a brigade, its services were always
                    efficient and well rendered. One exception came under my notice at Amissville,
                    viz, the gallantry and efficiency of Capt. Harrison, commanding Fifth Cavalry,
                    against a superior force of the enemy.</p>
<p>Of Tidball's battery, Capt. Tidball, Second Artillery; Lieuts. William N.
                    Dennison and Robert Clarke.</p>
<p>My staff officers throughout the campaign served with zeal, energy, and fidelity,
                    viz, Capt. A. J. Cohen, assistant adjutant-general; First Lieut. Isaac W. Ward,
                    Sixth Cavalry; First Lieut. C. Thompson, First New York Cavalry, aide-de-camp,
                    and First Lieut. Van Patten, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, division commissary of
                    subsistence.</p>
<p>I am, general, very res`ectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. PLEASONTON,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Division.</p>
