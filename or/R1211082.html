<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Samuel Jones on Union General Robert Milroy's
                    December, 1862, efforts to bring portions of the Valley under authority of the
                    state of West Virginia. Lee, alarmed by these attempts to make citizens take an
                    oath of allegiance to the U. S. government, orders a concentration of troops at
                    Staunton to oppose Milroy.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. SAMUEL JONES,<br> Cmdg. Department of Western
                        Virginia:</p>
<p>Camp near Fredericksburg, Va.,</p>
<p>December 29, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>It is reported by Gen. W. E. Jones, in command of the Valley District, that Gen.
                    Milroy has established himself at Petersburg and in the valley of the South
                    Branch of the Potomac, and has issued orders with a view of bringing the
                    citizens of that section under the government of the so-called State of Western
                    Virginia. From copies of the orders transmitted to me, and the oath of
                    allegiance prescribed, it is plain that great oppression and injustice is
                    contemplated to our citizens. I have directed Gen. Jones to concentrate all the
                    troops in the valley, and to endeavor to drive the enemy across the Potomac. I
                    understand that there are three companies of Jenkins' cavalry brigade scattered
                    over Augusta and Rockbridge Counties, and that these companies are to reassemble
                    at Salem, Roanoke County, on the 5th proximo. I have thought it probable that
                    the whole brigade might be available for service in the valley, which would make
                    the expulsion of the enemy easier and more certain. Should this be so, or should
                    there be any other troops in your department more available for this purpose, I
                    request that you will unite them to the command of Col. H. B. Davidson, at
                    Staunton.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
