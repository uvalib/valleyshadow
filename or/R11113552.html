<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson and his troops left the
                    Shenandoah Valley to join the fighting in front of Richmond. In this February,
                    1863, dispatch, Jackson reports on his June, 1862, departure from Staunton, and
                    the subsequent role his command played in the Seven Days Battles before

<p>Brig. Gen. R. H. CHILTON,<br> Asst. Adjt. and Insp.
                        Gen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>February 20, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor herewith to submit to you a report of the operations of my corps
                    in the battle of Cold Harbor and other engagements before Richmond.</p>
<p>On June 17 last, leaving the cavalry and Chew's battery under Brig.-Gen.
                    Robertson near Harrisonburg; Whiting's division, then near Staunton, and Ewell's
                    and Jackson's, near Weyer's Cave, Augusta County, Virginia, moved toward
                    Richmond. Lawton's brigade, subsequently of Jackson's division, being part at
                    Staunton and part near Weyer's Cave, moved with the troops nearest their
                    positions. Subsequently Col. Munford, with his cavalry, marched in the same
                    direction.</p>
<p>On June 25 we reached the vicinity of Ashland, on the Richmond Fredericksburg and
                    Potomac Railroad, about 12 miles from Richmond.</p>
<p>The division of Brig.-Gen. Whiting embraced the Texas Brigade, Gen. Hood, and the
                    Third Brigade, Col. Law commanding, with the batteries of Reilly and Balthis.</p>
<p>The division of Maj.-Gen. Ewell-the Fourth Brigade, Gen. A. Elzey; the Seventh
                    Brigade, Gen. Trimble; the Eighth Brigade, Col. I. G. Seymour, and the Maryland
                    Line, Col. Bradley T. Johnson, with the batteries of Brockenbrough, Carrington,
                    and Courtney.</p>
<p>Jackson's division-the First Brigade, Gen. Charles S. Winder; the Second Brigade,
                    Lieut. Col. R. H. Cunningham commanding; the Third Brigade, Col. S. V. Fulkerson
                    commanding, and the Fourth Brigade, Gen. A. R. Lawton, with the batteries of
                    Poague, Carpenter, and Wooding.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, in pursuance of instructions from the commanding
                    general, I took up the line of march for Cold Harbor, Whiting's division in
                    front.</p>
<p>Pursuing the Ashcake road, we crossed the Central Railroad about 10 a.m.
                    Approaching the Totopotomoy Creek, the Federal picket crossed to the south side
                    of the stream and partially destroyed the bridge, and by felling trees across
                    the road farther on attempted to delay our advance. After the Texas skirmishers
                    had gallantly crossed over and Reilly shelled the woods for the purpose of
                    driving the enemy from it, in order that we might safely effect a lodgment
                    beyond the creek, Whiting rapidly repaired the bridge and the march was resumed.</p>
<p>That night the three divisions bivouacked near Hundley's Corner. While there some
                    skirmishing took place with detachments of the enemy, in which Brockenbrough's
                    battery; the First Maryland, Thirteenth Virginia, and Sixth Louisiana Regt.'s
                    participated.</p>
<p>We were now approaching the ground occupied by that portion of the Grand Army of
                    McClellan which was posted north of the Chickahominy. His right was then resting
                    upon Mechanicsville, from which point his lines extended some miles down the
                    river. As our route that day inclined toward the south and brought us in the
                    direction, but to the left, of Mechanicsville, we distinctly heard the rapid and
                    continued discharged of cannon, announcing the engagement of Gen. A. P. Hill
                    with the extreme right of the enemy.</p>
<p>Early the next morning (27th) the three divisions resumed the march, Gen. Ewell
                    in the lead. After crossing Beaver Dam we halted to dislodge a force of the
                    enemy observed on our right near the intersection of the road then occupied by
                    us with the road leading from Mechanicsville to Bethesda Church. But the
                    Federals observing the division of Gen. D. H. Hill, then coming into view, and
                    which was advancing from Mechanicsville toward the point of intersection, and at
                    the same time seeing Gen. Ewell moving down from my command, they promptly
                    abandoned their position and fell back. The enemy, seen by us, as before stated,
                    on our right, having fallen back, and the road being open for pressing farther
                    along his rear, the march was resumed toward Walnut Grove Church, where I again
                    halted until Gen. A. P. Hill came up. Continuing to carry out the plan of the
                    commanding general I inclined to the left and advanced on Cold Harbor, while
                    Gen. A. P. Hill moved toward the same point by a different road to the right.
                    The enemy having obstructed the road which I had taken, and adopted the
                    additional precaution to delay my march by defending the obstructions with
                    sharpshooters, it became necessary, for the purpose of saving time, to take a
                    road still farther to the left. The time consumed in this delay threw me in rear
                    of Gen. D. H. Hill, who had moved by Bethesda Church. Upon reaching and passing
                    Cold Harbor about half a mile his division was opened upon by a heavy fire from
                    a position on his right and also from artillery in his front.</p>
<p>Soon after Gen. A. P. Hill became engaged, and being unacquainted with the
                    ground, and apprehensive, from what appeared to me to be the respective
                    positions of the Confederate and Federal forces engaged, that if I then pressed
                    forward our troops would be mistaken for the enemy and be fired into, and hoping
                    that Gen.'s A. P. Hill and Longstreet would soon drive the Federals toward me, I
                    directed Gen. D. H. Hill to move his division to the left of the road, so as to
                    leave between him and the wood on the right of the road an open space, across
                    which I hoped the enemy would be driven. Thus arranged, it was in our power to
                    distinguish friend from foe in case the enemy should be driven as expected.
                    Maj.-Gen. Stuart, who had been covering my left with his cavalry was also posted
                    so as to charge should the Federals attempt to retreat to the Pamunkey by Cold
                    Harbor; but it soon becoming apparent, from the direction and sound of the
                    firing, that Gen. A. P. Hill was hard pressed, I ordered a general advance of my
                    entire corps, which commenced with Gen. D. H. Hill upon the left, and extending
                    to the right through Ewell's, Jackson's, and Whiting's divisions, posted from
                    left to right in the order named.</p>
<p>The Federal commander had withdrawn his troops from their positions west of the
                    Powhite, a small tributary of the Chickahominy, and had concentrated them in
                    strong positions near Cold Harbor and east of that creek. The ground which had
                    been selected to receive our attack had natural advantages for defenses and was
                    strengthened by artificial works. His forces were posted upon an elevated ridge
                    running nearly parallel to the Chickahominy, his right resting near McGehee's
                    house, and his left upon an abrupt bluff, surmounted by artillery and protected
                    by a deep ravine and a double line of breastworks for infantry. This position on
                    the ridge was further favored on his right by points still more elevated rising
                    in his rear, well adapted for batteries, from which a destructive fire could be
                    maintained against an advancing line over the heads of his own infantry. In his
                    front was a wood of deep and tangled undergrowth, through which a sluggish
                    stream passed, converting into swamp or marsh the adjacent soil. This natural
                    obstruction was further increased by felled timber, designed to retard the
                    advance of our troops and to keep them as long as possible exposed to fire.</p>
<p>In advancing to the attack Gen. D. H. Hill had to cross this swamp, densely
                    covered with tangled undergrowth and young timber. This caused some confusion
                    and a separation of regiments. On the farther edge of the swamp he encountered
                    the enemy. The conflict was fierce and bloody. The Federals fell back from the
                    wood under the protection of a fence, ditch, and hill. Separated now from them
                    by an open field some 400 yards wide, he promptly determined to press forward.
                    Before doing so, however, it was necessary to capture a battery on his left
                    which could enfilade his line upon its advance. To effect this he sent two
                    regiments of Elzey's brigade, which had become separated from their command, to
                    go in rear of the battery, and ordered Col. Alfred Iverson, with the Twentieth
                    North Carolina and the First and Third North Carolina Regt.'s, to make the
                    attack in front. The order was promptly and gallantly obeyed and carried into
                    execution by Col. Iverson with the Twentieth North Carolina. He was severely
                    wounded in the advance. The battery was captured with severe loss and held for a
                    short time-sufficiently long, however, to enable the division to move on free
                    from its terrific fire, when it was retaken by the enemy. Again pressing
                    forward, the Federals again fell back, but only to select a position for a more
                    obstinate defense, when at dark-under the pressure of our batteries, which had
                    then begun to play with marked effect upon the left, of the other concurring
                    events of the field, and of the bold and dashing charge of Gen. Hill's infantry,
                    in which the troops of Gen. C. S. Winder joined-the enemy yielded the field and
                    fled in disorder.</p>
<p>In the mean time Gen. Ewell, on general D. H. Hill's right, had moved the Fourth
                    Brigade, Gen. Elzey, to the left of the road passing from Gaines' house to
                    McGehee's, and a portion of the Seventh, Gen. Trimble, and the Eighth Brigade
                    into the wood on the right of that road. Having crossed the swamp and commenced
                    the ascent of the hill, his division became warmly engaged with the enemy. For
                    two hours assailed in front and flank by superior numbers, without
                    re-enforcement, Col. Seymour, then commanding, having fallen, the Eighth Brigade
                    was drawn from the field, but the line was still held by a portion of Gen.
                    Trimble's. The Fifth Texas and a part of the Hampton Legion now came to his
                    support, and rendered important service in holding the enemy in check until the
                    arrival of Gen. Lawton, of Jackson's division, enabled him to assume the
                    offensive.</p>
<p>Lawton, after aiding in clearing the front, wheeled a part of his brigade to the
                    right, attacked the enemy in flank, and opened the way for the remainder of
                    Trimble's brigade, which advanced to the field beyond the woods. Gen. Ewell's
                    troops, having now exhausted their own ammunition and in many cases such as they
                    could gather from the dead and wounded and having been engaged for more than
                    four hours, the most of them withdrew from the field about dusk.</p>
<p>The four brigades of Jackson's division did not act together during the
                    engagement, but were called to separate fields of service. In pursuance of the
                    other to charge the enemy's front, the First Virginia Brigade, commanded by Gen.
                    C. S. Winder, moved forward through the swamp, and upon emerging into the open
                    field its ranks, broken by the obstacles encountered, were reformed. Meeting at
                    that point with the Hampton Legion, First Maryland, Twelfth Alabama,
                    Fifty-second Virginia, and Thirty-eighth Georgia, they were formed upon his
                    line. Thus formed, they moved forward under the lead of that gallant officer,
                    whose conduct here was marked by the coolness and courage which distinguished
                    him on the battle-fields of the valley. The enemy met this advance with spirit
                    and firmness. His well-directed artillery and heavy musketry played with
                    destructive effect upon our advancing line. Nothing daunted by the fall of
                    officers and men, thinning their ranks at every step, these brave men moved
                    steadily forward, driving the enemy from point to point, until he was finally
                    driven from his last position, some 300 yards beyond McGehee's house, when night
                    prevented further pursuit.</p>
<p>In the charge near McGehee's house, Col. J. W. Allen, of the Second Virginia
                    Infantry, fell at the head of his regiment. Five guns, numerous small-arms, and
                    many prisoners were among the fruits of this rapid and resistless advance. Gen.
                    Reynolds and an officer of his staff, who lingered on this side of the river
                    after the Federal troops had crossed over, were among the number of prisoners.</p>
<p>The Second Brigade, by request of Gen. Wilcox, was removed to a point off woods
                    about half a mile from the river. When it reached there the enemy had already
                    been repulsed at that point by a flank movement of brig. Gen. Rr. H. Anderson.</p>
<p>The Third Brigade was sent to support Gen. Whiting's attack upon the enemy's
                    left, but reached there only in time to witness the evidences of a bloody
                    triumph and the guns of the enemy in possession of the gallant Texas Brigade.
                    Col. S. V. Fulkerson, commanding the brigade, fell mortally wounded shortly
                    after his arrival on the spot. Gen. Lawton, of the Fourth Brigade, after
                    rendering timely and important support, before described, to Gen. Ewell's
                    command, pressed to the brow of the hill, driving the enemy before him, and
                    co-operating in that general charge late in the evening that closed the labors
                    of the day.</p>
<p>On my extreme right Gen. Whiting advanced his division through the same dense
                    forest and swamp, emerging from the wood into the field near the public road and
                    at the head of the deep ravine which covered the enemy's left. Advancing thence
                    through a number of retreating and disordered regiments he came within range of
                    the enemy's fire, who, concealed in an open wood and protected by breastworks,
                    poured a destructive fire for a quarter of a mile into his advancing line, under
                    which many brave officers and men fell. Dashing on with unfaltering step in the
                    face of those murderous discharges of canister and musketry Gen. Hood and Col.
                    Law, at the heads of their respective brigades, rushed to the charge with a
                    yell. Moving down a precipitous ravine, leaping ditch and stream, clambering up
                    a difficult ascent, and exposed to an incessant and deadly fire from the
                    intrenchments, these brave and determined men pressed forward, driving the enemy
                    from his well-selected and fortified position.</p>
<p>In this charge, in which upward of 1,000 men fell killed and wounded before the
                    fire of the enemy and in which fourteen pieces of artillery and nearly a
                    regiment were captured, the Fourth Texas, under the lead of Gen. Hood, was the
                    first to pierce these strongholds and seize the guns. Although swept from their
                    defenses by this rapid and almost matchless display of daring and valor, the
                    well-disciplined Federals continued in retreat to fight with stubborn
                    resistance.</p>
<p>Apprehensive, from their superior numbers and sullen obstinacy, that the enemy
                    might again rally, Gen. Whiting called upon Gen. Longstreet for re-enforcements.
                    He promptly sent forward Gen. R. H. Anderson's brigade, which came in gallant
                    style to his support, and the enemy was driven to the lower part of the plateau.
                    The shouts of triumph which rose from our brave men as they, unaided by
                    artillery, had stormed this citadel of their strength, were promptly carried
                    from line to line, and the triumphant issue of this assault, with the
                    well-directed fire of the batteries and successful charges of Hill and Winder
                    upon the enemy's right, determined the fortunes of the day. The Federals, routed
                    at every point and aided by the darkness of the night, escaped across the
                    Chickahominy.</p>
<p>During the earlier part of the action the artillery could not be effectively
                    used, At an advanced stage of it Maj. John Pelham, of Stuart's Horse Artillery,
                    bravely dashed forward and opened on the Federal batteries posted on the left of
                    our infantry. Re-enforced by the guns of Brockenbrough, Carrington, and
                    Courtney, of my command, our artillery now numbered about thirty pieces. Their
                    fire was well directed and effective, and contributed to the successful issue of
                    the engagement.</p>
<p>On the following day, the 28th, Gen. Ewell, preceded by a cavalry force, advanced
                    down the north side of the Chickahominy to Dispatch Station and destroyed a
                    portion of the railroad track.</p>
<p>On the 29th he moved his division to the vicinity of Bottom's Bridge to prevent
                    the enemy crossing at that point, but on the following day was ordered to return
                    to co-operate with the movements of the corps.</p>
<p>The 28th and 29th were occupied in disposing of the dead and wounded and
                    repairing Grapevine Bridge, over the Chickahominy, which McClellan's forces had
                    used in their retreat and destroyed in their rear.</p>
<p>During the night of the 29th we commenced crossing the Chickahominy, and on the
                    following morning arrived at Savage Station, on the Richmond and York River
                    Railroad, where a summer hospital, remarkable for the extent and convenience of
                    its accommodations, fell into our possession. In it were about 2,500 sick and
                    wounded, besides some 500 persons having charge of the patients.</p>
<p>Many other evidences of the hurried and disordered flight of the enemy were now
                    visible--blankets, clothing, and other supplies had been recklessly abandoned.
                    D. H. Hill, who had the advance, gathered up probably 1,000 stragglers and so
                    many small-arms that it became necessary to detach two regiments to take charge
                    of them and to see to the security of the prisoners.</p>
<p>About noon we reached White Oak Swamp, and here the enemy made a determined
                    effort to retard our advance and thereby to prevent an immediate junction
                    between Gen. Longstreet and myself. We found the bridge destroyed and the
                    ordinary place of crossing commanded by their batteries on the opposite side,
                    and all approach to it barred by detachments of sharpshooters, concealed in a
                    dense wood close by.</p>
<p>A battery of twenty-eight guns from Hill's and Whiting's artillery was placed by
                    Col. S. Crutchfield in a favorable position for driving off or silencing the
                    opposing artillery. About 2 p.m. it opened suddenly upon the enemy. He fired a
                    few shots in reply and then withdrew from that position, abandoning part of his
                    artillery. Capt. Wooding was immediately ordered near the bridge to shell the
                    sharpshooters from the woods, which was accomplished, and Munford's cavalry
                    crossed the creek, but was soon compelled to retire. It was soon seen that the
                    enemy occupied such a position beyond a thick intervening wood on the right of
                    the road as enabled him to command the crossing. Capt. Wooding's battery was
                    consequently recalled and our batteries turned in the new direction. The fire so
                    opened on both sides was kept up until dark. We bivouacked that night near the
                    swamp.</p>
<p>A heavy cannonading in front announced the engagement of Gen. Longstreet at
                    Frazier's farm and made me eager to press forward; but the marshy character of
                    the soil, the destruction of the bridge over the marsh and creek, and the strong
                    position of the enemy for defending the passage prevented my advancing until the
                    following morning. During the night the Federals retired. The bridge was rapidly
                    repaired by Whiting's division, which soon after crossed over and continued the
                    pursuit, in which it was followed by the remainder of my corps.</p>
<p>At White Oak we captured a portion of the enemy's artillery, and also found
                    another hospital with about 350 sick and wounded, which fell into our hands.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Frazier's farm I found Gen. Longstreet's advance near the road. The
                    commanding general soon after arrived, and in pursuance of his instructions I
                    continued to press forward. The head of my advancing column was soon fired upon
                    by the enemy, who nevertheless continued to fall back until he reached Malvern
                    Hill, which strong position he held in force. Gen. Whiting was directed to move
                    to the left and take position on the Poindexter farm; Gen. D. H. Hill to take
                    position farther to the right; Taylor's brigade, of Gen. Ewell's division, to
                    move forward between the divisions of Hill and Whiting; the remainder of Ewell's
                    division to remain in rear of the first line. Jackson's division was halted near
                    Willis' Church in the wood and held in reserve.</p>
<p>Gen. D. H. Hill pursued the route indicated, crossing an open field and creek.
                    His troops were then brought in full range of the enemy's artillery and suffered
                    severely. Brig.-Gen. Anderson was wounded and carried from the field. The
                    division was halted under the cover of a wood, which afforded an opportunity for
                    a more particular examination off the ground in front. The enemy in large force
                    were found strongly posted on a commanding hill, all the approaches to which in
                    the direction of my position could be swept by his artillery and were guarded by
                    infantry. The nearest batteries could only be approached by traversing an open
                    space of 300 or 400 yards, exposed to the murderous fire of artillery and
                    infantry.</p>
<p>The commanding general had issued an order that at a given signal there should be
                    a general advance of the whole line. Gen. D. H. Hill, hearing what he believed
                    to be the signal, with great gallantry pressed forward and engaged the enemy.
                    Not supported by a general advance, as he had anticipated, he soon saw that it
                    was impossible without support to sustain himself long against such overwhelming
                    numbers.</p>
<p>He accordingly sent to me for re-enforcements. I ordered that portion of Gen.
                    Ewell's division held in reserve and Jacksons' division to his relief; but from
                    the darkness of the night, and the obstructions caused by the swamp and
                    undergrowth, through which they had to march, none reached him in time to afford
                    him the desired support.</p>
<p>Gen. Hill, after suffering a heavy loss and inflicting a severe one upon the
                    enemy, withdrew from the open field. In the mean time the re-enforcements
                    ordered-after struggling with the difficulties of their route, and exposed to
                    the shelling of the enemy, which was continued until about 10 p.m.--came up too
                    late to participate in the engagement that evening.</p>
<p>On my left Gen. Whiting moved his division, as directed, to a field on the
                    Poindexter farm. Batteries were ordered up. The position of the enemy, as
                    already shown, naturally commanding, was materially strengthened by the
                    judicious distribution of his artillery. The first battery placed in position,
                    finding itself exposed to the superior cross-fire of the enemy, was compelled to
                    retire with loss. Balthis', Poague's, and Carpenter's batteries held their
                    positions and fought well. The position occupied by the artillery rendering
                    infantry support necessary, Whiting formed his line accordingly and, supported
                    by Trimble's brigade on his left and by the Third Brigade of Jackson's division
                    as a reserve, was directed to remain there until further orders. Some of these
                    batteries were well served, and effectually drove back at one time an advance of
                    the enemy upon my center.</p>
<p>Toward night Whiting received orders to send Gen. Trimble's brigade to the
                    support of Gen. D. H. Hill, on the right, which order was promptly executed, but
                    the brigade did not reach its destination until after Hill had withdrawn his
                    division to the woods.</p>
<p>Our troops slept in front of the Federal Army during the night, expecting a
                    renewal of the action; but early the next morning the enemy had withdrawn from
                    the field, abandoning his dead and leaving behind some artillery and a number of
                    small-arms.</p>
<p>I herewith forward to you official reports of the casualties of this corps, from
                    which it will be seen, as far as I have been able to ascertain, that in the
                    battle of Cold Harbor, on June 27, there were 589 killed, 2,671 wounded, and 24
                    missing; and in the engagement at Malvern Hill, on July 1,377 killed, 1,746
                    wounded, and 39 missing.</p>
<p>I regret that I have not before me the data by which to ascertain with absolute
                    precision the losses sustained, respectively, at Cold Harbor and Malvern Hill,
                    or of distinguishing throughout the entire corps the number of officers killed
                    and wounded from the enlisted men. But Brig.-Gen.'s Garland and Anderson, both
                    since killed, having omitted in their reports to state the separate losses of
                    their brigades in those two actions, and Brig.-Gen.'s Rodes, Colquitt, and
                    Ripley having omitted to classify their losses as between officers and men, I
                    have, so far as it relates to the two first-named brigades, apportioned the
                    aggregate of the reported losses between Cold Harbor and Malvern Hill according
                    to a probable estimate of the fact, and omitted any statements of the loss of
                    officers as distinguished from men in that division. In the three remaining
                    divisions-Ewell's, Whiting's, and Jackson's-the returns show a loss at Cold
                    Harbor of 30 officers killed and 99 wounded; of enlisted men, 305 killed and
                    1,420 wounded; and at Malvern Hill, 3 officers killed and 19 wounded; of
                    enlisted men, 305 killed and 1,420 wounded; and at Malvern Hill, 3 officers
                    killed and 19 wounded; of enlisted men, 38 killed and 354 wounded. The principal
                    loss sustained by my command at Malvern Hill fell upon the division of Maj. Gen.
                    D. H. Hill.</p>
<p>On July 2, by order of the commanding general, my corps, with the exception of
                    Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill's division, which remained near Malvern Hill, was moved in
                    the direction of Harrison's Landing, to which point the Federals had retreated,
                    under the shelter of their gunboats in the James River.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3d my command arrived near the landing and drove in the
                    enemy's skirmishers, and continued in front of the enemy until the 8th, when I
                    was directed to withdraw my troops and march to the vicinity of Richmond.</p>
<p>For further information respecting the engagements and officers who were
                    distinguished in them I respectfully call attention to the accompanying reports
                    of division and other commanders. The conduct of officers and men was worthy of
                    the great cause for which they were contending.</p>
<p>The wounded received the special attention of my medical director, Dr. Hunter
                    McGuire.</p>
<p>For the efficiency with which the members of my staff discharged their duties I
                    take pleasure in mentioning Col. S. Crutchfield, chief of artillery; Col. A.
                    Smead, inspector-general; Maj. R. T. Dabney and Capt. A. S. Pendleton, assistant
                    adjutants-general; Capt. J. K. Boswell, chief engineer, and Lieut. H. K.
                    Douglas, assistant inspector general. Cols. A. R. Boteler and William T.
                    Jackson, volunteer aides, and Maj. Jasper S. Whiting, assistant
                    adjutant-general, who were temporarily on my staff, rendered valuable service.</p>
<p>The ordnance department received the special attention of Maj. G. H. Bier. The
                    quartermaster's and commissary departments were well managed by their respective
                    chiefs, Majrs. J. A. Harman and W. J. Hawks.</p>
<p>Undying gratitude is due to God for this great victory, by which despondency
                    increased in the North, hope brightened in the South, and the capital of
                    Virginia and of the Confederacy was saved.</p>
<p>List of killed, wounded, and missing in the battles of Cold Harbor and Malvern
                    Hill, June 27 and July 1.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>T. J. JACKSON,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
