<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During the Spring of 1862, three Union forces under Fremont, Banks, and McDowell
                    advanced up the Shenandoah Valley. In this letter, Union General John C. Fremont
                    coordinates April, 1862, operations with General Nathaniel P. Banks. He comments
                    on the absence of Confederate troops from the Staunton area, and the movement of
                    sick on railroad cars.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. N.P. BANKS,<br> New Market:</p>
<p>WHEELING, VA.,</p>
<p>April 27, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The movement is right. The force could be rapidly concentrated. If Blenker had
                    been brought quickly forward all my troops would now be in valley, ready to move
                    in co-operation. I should be happy to act with you, and have been hoping
                    authority from the War Department. A dispatch received from Washington last
                    night induces belief that they meditate this move. I will give you prompt
                    information. Milroy reports no troops of the enemy in or about Staunton, and
                    none this side expect one regiment and one battalion of infantry and four
                    companies of cavalry at Buffalo Gap; that on 24th enemy moving all sick on cars
                    eastward, and that large trains loaded with soldiers, supposed to be Johnston's,
                    were passing.</p>
