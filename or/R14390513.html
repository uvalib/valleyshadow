<p>Brig.-Gen. CUSTER.</p>
<p>Camp near Cross Keys, Va.,</p>
<p>September 28, 1864</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that I have just this moment returned from the
                    reconnaissance ordered, and beg leave to submit the following report:</p>
<p>I crossed the river with two regiments (Twenty-second Pennsylvania and Eighth
                    Ohio), and proceed without any molestation to the road which leads from Brown's
                    Gap to the Piedmont road and to the ground occupied by this division when it was
                    attacked yesterday, sending strong patrols to within half a mile of Brown's Gap,
                    and on the Piedmont road to near the Staunton pike and to Piedmont. From
                    information carefully gleaned I learned that the enemy's force left the river
                    this morning at 10 a.m. Their force consisted of one brigade of infantry, one of
                    cavalry, and one battery (four pieces) horse artillery. They retired to the
                    cross-roads and thence in rear of the army through Piedmont. The rebel army
                    moved last night in the following order: Rodes' old division, with the entire
                    train, moved up this side of the Blue Ridge in the direction of Rockfish Gap;
                    the remainder of the infantry and artillery moved past Weyer's Cave, through
                    Piedmont and Mount Meridian, in the direction of the railroad; the cavalry moved
                    yesterday from Brown's Gap in the direction of Charlottesville, and a man who
                    passed over the road states that they were scattered from one end of it to the
                    other, twenty-two miles. Early in person went with Rodes' division and the
                    train. At the house where he made his headquarters last night they reported him
                    beastly intoxicated all night. Kershaw's division is shoeless, and a large
                    number of the infantry without arms. While on the hill above Weyer's Cave I
                    could distinctly hear artillery firing in the direction of Staunton, and
                    citizens report heavy firing in the direction of Rockfish Gap this a.m. Nothing
                    has passed through Brown's Gap. Citizens state that Early was censured from
                    Richmond for placing his command in the mountain region and leaving Staunton and
                    the Valley open. I tried to capture some prisoners, but the only squall I saw
                    flew like sheep in all directions. My command is upon the same ground occupied
                    during the day, and pickets out as ordered.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. M. SCHOONMAKER,<br> Col., Cmdg.</p>
