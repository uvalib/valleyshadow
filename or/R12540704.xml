                <p>Your letter of the 1st instant was received only a few moments since.</p>
                <p>The necessary orders will be immediately given to Col. Patton. The Fifty-fourth
                    and Fiftieth Virginia Regiments having been ordered out of my department (the
                    Fiftieth will go to Gen. Lee as soon as transportation is provided), I shall not
                    be able to send George M. Edgar's battalion with Col. Patton. As the Fiftieth,
                    which is as large as the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first together, goes to Gen.
                    Lee, I take it for granted he will send the two latter to you. I have written to
                    him that he may count with certainty on receiving the Fiftieth. Col. W. L.
                    Jackson has a regiment collected, and the field officers will be elected and the
                    organization completed before you start. Something over 200 of his men are now
                    in the lower end of Pocahontas; most of them are of the Virginia State Line, are
                    armed, and have seen service. I will direct Col. Jackson to join you and act
                    under your orders. I saw him yesterday, and told him of my intention to send him
                    with you on the expedition. He is at the Warm Springs, and I wish you to
                    communicate with him.</p>
                <p>Inform me if Gen. Lee has sent the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first to you. If he
                    has not, write and urge him to do so. The Fiftieth will be with him before
                    Hooker will move.</p>
                <p>My engineer and his party will leave here for Staunton on the 9th or 10th
                    instant.</p>
