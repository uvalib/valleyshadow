<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Robert S. Garnett reports to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper
                    regarding the state of troops under his command in what is now West Virginia
                    during June, 1861. Garnett reports having ordered munitions and supplies from
                    Staunton.</p>

<p>HDQRS. DEPARTMENT NORTHWESTERN VIRGINIA,</p>
<p>Gen. S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector Gen.:</p>
<p>Beverly,</p>
<p>June 18, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>As already reported, I have four companies of cavalry under my command. I find
                    that beyond Laurel Hill and the Buckhannon Pass there are so many country
                    by-roads and cross-roads that this force is not quite sufficient to keep my
                    command properly guarded. I therefore request that I may be supplied at the
                    earliest practicable with two companies of well-armed and well-instructed
                    cavalry.</p>
<p>The force which I found here is in a miserable condition as to ammunition and
                    equipments. As regards the latter, they are actually suffering. Many are without
                    blankets, and I may say nearly all without tents. The nights are cold, and there
                    is much rain in this mountainous region. Sickness is therefore to be
                    apprehended. In addition to this, they are obliged to carry their ammunition in
                    their pockets, and that which escapes the rain is ruined by the perspiration of
                    the men and the wearing out of the paper cartridges. I asked before leaving
                    Staunton for one thousand cartridge-boxes, but I suppose it will be some time
                    before I shall see them. I shall ask to-day for five hundred tent flies, as it
                    will take too much time to make tents. I simply want something to protect arms
                    and ammunition from rain.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R.S. GARNETT,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
