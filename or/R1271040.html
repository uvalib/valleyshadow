<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes to General John D. Imboden regarding the July, 1863,
                    situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Lee makes reference to prisoners, and
                    Imboden's attempts to dispose of them in Staunton, VA.</p>

<p> Brig. Gen. J. D. Imboden,<br> Comdg. Northwestern
                        Brigade, Woodstock, Va.:</p>
<p>Near Culpeper Court-House,</p>
<p>July 26, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>Your letters of the 23d and 25th instant have been received.</p>
<p>I regret to learn that you have had so much difficulty in disposing of the
                    prisoners after reaching Staunton, and am glad to hear that you lost so few.
                    From the accounts I receive, I fear several hundred must have escaped after
                    crossing the Potomac. I would like to have from you an exact report of the
                    numbers turned over to the authorities at Richmond.</p>
<p>I hope you will get all your cavalry shod and ready for service, and get your
                    command in full force in the field. I desire you to see what force of the enemy
                    is in the Valley, for, from the reports of Gen. Ewell, I doubt whether any
                    crossed at Front Royal, nor do I anticipate that any permanent force will be
                    sent into the Valley from east of the mountains.</p>
<p>If you find that Gen.'s Kelley and Mulligan are still in the neighborhood of
                    Hedgesville, a rapid movement upon Piedmont, or some point higher up the
                    railroad, will be the best means of drawing them west. Col. Wharton, with his
                    infantry at some point above Strasburg, could prevent any advance up the Valley
                    during your absence.</p>
<p>I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
