<p>Col. F. ASBURY, AWL,<br> 201st Regt. Pennsylvania
                        Volunteers: </p>

<p>The commanding general directs that in carrying out the instructions contained in
                    paragraphs 1 and 2, Special Orders, No. 223, headquarters Department of the
                    Susquehanna, of this date, you will march your command as follows: From your
                    present camp to Loudon; from thence to Cove Gap; from thence to Camp Hill, via
                    Mercersburg and Shimpstown; from Camp Hill to Upton; from thence to Greencastle;
                    from thence to Marchel Roads, three miles below Chambersburg; and from there
                    direct to your present places of encampment. The strictest discipline will be
