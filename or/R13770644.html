<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Henry Halleck writes Ulysses S. Grant in June, 1864, with
                    information gathered from a deserting Confederate engineer officer. Halleck
                    reports to Grant on Lee's troop strength, and says that all destroyed railroad
                    track has been repaired. According to Halleck, trains ran regularly from
                    Richmond to Staunton and Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> Bermuda Hundred, Va.:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>June 17, 1864 </p>
<p></p>
<p>A German engineer officer who left Lee's army June 7 says that Pickett's
                    division, about 6,000 infantry, and Breckinridge's division, about 7,000
                    infantry, passed through Gordonsville (in cars) on the 6th and 7th, against
                    Hunter. He did not see their cavalry or artillery. He estimates the entire force
                    left under Lee and Beauregard from 60,000 to 75,000, exclusive of home guards
                    and militia in Richmond. He says that all damage to railroads has been repaired
                    and cars run from Richmond to Charlottesville and Staunton. Lee's army is well
                    supplied with provisions, but ammunition is of inferior quality and much
                    complained of. Many of this man's statements are verified by others.</p>
