<p>W. H. TAYLOR, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Staunton,</p>
<p>May 5, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 16th ultimo did not reach me until the 2d instant. Pressure of
                    business, I regret to say, has prevented an earlier answer.</p>
<p>I so felt the importance of having the cavalry of this district more thoroughly
                    organized, drilled, and disciplined as to induce me to take action in the
                    matter; but Col. Ashby claimed that I could not interfere with his organization,
                    as he was acting under the instructions of the late Secretary of War, Mr.
                    Benjamin. These instructions or authority are contained in letters written on
                    the 21st and 22d of February last, and authorize Col. Ashby to raise cavalry,
                    infantry, and heavy artillery. Copies of these letters have been forwarded to
                    the War Department, accompanied with the indorsed communication from Col. Ashby
                    and my remarks thereon. Col. Ashby and Maj. Funsten are the only field officers
                    belonging to the cavalry under Col. Ashby. Col. Ashby reports that there has
                    never been any regimental organization of any part of his command. When I took
                    steps for organizing, drilling, and disciplining the cavalry both of its field
                    officers sent in their resignations, and such was Col. Ashby's influence over
                    his command that I became well satisfied that if I persisted in my attempt to
                    increase the efficiency of the cavalry it would produce the contrary effect, as
                    Col. Ashby's influence, who is very popular with his men, would be thrown
                    against me.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I regained taking further action in the matter (as I
                    was in the face of the enemy) until the War Department should have an
                    opportunity of acting in the case.</p>
<p>Col. Ashby reports twenty-one companies of cavalry, but he includes a number of
                    men who re-enlisted from the infantry with the understanding that they should
                    serve in the cavalry, but I have uniformly prohibited such re-enlistments, as it
                    is important that men should continue in that arm in which they have been
                    serving. At present there is no field officer on duty with the cavalry referred
                    to, as Col. Ashby and Maj. Funsten are both sick. It is important that the
                    cavalry should be organized into regiments at the earliest practicable moment.</p>
<p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> T. J. JACKSON,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
