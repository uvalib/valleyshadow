<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Early in the war, Staunton, VA, served as an important rendezvous point for
                    Confederate recruits. In this May, 1861, letter, Robert E. Lee writes Colonel
                    George Porterfield concerning his command at Grafton, VA. Lee refers to
                    companies of new recruits sent to that point.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Col. GEORGE A. PORTERFIELD,<br> Commanding, &amp;c.,
                        Grafton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 24, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of the 18th instant, and regret that you have
                    been unsuccessful in organizing the companies of volunteers that out expected.
                    By this time the companies from Staunton must have reached you; also one from
                    Harper's Ferry, and I hope that the true men of that region have been encouraged
                    to come out into the service of the State. I will write to the commanding
                    officer of Harper's Ferry to give you all aid in his power, and I hope you will
                    spare no pains to preserve the integrity of the State, and to prevent the
                    occupation of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad by its enemies. In answer to your
                    inquiry as to the treatment of traitors, I cannot believe that any citizen of
                    the State will betray its interests, and hope all will unite in supporting the
                    policy she may adopt.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R.E. LEE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
