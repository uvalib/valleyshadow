<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson's Assistant Adjutant Fitz-John Porter writes from

<p>Maj. Gen. GEORGE CADWALADER,<br> Commanding First
                        Division, en route to Williamsport:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>June 15, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>The commanding general desires you to give Capt. Newton the necessary aid to
                    carefully reconnoiter the position of the enemy beyond Williamsport, to
                    ascertain if he is really vacating the borders of the Potomac in your vicinity.
                    If the has vacated, the commanding general wishes you to throw a portion, if not
                    the whole, of your division over the river, and send parts well in advance to
                    secure against surprise, and, if it can safely be done, to annoy their retreat.
                    Capt. Newton will advise you of the wishes of the commanding general, and his
                    advice you are desired to take into careful consideration for the purpose of
                    acting upon. If you find the enemy gone, the general wishes Gen. Wynkoop placed
                    as soon as possible near the river, on your line, and Gen. Williams advanced
                    towards Sheperdstown.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
