<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Throughout the war, Staunton, VA, served as an important Confederate supply base.
                    In this June, 1861, letter, Robert E. Lee notifies General Robert Garnett,
                    commanding at Laurel Mountain in what is now West Virginia, that troops are on
                    the way from Staunton with various supplies ordered by Garnett.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS,</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. R.S. GARNETT,<br> Commanding Northwestern
                        Virginia, Laurel Hill, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>June 25, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>On to-morrow the two remaining companies of Col. Fulkerson's regiment, viz, the
                    Thirty-seventh, commanded, respectively, by Capts. Gibson and Wood, and two
                    belonging to the Twentieth, commanded by Capts. Jones and William B. Bruce,
                    leave for your command via Staunton. They will take with them two 6-pounder iron
                    guns, with ammunition, two hundred tents, and the following articles of
                    clothing, viz, seven hundred and twenty overcoats, one thousand pairs of socks,
                    and six hundred pairs of drawers. I am informed by the Quartermaster's
                    Department that at present there are no shirts on hand, but that the number
                    called for in your requisition (five hundred) will be forwarded, together with
                    the balance of the overcoats, as soon as made. By the Quartermaster's statement
                    it appears that six hundred and forty-nine blankets have been previously
                    furnished the troops under your command, and that there is not now a single
                    blanket in store. In addition to the two hundred tents mentioned above, the two
                    companies belonging to the Twentieth Regiment, and before alluded to, take with
                    them twenty-two tents on Col. Gilham's requisition.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R.E. LEE,<br> Gen., Commanding.</p>
