<p>QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE, VIRGINIA VOLUNTEERS,</p>
<p>Governor LETCHER:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>May 26, 1861.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I inclose you the letters of Maj. Turk, Col. Christian, and my special messenger,
                    Doctor Wayt. You will see from the letters that the expedition has proved a
                    success. I have, in accordance with your dispatch by your aide, Col. S. Bassett
                    French, sent 500 shirts and 100 pairs of pants, and directed them to be issued
                    and the captain of each company's receipt to be taken, specifying that the cost
                    of same was to be deducted from the pay of the men. On yesterday I started the
                    battalion cavalry, well armed, to Grafton. The Greenbrier Cavalry, a fine body
                    of men, arrived to-day, and I send W. H. Peyton, esq., down to get army pistols,
                    double-barrel shotguns, or single-barrel shotguns, to enable me to arm this
                    company and send them at once to Grafton. I have nearly sabers enough and ten
                    pairs of pistols and holsters and with the aid you can give me doubtless can arm
                    them. I regret to report the desertion of ten men belonging to the Greenbrier
                    Sharpshooters, Capt. Brown, last night. I have sent after them, and hope to
                    overtake them and bring them back. Maj. Turk and Col. Christian went with the
                    very first men to Harper's Ferry, and when by the action of the convention, they
                    were cut off, without a murmur, when I called on them to head the expedition to
                    Grafton they, with James J. A. Trotter, James E. Carson, and Capt. H. L. Opie,
                    started and traveled night and day with the expedition and have succeeded. Allow
                    me to urge upon Your Excellency that you appoint Col.'s Turk, Christian, and
                    Trotter to such positions as you can assign them in the volunteer service of the
                    State in the northwest. Such service sought to be rewarded, and Turk is one of
                    the most gallant men in the State. Your letter by Mr. Getty came to hand to-day,
                    and I assure you I feel most highly complimented by the estimate you hold my
                    services to my State, which I know far exceeds my merits. Col. Echols has gone
                    to Harper's Ferry, and leaves me in command here. I need aid and H. M. Bell,
                    esq., has been assisting me. Give him an appointment and he will be able, as he
                    has heretofore done, to give efficient aid to the State. Of his qualifications
                    and high character I need not say one word to you, as you know him well.</p>
<p>Yours, truly,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN.</p>
