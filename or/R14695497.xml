                <p>I have the honor to forward the following report of the operations of the Second
                    Brigade, First Cavalry division, during the late cavalry expedition:</p>
                <p>The brigade left Winchester with the cavalry of the Valley, February 27, 1865,
                    and marched without incident of importance by the Valley pike to Staunton,
                    arriving there March 2, having seen no enemy by the way but a small party of
                    fifty cavalry, which made a demonstration on right flank of the brigade February
                    28, but were easily repulsed by a squadron from Sixth New York Cavalry. Near
                    Staunton a detachment of 300 men from Twentieth Pennsylvania, under Maj.
                    Douglass, was sent to Swoope's Station, eight miles west of Staunton, for the
                    destruction of rebel Government property there. The expedition was highly
                    successful, destroying a large amount of valuable quartermaster's and commissary
                    stores, viz, the depot and four barns in the vicinity, containing the following
                    amount of stores: 3,000 pairs of boots, a like number of shirts, drawers, pants,
                    jackets, and blankets; 50,000 pounds of ham and bacon, and a small quantity of
                    ordnance stores, consisting of small-arms and ammunition. At Staunton the Fourth
                    New York (120 strong) and 257 men with unserviceable horses, under Lieut.-Col.
                    Nichols, of the Ninth New York, were sent to the rear, as part of the escort to
                    prisoners and guns captured by Third Division at Waynesborough. The Sixth New
                    York, Maj. White commanding, were left at Staunton for the destruction of rebel
                    property there, and reported to me at night, having destroyed 17 stage coaches,
                    60 wagons, 1 tannery, containing a large quantity of leather, and 1 Government
                    blacksmith shop.</p>
                <p>Leaving Staunton March 3, the brigade marched with the division through
                    Waynesborough and Rockfish Gap, burning a large tannery by the way, and camped
                    seven miles west of Charlottesville; distance made, twenty-nine miles. Arrived
                    at Charlottesville on the 4th of March, and on the 5th the Sixth New York, Ninth
                    New York, and Seventeenth Pennsylvania were detached and sent to assist in the
                    destruction of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad south of Charlottesville. This
                    work was done most effectually, the regiments named demolishing the road for a
                    distance of two miles, burning the ties and heating and bending every rail, and
                    burning two bridges, each fifty feet in length. A rebel caisson, concealed near
                    camp, was also destroyed here. At Charlottesville also was destroyed 2,000
                    pounds of tobacco, 15 wagons loaded with corn, wheat, tobacco, and flour; also a
                    tannery containing 1,000 hides. The command was supplied at Charlottesville with
                    seven days' rations of sugar, coffee, and salt, and marched, March 6, through
                    Scottsville to Howardsville, at the mouth of Rockfish River, on the James,
                    making a march of thirty-three miles and destroying effectually one canal lock
                    at Scottsville. The First New York Dragoons, Maj. Smith commanding, was sent
                    from Howardsville, March 6, with instructions to proceed rapidly to
                    Hardwicksville, twelve miles up the river, and to use his utmost exertions to
                    seize and hold the bridge at that point. The attempt was a failure, Maj. Smith
                    reaching the bridge at early dawn just in time to see it destroyed by fire. It
                    was impossible to save the bridge, each end being filled with straw and a man
                    stationed ready to apply a match on the slightest indication of a hostile
                    approach. Maj. Smith contended himself with destroying 336 sacks of salt, 4
                    bales of cotton, and a large quantity of tobacco, and then rejoined the brigade
                    at Warminster, and, with the Sixth New York, destroyed the locks at that point.</p>
                <p>March 8, the brigade was ordered by Brevet Maj.-Gen. Merritt to proceed without
                    delay to Columbia, to reach there by daylight on 9th, and to remain there until
                    further orders, holding the place and sending back all the information possible
                    regarding the movements of the enemy. The brigade marched at 12 m., reached
                    Scottsville at dark, halted one hour to rest and feed, and then, in a hard rain
                    and through heavy roads, pushed on for Columbia, reaching there at daylight. Two
                    squadrons of the Sixth New York were left to protect the bridge over the
                    Hardware River, and were relieved two days after by Col. Pennington's brigade,
                    of the Third Division, Maj. Farmer, commanding the detachment, having captured
                    and destroyed in the meantime three wagons loaded with commissary stores and a
                    number of horses and mules. The march from Warminster to Columbia, a distance of
                    fifty-six miles, was made in seventeen hours, and was a most severe one, owing
                    to the rain and mud encountered. The loss in horses was less than the severity
                    of the march might be supposed to cause, and this loss was more than made up by
                    animals captured on the route. Before reaching Columbia Capt. Blunt, brigade
                    inspector, with two orderlies, succeeded in capturing three of Fitz Lee's scouts
                    with their horses, arms, and equipments. Arriving at Columbia strong scouting
                    parties were at once sent out on the Richmond and Palmyra roads, and a small
                    party sent back to acquaint Gen. Merritt with the progress of the brigade. This
                    party captured two rebels, with horses, arms, and equipments, near Scottsville.
                    The detachment on Richmond road, fifteen men and one officer, proceeded to
                    Cartersville, eleven miles down the river, to the site of the old bridge, and
                    returned at night without seeing the enemy, after destroying a canal boat and a
                    large amount of commissary stores. The information obtained by this detachment,
                    as well as that sent to Palmyra, was all to the effect that Fitzhugh Lee's
                    division of cavalry was south of the James River, marching toward Columbia in
                    anticipation of our crossing there. According to orders received from Gen.
                    Merritt there was no destruction of property at Columbia, with the exception of
                    breaching the canal. The brigade remained at Columbia until the arrival of the
                    rest of the cavalry on the 10th of March, and then destroyed two naval camps in
                    the vicinity, containing the following property: 1 valuable steam-engine, a
                    great number of workmen's tools, and a large amount of dressed timber.</p>
                <p>March 11, in compliance with orders from Gen. Merritt the brigade proceeded to
                    Goochland Court-House, for the destruction of Government property there. The
                    march was commenced at 6 a.m. and Goochland reached at 1 p.m., the distance made
                    being twenty miles. The advance into Goochland was disputed by a squadron of
                    fifty of the Seventh South Carolina, Gary's brigade, which was charged by Maj.
                    Dinnin, with one squadron of the Ninth New York, and routed, Maj. Dinnin
                    capturing an officer and thirteen enlisted men. A strong scouting party sent out
                    on the river road advanced to within eighteen miles of Richmond, without meeting
                    any opposition. The brigade destroyed all the canal locks between Columbia and
                    Goochland, 10 in number; also 15 canal boats, most of them loaded with grain and
                    commissary stores; 2,000 pounds of tobacco, 4 hogsheads of tobacco, 1 large
                    warehouse, 1 dredge, 1 grist-mill, and 1 saw-mill. The jail at Goochland, in
                    which soldiers had been imprisoned, was also burned. The command left Goochland
                    at 6 p.m. and rejoined the cavalry at Columbia at midnight.</p>
                <p>On the 12th the brigade marched with the cavalry command to within a short
                    distance of Tolersville, on the Virginia Central Railroad, and camped, and the
                    next day assisted in tearing up the track, burning the ties, and bending the
                    rails as far as Frederick's Hall. Marched on the 14th to Beaver Dam, twelve
                    miles; on the 15th to Taylorsville and returned, crossing the North Anna at 4
                    p.m. at lower ford, and camped at Mount Carmel Church. Continued the march next
                    day and reached the White House without further incident March 19.</p>
                <p>During the expedition the brigade has marched over 450 miles, and has destroyed
                    the amount of property shown in the appended list; has captured 51 prisoners of
                    war, 270 horses, and 175 mules. The command has never suffered from scarcity of
                    forage or rations; good foraging parties under competent officers having been
                    able to meet every want. The loss in the brigade has been slight; 1 man killed
                    and 1 wounded by guerrillas, 42 reported missing, chiefly stragglers, who have
                    been picket up by the enemy, and 1 died from disease. The health of the command
                    is perfect; no sick are reported.</p>
                <p>I cannot speak in too high terms of the zeal and intelligence of the members of
                    the staff, whom I found at brigade headquarters on assuming command: Capt.
                    Mahnken, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. Cating, provost-marshal; Capt. Blunt,
                    brigade inspector; Lieut. Chamberlain, ordnance officer, and Doctor Clarke,
                    brigade surgeon, have all performed their duties with energy and ability, and I
                    commend them to my superiors for a proper recognition of their services.</p>
                <p>Report of property destroyed by the Second Brigade, First Cavalry Division,
                    during the late cavalry expedition: 6 1/4 miles railroad, 18 canal locks, 6
                    flat-boats (loaded with tobacco and flour), 12 canal boats, 5 canal-boat loads

                    hogsheads tobacco, 1 jail at Goochland Court-House, 500 cords railroad wood, 1
