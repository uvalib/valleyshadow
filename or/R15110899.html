<p>Maj. Gen. R. E. LEE:</p>
<p>MILITARY RENDEZVOUS, Staunton,</p>
<p>May 21, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have this morning sent off from this post, with orders to report to Col.
                    Jackson, at Harper's Ferry, two companies, one an infantry company from the
                    county of Monroe, numbering eighty-seven men, including commissioned and
                    non-commissioned officers; the other a rifle company from the county of
                    Alleghany, numbering seventy one men, including commissioned and
                    non-commissioned officers. I have armed both companies with flint-lock muskets,
                    a portion of arms brought over from Lexington. I find with the western troops a
                    very great indisposition to take these arms, and it would be better, if
                    possible, to give them the improved arms, as most of them are fine marksmen.
                    There remain here now but three companies, two cavalry companies and a rifle
                    company, which last I will send to Harper's Ferry as soon as I can get them
                    properly equipped, which will be in a day or two. The cavalry companies were
                    ordered here before I reached the post, for the purpose of sending them to the
                    northwest, as I understand. They have not yet been armed, but will be in a day
                    or two, when I shall order them in that direction, in accordance with what seems
                    to have been determined on.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. ECHOLS,<br> Lieut.-Col.</p>
