<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes Jefferson Davis in December, 1864, to inform him of
                    movements in the Shenandoah Valley. Lee reports that he has sent Robert Rodes'
                    division to Staunton to board trains for Richmond.</p>

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> President of the
                        Confederate States:</p>
<p>NEAR PETERSBURG,</p>
<p>December 14, 1864.</p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>After sending my dispatch to you yesterday, knowing that the snow in the Valley
                    was six inches deep and the weather very cold, and presuming that active
                    operations would necessarily be suspended, I directed Rodes' division to march
                    for Staunton and requested the quartermaster-general to send cars to convey it
                    to Richmond. It is now on the road, and should reach Staunton to-morrow evening.
                    If the Quartermaster's Department is active it should arrive in Richmond Friday
                    morning. A dispatch received from Gen. Early last night states that the scouts
                    report that the nineteenth Corps of the enemy had left the Valley, and that the
                    Eighth was under marching order. The latter might be preparing to move nearer
                    the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, for I do not think they will strip it of all
                    defense, of both corps may be coming to Gen. Grant. Col. Withers' scouts report
                    that a New York regiment of infantry and part of the Seventh Regt. of cavalry
                    has left the Kanawha for the Valley, but I supposed they might have been
                    intended to replace the garrison at New Creek. I do not know what may be Gen.
                    Grant's next move; his last against the Weldon railroad and out right flank
                    failed. The expeditions from Plymouth and New Berne against Fort Branch, on the
                    Roanoke, and Kinston, N. C., have both retreated before the forces moved against
                    them back to their former positions, and everything at this time is quiet in the
                    Departments of Virginia and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
