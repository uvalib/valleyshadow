<p><b>Summary:<br></b>After Thomas J. Jackson's May 8, 1862, victory over Union forces under John C. Fremont,
     Stonewall Jackson prepared to turn and attack Nathaniel P. Banks Federals. In this dispatch,
     Jackson orders General Richard Ewell to prepare his men to march. Jackson orders him to send
     any excess cooking and entrenching tools to the supply base of Staunton, VA.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p> Maj.-Gen. EWELL:</p>
<p>LEBANON WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS,</p>
<p>May 17, 1862</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your dispatch of yesterday and that of Col. Munford of the previous day have been received. I
     desire you to encamp beyond New Market on next Wednesday night. If any of the troops at
     Gordonsville cannot join you for want of transportation, please direct them to send their
     cooking utensils and entrenching tools by railroad to Staunton, and, with four days' cooked
     rations in their haversacks, to march at dawn on next Monday morning via Fisher's Gap for New
     Market. Let us, relying upon God for success, prepare for attacking Banks. I can only give you
     these general instructions. If your cavalry, or any part of your force, can, consistently with
     these instructions, damage the Manassas Gap Railroad or otherwise operate against Banks, I hope
     that it will be done. You may expect to hear from me daily until we meet. Give me all the
     information you can respecting Banks' movements.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours,</p>
<p>T. J. JACKSON,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
