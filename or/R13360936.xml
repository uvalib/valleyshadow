                <p>In April, 1864, Union forces in western Virginia prepared to advance in
                    conjunction with Grant's spring campaign. In this letter, Franz Sigel reports on
                    preparations in western Virginia, and the locations and strengths of the
                    Confederates facing him. He informs Grant that Confederate deserters who entered
                    Union lines from Staunton report that General Jubal Early took command in
                    Staunton.</p>

                <p>The troops are mostly on their way west and east, and the necessary arrangements
                    are made at Parkersburg to ship the infantry. The cavalry and trains will go
                    from Parkersburg by land to Charleston, where Gen. Crook wishes that all troops
                    from here should be sent. I sent him five infantry regiments and two regiments
                    of cavalry under Gen. Averell, which will make him about 10,000 effective men.
                    As soon as the troops at Martinsburg are assembled for the greater part I will
                    go there.</p>
                <p>No information has been received in regard to important changes in the position
                    of the enemy. Latest reports say that Early, with 4,000 to 5,000 men, is in the
                    vicinity and north and south of Staunton. The forces of Breckinridge are
                    reported at La Fayette Station, 10 miles west of New River bridge; are estimated
                    at from 6,000 to 8,000 men. They are stationed from Lynchburg to Saltville, and
                    in front of this line to Greenbrier River.</p>
                <p>Deserters from Staunton say that Gen. Early would take command in the valley.
                    They also report that they were left behind by Longstreet in June, 1863, at
                    Staunton, and that they received orders at the commencement of this month to
                    return to Tennessee to join Hood's division. They say that Longstreet in person
                    was at Richmond, but do not know whether his corps has gone East. It may be that
                    Hood's division has been left at or near Cumberland Gap, as reported by Gen.
                    Crook, and that the other divisions have gone to join Lee's army.</p>
                <p>Gen. Crook, to whom I sent the report of Breckinridge, says that this report is
                    very correct as far as the country in his front is concerned. Col. Babcock knows
                    about this report, of which I have sent a copy to the Adjutant-Gen. at
                    Washington.</p>
