<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Assistant Adjutant Charles Halpine writes from Staunton to Colonel Moor of

<p>Col. A. MOOR,<br> 28th Ohio Infty., Cmdg. 1st Brig.,
                        Army of the Shenandoah:</p>
<p>Staunton,</p>
<p>June 8, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>In taking leave of you on the expiration of the term of your regiment, the
                    major-general commanding desires to express to you his high appreciation of your
                    soldierly qualities and services, and his regret at losing you from this
                    command. The masterly management of your brigade at the recent battle of
                    Piedmont, on the 5th instant, did no more than sustain the creditable character
                    given of you by your former commanders. The major-general commanding trusts that
                    the service may not permanently lose so good an officer at a time so critical,
                    and to this end has written a letter to the honorable the Secretary of War, of
                    which I transmit a certified copy herewith.</p>
<p>I am, colonel, with very sincere respect, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>CHAS. G. HALPINE,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
