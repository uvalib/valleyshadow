<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Colonel A. Moor writes General Franz Sigel on the Twenty-eighth Ohio's
                    June, 1864, march from Staunton along with prisoners, refugees, contrabands,
                    sick, and wounded.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. F. SIGEL,<br> Martinsburg, W. Va.:</p>
<p>CAMP CARRINGTON,<br> Near Indianapolis, Ind.,</p>
<p>June 22, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your favor of the 15th instant was delivered to me at Grafton by your scout, but
                    it was impossible for me to answer it or comply with your desire to send copy of
                    my report to Gen. Sullivan, being on the cars with my prisoners. This march from
                    Staunton, in charge of prisoners, refugees, contrabands, sick, wounded, and a
                    mixed mass of soldiers, whose term of service had expired, was by far the
                    heaviest task of duty ever heaped upon me and my cut up regiment, but we did our
                    duty to the last day of our arrival at Camp Morton, else two-thirds of the
                    prisoners would have escaped before reaching Webster. Many officers of rank,
                    availing themselves of the protection offered by my escort and guard, promised
                    me every aid on the march, but I was sadly disappointed. Inclosed please find
                    copy of my official report to Gen. Sullivan, relative to the battle of New
                    Market.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. MOOR,<br>
                        Col. Twenty-eighth Regt. Ohio Volunteers.</p>
