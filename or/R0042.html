<p>Capt. A. J. COHEN, Assistant Adjutant-Gen., First Cavalry
                        Division. </p>
<p></p>
<p>May 12, 1863</p>
<p>CAPT</p>
<p>CAPT.: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this
                    brigade during the recent engagements:</p>
<p>On the morning of April 28, in compliance with orders from division headquarters,
                    I broke camp at Potomac Bridge, and moved with my command to Grove Church, on
                    the Morrisville road. I established my headquarters at the point, and
                    immediately dispatched parties to scour the country, arrest all citizens met
                    with, and watch the river from Bank's Ford to the Rappahannock Bridge. A number
                    of citizens were arrested, and confined in Grove Church until the passage of the
                    army across the river had been assured.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, I was ordered to send the Seventeenth Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry to report to Gen. Howard, and to withdraw my pickets and concentrate the
                    rest of the brigade in the neighborhood of Mount Holly Church; also to furnish
                    guides (acquainted with the country) to the columns of Gen.'s Howard and Meade.</p>
<p>I was unable to concentrate the Eighth Pennsylvania (then picketing on the
                    extreme left) until 3 a. m., when I marched to Mount Holly Church. On arriving
                    near that point, found the Sixth New York had been ordered to the advance of
                    Gen. Slocum's column, white the Eighth Pennsylvania had been ordered to report
                    to Gen. Meade. I was directed to march with that command.</p>
<p>The brigade was thus distributed, as follows: The Seventeenth Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry, Col. Kellogg in command, in advance of the Eleventh Army Corps; the
                    Sixth New York Cavalry, Lieut.-Col. McVicar in command, in advance of the
                    Twelfth Army Corps; the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Maj. Huey in command, and
                    one troop First Michigan Cavalry, in advance of the First Army Corps.</p>
<p>The Sixth New York operated under the direction of Brig.-Gen. Pleasonton,
                    commanding the First Cavalry Division, until the arrival of the corps at
                    Chancellorsville; the Eighth Pennsylvania under the direction of Col. Thomas C.
                    Devin, commanding the Second Brigade, First Cavalry Division, until the morning
                    of May 1.</p>
<p>SEVENTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY.</p>
<p> By referring to the report of Col. Kellogg,[1]
                    commanding the Seventeenth Pennsylvania, I find that his regiment was the first
                    to cross the pontoon bridge at Kelly's Ford on the night of the 28th, when he
                    immediately scouted the country to the front, toward Culpeper, for some miles,
                    finding but few of the enemy, who, being dismounted, retired into the woods. </p>
<p>The regiment then picketed the roads to the front, and at daylight again scouted
                    toward Culpeper some 3 miles, where it was met by a force of the enemy,
                    consisting of about 300 cavalry, one section of artillery, and some infantry.</p>
<p>The regiment was then ordered to cover the right of Gen. Howard's column,
                    scouting all the country to the right of the road from Kelly's to Germanna Ford.
                    This was accomplished by continually skirmishing with the enemy (on the roads to
                    the right), who fell back as our skirmishers advanced. The regiment did not loss
                    a man, killing several of the enemy and taking 1 prisoner.</p>
<p>Owing to a misunderstanding of orders, Col. Kellog had not been aware that there
                    was a wagon train in rear of the column which he was expected to guard and bring
                    forward, and Gen. Steinwehr, commanding division, Eleventh Corps, ordered the
                    regiment back to meet the enemy on the road just passed over by the column.</p>
<p>On going to the rear, they were found posted in a woods, with one section of
                    artillery and at least 300 cavalry, armed with carbines. Not being aware that a
                    train was yet in the rear, and having no carbines with which to dismount and
                    clear the woods, after he had ascertained the force of the enemy, Col. Kellogg
                    returned with his command to Germanna Ford.</p>
<p>He was again ordered to communicate with the train, which he then learned for the
                    first time was still in the rear, returned to where the enemy were posted,
                    charged and drove them down the road for a quarter of a mile, until he came upon
                    a barricade of felled trees across the road. The night being very dark and
                    rainy, he concluded to wait until daylight, having lost in the attack 8 horses
                    but no men. When about moving to the rear again at daylight, he was ordered to
                    the front to cross the Rapidan, scout to the right, and cover the column then
                    marching to Chancellorsville. Picketed all the roads to the right and rear on
                    the night of the 30th ultimo, and may 1 reported back to brigade headquarters,
                    leaving to squadrons with Gen. Howard, charged with the duty of picketing to his
                    right and front, and observing the country toward Orange and Spotsylvania
                    Court-House.</p>
<p>SIXTH NEW YORK CAVALRY.</p>
<p> By referring to the report of Capt. Beardsley,[2]now
                    commanding, I find that his regiment, under the command of Lieut.-Col. McVicar,
                    crossed at Kelly's Ford on the morning of the 29th ultimo in advance of Gen.
                    Slocum's column, and met the rebel cavalry in considerable force at Crook's Run.
                    A sharp skirmish ensued, when the enemy retired, leaving as prisoners 1
                    lieutenant and 1 private of the First North Carolina cavalry. The regiment
                    continued skirmishing and driving the enemy's vedettes to Germanna Ford, on the
                    Rapidan. Near the ford we captured 3 of the First North Carolina Cavalry
                    vedettes, the others retiring across the river. The ford was defended by 200
                    infantry, who were engaged in building a bridge. The regiment here dismounted
                    and engaged the enemy on foot until our infantry came up, when they were
                    speedily dislodged, leaving in our hands about 100 prisoners. At this point the
                    regiment lost 1 non-commissioned officer killed, and Lieut. [John F.] Ramsey and
                    3 privates of Troop E wounded. </p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, the regiment again advanced, and met the enemy in
                    considerable force at Wilderness Run. A fight ensued for the possession of the
                    bridge, but after a short skirmish the rebels retired. The regiment continued to
                    advance, skirmishing, to Louisa Run, where about 20 dismounted men were found
                    picketing the ford; they retired into the woods as the column advanced.</p>
<p>Just about dark the rear guard was vigorously attacked and driven in; this was
                    near the school-house on the road to Spotsylvania Court-House. The regiment was
                    formed into line, faced to the rear in an open field, and sabers were drawn. The
                    enemy were challenged, and found to be the Second Virginia Cavalry, of Lee's
                    brigade. Lieut.-Col. McVicar immediately ordered his men to break by fours, and
                    the charge to be sounded, and, placing himself at the head of this column,
                    charged down the narrow road through the woods, driving and scattering the enemy
                    in every direction, and taking many prisoners. On reaching the forks of the
                    road, the column received a heavy volley from a force drawn up on the left
                    front, instantly killing Lieut.-Col. McVicar and several men. Capt.'s Aitkens
                    and Heermance had previously been wounded, and Lieut.'s Goler and O'Neil
                    dismounted. The advance guard, under Lieut. Bell, formed into line on the
                    right-hand road, allowing the column to reform, when they again charged, and,
                    reaching the ford over Lousia Run, formed into line on the opposite side.</p>
<p>Capt. Beardsley, who was left in the rear with a platoon, secured 12 prisoners
                    and the colonel's body and the wounded officers. Assuming command, he sent
                    orders to the regiment to return to the school-house, but before the messenger
                    reached them he was himself attacked and driven off, leaving his prisoners and
                    wounded officers, but succeeded in joining the regiment by a circuitous route.</p>
<p>Lieut. O'Neil, who succeeded in remounting himself, collected some 60 men and
                    brought them in safety through the enemy's lines.</p>
<p>After the command had all arrived at Louisa Run, it was withdraw to the line of
                    infantry pickets on the Plank road, where it remained until ordered to join the
                    brigade. The prisoners captured, but who afterward escaped during the second
                    attack, were from the Second, Third, Fifth, and Ninth Virginia Cavalry, showing
                    that the regiment was evidently surrounded by a brigade. It was reported by the
                    prisoners that the regiments had just been brought together that evening.</p>
<p>EIGHTH PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY.</p>
<p>The operations of this regiment up to May 1 having been conducted under my
                    direction, I can speak from personal knowledge of the facts. Immediately on
                    ascertaining the proposed route of Gen. Meade, I sent captain Wilson across the
                    river with a squadron, to examine the ford across Mountain Run. Ascertaining
                    that the ford was practicable, I immediately crossed with the regiment, and,
                    sending Maj. Keenan in advance, reached without opposition the intersection of
                    the River road with that of Culpeper. At this point I halted, and sent a part to
                    the right to communicate with Gen. Slocum's column; also a squadron to Barnett's
                    Ford, on my left and rear, to ascertain whether the enemy were still at the
                    point. Having established communication with the column on our right, moved on
                    to Richardsville, at the intersection of the country road to Ely's Ford.</p>
<p>At this point I dispatched Maj. Keenan, with two squadrons, to Richards' Ford, on
                    my left, with instruction to drive the enemy, if possible, from that point, and
                    establish communication with our pickets opposite, and then to join me at Ely's
                    Ford by a by-road along the Rapidan, by which means I trusted to secure my force
                    on this side. I also dispatched Maj. Huey, with two squadrons, to Ely's Ford (in
                    my front), with instructions to carefully approach the open ground in the
                    neighborhood of the ford, in order that we might make disposition to secure any
                    force on this side. I then awaited the approach of Gen. Meade, explained my
                    dispositions, which he approved of, and desired me to go on to Ely's Ford, and
                    inform him of the state of affairs there. On reaching Ely's Ford, I found a
                    picket of 10 men on the opposite side. They did not attempt to retire, and I
                    sent to Gen. Meade for instructions, as I had understood that he did not wish to
                    cross until he heard from the column at Germanna.</p>
<p>On Gen. Meade's arrival, he ordered me to cross the ford, which I did with Maj.
                    Huey and Lieut. Daily's troop, of Eighth Pennsylvania, the remainder of the
                    detachment following. The enemy's pickets remained until we had nearly crossed
                    the ford, when they fled by the road to Chancellorsville. Sending the detachment
                    first across in pursuit, I stopped the second squadron, and sent it, with a
                    competent guide, to scour the country to the right toward the Orange Plank road
                    and Germanna, from which point I expected the enemy would be driven about that
                    time. Gen. Griffin having crossed with his division, I picketed the roads to the
                    right and left and went into camp. In the meantime the squadron sent to
                    barnett's Ford, having found no enemy, joined Maj. Keenan, and the detachment,
                    proceeding to Richards' Ford, surprised the enemy in their rifle-pits, and
                    captured 28 men and 1 commissioned officer.</p>
<p>The next morning, April 30, at 3 o'clock, I sent Maj. Huey, with three squadrons,
                    to reach the United States Ford, if practicable, and open communication with our
                    forces opposite. The enemy were met on the road to Chancellorsville just before
                    reaching the intersection of that leading to the United States Ford. The advance
                    guard, under Lieut. Carpenter, charged down on them, capturing one company of
                    the Twelfth Virginia, with all their officers (3). The enemy then retreated to
                    their rifle-pits, and some severe skirmishing ensued, when, by a brilliant
                    charge, they were driven from their works to a wood in their rear. Capt.
                    McCallum, Eighth Pennsylvania, had his horse killed under him.</p>
<p>Having come up by this time with the other squadrons, I directed the skirmishers
                    to advance. The woods were soon cleared, and the command charged into
                    Chancellorsville, from which place the rebels retreated in haste. Six prisoners
                    were captured in this last skirmish.</p>
<p>I immediately notified Gen. Meade of the occupation of Chancellorsville, with a
                    request that the point, from its evident importance, might be occupied in force.</p>
<p>On Gen. Meade's arrival, I was ordered to proceed in the direction of banks' Ford
                    and ascertain the presence of the enemy at that point. Proceeding down the old
                    Fredericksburg turnpike, I ascertained that Mahone's (rebel) brigade was just
                    ahead of me, and on reaching the foot of a hill beyond the crest of which the
                    roads from the United States and banks' Fords intersect, we came upon the
                    enemy's pickets, who retired very slowly, rendering it evident that they were
                    confident of support.</p>
<p>Maj. Keenan, who was in advance with two squadrons, here dismounted a part of his
                    command, and, deploying them on each side of the road as skirmishers, advanced
                    through the thick woods that led to the crest of the hill. A brass gun,
                    evidently masked, could be seen on the left of the crest, raking the road. As
                    the skirmishers neared the crest through the woods, the enemy opened a heavy
                    fire on them from at least a regiment, and compelled them to withdraw.</p>
<p>Ascertaining that the enemy had works of some kind on the hill, and feeling that
                    my force was not sufficient to force their position, I sent word to Gen. Meade,
                    who sent down Griffin's division. Gen. Griffin, having sent a brigade into the
                    woods and felt the enemy's position, withdrew (by orders) to Chancellorsville
                    with out engaging them. The regiment lost 3 men wounded in this skirmish. After
                    dark I withdrew the regiment half a mile, and behind the Run, and went into
                    camp, leaving my vedettes in front.</p>
<p>The next morning, May 1, at sunrise, I was ordered to report to Gen. Hooker in
                    Person, and soon after the pickets were driven in, the regiment went to their
                    support, and severe skirmishing ensued. Several charges were made by the
                    regiment, and the ground was held until the arrival of Gen. Sykes with his
                    division, when, after a sharp action, the position was carried. A detachment
                    from the Eighth Pennsylvania, sent to the left, captured 17 prisoners. The
                    regiment then went into camp with the brigade.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of May 2, the brigade (with the exception of a squadron of the
                    Sixth New York, under Capt. Crocker, on picket at Ely's Ford), was ordered to
                    the front, in rear of Gen. Howard's line, and on the right of general Sykles',
                    about 1 mile from Chancellorsville. Shortly after, I was ordered to report with
                    the Sixth New York to Gen. Birney, then about 3 miles to the left. On reporting
                    to him, he ordered me to return with my command with my command and ascertain in
                    the Plank road was open to Chancellorsville. His infantry columns were at that
                    time retiring.</p>
<p>I succeeded in reaching the field where I had left the brigade under Gen.
                    Pleasonton, and found the infantry about forming line. I immediately ordered a
                    detachment to make their way to the Plank road by the road we had come. When
                    half-way, they were fired upon from skirmishers in the woods, and finally ran
                    into the enemy's infantry, in column, and were driven back. I immediately formed
                    the Sixth New York in line, facing the road, reported the facts to Gen. Whipple,
                    who ordered his skirmishers to the front, and to Gen. Birney as soon as he came
                    upon the field. I then retired my command into the hollow in rear of the line,
                    where the Seventeenth Pennsylvania reported to me. I was ordered by Gen. Sickles
                    to post vedettes around the skirt of woods that encompassed the position. I
                    assigned this duty to the Sixth New York. I had previously thrown out pickets on
                    the extreme left, near Gen. Birney's former position. In the meantime the Eighth
                    Pennsylvania (which command I had left on the field with Gen. Pleasonton) had
                    been sent to the support of Gen. Howard, and, finding his line of battle broken
                    and retired to their rear, had charged down on the enemy's lines between them
                    and the brick house, which they succeeded reaching, losing Maj. Keenan, Capt.
                    Arrowsmith, Adjutant Haddock, and about 30 men and 80 horses. The charge,
                    however, had the effect of disordering and checking the enemy at that point. The
                    regiment then formed as provost in front of the brick house, where it remained
                    for the night. The Seventeenth Pennsylvania had, by order of Gen. Pleasonton,
                    been formed in support of the batteries with which he had driven back the enemy'
                    advance after the Eleventh Corps had broken. Their steadiness under the severe
                    fire elicited much commendation.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 3d, I was ordered by Maj.-Gen. Sickles to hold my
                    command in readiness to cover the movement of his column from the field. I drew
                    in my vedettes and awaited the movement. The fire becoming very hot, and working
                    around to my right and rear, I formed the two regiments (Sixth New York and
                    Seventeenth Pennsylvania) in the hollow on the left of the battle-line, but the
                    fire from the front, right, and left had by this time so become so concentrated
                    on the position that it was unless to look for cover, and my men began to drop
                    fast, although the line was steady as a rock. At this moment I was ordered to
                    report to Gen. Hooker with my command.</p>
<p>I succeeded with some difficulty in saving my pickets in the woods on the extreme
                    left, bringing them in when nearly surrounded and under a heavy fire. On
                    reporting to Gen. Hooker, I was ordered to form my command as skirmishers in
                    rear of the line of battle, and to prevent any stragglers passing through. This
                    position I maintained until the change of front to the white house, where I
                    formed a new line, which was maintained until the close of the action.</p>
<p>About nightfall, the general commanding the division ordered the Seventeenth
                    Pennsylvania to cross the United States Ford and supply themselves with rations
                    and forage. I remained with the Sixth New York, bivouacked in rear of the line
                    of battle. The squadron of the Sixth New York, which had been picketing Ely's
                    Ford, here reported. They had been completely cut off from our army, and had to
                    fight their way through the enemy's skirmishers to our lines, losing several men
                    and horses. They only came in by direction of the field officer in command of
                    our outposts on that line.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th instant, I was ordered to report to division
                    headquarters, when I was directed to place the Eighth and Seventeenth
                    Pennsylvania in camp. The Eighth had on the previous day been picketing from
                    Hartwood to Kelly's Ford.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 4th, the Eighth Pennsylvania was ordered to report to
                    Gen. Sedgwick, at Banks' Ford, who directed it to report to Gen. Howe, then
                    severely pressed.</p>
<p>When Sedgwick's corps crossed the river, Troops C and I, under Lieut.'s Garrett
                    and Baker, formed the extreme rear guard, remaining until after the bridges were
                    taken up, when they were obliged to swim their companies across the river.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th instant, the brigade was ordered to Falmouth, where it
                    encamped the same night.</p>
<p>Where all did so bravely and well it is hard to discriminate, but I cannot avoid
                    recurring with admiration to the cool bravery of Lieut. Garrett, of the Eighth
                    Pennsylvania Cavalry, who had been left on picket some miles down the Plank road
                    toward Fredericksburg at the time that our column on the left commenced to
                    retire, on the afternoon of May 1. Scorning to come in without orders, he
                    remained in rear of our retiring column, dismounted and deployed his little band
                    of 30 men, steadily faced the enemy's advancing line, and fought his way back
                    step, killing several of the enemy's skirmishers, and himself losing 5 horses,
                    his own being killed under him. I drew him in from within less than half a mile
                    from the brick house, having skirmished back 1 1/2 miles. He acted with the same
                    coolness when left by Gen. Howe to cover his rear, remaining until too late to
                    cross the bridge, being obliged to swim his squadron across.</p>
<p>Capt. McCallum and Lieut.'s Daily, Carpenter, and Baker, of the Eighth
                    Pennsylvania Cavalry, and Lieut.'s Ramsey and Bell, of the Sixth New York, were
                    also distinguished for their bravery in advance of the columns. Lieut. Blunt, of
                    the Sixth New York, with an escort of 4 men, succeeded in communicating with
                    Gen. Verell at Rapidan Station, passing through the enemy's lines via
                    Stevensburg (then occupied by them) both going and returning with admirable
                    coolness, sometimes deceiving and at others eluding their patrols.</p>
<p>The regimental commandeers, Col. Kellogg, Maj. Huey, and Capt. Beardsley, were
                    cool, prompt, and ready in carrying out my orders, and in no one case failed in
                    their execution while under my command.</p>
<p>Of those that we have lost their reputation belongs to the whole command. The
                    daring bravery of McVicar and the spending fighting of Keenan will not soon be
                    forgotten by those who witnessed it.</p>
<p>Capt. Aitkens and Heermance, of the Sixth New York, and captain Arrowsmith and
                    Adjutant Haddock, of the Eighth Pennsylvania (supposed to be wounded and in the
                    hands of the enemy), were also distinguished for bravery.</p>
<p>Were I to enumerate every officer who behaved well, I have to send you the roster
                    of the whole command. Those mentioned above are simply officers whose position
                    or duties gave them opportunity to distinguish themselves.</p>
<p>Lieut.'s [Henry] Mahnken and [Raymond L.] Wright, of the brigade staff, were
                    constantly under fire, and willing, prompt, and cool in the transmission of
                    orders.</p>
<p>I respectfully inclose tabular lists of killed, wounded, and missing, prisoners
                    taken by this brigade, and property lost and captured.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>THOS. C. DEVIN, Col., Cmdg. Brigade.</p>
