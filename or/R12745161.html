<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch writes Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in June, 1863,
                    to inform him that a Union telegraph operator outside Chambersburg reported that
                    a man on horseback claimed that Confederate troops entered the town.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. Stanton:</p>
<p>Harrisburg,</p>
<p>June 16, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch received, &amp;c. My last dispatch, about 10 last evening, from
                    the operator a few miles this side of Chambersburg, stated that a gentleman who
                    was to notify him of the enemy's arrival rode to the office, and said that
                    several mounted men had just come in, saying they were Southern soldiers. This
                    was two hours after Lieut. Charles W. Palmer, who had a small force of Maryland
                    cavalry, came in from Greencastle with his column, reporting the rebels near.
                    One company of cavalry recruits was sent out last night from Carlisle in the
                    direction of Chambersburg. Nothing heard from them as yet. Our measures have
                    been taken to get correct reports. Capt. Boyd, First New York Cavalry, is in
                    this section.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
