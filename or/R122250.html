<p><b>Summary:<br></b>On July 11, 1861, Union troops under George B. McClellan won a lopsided victory
                    over Robert S. Garnett's Confederates at the battle of Laurel Mountain, West
                    Virginia. Garnett lost his life in the battle, and the Confederacy would
                    eventually loose what is now the state of West Virginia. Staunton, Virginia,
                    served as an important Confederate supply base and organizing ground for troops
                    during this campaign. In this letter, Confederate General Henry Jackson
                    discusses Laurel Mountain and the movement of troops through Staunton. The
                    Confederate reinforcements included local militia who, in Jackson's opinion,
                    will do more harm than good.</p>

<p>BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS,</p>
<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>Camp at Monterey, Va., </p>
<p>July 16 [18?], 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Inclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit copies of correspondence with
                    Maj.-Gen. McClellan, of the U. S. Army, which will explain themselves. Further
                    information received has confirmed into assurance the hope expressed in my last
                    letter that the retreating column of Gen. Garnett had not been so wholly
                    [dispersed] after his death as was first supposed. I have good reason to believe
                    that by Friday next some twenty-five hundred or three thousand men connected
                    with it will join me here.</p>
<p>I also learn that a company of artillery with four pieces, and capable of
                    effective service, has escaped the disasters of the last week almost intact.
                    With an Arkansas regiment, understood to be approaching from Staunton, this
                    accession will raise my command to some seven thousand men. I have sent a
                    courier to met Col. Ramsey, with a direction that the artillery and cavalry be
                    advanced with all possible dispatch. So soon as I can control their services, I
                    hope to occupy the stronghold of the Alleghany Mountains, which commands this
                    road, the indications of yesterday having suggested that the enemy may conclude
                    to advance by that route.</p>
<p>The work of reorganization is going on in this camp quite perceptibly, I think,
                    but I have been somewhat alarmed by a notification from Maj. Harman,
                    quartermaster at Staunton, that within five days five thousand troops, whom I
                    suppose to be the militia of the adjoining county, will be upon the march to
                    join me here. It is questionable whether so large a body of wholly undiscipline
                    men, however zealous and patriotic they may be, will be able to compensate, by
                    service in the field, for the disorganization they must occasion in the camp,
                    and for the labor of arming, transporting, and supplying them. Supposing that
                    the death of Gen. Garnett, and the relief of his command from immediate danger
                    in removing the necessity for their services, may prevent their assemblage and
                    forward movement, and exceedingly loth to interference with any direction from
                    the State authorities, I shall leave all communication with Maj. Harman upon
                    this subject to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Permit me again to reiterate that what we need upon this line is good engineers,
                    artillery of a heavier caliber than we now have to meet such moving with the
                    enemy, and mountain howitzers, which the character of this country would render
                    eminently effective.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>HENRY R. JACKSON, <br> Brig.-Gen., &amp;c.</p>
