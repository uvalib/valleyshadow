<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General George Crook writes to report his May, 1864, progress toward
                    Staunton, VA. Crook reports his intention to get supplies from the countryside,

<p>COMDG. GEN. DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA:</p>
<p>LEWISBURG,</p>
<p>May 31, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Left Meadow Bluff this morning. Expect to be in Staunton in about six days. We
                    can get plenty of fresh beef in this country, but the other necessary supplies
                    cannot be obtained in the country, even if every pound was taken from the
                    people. I shall, however, drain the country of all supplies as I pass through.
                    Owing to the miserable transportation sent me here my command is in very low
                    state. I shall insist on having an investigation of this matter, so as to have
                    guilty parties punished. It came very near making the whole expedition a
                    failure. It will be indispensably necessary to have to meet me at Staunton the
                    following articles of supplies: Fifty kegs of horseshoes, 1,500 pounds of
                    horseshoe nails, 500 hats, 1,000 blouses, 1,000 pants, 1,500 shirts, 2,000 pairs
                    drawers, 3,000 pairs socks, 2,000 pairs boots, 1,000 haversacks, 1,000 canteens,
                    500 ponchos, for the Second Cavalry Division. Two thousand pairs infantry pants,
                    5,000 pairs stockings, 2,000 pairs shoes, 1,200 pairs drawers, 3,000 shirts,
                    3,000 blouses, 3,000 hats, 3,000 canteens, 3,000 haversacks, 50 kegs fitted
                    horseshoes, 25 kegs fitted mule shoes, 10 sacks horseshoe nails, 100 6-mule
                    wagons with teams complete, with forage for 1,500 animals, for the Second
                    Infantry Division. One hundred thousand rations hard bread, coffee, sugar, salt,
                    half rations salt meat. Send to the medical director field supplies of medicine,
                    dressings, applications, stimulants, anti-periodics, astringents, morphia,
                    anesthetics, antiscorbutics, fruit, vegetables, and extracts, of Government and
                    Sanitary Commission, sufficient for eight cavalry regiments and twelve infantry.</p>
