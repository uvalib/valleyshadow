                <p>Alex H. H. Stuart writes to Confederate Secretary of War Leroy P. Walker in July,
                    1861, to complain about Michael G. Harman's position of command at Staunton, VA.
                    Stuart argues that a military officer is needed to properly oversee such an
                    important rendezvous point for Confederate soldiers. Stuart says that Harman has
                    alienated army officers and prominent civilians, and alarmed the public by
                    calling out the militia and sending them to the front without proper provisions
                    made for defense of the town.</p>

                </opener>
                <p>As Staunton has been made one of the places of rendezvous for the troops called
                    into service, I regard it of the highest importance that there should be a
                    military officer of intelligence and character in command of the post.
                    Everything is now in the hands of the quartermaster, M. G. Harman, who is a
                    civilian unacquainted with military law or usages, and who has rendered himself
                    exceedingly obnoxious to officers and soldiers. To-day there was a state of
                    things which threatened an emeute. I was induced to interpose to prevent it, but
                    there is no knowing what may be the consequence if some change is not made. I
                    should be very much gratified if you could make a visit here or send some
                    confidential agent. You would learn things that would surprise you. The officer
                    in command here should be a calm, dignified man, who would possess the
                    confidence of the public. The expenditures at this point are enormous and the
                    public interests would not suffer from being vigilantly looked after. You can
                    scarcely imagine the depth of the feeling occasioned by the call for the militia
                    en masse. Men go to the battle-field with very little alacrity when they feel
                    that they leave their wives and children exposed to horrors to which their own
                    perils are as nothing. The case ought to be modified, or the people may be
                    driven to desperation.</p>
