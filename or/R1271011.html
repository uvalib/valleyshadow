<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this July, 1863, letter, Robert E. Lee writes to General John Imboden and his
                    cavalry en route for Staunton. Lee mentions prisoners, and Imboden's orders to
                    operate on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. Imboden,<br> Comdg. Northwestern
                        Virginia Brigade:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 16, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>From the reports I have received of your progress, I am in hopes you will reach
                    Staunton to-day. Dispose of your prisoners as soon as possible, and return to
                    Winchester. Your services are much needed here now to operate against your old
                    enemy, who has advanced from the west along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and
                    relaid the track as far as Cherry Run. Col. Imboden with his cavalry will be
                    sent to ascertain the position and force of the enemy, so as to determine what
                    your movements should be when you reach Winchester. Collect all your available
                    men, leaving only the feeble to guard the Shenandoah Mountain, and have your
                    horses shod, and every preparation made for active operations. Also inform me
                    about the time you will reach Strasburg, that I may send you information and
                    instructions there, if necessary.</p>
<p>I am, with much respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
