<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Adjutant General Robert Chilton writes to John Imboden concerning his
                    October, 1862, efforts to procure cattle and horses in western Virginia. Chilton
                    instructs Imboden to send to Staunton all the leather he can gather.</p>

<p>Col. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c., Petersburg,
                        Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 23, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Your letter to Gen. Jackson, of the 20th instant, just received by the commanding
                    general, to whom it was referred. He has referred to the chief quartermaster and
                    commissary of this army the portions relating to the procurement of horses and
                    cattle. Proceed as you have done heretofore, procuring all of each as far as
                    possible, not delaying to receive Federal money, which will, if to be obtained,
                    be sent to you.</p>
<p>The commanding general wishes you, if news from Loring is corroborated
                    satisfactory, to cross the mountains for co-operation with his forces, as
                    preferable to any independent move, it being most important to damage, in every
                    possible way, their lines of communication, by destroying bridges, tanks,
                    tunnels, &amp;c., on the railroads. This operation will not interfere with
                    your prosecution of your present work, which may be continued upon your return,
                    in which event it is hoped you will bring over all the horses and cattle to be
                    procured west of the mountains. If Yankee money can be procured, a special agent
                    will be sent forward to make, under your direction, the contemplated purchases.
                    It is desired that you will send out of reach of the enemy all the leather which
                    can be procured, advising Col. Davidson, commanding at Staunton, whenever
                    sending it out, in order that he may, as instructed, send wagons to transport it
                    to Staunton.</p>
<p>The commanding general desires me to renew to you this thanks for the activity
                    and energy you have displayed in your operations, and to express his best wishes
                    and hopes for your success in the anticipated enterprise.</p>
<p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. H. CHILTON,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
