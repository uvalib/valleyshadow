<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Provost Marshal George Eyster, stationed at Chambersburg, writes in June,
                    1863, to Provost Marshal General J. B. Fry concerning efforts to enforce the
                    draft in Bedford County. Eyster reports that attempts to procure troops from
                    Carlisle Barracks to enforce enrollment failed, and that he is going ahead in
                    attempting to secure citizen guards, sheriffs and prominent men to prevent open
                    and covert resistance to the authority of military enrollers. He also describes
                    some of the violent actions of the resisters.</p>

<p>Col. J. B. FRY:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG,</p>
<p>June 12, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Although advised by the commandant at Carlisle on the 8th instant that a cavalry
                    force of sixty men could be spared for service in this district, upon my
                    telegraphing yesterday that the detachment should proceed to the scene of
                    disturbance I was advised no troops could be spared and referred to the U. S.
                    officer in command at Harper's Ferry. To order troops from either Baltimore or
                    Harper's Ferry to Bedford County, especially mounted men, would consume probably
                    two days and a half, if not three, and I take it that it is desirable that the
                    enrollment should not be delayed even for that length of time to await the
                    arrival of a military force. I have consequently directed my deputy to require
                    all enrollers inclined to desist to proceed, and authorized him to call upon
                    citizens for a posse comitatus to protect them at their work and aid in
                    arresting persons who have resisted and assisted to resistance of the
                    enrollment. He is instructed to report to me the names of such citizens as are
                    called upon and refuse to give their services. I have called into requisition
                    the assistance of the sheriff in that county, and have asked prominent gentlemen
                    to aid by their counsel and influence in the execution of the order.</p>
<p>You have been advised that the resistance takes the shape of intimidation by
                    secret incendiarism and attempted assassination, If the effort to procure
                    citizen guards fails, which is not improbable, you will please advise me from
                    what quarter to order troops.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. EYSTER,<br> Provost-Marshal Sixteenth District of Pennsylvania.</p>
