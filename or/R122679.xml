                <p>The commanding general directs the following movements to take place on Saturday
                    morning:</p>
                <p>The First Brigade, Col. Thomas commanding, will march by the Williamsport and
                    Greencastle road, leaving Hagerstown to the left, and establish its camp near
                    Williamsport, but far enough from the river to be free from the enemy's shot. He
                    will hold Williamsport and protect the artillery.</p>
                <p>The Fourth Brigade, Col. Miles commanding, will follow the First Brigade, and
                    locate its camp temporarily on stream in the rear and on the right of First
                    Brigade.</p>
                <p>The Third Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Williams commanding, will take the Hagerstown
                    turnpike and the direct road to Sharpsburg, and establish its camp near head of
                    stream. This brigade will throw a large picket towards Sharpsburg.</p>
                <p>The Second Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Wynkoop commanding, will proceed by rail to
                    Hagerstown and march on the Frederick turnpike to vicinity of Funkstown.</p>
                <p>The Fifth Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Negley commanding, will move by rail as rapidly as
                    possible, and be established on the Hagerstown and Williamsport turnpike.</p>
                <p>The quartermaster will provide wagon transportation in Hagerstown for this and
                    the preceding column.</p>
                <p>Each brigade will post its guards and sentinels so as to secure a continuous line
                    from camp to camp, and place its pickets far enough in advance and on the flanks
                    to secure against surprise.</p>
                <p>Each brigade will protect the adjoining one, and in case of attack go to its
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>The Fifth Brigade will, in addition to being the reserve, provide the guards for
                    the store-houses, hospitals, &amp;c., in the vicinity of Hagerstown.</p>
                <p>In selecting camps, the commanding officers will have a regard for defense and
                    drill and healthy locations.</p>
                <p>Gen. Cadwalader will see to the location of the camp of each brigade and
                    administration of affairs.</p>
                <p>Gen. Keim will see to the execution of orders in this vicinity, until the
                    departure of his division, when he will join it in front of Hagerstown.</p>
                <p>Immediately on arrival of a train in Hagerstown the regiments will be formed and
                    marched through town and be located on its ground in line of battle, its pickets
                    thrown out and guards established.</p>
                <p>The men must be kept in camp ready at all times for instant action, and be
                    drilled in the school of the company and regiment.</p>
