<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert C. Schenck writes General Darius Couch in June, 1863,
                    concerning reports of advancing Confederates. Schenck declares that the people
                    of Pennsylvania are in a panic, probably due to mistaking Union cavalry
                    escorting wagon trains to Chambersburg for Confederate troops.</p>

<p>Gen. Couch:</p>
<p>Baltimore,</p>
<p>June 15, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have not troops at Conewago Bridge, and have not thought of destroying it. What
                    proof is there that the enemy has appeared at Hagerstown? I wonder if a panic
                    was not created by a detachment of the First New York Cavalry I had there at 9.
                    They were escorting and following wagon trains from Martinsburg, which I ordered
                    them to take through Greencastle to Chambersburg, and turn over to the
                    quartermaster at latter place. I have just been assured by telegraph from
                    Frederick that until afternoon to-day not a single Confederate soldier had
                    appeared at either Shepherdstown or Williamsport this side of the enemy. I think
                    your people are in a panic, that thus far is in a good measure causeless.
                    Milroy, from Winchester, has cut his way through to Harper's Ferry.</p>
