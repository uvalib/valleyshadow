<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union cavalry commander Alfred Pleasonton reports to Lieut.-Colonel Dickinson on
                    November, 1862, movements in the Shenandoah Valley. He reports Hill's division

<p>Lieut.-Col. DICKINSON,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Center Grand Division:</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 17, 1862</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>A contraband just in, who left Strasburg last Thursday, states that D. H. Hill's
                    corps was 2 miles beyond that place, on the railroad to Mount Jackson. Hill was
                    tearing up the road and destroying the bridges. The rebels thought we intended
                    following them in that valley. D. H. Hill was en route to Staunton. Jackson's
                    corps was between Strasburg and Winchester; Ewell and A. P. Hill were with
                    Jackson. Provisions were scarce, and the rebels were obliged to move to get
                    them. My pickets on the Orleans road have been attacked this morning by Stuart's
                    cavalry. I have sent out re-enforcements. They have also attacked me on the
                    Waterloo road; nothing serious, however. No enemy in sight at Sulphur Springs. I
                    have sent half a regiment to Fayetteville, to guard the fords. Averell's brigade
                    will cover the road behind the Fifth Corps, in the direction of Warrenton
                    Junction. The Second Brigade will take the Fayetteville road. I shall move with
                    this latter brigade. My headquarters to-night will be near the junction with the
                    Warrenton Junction road.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>A. PLEASONTON,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Division.</p>
