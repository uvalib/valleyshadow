<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan commanded the Cavalry of the Army of the Potomac
                    which included the 16th and 21st Pa. Cavalry. Sheridan reports on the pursuit of
                    the enemy.</p>

<p></p>
<p>General</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 16, 1865.</p>
<p>GEN</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following narrative of the operations of my
                    command during the recent campaign in front of Petersburg and Richmond,
                    terminating with the surrender of the rebel Army of Northern Virginia at
                    Appomattox Court-House, Va., on April 9, 1865:</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>On the 7th instant the pursuit was continued early in the morning by the cavalry,
                    Gen. Crook in the advance. It was discovered that the enemy had not been cut off
                    by the Army of the James, and, under the belief that he would attempt to escape
                    on the Danville road through Prince Edward Court-House, Gen. Merritt was ordered
                    to move his two divisions to that point, passing around the left of the Army of
                    the James. Gen. Crook continued the direct pursuit, encountering the main body
                    of the enemy at Farmville and again on the north side of the Appomattox, where
                    the enemy's trains were attacked by Gen. Gregg, and a sharp fight with the
                    enemy's infantry ensued, in which Gen. Gregg was unfortunately captured. On
                    arriving at Prince Edward Court-House I found Gen. Mackenzie, with his division
                    of cavalry from the Army of the James, and ordered him to cross the bridge on
                    the Buffalo River, and make a reconnaissance to Prospect Station on the
                    Lynchburg railroad, and ascertain if the enemy were moving past that point.
                    Meantime I heard from Gen. Crook that the enemy had crossed to the north side of
                    the Appomattox, and Gen. Merritt was then moved on and encamped at Buffalo
                    Creek, and Gen. Crook was ordered to recross the Appomattox and encamp at
                    Prospect Station.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th Merritt and Mackenzie continued the march to Prospect
                    Station, and Merritt's and Crook's commands then moved on to Appomattox Depot, a
                    point on the Lynchburg railroad five miles south of Appomattox Court-House.
                    Shortly after the march commenced, Sergeant White, one of my scouts, notified me
                    that there were four trains of cars at Appomattox Depot loaded with supplies for
                    Gen. Lee's army. Gen.'s Merritt and Crook were at once notified, and the command
                    pushed on briskly for twenty-eight miles. Gen. Custer had the advance, and, on
                    nearing the depot, skillfully threw a force in rear of the trains and captured
                    them. Without halting a moment he pushed on, driving the enemy (who had reached
                    the depot about the same time as our cavalry) in the direction of Appomattox
                    Court-House, capturing many prisoners and twenty-five pieces of artillery, a
                    hospital train, and a large park of wagons. Gen. Devin coming up went in on the
                    right of Custer. The fighting continued till after dark, and the enemy being
                    driven to Appomattox Court-House I at once notified the lieutenant-general, and
                    sent word to Gen.'s Ord and Gibbon, of the Army of the James, and Gen. Griffin,
                    commanding the Fifth Corps, who were in rear, that if they pressed on, there was
                    now no means of escape for the enemy, who had reached "the last ditch."</p>
<p>During the night, although we knew that the remnant of Lee's army was in our
                    front, we held fast with the cavalry to what we had gained, and ran the captured
                    trains back along the railroad to a point where they would be protected by our
                    infantry that was coming up.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fourth and Fifth Corps and one division of the Twenty-fifth Corps
                    arrived about daylight on the 9th at Appomattox Depot. After consulting with
                    Gen. Ord, who was in command of these corps, I rode to the front, near
                    Appomattox Court-House, and just as the enemy in heavy force was attacking the
                    cavalry with the intention of breaking through our lines, I directed the
                    cavalry, which was dismounted, to fall back gradually, resisting the enemy, so
                    as to give time for the infantry to form its lines and march to the attack, and
                    when this was done to move off to the right flank and mount. This was done, and
                    the enemy discontinued his attack as soon as he caught sight of our infantry. I
                    moved briskly around the left of the enemy's line of battle, which was falling
                    back rapidly, heavily pressed by the advance of the infantry, and was about to
                    charge the trains and the confused mass of the enemy, when a white flag was
                    presented to Gen. Custer, who had the advance, and who sent the information to
                    me at once that the enemy desired to surrender.</p>
<p>Riding over to the left at Appomattox Court-House I met Maj.-Gen. Gordon, of the
                    rebel service, and Maj.-Gen. Wilcox. Gen. Gordon requested a suspension of
                    hostilities pending negotiations for a surrender then being held between
                    Lieut.-Gen. Grant and Gen. Lee. I notified him that I desired to prevent the
                    unnecessary effusion of blood, but as there was nothing definitely settled in
                    the correspondence, and as an attack had been made on my lines with the view to
                    escape, under the impression our force was only cavalry, I must have some
                    assurance of an intended surrender. This Gen. Gordon gave, by saying that there
                    was no doubt of the surrender of Gen. Lee's army. I then separated from him,
                    with an agreement to meet these officers again in half an hour, at Appomattox
                    Court-House. At the specified time, in company with Gen. Ord, who commanded the
                    infantry, I again met this officer, also Lieut.-Gen. Longstreet, and received
                    from them the same assurance, and hostilities ceased until the arrival of
                    Lieut.-Gen. Grant.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
