<p>HDQRS. MONTEREY LINE,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Camp Alleghany,</p>
<p>December 19, 1861.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the engagement with the enemy
                    which occurred at this place on the 13th instant:</p>
<p>On the 12th I sent out a scouting party of 106 men, commanded by Maj. John D. H.
                    Ross, of the Fifty-second Virginia Volunteers, with instructions to ambuscade a
                    point on the pike beyond Camp Baxter, on Greenbrier. On the afternoon of that
                    day the advance guard of the enemy approached, were fired into by Maj. Ross's
                    command, and many of them killed or wounded. Immediately the main body of the
                    enemy approached in force, deployed, and advanced upon our scouting party, who
                    retired and came into camp that night.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, about 4 a.m., I was aroused by the officer of the
                    day, who reported firing at the advance pickets on the pike in the direction of
                    the enemy. I immediately turned out the whole of my command, and prepared to
                    meet them. I ordered Hansbrough's battalion, the Thirty-first Virginia,
                    commanded by Maj. Boykin, and Reger's battalion to occupy the crest of the
                    mountain on the right, to guard against approach from that quarter. On this hill
                    there were no defenses. There were some fields and felled timber beyond, which
                    reached the crest of the mountain. The enemy advanced to our front, and,
                    conducted by a guide, a Union man from Western Virginia, who was familiar with
                    the roads and trails in the vicinity, turned off from the turnpike about a mile
                    from our position, near the base of the mountain, and reached our right by a
                    trail which led into a road coming into the field slightly in our rear. As they
                    approached this position pickets thrown out from Hansbrough's battalion
                    discovered them, and reported them as advancing in strong force.</p>
<p>About 7.15 o'clock a.m. the enemy advanced, and a terrific fire commenced. The
                    enemy on this flank numbered fully 2,000. They were gallantly met by our troops,
                    who did not exceed 300 at this time. As soon as I heard the firing I ordered two
                    companies of the Twelfth Georgia (Hawkins' and Blandford's), who had at the
                    first alarm been posted on the pike about a quarter of a mile in front down the
                    mountain, to move up immediately to the support of our forces on the right.
                    Three other companies of the Twelfth (Davis', Hardeman's, and Patterson's),
                    Lieut. U. E. Moore commanding, were also ordered to the support of those on the
                    right, who were making a gallant defense and holding the position against
                    immense odds. Gallantly did the Georgians move up, and, taking position on the
                    left, received a terrible fire from the enemy.</p>
<p>By this time the extreme right had been forced back, but seeing the Georgians,
                    who came on with a shout, they joined them, and moved upon the enemy, who,
                    taking advantage of some fallen trees, brush, and timber, poured upon them a
                    terrific fire. Our men were checked, but not driven back. They did not yield an
                    inch, but steadily advanced, cheered and led by their officers. Many of the
                    officers fought by the side of their men and led them on to the conflict. I
                    never witnessed harder fighting. The enemy, behind trees, with their long-range
                    arms, at first had decidedly the advantage, but our men soon came up to them and
                    drove them from their cover. I cannot speak in terms too exaggerated of the
                    unflinching courage and dashing gallantry of those 500 men who contended from
                    7.15 a.m. until 1.45 p.m. against an immensely superior force of the enemy, and
                    finally drove them from their positions and pursued them a mile or more down the
                    mountain.</p>
<p>I cannot name all who deserve particular mention for this gallantry and good
                    conduct. Col. Hansbrough, whilst gallantly leading his battalion, was wounded by
                    a pistol-shot and carried from the field. Soon after the fight became general
                    the brave Lieut. G. T. Thompson, of the Thirty-first Virginia, fell severely
                    wounded. His good conduct had attracted my attention, and he fell within a few
                    feet of me. Capt. Mollohan, while cheering and leading his men in pursuit of the
                    enemy, fell mortally wounded. Lieut. Moore, Twelfth Georgia Volunteers, whilst
                    gallantly leading a charge, fell mortally wounded. This gallant officer was ever
                    ready for any expedition involving danger; he was truly brave. Capt.'s Davis,
                    Blandford, Hardeman, and Hawkins, their officers and men, behaved admirably.
                    Capt. Davis and his company were conspicuous for their gallantry and good
                    conduct throughout the fight. Adjutant Willis, Lieut.'s McCoy, Etheridge,
                    Marshall, and Turpin, Twelfth Georgia Regt., deserve particular mention for
                    their good conduct. Maj. F. M. Boykin, jr., commanding Thirty-fist Virginia
                    Volunteers, his officers and men, deserve my thanks for their unflinching
                    courage throughout the struggle. This regiment suffered severely. Lieut.'s
                    Toothman, J. Johnson, McNewmar, J. R. Philips, all wounded, deserve honorable
                    mention. Capt. Thompson, Thirty-first Virginia, deserves special notice.
                    Adjutant Morgan, Lieut.'s Robinson, Haymond, Sergeants Jarvis, Roder, Privates
                    Collins, Musgrave, and Green, Hansbrough's battalion, are favorably mentioned by
                    their commanders.</p>
<p>My command consisted of the Twelfth Georgia Regt., under the immediate command of
                    Lieut. Col. Z. T. Conner; Fifty-second Virginia, Maj. Ross', Hansbrough's, and
                    Reger's battalions; Thirty-first Virginia, Maj. Boykin; Lee Battery of
                    artillery, four pieces, Capt. P. B. Anderson; Capt. Miller's battery, four
                    pieces, and a detachment of Pittsylvania cavalry, Lieut. Dabney. The artillery
                    was posted on the hill to the left of my position, which had been entrenched.
                    Immediately after the troops were turned out the Twelfth Georgia and
                    Fifty-second Virginia were ordered into the trenches. The Pittsylvania cavalry,
                    dismounted, under Lieut. Dabney, also went into the trenches, armed with
                    carbines. A large column of the enemy, led by one Slater, a traitor, well
                    acquainted with the counter, approached the left of this position by a road
                    running along a leading ridge.</p>
<p>About half an hour after the attack was made on the right this column came up on
                    the left to our trenches. They were evidently surprised to find us entrenched.
                    Here the brave Anderson, by a fatal mistake, lost his life. As the enemy
                    advanced he road to the trenches and invited them in, thinking they were our
                    returning pickets, at the same time telling our men not to fire. He was
                    instantly shot down by the advanced body of the enemy's force. Our men then
                    opened a galling fire upon them, and they fell back into the fallen timber and
                    brush, from which they kept up a constant fire at our men in the trenches and
                    upon our artillerists.</p>
<p>My acting assistant adjutant-general, Capt. James Deshler, of the artillery,
                    whilst behaving most gallantly, was shot down in the trenches by a wound through
                    both thighs. He refused to leave the field, and remained in the trenches until
                    the day was over. Capt. Miller opened upon the enemy with his guns and behaved
                    with great gallantry, exposing himself and his guns to the fire of the enemy's
                    sharpshooters. After the enemy's force on the right had been repulsed and driven
                    from the field, I ordered all of our men who had been engaged in that quarter to
                    join the troops in the trenches on the left. They took post with the other
                    troops, and opened fire on the enemy as occasion offered. The enemy, under the
                    fire of artillery and infantry, soon retreated from the left, leaving their dead
                    and wounded.</p>
<p>The enemy's force on the left was larger, if anything, than the force on the
                    right. They numbered in all about 5,000 men, who had been drawn from Belington,
                    Beverly, Huttonsville, Elk Water, and Cheat Mountain. My force did not exceed
                    1,200 effective men of all arms. Gen. Reynolds, U. S. Army, commanded the whole
                    of the enemy's forces, and Gen. Milroy the attack on our right. Gen. Milroy is
                    reported by prisoners captured to have been wounded. The enemy left upon the
                    field 35 dead and 13 wounded. They carried from the field large numbers of dead
                    and wounded. This I get from citizens who reside upon the roads along which they
                    retreated. Ten or twelve ambulances were seen conveying their wounded. We
                    captured 3 prisoners and about 100 stand of arms, which the enemy had thrown
                    away in his flight.</p>
<p>Although we have reason to be thankful to God for the victory achieved over our
                    enemies on this occasion, we can but lament the loss of many valuable lives. Our
                    casualties amount to 20 killed, 96 wounded, and 28 missing. Many of the missing
                    have returned since the day of the battle. I am much indebted to Surgs. H. R.
                    Green, of the Twelfth Georgia Regt., and W. T. Blanc, of the Thirty-first
                    Virginia Volunteers, for their attention to our own wounded as well as those of
                    the enemy. They have been untiring in their efforts to alleviate their
                    sufferings. Dr. Green was slightly wounded in the hand by a spent ball while
                    attending to the wounded.</p>
<p>Herewith I submit a list of casualties; also the reports of commanders of
                    regiments and corps.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>E. JOHNSON,<br> Col. Twelfth Georgia Regt., Cmdg. Monterey Line.</p>
