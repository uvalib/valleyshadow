                <p>... The cannonading of the 8th had been resumed on the 9th, and was kept up more
                    or less throughout the day. The reports from the front sent in to me and from
                    Gen. Banks to your headquarters (were by your direction I had been throughout
                    the day) were to the effect that the enemy did not yet seem to be in great
                    force, showing his cavalry somewhat ostentatiously, and using his artillery
                    only; and these reports continued to be of this character throughout the day,
                    and gave the assurance the enemy would not be able to bring up his main force
                    till our army should have been sufficiently concentrated and got in good
                    condition for battle.</p>
                <p>Gen. Sigel's corps having arrived at Culpeper after a forced march, much of it
                    during the night previous, and being reported without provisions and not in a
                    condition to immediately follow Gen. Banks, by your order I directed subsistence
                    to be given Gen. Sigel's men from my supply train, and instantly took Rickett's
                    division, accompanied by you, to the front, to join Gen. Banks, without waiting
                    to follow Gen. Sigel, as had been before ordered.</p>
                <p>When the order was given me to take Rickett's division to the front it was not
                    known Gen. Banks had attacked the enemy, or that he purposed doing so, or that
                    the enemy was in sufficient force to attack him; but the cannonading having
                    become more continuous, I was sent forward as a precautionary measure, and to
                    allow Gen. Sigel's men some rest. When between 2 and 3 miles from Cedar Mountain
                    we began to meet the evidences of the battle which Gen. Banks had fought at its
                    base--stragglers, singly and in groups, and soon companies, battalions, and
                    batteries moving to the rear. Gen. Banks had left the position where he had
                    drawn up his troops and moved them forward to attack the enemy, not believing
                    him to be in any great force, and found him stronger than he had supposed,
                    outnumbering greatly his own corps, and had been driven back after a gallant,
                    severe, and bloody contest.</p>
                <p>It was now dark, and under the assurance of Gen. Banks that the remainder of his
                    corps were in the front of a narrow strip of woods which extended across the
                    road; that a brigade was still on a hill to the right of this wood, and that his
                    brigade and the right of his line, which was said to be intact, would be drawn
                    toward and strengthen the center, which had suffered most, I was ordered to
                    place Rickett's division to the right and front. This was done by posting
                    Tower's brigade with two batteries (Lapin's and Thompson's) on the knoll to the
                    right of the wood, Caroll's brigade connecting the left of Tower's line with the
                    woods; Hartsuff's and Duryea's brigades in second line, with Hall's and
                    Thompson's batteries in reserve. But while making these dispositions and moving
                    forward in column to do so, the enemy following up the retreat of Gen. Banks,
                    established a battery beyond the woods before mentioned and opened on the head
                    of my column, and soon after coming through the woods with infantry, cavalry,
                    and artillery, established another battery on the knoll where you had just
                    before made your headquarters after your conference with Gen. Banks and others.
                    This battery fired on the second line of Rickett's division, and until the
                    battalion in mass were placed under the shelter of the rolling ground took
                    effect on Hartsuff's brigade. Quickly the batteries in reserve, under the
                    direction of that most valuable officer Maj. Tillson, chief of artillery, Hall's
                    First Maine, and Thompson's Second Maryland, opened on the enemy. It was dark,
                    and only by the flash of the enemy's piece could they see where to direct their
                    aim, but soon, by a rapid and well-directed fire they silenced the enemy's
                    batteries and forced them to withdraw, leaving some of their officers and most
                    of their horses dead on the ground. The fire of the enemy's infantry from the
                    woods was mostly at Corroll's brigade, which suffered from it before his men
                    could be got into position in the front line.</p>
                <p>The hot reception given the enemy by Ricketts' division caused the enemy to fall
                    back during the night to their former position on and near Cedar Run Mountain,
                    some 3 miles. Finding Rickett's division too far to the front and right, it was
                    drawn over during the night by your direction to the right of the position you
                    had directed Gen. Sigel to occupy.</p>
