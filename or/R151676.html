<p>Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HDQRS. ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,</p>
<p>February 5, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Gen. W. E. Jones, commanding in the Valley District, who has been directed to
                    send into certain counties in the west with the view of obtaining cattle and
                    other supplies of meat for the use of the army, reports under date of 1st
                    instant the steps he has taken. There are but few cattle in the Valley of the
                    Shenandoah, and they have been secured for the troops under his command. The
                    surplus bacon of the Valley has been untouched, and measures have been taken to
                    secure it and forward it at once to Staunton. Two companies of cavalry have been
                    sent to Hardy, Hampshire, and adjoining counties for the purpose of securing
                    beef, and one company to Loudoun and Fauquier for the same purpose. Gen. Jones
                    reports that flour can be had in large quantities in the upper part of the
                    Valley, the supply being only limited by the transportation. He suggests the
                    propriety of the Government buying stock cattle and feeding them in the upper
                    Valley on ground wheat and hay from the supply of beef in the spring. I regard
                    the suggestion worthy of consideration and accordingly it to you.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
