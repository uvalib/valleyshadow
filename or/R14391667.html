<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Assistant Adjutant George Leet writes General Phil Sheridan in November,
                    1864, concerning a plan to hire a female spy to go to Staunton, VA.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Kernstown, Va.:</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.,</p>
<p>November 24, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Scouts started out on Sunday, but finding all roads leading to our agent's house
                    picketed, and being fired upon and pursued, they were forced to return here.
                    Others were sent out another route the next day (Monday) with directions to
                    employ and send to Staunton a woman who was formally an agent with Army of
                    Potomac, and said to be reliable and efficient. The men last sent are expected
                    back to-day or to-morrow, and I will communicate to you immediately upon their
                    arrival any information they may have. I will keep the men moving all the time,
                    and give them special instructions to spare no efforts to obtain reliable
                    information of movements of enemy thought Gordonsville during the time mentioned
                    in your dispatch of last night.</p>
