<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Gabriel Wharton concerning fighting in western
                    Virginia in August, 1863. Lee orders Wharton to move his men through Staunton
                    and report to Colonel William Jackson in western Virginia. Lee also directs that
                    that all sick men be sent to Staunton by rail.</p>

<p>Gen. G. C. WHARTON,<br> Cmdg. Brigade:</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 24, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Gen. Sam. Jones reports by telegraph that the enemy has driven Col. Jackson out
                    of Pocahontas, and is pressing him back toward Warm Springs. Another column is
                    moving down from Beverly toward Lewisburg. He represents himself in great need
                    of all the troops sent to this army.</p>
<p>I have, therefore, to request that you will make arrangements at once to report
                    to him, proceeding via Staunton and Warm Springs, with your brigade and three
                    field batteries. Jenkins' brigade is also ordered.</p>
<p>I have directed Col. Corley to use the railroad to the extent of its ability,
                    without stopping supplies, to transport the sick and feeble, &amp;c., of
                    your command to Staunton. You had better send him the number you with forwarded
                    by rail.</p>
<p>You can take the road through Charlottesville or Stanardsville, as you may deem
                    best.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
