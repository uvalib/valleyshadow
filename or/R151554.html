<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Joseph E. Johnston in May, 1862, with news from
                    Staunton of Jackson's victory at McDowell.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Gen. J. E. JOHNSTON,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va., HDQRS.,</p>
<p>May 9, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have received information by telegraph this morning from Maj. A. W. Harman,
                    assistant quartermaster at Staunton, that Gen. Jackson's advanced forces engaged
                    the enemy (Milroy) near McDowell, on Sitlington's Hill, at 5 p. m. yesterday,
                    and after four hours' fighting drove them back in confusion on McDowell. We had
                    no artillery. Winder's brigade not in action. Our troops encamped on
                    battle-field. Artillery gotten in position, and ready to renew fight. Three
                    gun-boats entered James River on yesterday. One iron-clad attacked battery at
                    Day's Point. It is reported battery was silenced. Enemy yesterday attacked
                    Sewell's Point battery. Retired on approach of Virginia. These movements of
                    enemy supposed to be caused by information derived from a Capt. Bias, who
                    deserted with his tugboat and crew and went to Fort Monroe yesterday. Every
                    preparation is being made that is possible to contest the ascent of James River
                    by enemy's boats. Nothing heard of their farther advance since yesterday.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
