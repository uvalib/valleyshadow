<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General J. E. B. Stuart in June, 1863, with plans for the
                    invasion of Pennsylvania in what became the Gettysburg campaign. He mentions
                    planning to send a column of General Richard Ewell's troops north, through
                    Chambersburg. He also expresses his fear that the Army of the Potomac might
                    cross into Pennsylvania before he is aware, and gives instructions for procuring
                    supplies in Maryland.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart,<br> Comdg. Cavalry:</p>
<p>Hdqrs.,</p>
<p>June 22, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have just received your note of 7.45 this morning to Gen. Longstreet. I judge
                    the efforts of the enemy yesterday were to arrest our progress and ascertain our
                    whereabouts. Perhaps he is satisfied. Do you know where he is and what he is
                    doing? I fear he will steal a march on us, and get across the Potomac before we
                    are aware. If you find that he is moving northward, and that two brigades can
                    guard the Blue Ridge and take care of your rear, you can move with the other
                    three into Maryland, and take position on Gen. Ewell's right, place yourself in
                    communication with him, guard his flank, keep him informed of the enemy's
                    movements, and collect all the supplies you can for the use of the army. One
                    column of Gen. Ewell's army will probably move toward the Susquehanna by the
                    Emmitsburg route; another by Chambersburg. Accounts from him last night state
                    that there was no enemy west of Frederick. A cavalry force (about 100) guarded
                    the Monocacy Bridge, which was barricaded. You will, of course, take charge of
                    A. G. Jenkins' brigade, and give him necessary instructions. All supplies taken
                    in Maryland must be by authorized staff officers for their respective
                    departments--by no one else. They will be paid for, or receipts for the same
                    given to the owners. I will send you a general order on this subject, which I
                    wish you to see is strictly complied with.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
