<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Assistant Adjutant Edward D. Townsend writes General Robert Patterson,
                    stationed at Chambersburg, in June, 1861. Townsend instructs him to delay any
                    advance until more troops arrive.</p>

<p>Gen. R. PATTERSON, Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>June 4, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Scott says do not make a move forward until you are joined by a battery of
                    the Fourth Artillery and a battalion of five companies Third U. S. Infantry, to
                    leave here the 6th instant for Carlisle. Company F, Fourth Artillery, is the one
                    to be mounted. Orders have been given to purchase horses and collect the guns,
                    equipments, &amp;c., as soon as possible, at Carlisle. It will require some
                    days, but the General considers this addition to your force indispensable. If
                    two Ohio regiments come to you, retain them. Also halt the first two regiments
                    that may pass through Harrisburg from the North to this city, and add them to
                    your force. You will receive a letter from the General before you move.</p>
<p></p>
<p>E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
