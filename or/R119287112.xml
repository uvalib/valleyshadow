                <p>From my last report it appears that Gen. McClellan has massed his army on the
                    Manassas Gap Railroad, in the vicinity of Piedmont. He withdrew his force form
                    Snicker's Gap and moved it toward Middleburg. The force at Paris and Upperville
                    was likewise withdrawn to the Manassas Railroad. His cavalry is advanced to the
                    line of the Rappahannock. Gen. A. P. Hill, finding Snicker's Gap open, advanced
                    his pickets to Snickersville, where they were by last reports, and on that
                    occasion Maj. White, with his battalion of cavalry, captured 104 prisoners and
                    some ambulances and wagons loaded with stores. Gen. D. H. Hill's division is in
                    the forks of the Shenandoah, guarding the passes in that direction. As long as
                    Gen. Jackson can operate with safety, and secure his retirement west of the
                    Massanutten Mountains, I think it advantageous that he should be in position to
                    threaten the enemy's flank and rear, and thus prevent his advance southward on
                    the east side of the Blue Ridge. Gen. Jackson has been, directed accordingly,
                    and, should the enemy descend into the valley, Gen. Longstreet will attack his
                    rear, and cut off his communications. The enemy, apparently, is so strong in
                    numbers that I think it preferable to attempt to baffle his designs by
                    maneuvering, rather without too great risk and loss would require more than
                    double our present numbers.</p>
                <p>I beg, if possible, that shoes and blankets be sent to me at Gordonsville. Those
                    sent to Staunton will not be more than are required by Gen. Jackson.</p>
