<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Cavalry General William Averell writes Colonel Forsyth regarding cavalry
                    preparations in western Virginia during August, 1864. Averell mentions that West
                    Virginia cannot be occupied by Confederates until the railroad running west of
                    Staunton is repaired.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. J. W. FORSYTH,<br> Chief of Staff, Middle
                        Military Division:</p>
<p>Martinsburg, W. Va.,</p>
<p>August 16, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to request that the detachment of the Eighth Ohio Cavalry at
                    Beverly be ordered to join the regiment at this place at once. It is impossible
                    for the enemy to occupy West Virginia west of the Alleghany Mountains until the
                    railroad is repaired west of Staunton. The country is perfectly destitute of
                    supplies, and no force except small parties can operate in Randolph County.
                    There are plenty of discharged soldiers in Barbour and Harrison Counties who can
                    take care of all the guerrillas in that section. It is very important that the
                    400 men of the Eighth Ohio Cavalry, now at Beverly, should join the regiment at
                    once. It is one of the best veteran regiments in service, but is unfortunately
                    armed with the Union carbine, in which the men have no confidence. I desire to
                    get the regiment together and arm them with Enfield rifles. They are the finest
                    skirmishers and sharpshooters in service. Their separation is detrimental to
                    their discipline and their accounts are in a very disorderly state. In its
                    present position it is of no use; together, it would add greatly to the strength
                    of my division.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
