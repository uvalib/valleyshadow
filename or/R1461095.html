<p>Lieut. Col. T. S. BOWERS,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Hdqrs. Armies of the United States:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 5, 1865.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that Gen. Torbert, commanding Army of the Shenandoah,
                    reports to me by telegram of this date that the cavalry force under Col. Reed,
                    of the Twenty-second New York Cavalry, has returned from Staunton having paroled
                    about 750 men, in addition to those heretofore reported. Gen.'s Rosser and
                    Lilley left Staunton the day before Col. Reed arrived there, having been engaged
                    without success in endeavoring to raise men to go south. Gen. Torbert expects to
                    receive on Monday the surrender of the remnant of Dearing's old brigade. The
                    people are reported as well disposed. Guerrillas are reported as troublesome in
                    the vicinity and Mount Jackson. I have directed a force to be sent against them,
                    and no quarter to be shown.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WINF'D S. HANCOCK,<br> Maj.-Gen. of Volunteers, Cmdg. Middle Military
                        Division.</p>
