<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General William Loring reports from Staunton on December, 1861,
                    actions in western Virginia.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Col. S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant-Gen., Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>STAUNTON,</p>
<p>December 13, 1861.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I inclose the report of Col. Johnson, which I received to-day. The enemy was
                    informed of our movement, it seems, through deserters, but, as expected, the
                    troops on Alleghany checked and repulsed them with loss. The weather has been so
                    good that they were enabled to attack with their entire force, and will no
                    doubt, as stated by Col. Johnson, endeavor to possess the pass now occupied by
                    us when it is evacuated. In consequence of their formidable appearance, and not
                    being assured of their intention, I have for the time ordered Col. Johnson to
                    remain where he is, and given directions for the command to halt upon this road
                    about 20 miles distant, where it will strike it en route to Strasburg. I expect
                    it there in two or three days. I have arranged the march in case we could not,
                    which was highly desirable, get the use of the rail from here to Strasburg, to
                    march through with our own transportation. It will, of course, delay us. Should
                    the weather shortly take an inclement turn, the enemy may be forced to return to
                    Cheat, and enable us to follow up the design contemplated.</p>
<p>With respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
