                    1864, advance in western Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley. Grant warns Sigel

                <p>I send with this Lieut.-Col. Babcock, of my staff, to consult with you in person
                    in reference to the preparations for the approaching campaign. I will state that
                    the instructions which I communicated to you were based upon such information as
                    is given by the maps, and as could be obtained by inquiries from those who had
                    previously been over the country.</p>
                <p>The point to be attained was marked in my instructions; that is, in the spring
                    campaign it is desirable to bring into the field all the troops possible.</p>
                <p>From the extended line you have to guard, no troops can be taken from you except
                    to act directly from your line toward the enemy. In this way you must occupy the
                    attention of a large force, and thereby hold them from re-enforcing elsewhere,
                    or must inflict a blow upon the enemy's resources, which will materially aid us.
                    This being the object, it is not necessary that the exact line marked out by me
                    should be followed. It was selected with the view of keeping your present line
                    covered. If this can be equally well done by starting from Gauley Bridge, I have
                    no objections to that route.</p>
                <p>The concentration preparatory to starting should go forward with all expedition,
                    so that the two columns sent by you can be started by the 23d instant, if called
                    on to do so. I will give the signal from here for starting from Beverly or
                    Gauley, as the case may be. It is now pretty certain that the enemy, suspecting
                    a move up the Shenandoah Valley, have established a considerable force at
                    Staunton to meet you. This may be, however, a cover for a formidable movement of
                    the enemy by that route northward. This you will want to watch closely, and
                    report any information you may obtain.</p>
                <p>Confer freely with Col. Babcock, and whilst he remains with you let us settle
                    unalterably the line to be pursued by your forces. Of course I do not intend you
                    to understand that Col. Babcock will give you orders in this matter; but by a
                    personal interview the best thing to do can be arrived at, and by telegraphing
                    to me it can be adopted.</p>
