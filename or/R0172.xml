    <p>I have to submit the following report of the part taken by the Second Corps in the recent
     operation, for the information of the major-general commanding the army:</p>
    <p>I was instructed on the 4th instant to move at 7 a.m. of the 5th, with the two divisions of
     my corps not in the entrenchments and two batteries of artillery, to the crossing of Hatcher's
     Run at the Vaughan road and at Armstrong's Mill, to hold those crossing, keep open the
     communication with the Fifth Corps, under Gen. Warren, when it reached the intersection of the
     Vaughan and stage roads, some three or four miles distant, and support him, if required. In
     accordance with those instructions, I moved at 7 a.m. of the 5th, with Gen. Mott's (Third)
     division, 5,961 officers and enlisted men, and Gen. Smyth's (Second) division, 4,607 officers
     and enlisted men, and Battery K, Fourth U. S. Artillery, Brevet Capt. Roder, and the Tenth
     Massachusetts Battery, Lieut. J. W. Adams, with the rations, ammunition, &amp;c ordered.</p>
    <p>Maj. Hess, Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, with 220 officers and men, joined me at 6 a.m. He was
     placed in advance, to drive in the enemy's cavalry pickets, and secure the crossing of
     Hatcher's Run, so as to conceal temporarily the fact from the enemy that the movement was made
     by an infantry force.</p>
    <p>Maj. Hess found the enemy's infantry in small force holding the Vaughan road crossing, the
     run being dammed and obstructed by fallen trees. Being unable to use his cavalry with any
     effect, Gen. De Trobriand's skirmishers, under his personal supervision, quickly drove the
     enemy from their rifle-pits, and secured the position at 9.30 a.m. This brigade was then
     rapidly crossed on the dam and put in position, covering the road, and his pickets extended to
     meet those of Gen. Smyth, ordered to the crossing at Armstrong's Mill. With considerable
     difficulty a bridge about 100 feet in length was thrown across the stream. West's brigade, of
     Mott's division, followed De Trobiand's, and was subsequently crossed to the south side of
     Hatcher's Run, completing the security of the position. Caption Rider's battery of 12-pounders
     was put in position here.</p>
    <p>Smyth's division had been directed by me to diverge to the right from the Vaughan road near
     the Cummings house, secure the crossing at Armstrong's Mill, cover it and extend to the right
     past the R Armstrong house, and rest his right upon the small swamp in that vicinity. Lieut.
     Adams' battery of rifled guns was sent with him. These instructions Gen. Smyth executed at
     once, finding directly in front of his right, about 1,000 yards distant, the enemy's
     entrenchments, a redoubt, with the connecting curtains, being in full view. These works had
     been erected since the last movement in December. Gen. Mott, by my direction, sent his rear
     brigade, McAllister's, to the vicinity of the Tucker house, with instructions to take position
     covering the Vaughan road a small parallel road connecting the Squirrel Level road with
     Armstrong's Mill, the right to rest near the swamp, west of and near to the Squirrel Level
     road, and the left to extend toward the swamp, on which Smyth's right was to rest. Smyth's
     division was relied upon to fill up the interval, should there be one. These orders were
     promptly executed. All the troops were directed to intrench immediately upon taking up
     position. Maj. Hess, Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, was ordered to open communication, on the
     south side of Hatcher's Run, between Mott's right and Smyth's left, and to move out to Dabney's
     Mill, and establish a post of observation there, and upon effecting this to move out the
     Vaughan road and communicate with Maj.-Gen. Warren. While he was endeavoring to carry out the
     first part of this direction, I proceeded to examine Smyth's and McAllister's positions. It was
     here that I expected the attack of the enemy. Finding that McAllister was unable to cover the
     ground assigned to him, with the concurrence of the commanding general of the army, I
     telegraphed to Maj.-Gen., whose division had remained in the entrenchments, to send out a
     strong brigade quickly to the Tuckner house, to relieve McAllister's right and enable that
     officer to extend to his left and connect with Smyth. Maj. Hess was unable to carry out the
     first part of his instructions, but the pickets of the two division connected along the south
     branch of Hatcher's Run. The enemy's infantry pickets were driven from the Vaughan road, and
     communication established with Maj.-general Warren.</p>
    <p>At about 4 p.m. the enemy opened with artillery from one of his redoubts that enfiladed the
     road leading to Armstrong's Mill from the Vaughan road, but doing no damage, and receiving no
     reply, the fire ceased. At 4.30 p.m. Ramsey's brigade (Fourth Brigade, First Division) 1,100
     strong, reached the Tucker house, and enabled McAllister to extend toward Smyth's right. He had
     not yet quite completed this change of position when, at 5.15 p.m., the enemy, having
     concentrated a strong force in the vicinity of the Thompson house (since ascertained to be the
     chief parts of Hill's and Gordon's corps), made a sudden attack upon the right of Smyth and the
     left of McAllister. This attack was promptly and skillful met by Gen. Smyth and Gen.
     McAllister, and the enemy's leading troops quickly repulsed, but the action was continued by
     those more distant until after 7 o'clock. The enemy's artillery opened from the redoubt already
     mentioned and from a battery near the Thompson house, both of which were effectually replied
     to. Early in the action I ordered up West's brigade, of Mott's division, to strengthen
     McAllister's left, which it did before the termination of the engagement; I also used two of
     Smyth's regiments as supports. The enemy withdrew to his entrenchments shortly after the
     engagement ceased.</p>
    <p>Our loss (125 killed and wounded) was small, while that of the enemy was comparatively severe
     and must have been six or seven times greater than ours. I append a tabular statement of the
     casualties.</p>
    <p>Among the wounded is Col. M. Murphy, Sixty-ninth New York national Guard, commanding Second
     Brigade, Second Division, severely.</p>
    <p>During the evening Hartrant's division, of the Ninth Corps, 3,200 strong, and Wheaton's
     division of the Sixth Corps, 4,500 strong, reported to me and were posted along the Squirrel
     Level road, connecting with the entrenchments of the army.</p>
    <p>It having been decided by the major-general commanding to concentrate at once Maj.-Gen.
     Warren's (Fifth) corps and Gregg's cavalry at the Vaughan road crossing of Hatcher's Run, as
     soon as a sufficient number of these troops arrived, Maj.-Gen. Mott's troops there--De
     Trobriand's brigade--were moved, at about 2 a.m. of the 6th, to near the Tuckner house, and
     Gen. Mott resumed the command of all his brigades as well as of Ramsey's.</p>
    <p>Early next morning, in pursuance of instructions I had received from the commanding general
     of the army, Gen. Mott and Gen. Hartraft sent out reconnaissance that advanced to within sight
     of the enemy's works near the Watkins house without finding any force but the pickets, which
     were driven inside the main works. At the same time all my command, including Miles' division,
     were held ready to attack the enemy should he be found outside his works. At 2 p.m. Gen.
     Wheaton's division was ordered to move to the Cummings house and report to Maj.-Gen. Warren,
     and Gen. Mott was ordered to hold Gen. De Trobriand's and Gen. West's brigades ready to support
     Gen. Warren. They were subsequently moved to the Vaughan road crossing of Hatcher's Run with
     that object, but returned to their positions at night. Gen. Smyth, on that and the following
     day (the 7th), supported Gen. Warren's movements with his artillery.</p>
    <p>On the morning of the 9th, in pursuance of instructions from the headquarters of the army,
     the First and Third Divisions of the Second Corps took up the position assigned them of the new
     line from Fort Gregg to the Vaughan road crossing of Hatcher's Run, and commenced the
     constructions of entrenchments.</p>
    <p>On the morning of the 11th Gen. Smyth's division was withdrawn from its position, covering
     the crossing at Armstrong's Mill, and posted on the new line. The casualties subsequent to the
     5th were 13 killed and wounded.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, I desire to express the very great satisfaction I have felt at the prompt,
     skillful, and spirited manner in which the duties were performed by both officers and men
     during the operation. It was the good fortune of Brig.-Gen. Smyth, commanding Second Division,
     Brevet Brig.-Gen. McAllister, commanding Third Brigade, Third Division, and M. Murphy,
     commanding Second Brigade, Second Division, to be placed in positions where they evinced both
     skill and gallantry.</p>
    <p>I am under obligations to Lieut.-Col. Hazard, commanding Artillery Brigade, Lieut.-Col.
     William, acting inspector-general, and to the other officers of my staff, for the zealous
     assistance they rendered me.</p>
    <p>I transmit herewith the reports of the division and other commanders, and am,</p>
    <closer>
     <salute>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
     <signed/>
