<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Throughout the war, Staunton, VA, served as a base of Confederate recruiting and
                    operations in the Valley. In this May, 1861, letter, Robert E. Lee informs
                    Confederate politician and diplomat James Mason of actions around Harper's Ferry
                    and in the Shenandoah Valley, including companies sent from Staunton to Beverly
                    with orders to recruit along the way.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Hon. JAMES M. MASON, Winchester, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 21, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have been gratified at the reception of your letter of the 15th instant, giving
                    an account of you visit to Harper's Ferry. I had hoped that the Maryland people
                    would relieve us of the necessity of occupying the Maryland Heights. Col.
                    Jackson was directed to give to their occupation the appearance of its being
                    done by the people of that State, and not to take possession himself till
                    necessary; but the time has been left to his discretion which I am sure will be
                    wisely exercised. There is no doubt, under the circumstances, of our right to
                    occupy these heights.</p>
<p>Measures have been taken, more than three weeks ago, for securing the control of
                    both branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and for throwing a force into
                    the disaffected region of the State; to carry out which Maj. Loring has been
                    sent to Wheeling to protect the terminus of the main road, and Col. Porterfield
                    has been sent to Grafton, with instructions to concentrate there regiments, at
                    Parkersburg one regiment, and at Moundsville one regiment. These measures having
                    in part field, several companies have been sent from Staunton to Beverly, with
                    instructions to gather strength as they passed through the country for Col.
                    Porterfield's command. By these means it is hoped that a considerable force has
                    been concentrated at Grafton by this time, and loyalty in some degree engendered
                    in the disaffected region of which you speak.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R.E. LEE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
