<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of my command in
                    the campaign from Winchester, in the Shenandoah Valley, to the armies in front
                    of Petersburg, beginning February 27 and ending March 28:</p>
<p>The command consisted of the First and Third Divisions of Cavalry of the Army of

<p>On the morning of February 27, 1865, we marched from Winchester up the Valley
                    pike, with five days' rations in haversacks, and fifteen days' rations of
                    coffee, sugar, and salt in wagons, thirty pounds of forage on each horse, one
                    wagon for division headquarters, eight ambulances, and our ammunition train; no
                    other wagons, except a pontoon train of eight boats, were permitted to accompany
                    the command.</p>
<p>My orders were to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad, the James River Canal,
                    capture Lynchburg if practicable, and then join Maj.-Gen. Sherman wherever he
                    might be found in North Carolina, or return to Winchester; but in joining Gen.
                    Sherman I must be governed by the position of affairs after the capture of
                    Lynchburg.</p>
<p>The command was in fine condition, but the weather was very bad, as the spring
                    thaw, with heavy rains, had already come on. The valley and surrounding
                    mountains were covered with snow which was fast disappearing, putting all the
                    streams nearly past fording.</p>
<p>On our first day's march we crossed Cedar Creek, Tumbling Run, and Tom's Brook,
                    and went into camp at Woodstock, having marched thirty miles.</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock on the morning of the 28th instant the march was resumed through
                    Edenburg, across the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, and through New Market,
                    going into camp at Lacey's Spring, nine miles north of Harrisonburg; the
                    crossing of the North Fork of the Shenandoah was by a pontoon bridge.</p>
<p>Small bands of guerrillas hovered on our flanks during the day, but no effort was
                    made to drive them off, and no damage was done by them; distance marched,
                    twenty-nine miles.</p>
<p>The march was resumed at 6 o'clock on the morning of the 29th (March 1), through
                    Harrisonburg and Mount Crawford, and camp pitched on Middle River at Cline's
                    Mills. Guerrillas hovered around us during the march, and at Mount Crawford Gen.
                    Rosser, with 200 or 300 cavalry, attempted to burn the bridge over the Middle
                    Fork of the Shenandoah, but did not succeed; two of Capehart's regiments swam
                    the river above the bridge, charged Rosser and routed him, driving him rapidly
                    to Cline's Mills, the advance pushing almost to Staunton; but few of the enemy
                    were killed, 30 taken prisoners, and 20 ambulances and wagons, with their
                    contents, were captured and destroyed; our loss was 5 men wounded. Cline's Mills
                    are seven miles from Staunton, where the headquarters of Gen. Early were said to
                    be. Not knowing but that he would fight at Staunton, Col. Stagg's brigade, of
                    Gen. Devin's division, was ordered to destroy the railroad bridge over
                    Christian's Creek, between Staunton and Waynesborough, to prevent his getting
                    re-enforcements by rail, or, in case he would not stand, to prevent him carrying
                    off supplies and ordnance stores; the bridge was burned, but Gen. Early,
                    learning of our approach, made a hasty retreat to Waynesborough, leaving word in
                    Staunton that he intended to fight at that place.</p>
<p>The next morning we entered Staunton. The question then arose in my mind whether
                    I should pursue my course on to Lynchburg, leaving Gen. Early in my rear, or go
                    out and fight him with my cavalry against his infantry and what cavalry he could
                    collect, defeat him, and open a way through Rockfish Gap, and have everything in
                    my own hands for the accomplishment of that portion of my instructions which
                    directed the destruction of the Central Railroad and James River Canal. I
                    decided upon the latter course, and Gen. Custer's division (Third), composed of
                    Col. Wells', Pennington's, and Capehart's brigades, was directed to take up the
                    pursuit, followed closely by Gen. Devin's division, composed of Gen. Gibbs' and
                    Col.'s Fitzhugh's and Stagg's brigades. The rain had been pouring in torrents
                    for two days, and the roads were bad beyond description; nevertheless, the men
                    pushed boldly on, although horses and men could scarcely be recognized for the
                    mud which covered them.</p>
<p>Gen. Custer found Gen. Early as he had promised, at Waynesborough, in a well
                    chosen position, with two brigades of infantry and some cavalry under Gen.
                    Rosser, the infantry occupying breast-works. Custer, without waiting for the
                    enemy to get up his courage over the delay of a careful reconnaissance, made his
                    dispositions for attack at once, sending three regiments around the left flank
                    of the enemy, which was somewhat exposed by being advanced from, instead of
                    resting upon, the bank of the river in his immediate rear. He, with the other
                    two brigade, partly mounted and partly dismounted, at a given signal boldly
                    attacked and impetuously carried the enemy's works, while the Eighth New York
                    and the First Connecticut Cavalry, which were formed in column of fours, charged
                    over the breast-works, and continued the charge through the little town of
                    Waynesborough, sobering a few men as they went along, and did not stop until
                    they had crossed the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, which was immediately
                    in Gen. Early's rear, where they formed as foragers, and with drawn sabers held
                    the east bank of the stream. The enemy threw down their arms and surrendered,
                    with cheers at the suddenness with which they were captured.</p>
<p>The general officers present at this engagement were Gen. Early, Long, Wharton,
                    Lilley, and Rosser, and it has always been a wonder to me how they escaped,
                    unless they hid in obscure places in the houses of the town.</p>
<p>Col. Capehart, with his brigade, continued the pursuit of the enemy's train,
                    which was stretched for miles over the mountains, and the other two brigades
                    pushed rapidly after him, with orders to encamp on the east side of the Blue
                    Ridge.</p>
<p>The substantial results of this brilliant fight were 11 pieces of artillery, with
                    horses and caissons complete; about 200 wagons and teams, all loaded with
                    subsistence, camp and garrison equipage, ammunition, and officer's baggage; 17
                    battle-flags, and 1,600 officers and enlisted men. The results, in a military
                    point of view, were very great, as the crossing of the Blue Ridge, covered with
                    snow as it was, at any other point would have been difficult.</p>
<p>Before leaving Staunton for Waynesborough, I obtained information of a large
                    amount of rebel property at Swoope's Depot, on the Lexington railroad, and sent
                    a party to destroy it, which was done, a list of which property will be attached
                    to this report.</p>
<p>Gen. Custer's division encamped at Brooksville, on the east side of the Blue
                    Ridge, Gen. Devin's division remaining at Waynesborough.</p>
<p>The next morning the prisoners were sent back to Winchester under a guard of
                    about 1,500 men, commanded by Col. J. L. Thompson, First New Hampshire Cavalry,
                    who safely reached that point, notwithstanding he was harassed by Gen. Rosser's
                    command as far as the crossing of the North Fork of the Shenandoah near Mount
                    Jackson, at which point Gen. Rosser made a fierce attack upon him and tried to
                    rescue the prisoners, but he was handsomely repulsed by Col. Thompson, who
                    captured some of his men, and finally arrived at his destination with all his
                    own prisoners, and some of Rosser's men besides.</p>
<p>Gen. Devin resumed his march at 6 a.m., leaving Gen. Gibbs' brigade to destroy
                    the iron bridge over the South Fork of the Shenandoah and to burn and destroy
                    the captured wagons and their contents.</p>
<p>Gen. Custer moved on toward Charlottesville, destroying much Government property
                    and subsistence at Greenwood Depot and Ivy Station, also the railroad and the
                    large bridge over Mechum's River, arriving at Charlottesville at 4 p.m., the
                    mayor and several of the most prominent citizens meeting him in the suburbs of
                    the city and delivering up the keys of the public buildings.</p>
<p>The roads from Waynesborough to Charlottesville had, from the incessant rain and
                    spring thaws, become so terribly cut up and the mud was of such a depth that it
                    was impossible for our train to reach Charlottesville under two days. I
                    therefore notified the command that we would remain two days at this point, for
                    the purpose of resting, refitting, and destroying the railroad. Parties were
                    sent well out toward Gordonsville to break the railroad, and also about fifteen
                    miles toward Lynchburg for the same purpose, to prevent troops massing on me
                    from either Richmond or Lynchburg. A thorough and systematic destruction of the
                    railroads was then commenced, including the large iron bridges over the North
                    and South Forks of the Rivanna River, and the work was continued until the
                    evening of the 5th instant, when Gen. Gibbs reported, with our trains. Forage
                    and subsistence were found in great abundance in the vicinity of
                    Charlottesville.</p>
<p>Commodore Hollins, of the Confederate Navy, was killed while trying to escape
                    from a scouting party from Gen. Custer's division.</p>
<p>This necessary delay forced me to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg, but
                    trusty scouts had been sent there to find out the state of affairs in that
                    vicinity.</p>
<p>When the time to start came I decided to separate into two columns, sending Gen.
                    Devin's division, under immediate command of Gen. Merritt, to Scottsville,
                    thence to march along the James River Canal, destroying every lock as far as New
                    Market, while with Custer's division I pushed on up the Lynchburg railroad,
                    through North and South Gardens, destroying it as far as Amherst Court-House,
                    sixteen miles from Lynchburg, and then moved across the country and united with
                    Gen. Merritt's column at New Market.</p>
<p>Gen. Merritt started on the morning of the 6th, first sending the First Michigan
                    Cavalry, Col. Maxwell commanding, down the Rivanna River to Palmyra and toward
                    Columbia, with directions to rejoin him at Scottsville. Gen. Merritt thoroughly
                    accomplished his orders, destroying all large flour mills, woolen factories, and
                    manufacturing establishments, tearing up and demolishing all the locks on the
                    James River Canal from Scottsville to New Market. I had directed him to try and
                    obtain possession of the bridge across the James River at Duguidsville,
                    intending to hold it and strike the South Side Railroad at Appomattox Depot and
                    follow up its destruction to Farmville, where the High Bridge crosses the
                    Appomattox. A bold dash was made to secure this bridge, but without avail, as
                    the enemy had covered it with inflammable material and set it on fire the
                    instant their scouts signalled the approach of our forces. They also, and by the
                    same means, burned the bridge across the James River at Hardwicksville, leaving
                    me master of all the country north of the James River.</p>
<p>My eight pontoons would not reach half way across the river, and my scouts from
                    Lynchburg reported the enemy concentrating at that point from the west, together
                    with a portion of Gen. Pickett's division from Richmond and Fitz Lee's cavalry.
                    It was here that I fully determined to join the armies of the lieutenant-general
                    in front of Petersburg, instead of going back to Winchester, and also make a
                    more complete destruction of the James River Canal and the Virginia Central and
                    Fredericksburg railroads, connecting Richmond with Lynchburg and Gordonsville.</p>
<p>I now had all the advantage, and by hurrying quickly down the canal, and
                    destroying it as near Richmond as Goochland, or beyond, and then moving up to
                    the railroad and destroying it as close up to the city as possible, in the same
                    manner I did toward Lynchburg, I felt convinced I was striking a hard blow by
                    destroying the means of supply to the rebel capital, and, to a certain extent,
                    the Army of Northern Virginia, besides leaving the troops now concentrating at
                    Lynchburg without anything to oppose them, and forcing them to return to
                    Richmond. This conception was at once decided upon, and Col. Fitzhugh's brigade
                    was ordered to proceed to Goochland and beyond immediately, destroying every
                    lock upon the canal, and cutting the banks wherever practicable.</p>
<p>The next morning the entire command moved from New Market down the canal
                    leisurely, completely destroying the locks and the banks about the aqueducts,
                    and in some places cutting the banks.</p>
<p>The rain and mud still impeded us, and the command, particularly the
                    transportation, was much worn and fatigued; however, by replacing our worn-out
                    mules with those captured from Gen. Ealy's trains, and with the assistance of
                    nearly 2,000 negroes who attached themselves to the command, we managed to get
                    along in very good shape, reaching Columbia on the evening of the 10th instant,
                    at which place we were rejoined by Col. Fitzhugh's brigade. Col. Fitzhugh had
                    destroyed the canal about eight miles east of Goochland, thereby reducing it to
                    a very small length.</p>
<p>At Columbia we took one day's rest, and I here sent a communication to the
                    lieutenant-general commanding the armies, notifying him of our success,
                    position, and condition, and requesting supplies to be sent to White House.</p>
<p>My anxiety now was to be able to cross the Pamunkey. I felt confident that the
                    enemy would march out a heavy force, and try to destroy my command, and prevent
                    me from crossing the river. The railroad from Richmond to Gordonsville was still
                    intact, and to go south of the Pamunkey River, and between it and Richmond, I
                    regarded as too hazardous, and I was fearful that the enemy might use it to get
                    on my flank and rear; Gen. Custer was therefore directed to strike the railroad
                    at Frederick's Hall, and Gen. Merritt at Louisa Court-House. Gen.Custer was
                    ordered to thoroughly destroy the track toward Richmond as far as Beaver Dam,
                    while Gen. Merritt did the same thing from Louisa Court-House to Frederick's
                    Hall.</p>
<p>While at this latter place Maj. Young's scouts from Richmond notified me of
                    preparations being made there to prevent me from getting to the James River, and
                    that Pickett's division of infantry was coming back from Lynchburg, via the
                    South Side Railroad, as was also the cavalry, but that no advance from Richmond
                    had yet taken place. I at once determined that there was no way to stop me
                    unless Gen. Longstreet marched directly for the White House, and that he would
                    be unable to do so if I pushed boldly on toward Richmond, as he would be forced
                    to come out and meet me near Ashland; then I could withdraw, cross the South and
                    North Annas, and march to White House on north side of the Pamunkey. It proved
                    true.</p>
<p>But, to divert from the narrative, when Gen. Custer struck Frederick's Hall
                    Station, he entered it so suddenly that he captured the telegraph office with
                    all the dispatches; among them was one from Lieut.-Gen. Early to Gen. Lee,
                    stating that he had been informed that Sheridan's forces were approaching
                    Goochland, and that he intended to move up with 200 cavalry which he had and
                    attack them in the flank at daylight. Gen. Custer immediately ordered a regiment
                    of cavalry in pursuit of this bold party, which, in about two hours, it
                    overtook, attacked, and captured or dispersed in every direction, Lieut.-Gen.
                    Early escaping on a side road with five or six orderlies and two staff officers;
                    he was, however, closely followed by a small detachment, and his staff officers
                    captured, he barely escaping over the South Anna with a single orderly; and the
                    next day he made his way to Richmond, after a campaign in the Shenandoah Valley
                    in which he lost nearly the whole of his army, together with his battle-flags,
                    and nearly every piece of artillery which his troops opened upon us, and also a
                    large part of his transportation.</p>
<p>But, to resume, Gen. Custer, on the morning of the 14th instant, was directed to
                    push down the Negro foot road and cross the South Anna. He sent his scouting
                    parties up to within eleven miles of Richmond, where they burned a hospital
                    train. The object of this move was to divert the attention of the enemy from the
                    North and South Anna bridges, and bridges over Little River, which Merritt was
                    ordered to destroy with Devin's division, Custer's main column meanwhile being
                    held at the Negro foot crossing of the South Anna. Gen. Merritt was ordered to
                    follow the railroad to Hanover Junction, cross the Little River, and go into
                    camp on north bank of South Anna.</p>
<p>In the attack upon the railroad bridge over the South Anna the Fifth U. S.
                    Cavalry charged up to the bridge, dismounted, dashed across it, and drove away
                    the company of artillery who tried to defend it, and turned their own guns--four
                    20-pounder Parrotts--upon them. . .</p>
