<p>WINCHESTER, VA.,</p>
<p>February 3, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Statement of Private John Johnson, Company A, Seventh Tennessee Infantry,
                    McComb's brigade, Heth's division, A. P. Hill's corps:</p>
<p>Deserted from my regiment near Petersburg January 26. I got a sick furlough for
                    forty days; came by rail to Staunton; from their became by stage to Mount
                    Jackson; then took the North Mountain down. We were assisted by several Union
                    men below Mount Jackson. There were about sixty men in my regiment; 300 men in
                    the brigade. I heard the quartermaster say that there were about 1,700 men in
                    the division; cannot say how many in the corps. My regiment is on the left of
                    Petersburg. Large numbers of Lee's army are deserting daily; sometimes as many
                    as 200 a day. At least half would desert if they had an opportunity. The report
                    that Lee is to leave the army causes great discontent. The men say that they
                    never will fight under any other commander. A. P. Hill is not very popular as a
                    corps commander. The rations very poor and irregular.</p>
<p>Tilman Etheridge, private, Company H, Seventh Tennessee, deserted with John
                    Johnson, 26th of January. Statement substantially same as Johnson's.</p>
