<p><b>Summary:<br></b>On May 8, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson attacked and defeated a
                    portion of General John C. Fremont's command under Robert Milroy at McDowell. In
                    this letter, Fremont informs Secretary of War Stanton of Jackson's subsequent
                    movements. He reports on intelligence gathered by scouts concerning the arrival
                    in Staunton of more Confederate troops by train.</p>

<p> Hon. E. M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>PETERSBURG, VA.,</p>
<p>May 11, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Schenck reports from 2 miles south of Franklin certain information that the
                    rebels have a strong picket advanced to within 9 miles of this camp, on the road
                    from Monterey, and near the place where he encamped last night. Three of Gen.
                    Milroy's best scouts sent in direction of Staunton have just returned. They
                    ascertained that Jackson's and Johnson's forces amounted to 14,000, and were
                    being re-enforced three days ago by troops arriving in trains at Staunton. They
                    know of three long trains full.</p>
<p>In the fight at McDowell Friday enemy had a prominent rebel officer killed,
                    probably a general, and there is some reason to believe it is Johnston [E.
                    Johnson].</p>
<p></p>
<p>J. C. FREMONT,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
