                <p>Recent information from scouts reconcile many discrepancies of former reports.
                    Lieut.-Col. Mosby, upon closer examination, finds that the troops sent back to
                    Alexandria from the Rappahannock consisted of some furloughed regiments which
                    had re-enlisted, invalids, sick, sutlers, retainers, &amp;c. The artillery
                    and wagons were the disabled pieces, carriages, &amp;c., that had been
                    replaced by others. I think no new corps has joined Gen. Meade. He has been
                    re-enforced by recruits, detachments, and the troops from about Washington,
                    &amp;c., but no corps or divisions have been detached from him. I do not
                    think his army will exceed 75,000 men, though they claim to have 100,000. I
                    believe that two corps have been transferred from the West to Annapolis, the
                    Ninth and probably the Eleventh and Twelfth consolidated. All accounts agree
                    that two corps have passed over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad east. As to the
                    numbers of the corps reports vary. A scout just from the valley reports that
                    Averell left Martinsburg last Tuesday, and moved up the Baltimore and Ohio
                    Railroad, taking with him all the cavalry that could be spared from that region,
                    leaving only a garrison at Martinsburg. There is now no force at Harper's Ferry.
                    A physician of his acquaintance went into Martinsburg and learned that two corps
                    had passed down the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad toward Baltimore; did not know
                    whence they came. Same information comes from other sources. I think it probable
                    that Averell will move upon the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, or Staunton or
                    some point west, at the time of the general movement upon Richmond, from some
                    point beyond the North Mountain. I think, too, Gen. Grant will rely upon his
                    flank movement upon Richmond to draw this army back. If that movement can be
                    successfully met and resisted, I have no uneasiness as to the result of the
                    campaign in Virginia. I know of no better plan than that submitted in a former
                    letter to Your Excellency.</p>
