<div id="mainResults">
<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Cavalry Captain D. H. Hastings reports to General Lorenzo Thomas that he
                    has placed cavalry pickets near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border at the request
                    of Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtain. Hastings placed the pickets to help
                    contain Robert E. Lee's September, 1862, advance into Maryland. Hastings also
                    comments on the panic among civilians in the Chambersburg area.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. LORENZO THOMAS,<br> Adjutant-Gen., U. S.
                        Army, Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Carlisle Barracks, Pa.,</p>
<p>September 12, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>At the request of His Excellency Gov. A. G. Curtin, I have sent my permanent
                    party, mounted, at daylight this morning, to operate in front of the rebel
                    pickets, between Chambersburg and the Maryland line, and to give some degree of
                    confidence to the inhabitants, as well as to prevent a panic, which was rather
                    imminent among the more easily frightened portion of the people in that
                    neighborhood.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient
                        servant,</p>
<p>D. H. HASTINGS,<br> Capt. First Cavalry, Cmdg.</p>
