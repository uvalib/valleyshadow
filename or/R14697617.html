<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Winfield Scott Hancock writes General Grant in April, 1865, to
                    report on troop dispositions in the Shenandoah Valley. Hancock reports that
                    Staunton is occupied by Confederate General Thomas Rosser's men.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT:</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, VA.,</p>
<p>April 6, 1865.<br> (Received 9.10 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Torbert has just returned from his reconnaissance. He found nothing in the
                    Valley excepting a few hundred cavalry under Rosser at Staunton. He is satisfied
                    from the reports from all the people that a movement of Pickett's division was
                    anticipated, and quite a number of his men are on furlough near here. Some
                    deserters from his division also report that it was the talk among the men that
                    they were coming to the Valley.</p>

<p>WINF'D S. HANCOCK,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
