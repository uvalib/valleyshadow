<p><b>Summary:<br></b>After Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson's string of victories in May, 1862,
                    Federal armies in the Valley attempted to converge against him. In this June
                    dispatch, Union General Nathaniel P. Banks informs Irvin McDowell of the
                    situation, and mentions expected military support for Jackson from Confederates
                    in Staunton.</p>

<p>Gen. MCDOWELL:</p>
<p> Winchester,</p>
<p>June 5, 1862.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I fear we are not in condition to furnish provisions to the prisoners at
                    Strasburg, but I shall send a detachment up to-morrow to ascertain their
                    condition. The great rains have cut off all our supplies. The river at
                    Williamsport is impassable--not a boat can cross. The bridge at Harper's Ferry
                    is carried away and the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. We are
                    without wagons or rations for our own troops for more than a day or two. The
                    prisoners might be brought here if necessary.</p>
<p>A servant that I find here reports a conversation heard between the rebel
                    officers at the hotel on the day Jackson left. In speaking of their being cut
                    off by your forces, they said that Johnston and Lee were to support them from
                    the Luray road and Smith and Magruder at Staunton. Their purpose was to draw our
                    troops into the valley as far as possible and destroy them by greatly superior
                    forces. We heard these reports often when in the valley, and do not attach much
                    importance. They are given as a part of the history of the day.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours,</p>
<p>N. P. BANKS,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
