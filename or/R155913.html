<p>His Excellency PRESIDENT DAVIS, Richmond:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>October 22, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I received on yesterday a pressing letter from Gen. H. R. Jackson, commanding on
                    the Monterey line, to urge the commanding officer of the Fifty-eighth Virginia
                    Regt. to march immediately for Fork of Waters, on the Seneca road. I immediately
                    telegraphed Gen. S. Cooper, and he has ordered the regiment to move without
                    delay. My object in writing to you is to urge the importance of having at least
                    two regiments on the Hardy line the guard the Seneca road. It would be a serious
                    affair indeed if the enemy were to push forward a force on that line and get
                    possession of our supplies at Monterey and come in the rear of our forces on the
                    Alleghany and at Greenbrier river, by which movement, they having a strong force
                    at Cheat Mountain, our forces would be surrounded. The Fifty-eighth Virginia
                    regiment has a great many men sick in the hospital, and numbers scarcely 400
                    effective men. I inclose you a copy of Gen. Jackson's letter. I fear that the
                    Seneca road, not being guarded at all, gives an opportunity for pretended
                    friends to pass and give information to the enemy which may induce this movement
                    on their part. I hope you will send a regiment up immediately, if it can
                    possibly be done, if you concur in the importance I attach to guarding this
                    line.</p>
<p>With the highest consideration, I am, very respectfully, your obedient
                        servant,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Lieut.-Col., Cmdg.</p>
