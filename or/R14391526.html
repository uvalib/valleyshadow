<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, writes Captain R. I.
                    Dodge in October, 1864, concerning reinforcements and troop assignments in
                    Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Capt. R. I. DODGE, U. S. Army,<br> Actg. Asst.
                        Provost-Marshal-Gen., Harrisburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>October 31, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>Your three communications of the 29th instant in reference to matters in
                    Clearfield, Snyder County,&amp;c., are received. I fully agree with you as
                    to the necessity of immediately sending troops into those two counties, but I
                    have not a man to place at your disposal, excepting artillery. You can have one
                    or, if necessary, two sections of that. The companies at York and Carlisle, you
                    are aware, were assigned by directions of the War Department. It is not deemed
                    advisable to order any troops from Philadelphia at this time; indeed, there are
                    none to spare, nor are there any that could be taken away from Pittsburg, unless
                    it be from Camp Reynolds. I have asked Gen. Halleck to send me some dismounted
                    cavalry for the very purpose you wish troops, but have had no reply. There is
                    one company of infantry now at Bloody Run that perhaps can assist you after the
                    election. The cavalry you mention as intending to order from Columbia County I
                    consider are there by superior orders. I was asked what were my reasons for
                    ordering them away, and replied that they could probably return. This was after
                    Sheridan's last victory. It is hoped that after election that something will be
                    done for the necessities of this department.</p>
<p>I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
