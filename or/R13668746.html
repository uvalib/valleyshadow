<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT, Hdqrs. in the Field (Care of
                        Capt. Collins, to be forwarded immediately in duplicate by different
                        couriers):</p>
<p>Washington,</p>
<p>May 14, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your note of yesterday has just reached me, the courier having come on the
                    Washington. Gen. Wright was nominated two days ago, and confirmed by the Senate
                    for major-general. Gen. Humphreys, Gen. Schofield, Gen. Wilson, and all before
                    the Senate have been confirmed, except Gen. Carr, whose nomination was not acted
                    upon. There is at present no vacancy for a major-generalship, but I will muster
                    out some one for Gibbon. The brigadiers in volunteer service you name shall be
                    appointed. If there be any vacancies in regular army for brigadier, Hancock
                    shall have it. There is one regular major-generalship vacant, but brevets can be
                    given without limit. Dodge has been designated for some time for the first
                    vacant major-generalship in the volunteers. Buell objects to serving under
                    Canby. Wright will be assigned to Sixth Corps. Your recommendations in favor of
                    Meade and Sherman will be carried out. We have heard nothing from Sherman for
                    three days, nor from Butler. Sigel is at Woodstock; reports Breckinridge at
                    Staunton on the 10th of May, and that a portion of his force was in Sigel's
                    front. Crook had not been heard from since the 6th of this month, and was then
                    at Princeton.</p>
