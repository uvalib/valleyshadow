<p>Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:</p>
<p>BONSACK'S,</p>
<p>June 11, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Averell's cavalry, reported 4,000 strong, crossed the North River, eight miles
                    above Lexington, at 12 o'clock last night, and it is presumed entered and
                    occupied the town before daybreak this morning. McCausland, with 1,500 cavalry,
                    skirmished with them several times during the day, but could not impede their
                    advance materially. Averell came from Staunton by the Middlebrook and Brownsburg
                    road, and Crook's infantry force is reported to be advancing by the Greenville
                    and Fairfield road, with no Confederate forces between him and Lexington.
                    Doubtless the Virginia Military Institute is now a heap of ruins. Can you send a
                    force to intercept them and co-operate with the heavy force of Breckinridge in
                    their rear? Buford's Depot, on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, is but
                    twelve miles from Buchanan and nearer, too, to the route of the enemy than any
                    other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH.</p>
