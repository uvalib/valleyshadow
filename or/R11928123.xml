                <p>Army of the Potomac commander Alfred Pleasonton reports to General Parke on the
                    November, 1862, disposition of Thomas J. Jackson's troops. Pleasonton speculates
                    that, if attacked, Jackson will retreat to Staunton.</p>

                <p>I find there are four roads between this and Woodville that pass down to Culpeper
                    from Chester Gap, each of which should be strongly guarded, to prevent the rebel
                    trains passing down.</p>
                <p>The rebels are now using Thornton's Gap for their trains, Chester Gap being
                    guarded by Jackson. Jackson has no trains with him, but is supplied by the
                    farmers in Page County. His trains are hauling supplies to Culpeper. Jackson's
                    plan, when we move to Culpeper, is to stride for Warrenton Junction and
                    Rappahannock Station. If we attack him in the gap, he will retreat up the valley
                    toward Staunton. This is what he wants, to draw us off from Culpeper. His army,
                    it is said, is composed of the picked fighting men of the whole. The army at
                    Culpeper, I am told, is a good deal demoralized, and will not stand much of a
                    shock.</p>
                <p>The negro that came in from Jackson yesterday tells me that if we can get our
                    army to Madison, we shall cut Jackson off from the road to Richmond, from its
                    connection with Culpeper, and would break up the Culpeper army.</p>
                <p>I learn that Joe Johnston, and Shanks [N. G.] Evans, and George E. Pickett are at
                    Culpeper. Stuart is in front of me, at Hazel River, on the other side. There has
                    been some picket firing, but I shall not disturb him until the general is ready
                    to"let slip the dogs of war."</p>
                <p>Jackson has no cavalry except some few for scouts. Leave a strong force to face
                    Jackson, covering Warrenton and its junction with a corps of observation at
                    Barbee's; push your forces down on Culpeper vigorously, inclining to the right,
                    to take in Woodville and Madison. Give us ten days more good weather, and wind
                    up the campaign in a blaze of glory.</p>
                <p>Stuart told a lady that our rapid advance, was due to desperation;that we were
                    forced to it, and that on reaching the Rappahannock we would get the soundest
                    thrashing we have ever had. Nous verrons. Please let me know if you received my
                    dispatch of 2.30 p. m. yesterday.</p>
