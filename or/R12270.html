<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Major Michael G. Harman, commanding at Staunton, writes Colonel G. A.

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES</p>
<p>Col. G. A. PORTERFIELD,<br> Commanding Virginia Forces,
                        Beverly, Va.:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va., </p>
<p>June 6, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>I send you a supply of ammunition by Messrs. Trotter and Crawford, an account of
                    which is herewith inclosed.</p>
<p>To-morrow I shall send you a field battery, accompanied by cavalry and infantry,
                    which will be joined by other troops on the way, and the whole force will report
                    to you at Beverly. On the day following, from two to three thousand troops will
                    be sent to you by President Davis from Richmond. I have received a telegraphic
                    dispatch from the commander-in-chief our army, saying. "Send a messenger to Col.
                    Porterfield to be valiant and maintain his ground until relief reaches him. Send
                    him supplies, if he wants them."</p>
<p>Having received no official communication from you, but learning from private
                    sources, since the disaster to our arms at Philippi, that you are almost without
                    ammunition, I have determined to send you a supply by express. I inclose
                    duplicate receipts for the munitions sent, which you will please sign and return
                    to me. Please keep in daily communication with me by couriers until relief
                    reaches you.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Commanding.</p>
