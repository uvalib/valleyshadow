                    action in West Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley. Staunton played a role in

<p>General S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector
                        General</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>October 2, 1863.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>On the evening of August 23, I received information from Col. William L. Jackson
                    that Brigadier-General Averell, U.S. Army, with a force estimated at over 4,000
                    men, consisting of cavalry, mounted infantry, and artillery, was in motion from
                    the direction of Moorefield. So far as I could ascertain, General Averell was on
                    a raid toward Staunton. He had driven Colonel Jackson from Hightown and his camp
                    near Huntersville, and the latter had fallen back to Gatewood's, on Back Creek,
                    on the road from Huntersville to Warm Springs.</p>
<p>I had a few days previously ridden over that road, Colonel Jackson accompanying
                    me part of the way, and from my own observations and his representations
                    believed that he could detain the enemy on that road long enough to enable me to
                    send a force to his assistance or place it in the rear of the enemy. I
                    accordingly ordered the First Brigade of my command, Col. George S. Patton
                    commanding, to move by the Antony's Creek road. I joined the brigade myself on
                    that road on the 25th.</p>
<p>On the morning of that day, I received a dispatch from Colonel Jackson, dated at
                    9 o'clock on the previous day at Gatewood's. Pie informed me that he had driven
                    back the enemy's skirmishers to his old camp near Huntersville. The tenor of the
                    dispatch induced me to believe that he could not only check the opposing force
                    at Gatewood's, but could move up and join the First Brigade at the intersection
                    of the Antony's Creek road from Huntersville to Warm Springs. I dispatched him,
                    informing him of the movement of that brigade, and directed him, if possible, to
                    join it at the junction of the two roads above mentioned. I have reason to
                    believe that he never received my dispatch, and that it was intercepted by the
                    enemy.</p>
<p>While on the march on the 25th, information was received, which I deemed
                    reliable, that the enemy had not only driven Colonel Jackson from Gatewood's,
                    but had forced him beyond Warm Springs. Still remaining under the impression
                    that the destination of the enemy was Staunton, the First Brigade was ordered to
                    turn off from the Antony's Creek road and take a shorter route to Warm Springs.</p>
<p>After 10 o'clock that night information was received which satisfied me that the
                    enemy had abandoned the pursuit of Colonel Jackson and that, while the First
                    Brigade was marching toward Warm Springs, General Averell was advancing from
                    Warm Springs to Callaghan's. I immediately ordered Colonel Patton to return on
                    the Antony's Creek road in the hope of intercepting the enemy on the road from
                    the Warm to the White Sulphur Springs. By a night march our advanced guard
                    reached the intersection of the latter named road at the same instant that the
                    head of Averell's column debouched from the defile through the Alleghany
                    Mountains on the road from Callaghan's. General Averell endeavored to force his
                    way through, but the First Brigade was quickly placed in position, when an
                    engagement commenced, which for five hours was very warm and continued at
                    intervals until dark.</p>
<p>That night the troops occupied the same position that they had taken in the
                    morning. The enemy made two vigorous attacks the next morning, which were
                    handsomely repulsed, when he abandoned his position and retreated towards Warm
                    Springs.</p>
<p>My cavalry and artillery were ordered in pursuit. For about 10 or 12 miles the
                    road passes through a narrow and thickly wooded defile. The enemy availed
                    himself of the advantage offered to retard pursuit by felling trees across the
                    road. I was informed that he had left a regiment of infantry and a squadron of
                    cavalry at the Warm Springs, and under the impression that he would make a stand
                    at the latter place, the First Brigade was pushed forward in pursuit. The enemy,
                    however, turned off from the direct road at Morris' Hill and retreated rapidly
                    by way of Huntersville toward Beverly.</p>
<p>The reports and accompanying papers from Colonels Patton and William L. Jackson
                    will give the details of the engagement near White Sulphur Springs and of the
                    pursuit of the enemy.</p>
<p>The conduct of the troops on the 26th and 27th was admirable, and they moved
                    forward in pursuit with spirit and alacrity, and, although much fatigued,
                    without straggling.</p>
<p>Col. George S. Patton, commanding the brigade, displayed good judgment in placing
                    his troops in action, and his gallantry was conspicuous throughout the
                    engagement.</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted to the officers of my staff who were with me (Maj. W. B.
                    Myers, assistant adjutant-general ; Capt. R. L. Poor, Engineer Corps; and my
                    aides, Lieuts. James L. Fraser and P. C. Warwick) for the intelligent and active
                    performance of their duties. Lieutenant Warwick made a difficult and hazardous
                    reconnaissance of the enemy on the night of the 25th and morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>I must add that on receiving information of Averell's movements, I telegraphed to
                    the Secretary of War and General Lee, informing them of it, and asking that
                    Jenkins' brigade of cavalry and Wharton's, of infantry, be returned to me by way
                    of Staunton and Warm Springs, and they were ordered accordingly. If Wharton's
                    brigade had moved by railroad to Millborough, as I supposed it would, it would
                    have reached Callaghan's on the evening of the 26th or morning of the 27th. With
                    that force at Callaghan's and the First Brigade pressing in the rear, the
                    country is such that I scarcely think that General Averell's command could have
                    escaped destruction.</p>
<p>On first receiving information of the enemy's movement, apprehending that he
                    might be aiming at Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, I warned the home guards
                    along the line of that road to be in readiness to turn out at a moment's notice.
                    On the night of the 25th, I ordered them to turn out, which they did with great
                    alacrity, and were prepared to defend the important points along the line of
                    that road.</p>
<p>My inspector-general, Maj. Giles B. Cooke, assistant adjutant-general, was in
                    charge of my office at Dublin, and was very active and energetic in organizing
                    and disposing of this force.</p>
<p>The accompanying topographic sketch will illustrate the position of the troops
                    near White Sulphur Springs.</p>
<p>With great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Major-General.</p>
