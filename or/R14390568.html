<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Topographical Engineer Jedediah Hotchkiss kept a journal from August
                    to the end of December, 1864. In it, he details his role in campaigns in
                    Maryland and the Shenandoah Valley. Hotchkiss discusses events in Staunton, VA,
                    as well, including troop movements in the vicinity, the evacuation of the town
                    in October, personal business, dinner with Major M. G. Harman who had served as
                    Staunton's quartermaster, and Harman's efforts to select winter camps in Augusta
                    County.</p>

<p>Thursday, August 4.--We started at sunrise and went to Shepherdstown via Leetown.
                    Breckinridge went the same way. Rodes and Ramseur went by Martinsburg to near
                    Hainesville. Hdqrs. at Mrs. Bedinger's. Pleasant.</p>
<p>Friday, August 5.--We crossed the river to Sharpsburg and had engagement with
                    Coke's cavalry and drove them away, and then encamped near there. Gen. Early and
                    myself rode over part of the battle-field of Sharpsburg, and I sketched, by his
                    order, the position of his brigade there. Gen. Ransom accompanied us. Rodes and
                    Ramseur encamped at Claggett's Mill. A warm day.</p>
<p>Saturday, August 6.--We marched to Tilghmanton and the cross-roads beyond toward
                    Hagerstown, and then went to Williamsport and encamped on the Virginia side. We
                    found Rodes and Ramseur near Saint James' College. The general went to Saint
                    James' College and paroled Doctor Kerfoot and Professor Coit for the return of
                    Doctor Boyd, of Winchester, to his home in three weeks. He talked to Doctor
                    Kerfoot for some time. It began to rain very early in the morning and rained
                    most of the forenoon, then cleared off finely. We dined at Williamsport.
                    Breckinridge encamped opposite Williamsport. Rodes and Ramseur went to near
                    Hammond's Mill. The Yankees have a force at Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p>Sunday, August 7.--We started at an early hour and went to Martinsburg and spent
                    most of the day at Ed. Pendleton's, and in the p. m. went on to Bunker Hill.
                    Breckinridge came to Darkesville and Rodes and Ramseur to Bunker Hill. Gen.
                    Pegram reported for duty. Quite warm.</p>
<p>Monday, August 8.--Worked at map of the battle of Monocacy all day. Quite warm.
                    Enemy reported coming up from Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 9.--Spent day in camp at Bunker Hill making map of battle of
                    Monocacy. Robinson reducing Adams County and Oltmanas copying map of District of
                    Columbia. Lieut. Koerner came to see me in p. m. about details, &amp;c.
                    Warm.</p>
<p>Wednesday August 1O.--We moved at an early hour to Stephenson's Depot,
                    Breckinridge in advance, and then by Jordan Springs to the Red Bud and Abraham's
                    Creek, where Breckinridge encamped. Rodes marched to the right of the road at
                    Stephenson's and encamped. Ramseur marched yesterday to Winchester to meet a
                    reported advance of Averell from Romney. We got the details of the rout of our
                    cavalry at Moorefield. It was a disgraceful affair. We lost some 400 men and 4
                    pieces of artillery. We had headquarters near Burgess', a mile from Winchester
                    on the Berryville road. Dined at Walls. Warm day. Enemy made demonstrations on
                    the Millwood, Berryville, and Martinsburg roads in the p. m., and were easily
                    repulsed.</p>
<p>Thursday, August 11.--Appearances indicating a general attack by a large force,
                    we this morning formed a line of battle covering the approaches east and
                    southeast of Winchester; Breckinridge covering the Berryville and Millwood
                    roads, Ramseur the Front Royal road, and Rodes the Martinsburg road. Everything
                    was moved from Winchester and we had a skirmish on the Millwood road. About noon
                    I guided Gordon across the country, by a route I had selected in the a.m. , to
                    the pike near Kernstown and took him to a position south of Newtown. The rest of
                    the army followed, and we had a brisk skirmish, about dark, on the road to the
                    Double Toll-Gate from Newtown. We drove the enemy back and encamped near
                    Newtown. Headquarters at Chrisman's. Very warm. Bryan's and Lowry's batteries,
                    on the Millwood road, were engaged some.</p>
<p>Friday, August 12. --We marched at an early hour and went across Cedar Creek and
                    formed a line of battle. The Yankees came on and formed on the north side of the
                    creek, and we had some skirmishing but no general engagement. In the evening we
                    fell back to Fisher's Hill and took up our headquarters at Funkhouser's. I spent
                    the day reconnoitering and carrying orders, and at night took Col. Jackson and
                    his cavalry to the Middle road and posted them for pickets. Got to camp at
                    midnight. Very warm.</p>
<p>Saturday, August 13.--We selected a line of battle on Fisher's Hill, Wharton on
                    the right of the pike, Gordon to the top of the hill beyond the railroad,
                    Ramseur from Gordon to the top of the hill beyond the Middle road, and Rodes
                    half a mile beyond the Middle road with strong pickets across the Valley to the
                    Back road; cavalry in front, McCausland at the foot of Three Top Mountain,
                    Jackson on the Middle road and Johnson on the Back road. We spent the day on the
                    lines. The troops fortified them. Very warm.</p>
<p>Sunday, August 14.--We spent the day on the lines, staying under a tree by the
                    roadside. Had a little skirmishing with the enemy. Most of them remained on the
                    north side of Cedar Creek. Our signal men were driven off the point of Three Top
                    Mountain, but Capt. Keller and his sharpshooters drove the Yankees off and
                    killed 2 and captured 3.</p>
<p>Monday, August 15.--Spent the day on the lines and at Breckinridge's
                    headquarters. In the p.m. we drove the enemy back to Cedar Creek Hill and found
                    them in the same position. A very warm day. It rained late in the p.m. and at
                    night. Maj. Jones spent the night with me. Gen. Lomax came to-day.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 16.--Sketched the country between the river and Massanutten
                    Mountain and along the foot of Fisher's Hill. Quite warm. Fitz Lee came to see
                    Gen. Early, his cavalry being at Front Royal. Anderson had a fight with the
                    Yankee cavalry at Guard Hill, in which he got the worst of it.</p>
<p>Wednesday, August 17.--We found the enemy gone this morning and the smoke rising
                    from all parts of the Lower Valley from the burning of barns and hay and wheat
                    stacks by the retreating Yankees. We followed, Gordon in advance; then Wharton,
                    Ramseur, and Rodes. McCausland went down the Valley pike, Jackson on the Middle,
                    and Johnson on the Back roads. We did not get up with the enemy until we reached
                    Kernstown; there drove in the skirmishers, and found the cavalry posted on
                    Bower's Hill. I took Forsberg's small brigade to the Middle road and threw them
                    out to the left and drove the enemy from the hills in front and to the left of
                    Bell's, Johnson's cavalry being there on our left; then reported, and Wharton's
                    division was sent there. I put in it line to advance against Bower's Hill. Then
                    saw it go in and take the hill. Ramseur's sharpshooters advanced at the same
                    time. I watched the left of the line and the advance of Johnson's cavalry, then
                    reported to Gen. Early after dark. Gordon crossed from Kernstown to the Front
                    Royal road and came into Winchester from that way. We lost some killed and
                    wounded, and inflicted some loss on the enemy and drove them through the town.
                    We got the town just after dark. We encamped at Pritchard's, near Kernstown. We
                    took 200 prisoners. The day was pleasant and cloudy; part of it very hot.
                    Anderson marched up to the Opequon.</p>
<p>Thursday, August 18.--We moved our camp to the yard of Mrs. Wood, near the Town
                    Spring, at Winchester. Rodes moved out a mile or so on the Berryville road,
                    Ramseur on the Martinsburg road, and Gordon and Wharton remained on Abraham's
                    Creek, near Hollingsworth's Mill. Gen. Anderson came up with Kershaw's division
                    and Fitz Lee's cavalry and encamped near the Opequon, on the Front Royal and
                    Millwood roads. It rained most of last night and half of to-day quite steadily.
                    Oltmanns finished a map of the Valley, which I sent to Gen. Lomax, and corrected
                    some maps.</p>
<p>Friday, August 19.--We moved at an early hour to Bunker Hill, Ramseur in advance,
                    followed by Rodes and Breckinridge. All encamped in the vicinity of Bunker Hill.
                    Anderson and Fitz Lee remained at Winchester. Lomax and his cavalry went to
                    vicinity of Martinsburg and halt the line of the Opequon all along. A fine day.
                    Slight showers. Cool evening. Lomax went to Martinsburg and Shepherdstown.</p>
<p>Saturday, August 20.--We spent the day in camp. I corrected some maps. Oltmanns
                    copied part of battle of Monocacy and Robinson copied a Valley map. It rained
                    and misted most of the day. We had some skirmishing with the enemy along the
                    Opequon. Camps as yesterday.</p>
<p>Sunday, August 21.--We moved toward Charlestown at an early hour. Drove the enemy
                    from the Opequon. Met their infantry skirmishers at Aldridge's about 9.30 a.m.
                    Rodes was in front and threw out his skirmishers and drove the enemy to the
                    vicinity of Charlestown. Ramseur was put on his right and advanced to near the
                    Summit Point road. Anderson came by the old Winchester and Charlestown road and
                    Fitz Lee by the Berryville road. They had some fighting near Summit Point. We
                    advanced by Smithfield. It threatened rain some, but cleared off by noon. Lomax,
                    with Vaughn, Johnson, and Jackson, advanced by Leetown and then toward Summit
                    Point with part of his force from Smithfield. Gordon was put on the right and
                    Wharton on the left of the pike in reserve. We skirmished with the enemy during
                    the p.m. and used some artillery. They made some advances, but were repulsed. We
                    encamped some two and a half miles from Charlestown. A fine day. I reconnoitered
                    positions, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Monday, August 22.--We advanced at an early hour and found the enemy gone,
                    leaving only cavalry behind. We soon drove them off, and three miles beyond
                    Charlestown. Anderson and Fitz Lee came to vicinity of Charlestown, and our
                    cavalry was thrown out toward Shepherdstown and toward the Shenandoah. It rained
                    very hard for several hours in the p.m. I dined at Mr. Strider's. Robinson
                    copied map for Gen. Kershaw in p.m. and night. Hdqrs. near Davenport's.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 23.--The army remained in front of Charlestown. Made some few
                    movements to thwart moved of the enemy, moving more to the left. I sketched the
                    portion of country that we fought over on Sunday. There was a dense for in the
                    morning, but it cleared off and became quite warm. Hdqrs. at Davenport's.</p>
<p>Wednesday, August 24.--Still at same place. Enemy drove in our pickets toward
                    Harper's Ferry and created some stir, which was soon quelled. Quiet the rest of
                    the day. I rode over to Rock's Ford, on the Shenandoah, to view the country.
                    Dined with Maj. Adams at Osborne's. Very warm day.</p>
<p>Thursday, August 25.--We started at an early hour for Shepherdstown, via Leetown,
                    Wharton in front, followed by Gordon, Rodes, and Ramseur. Fitz Lee went by
                    Smithfield to Leetown and Lomax collected his at the same place, and all went on
                    to Martinsburg and Williamsport. We met the enemy's cavalry advance about one
                    mile and a half from Leetown and had quite a heavy skirmish with them. Wharton's
                    division was thrown out and engaged, most of it on the left of the road. Gordon
                    was moved to the right and Rodes to the left. We soon drove the enemy off, with
                    considerable loss on both sides. They made another stand near Shepherdstown on
                    the Charlestown road, which Gordon repulsed with Terry's brigade on the left,
                    then York and Evans on the right. Quite a lively skirmish ensued, in which
                    Gordon was wounded in the head, but he gallantly dashed on, the blood direction,
                    and encamped at night near Shepherdstown. Hdqrs. at Boteler's house. A stampede
                    of ambulances when the firing began came near causing a stampede of Wharton's
                    division. We lost a good many. The Yanks had started on a raid and had three
                    days' rations with them. Very warm. The cavalry is opposite Williamsport
                    to-night.</p>
<p>Friday, August 26.--We spent about half the day at Shepherdstown, then marched
                    back to Leetown, Ramseur in advance, followed by Rodes, Gordon and Wharton. Our
                    cavalry came to the vicinity of Shepherdstown, having found the enemy in force
                    to oppose their passage at Williamsport. They had an artillery duel in the
                    morning. Anderson had a fight near Charlestown in the p.m. Hdqrs. in the orchard
                    at the old Gen. Lee house. Col. Boteler spends the night with me. Robinson and
                    Oltmanns worked awhile at maps. Fine day. Windy and some rain at night.</p>
<p>Saturday, August 27.--We continued our march back to our old camp at Bunker Hill.
                    Rodes went by Dandridge's and the Sulphur Springs, the rest by Smithfield.
                    Ramseur followed by Gordon and Wharton. Anderson came from Charlestown by
                    Smithfield, and went on to Stephenson's. Pleasant, but quite cool in the p.m. We
                    also found the cavalry falling back, but Gen. Early ordered McCausland back to
                    Charlestown, and he went beyond toward Harper's Ferry. Fitz Lee and Lomax
                    remained near Shepherdstown.</p>
<p>Sunday, August 28.--We spent the day in camp at Bunker Hill, and had preaching in
                    some of the divisions. The enemy's cavalry advanced on ours, and we had some
                    fighting near Smithfield, especially Harry Gilmor, but our cavalry retired,
                    Lomax toward Bunker Hill, and Fitz Lee toward Brucetown. The enemy occupied
                    Smithfield, burning three houses there. Some infantry marched toward the
                    Opequon, but was not engaged. The day was quite cool. Robinson made a map for
                    Gen. Wickham.</p>
<p>Monday, August 29.--The enemy's cavalry advanced this morning and drove ours
                    across the Opequon. Ramseur was marched out by the turnpike and advanced to
                    drive them back. Gordon moved by a road to the right to turn the enemy's left
                    flank. The artillery was also advanced. After some brisk commanding across the
                    creek, and skirmishing, we drove the enemy through Smithfield and two miles and
                    a half beyond, then returned to our old camps again. Rodes help the road toward
                    Martinsburg. We lost 10 killed and 75 wounded. Late in the p.m. our cavalry was
                    again driven across the Opequon by the enemy. I went to Gen. Anderson in the
                    morning to apprise him of the situation, then came back and witnessed most of
                    the advance. Pleasant day. Cool in morning and evening. Robinson and Oltmanns
                    worked at maps. I sent Green's baggage to Winchester.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 30.--Spent the day in camp, not feeling very well, but worked
                    some at maps. Robinson and Oltmanns copying maps of the Valley. Fine day; cool
                    night; all quiet.</p>
<p>Wednesday, August 31.--I sketched the road to the Opequon and back. The Yankee
                    cavalry made some advances toward Winchester. Came to the Opequon. Anderson
                    moved back to near Winchester. Our cavalry was moved to meet them, but they went
                    back in the p.m. and the usual quiet prevailed. Fine day; cool at night. Rodes'
                    division went to Martinsburg and back.</p>
<p>Thursday, September 1.--I rode up to Winchester in the a.m. and brought back some
                    dispatches for Gen. Early. Oltmanns copied map of the Valley. Robinson finished
                    reducing Adams County, Pa. A very fine day.</p>
<p>Friday, September 2.--Dispatches came in the morning stating that the enemy was
                    moving toward Berryville in force. So we moved across the country toward Stone
                    Chapel by Fry's Ford, Gordon in advance, followed by Wharton and Ramseur. We got
                    nearly to Stone Chapel when Vaughan's brigade of our cavalry to stampeded at
                    Bunker Hill and ran away, leaving the wagons and Johnson's brigade to take care
                    of themselves. A few hundred cavalry took fourteen wagons and some men and
                    compelled us to turn back. Rodes had been left near Stephenson's. He turned back
                    and drove the enemy nearly to Bunker Hill. We turned back through Brucetown,
                    Ramseur in advance, and encamped between Brucetown and Stephenstown's. Our
                    wagons went from Stephenson's nearly to Summit Point ahead of the army, but all
                    got back safely to Stephenstown's about midnight. The enemy retired and Fitz Lee
                    reported that the enemy had gone to City Point. Anderson and Fitz Lee moved
                    toward Berryville.</p>
<p>Saturday, September 3.--The enemy's cavalry appeared at White Post this morning
                    threatening to come to Newtown. Fitz Lee moved toward Newtown and Anderson
                    toward Berryville. He met the enemy near there in the p.m. and drove them from a
                    line of works with small loss. The cannonading kept up until 9 p.m. Rodes
                    started in the morning for Bunker Hill, to be followed by the rest of the corps;
                    but he alone went on and had a skirmish with the enemy there after the cavalry
                    fight, in which Harry Gilmor was wounded. Ramseur remained in camp guarding some
                    roads. At night Gordon moved to Winchester, his men in high spirits. It rained
                    in the night; began just about dark. I went to Winchester to attend to some
                    business.</p>
<p>Sunday, September 4.--We were roused up very early to go to Berryville, Ramseur
                    in front, followed up Wharton and Rodes (Gordon remained at Winchester). We
                    found Anderson in line of battle in front of Berryville and joined on to his
                    left. He was skirmishing some with the enemy. Their cavalry soon passed back
                    from Millwood. We marched to find the enemy's right flank. Went as far as Sidney
                    Allen's. Found them well fortified, so skirmished with them until night and then
                    withdrew to a line parallel with the Winchester and Berryville roads, and there
                    spent the night. Hdqrs. at Russell's. A fine day. It rained some at night.</p>
<p>Monday, September 5.--We remained in front of Berryville until 2 p.m., then
                    withdrew and returned to Stephenson's Depot by the way of the Burnt Factory,
                    Jordan Springs, &amp;c. Rodes was in front, followed by Wharton and Ramseur.
                    Anderson moved back to Winchester in the morning. Our cavalry had a skirmish
                    with the enemy below Stephenson's and was falling back when Rodes' advance came
                    there, just before dark, and threw out a brigade to the right of the pike and
                    advanced rapidly and drove Averell's cavalry some three miles, inflicting some
                    damage. It rained very hard late in the p.m. and also after dark. Hdqrs. at Mrs.
                    Stephenson's.</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 6.--We spent the day in camp, and it rained and misted most of
                    the time. I corrected maps and wrote some letters. Gave Col. Smith a map of the
                    northeast of Virginia.</p>
<p>Wednesday, September 7.--I rode over a back road to Winchester on the left of the
                    pike and back by one of the right and sketched them. A fine, clear day. Enemy's
                    cavalry made a demonstration near Brucetown; also near the Yellow House on the
                    Martinsburg road, and also on the Millwood and Front Royal roads not far from
                    Winchester, and were repulsed at all points. The general went to Winchester.</p>
<p>Thursday, September 8.--I went to Newtown to-day to see Lieut. Koerner. Met him
                    and we went to Maj. Jones' and spent the night. It rained most of the day; began
                    at 10 a.m. We changed camp and went back of Mrs. Stephenson's.</p>
<p>Friday, September 9.--It cleared off and we had a fine day. Koerner and myself
                    came back to camp, then went over to Breckinridge's and fixed to have his
                    engineer company go and aid in the survey of the country. The enemy came to the
                    Opequon and burned some mills. Wharton went to meet them.</p>
<p>Saturday, September 10.--We moved down to Bunker Hill, Rodes in front, followed
                    by Ramseur. Some of Lomax's brigade preceded us. We had a very hard rained in
                    the morning, with thunder and lighting. We marched through. Our infantry marched
                    just beyond Darkeville. Our cavalry drove the Yankees through Martinsburg after
                    the infantry had started them from Darkesville. All the enemy went south of that
                    stream. We came back to our old camp at Bunker Hill. Ramseur and Rodes came
                    there. Lomax remained at Darkeville. The day became pleasant.</p>
<p>Sunday, September 11.--It began to rain about 11 p.m. last night and rained very
                    hard until 7 this morning, with thunder and vivid lightning. The infantry moved
                    back to Stephenson's to-day. I went with Capt. Wilbourn by the Back road to our
                    old camp at Stephenson's. The cavalry remained at Darkeville. There were several
                    hard showers during the day, accompanied by thunder and lightning. We dined at
                    Mr. Abbott's.</p>
<p>Monday, September 12.--Spent the day in camp preparing to go to Staunton. All
                    quiet. A fine day; showery. Cool morning and evenings. Maj. Jones dined with us.</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 13.--I left for home. Went to the engineer camp, seven miles
                    southwest of Strasburg, and spent the night. There was heavy cannonading near
                    Brucetown when I left. A fine, cool day. The enemy advanced on the old
                    Charlestown road. We broke up camp at Stephenson's at 2 p.m. The general spent
                    the day at Carpenter's battery on the left of the road near the Opequon. We
                    skirmished across the creek. Carpenter had 2 guns disabled, 3 men killed, and 5
                    wounded. Gordon on the left. Ramseur on the right. Enemy left. Hdqrs. at same
                    place at night.</p>
<p>Wednesday, September 14.--I rode as far as Mr. Cowan's, near Tenth Legion. It
                    rained very hard most of the day. Cold and chilly. Col. Boteler left for
                    Winchester. Anderson took his division away to Culpeper Court-House via Front
                    Royal.</p>
<p>Thursday, September 15.--Went on home by way of Mossy Creek. Dined at Mr. Craun's
                    and called at Maj. McCue's. A fine, cool day. The people are busy sowing grain.
                    Grass is growing finely. Otlmanns made copy of map of Virginia. Lieut. Boyd came
                    to headquarters to report to Lieut. Koerner.</p>
<p>Friday, September 16.--Went to Staunton by the way of E. Geeding's. Looked some
                    for supplies. Got maps and sent some down to camp. A fine day. Cool in evening.
                    Lieut. Koerner sent Boyd and Chichester to the west of Winchester to survey.</p>
<p>Saturday, September 17.--Rode around among my neighbors to buy supplies for the
                    year. Had some difficulty, but got along well. Fine, bracing day. They had
                    dinner in camp at 1 p.m. and two days' rations were ordered, and moved at 3 p.m.
                    to Bunker Hill, Gordon in advance, preceded by Jackson and followed by Rodes.
                    Camped at Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>Sunday, September 18.--I spent the day at home, as it portended rain and rained
                    some in the a.m. Henry Sieg and others called to see me. Fine day. At 3 a.m.
                    Gordon marched for Martinsburg. Cavalry met enemy's pickets at Big Spring and
                    drove them through town of Martinsburg. Two brigades of Gordon went to the left
                    of Martinsburg, and one (York's) to the right. Destroyed Tuscarora bridge, took
                    21 men and horses, 5 wagon loads of coal, and 5 coils of telegraph wire. Left at
                    4 p.m. and came back to Bunker Hill; headquarters at Stephenson's. Rodes came to
                    Stephenson's. Grant said to be at Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p>Monday, September 19.--I started back to camp by the way of Staunton. Passed
                    through Harrisonburg, where there was a large crowd at court. Came to Big Spring
                    and spent the night at Lincoln's. Fine, warm day. Enemy came on by the
                    Berryville road and Ramseur engaged them three miles from Winchester, at right
                    angles to the road, from 3 a.m. Lomax, Johnson, and Jackson on the right. Rodes
                    came up at 10 a.m. and formed on Ramseur's left, and Gordon came about noon and
                    formed on Rodes' left. Wharton came up and fought along the Martinsburg road to
                    Gordon's rear. He drove the enemy's cavalry back several times. The infantry
                    fighting became heavy about noon. Gen. Rodes was killed between 1 and 2 p.m.
                    Enemy advanced several times. Were repulsed with very great loss. The Yankee
                    cavalry made a dash on our left at 1 p.m. and were driven back, but at 4 p.m.
                    they turned our left and fell on our rear and made our men give way in great
                    confusion, coming to the suburbs of Winchester. Then Gordon's line gave way and
                    we were compelled to retreat about sundown. This was effected with little loss.
                    The enemy's cavalry come on to Kernstown, but were checked by Ramseur. We fell
                    back to Newtown, Gordon in front and Ramseur in the rear. Camped about midnight.
                    We took 400 prisoners and inflicted a loss of 8,000 or 10,000 on the enemy. Our
                    loss about 1,500. Fine day. Chilly night. . .</p>
<p>Saturday, September 24.--We formed a line of battle on Rude's Hill in the
                    morning, Wharton on the left and Ramseur on the right, in front, and Pegram on
                    the right and Gordon on the left, in the rear, and remained there until noon.
                    The enemy came on and threw a few shells and began to move up the opposite side
                    of the river on our left flank. We then fell back to near New Market, then
                    gradually, in line of battle and by the flank, skirmishing and using artillery,
                    to Tenth Legion Church, where we formed a line and kept the enemy at bay until
                    after dark. The enemy drove our cavalry rapidly on the Back and Middle roads.
                    Wickham brought his cavalry across the Massanutten enemy followed him closely. I
                    took orders to Maj. Harman about the wagons, and then aided in getting them off
                    the pike and onto to Keezletown road. After dark the infantry retired to
                    Flook's, eighth miles from Tenth Legion, on the Keezletown road, getting there
                    about midnight, Ramseur in front, followed by Gordon, Wharton, and Pegram. I
                    remained and posted Jackson's cavalry brigade. Our cavalry was driven in great
                    confusion nearly to Harrisonburg. We rested at the wagons at Flook's until the
                    moon rose. A fine day. Cool in p.m. and some rain.</p>
<p>Sunday, September 25.--We started the wagons on toward Port Republic at 1 a.m. At
                    daylight the army came on, Pegram in rear, by Peale's Cross-Roads,
                    Meyerhoeffer's Store, &amp;c. Wharton preceded Pegram. I came to Port
                    Republic to guide the head of the train. It went on to Brown's Gap. Harman and
                    Allan were with me. I rode on to Staunton to look after my map box. Got there by
                    noon. Found much excitement. They were evacuating the place. I dined at Maj.
                    Harman's. Got back to camp by 10 p.m., having ridden forty miles to-day. A fine
                    warm day. The enemy did not follow. Their cavalry came to Harrisonburg. We got
                    out whole commanding into Brown's Gap, except the cavalry. Left them north of
                    the South River. Hdqrs. at Mount Vernon Furnance.</p>
<p>Monday, September 26.--Kershaw's division came up from Saint Run Gap. Joined us
                    about noon. The Yankee artillery fired a few shots at it as it turned off at
                    Lewis' to come to Brown's Gap, and a few cavalry went down the river to attack
                    his trains. Kershaw got some men and artillery in position and gave them a warm
                    reception. The Yankee cavalry drove ours across the river and came up to our
                    lines. Pegram's division was marched out on the Cave road, and skirmished some
                    with them near the angle of the road, and repulsed several charges of their
                    cavalry, using artillery. The enemy also advanced on the turnpike, and Ramseur
                    drove them back from there. Wharton moved out in rear of Ramseur, and Gordon in
                    rear of Pegram. I showed Kershaw the way up, and carried some orders. Oltmanns
                    copied a map of the Valley. A fine, warm day. Enemy reported up South River, and
                    Wickham moved to near Patterson's, on South River. My horse was killed by a
                    bullet in the Yankee charge.</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 27.--Wickham crossed the river at Patterson's, and Gordon
                    followed him with artillery, &amp;c. Ramseur followed Gordon. We attacked
                    the Yankee cavalry encamped near Weyer's Cave and drove them away from between
                    Middle and South Rivers, and also from the vicinity of Port Republic, giving
                    them some help with our artillery as they went toward Harrisonburg. Pegram
                    pushed forward shaw held the front of Brown's Gap. Wharton followed Pegram. We
                    surprised the Yankees, but an untimely opening of artillery advised them of our
                    approach. We brought our camp to opposite Weyer's Cave. The army (except
                    Kershaw, who remained at the Furnace) encamped between the rivers. I suggested
                    the routes of the army and guided movements. Pleasant day.</p>
<p>Wednesday, September 28.--We started at an early hour to go to Waynesborough, but
                    a report of an attack on Pegram's pickets turned us back for a time. Then we had
                    to wait for Kershaw's train to pass by. Then a misunderstanding of orders caused
                    delay at Mount Meridian. The train went up South River and crossed at
                    Patterson's Ford, Ramseur in front. Pegram, followed by Wharton, went by the
                    Waynesborough road from Mount Meridian. Five miles from Waynesborough Wharton
                    took the River road and Pegram kept on to Dogtown. I guided Kershaw by Mount
                    Meridian to New Hope. A mile beyond New Hope we took the Waynesborough road. We
                    encountered the enemy's cavalry pickets near the Hermitage, five miles from
                    Waynesborough, and drove them rapidly forward. Pegram drove them to Dogtown by
                    dark, and attacked them there just after Wickham drove them through
                    Waynesborough from toward Rocksfish Gap, whither he had gone by the south bank
                    of South River. Pegram drove them to Dogtown by dark, and attacked them there
                    just after Wickham drove them through Waynesborough from toward Rockfish Gap,
                    whither he had gone by the south bank of South River. Pegram had driven the
                    Yanks three miles and a half. He gallantly attacked them after dark and drove
                    them toward Fishersville and encamped where they had had their camp on the
                    Staunton road. Gordon followed Kershaw. All encamped in the vicinity of
                    Waynesborough at a late hour. Hdqrs. at Gallagher's. A fine day. Some rain in
                    p.m.</p>
<p>Thursday, September 29.--We moved our camp to the southwest of Waynesborough and
                    spent the day cleaning up. I rode around the lines with the general in the a.m.
                    The enemy went toward Mossy Creek at a rapid rate. They made the night light
                    with burning barns, hay stacks, &amp;c., during the day and night. I went to
                    the tunnel in the morning to see if any damage had been done there; also
                    examined the track of the railroad and got the pioneers and engineer troops at
                    work on the bridge across South River, which the enemy had burned. Showery day.
                    Rained hard at night. Quite warm.</p>
<p>Friday, September 30.--We spent the day at Waynesborough. It rained and misted in
                    the morning, but got quite pleasant in the p.m. The Yankees went to Bridgewater
                    yesterday. Our cavalry went up to Staunton and put pickets out to Middle River.
                    A great deal of burning going on to-night toward Rockingham-mills, barns,
                    &amp;c. . .</p>
<p>Monday, October 3.--Spent the day in camp. Army quiet, save some skirmishing with
                    Yankee cavalry along North River. It misted and rained during the day and rained
                    hard at night. Gen. Rosser came yesterday, and to-day reconnoitered the front.
                    The enemy holds the line of North River. Sent map of Southeastern Virginia to
                    Gen. R. E. Lee.</p>
<p>Tuesday, October 4.--Spent the day in camp. Oltmanns went to Staunton. Robinson
                    copied map of Valley. It cleared off and was a fine day. All quiet. Rosser's
                    cavalry encamped near Staunton; came from Lynchburg and Richmond. The enemy
                    burned barns, &amp;c., at night.</p>
<p>Wednesday, October 5.--Spent the day in camp drawing--Robinson reducing
                    Pennsylvania maps, Otlmanns copying Valley map. Gordon moved camp to vicinity of
                    Naked Creek. Rosser moved to Landes' Mill, on road from Stone Church to Mossy
                    Creek. Cars ran to Smith's to-day, two miles and a half from Staunton. We have
                    rebuilt the bridges over South River and Christian's Creek. About two miles of
                    track are to be railed. Enemy still near Harrisonburg. The general rode along
                    the lines to-day. Fine day. Lieut. Boyd dined with us. . .</p>
<p>Saturday, October 22.--I started on the state for Richmond at 7 a.m. to bear
                    dispatches to Gen. Lee. Got to Staunton after dark. Spent the night at M. G.
                    Harman's. Had quite a long chat with Andrew Hunter. Quite cool.</p>
<p>Sunday, October 23.--Went to Richmond on the cars. Many of the reserves were
                    going down and I met some coming to the Valley District. A fine day, but cool. I
                    went to Gen. Lawton's to get a horse to go to Gen. Lee's at Chaffin's. Took tea
                    with Gen. Lawton and had a long chat. Got a horse and went to Gen. Lee's, six
                    miles. Got there at 11 p.m. Saw Gen. Lee and we had a long talk about matters in
                    the Valley, commanding generals, &amp;c. I spent the night there. Gen. Early
                    told me not to tell Gen. Lee that we ought to have advanced in the morning at
