<p><b>Summary:<br></b>The railroad running out of Staunton served as a crucial supply route for
                    Confederate armies in Virginia. In this June, 1864, letter, General Grant writes
                    General George Meade discussing orders for a cavalry raid to Charlottesville and
                    Gordonsville. Grant orders that the cavalry go as far west as Staunton,
                    destroying rails all the way.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. MEADE,<br> Cmdg. Army of the Potomac:</p>
<p>Cold Harbor, Va.,</p>
<p>June 5, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The object of the cavalry expedition to Charlottesville and Gordonsville is to
                    effectually break up the railroad connection between Richmond and the Shenandoah
                    Valley and Lynchburg. To secure this, they should go as far as Charlottesville,
                    and work upon the Lynchburg branch and main line to Staunton for several miles
                    beyond the junction. This done they could work back this way to where the road
                    is already destroyed, or until driven off by a superior force. It is desirable
                    that every rail on the road destroyed should be so bent or twisted as to make it
                    impossible to repair the road without supplying new rails. After the work is
                    accomplished, herein directed, the cavalry will rejoin the main army, keeping
                    north of the Pamunkey until the position of the army is known to them. It may be
                    found necessary to keep on the north side as far down as West Point.
                    Instructions will be sent to Gen. Hunter by the cavalry expedition. He will be
                    required to join his force to Gen. Sheridan's and return with him to the Army of
                    the Potomac. If it is found practicable, whilst the cavalry is at the most
                    westerly point reached by it, to detach a brigade or more to go over to the
                    James River and destroy the canal, it will be a service well repaying for three
                    or four days' detention.</p>
