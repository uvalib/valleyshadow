<p><b>Summary:<br></b>George B. McClellan, commanding Union forces in West Virginia during July, 1861,
                    writes Assistant Adjutant Edward Townsend to ask if he should advance on
                    Staunton.</p>

<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>BUCKHANNON,</p>
<p>July 7, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Newspaper reports say that my department is to be broken up. I hope the General
                    will leave under my control both the operations on the Mississippi and in
                    Western Virginia. If he cannot do so, the Indiana and Ohio troops are necessary
                    to my success. With these means at my disposal, and such recourses as I command
                    in Virginia, if the Government will give me ten thousand arms for distribution
                    in Eastern Tennessee I think I can break the backbone of Secession. Please
                    instruct whether to move on Staunton or on to Wytheville. I thank the General
                    for his commendation, and hope to deserve rather in the future than in the past.
                    Please enforce the occupation of Cumberland and Piedmont. The condition of
                    things in that vicinity renders it absolutely necessary to occupy both these
                    points, and you will remember that my command does not extend that far. I cannot
                    too strongly impress upon you the necessity of holding these points. The
                    Pennsylvania State troops now in the vicinity of Cumberland will answer the
                    purpose perfectly well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. McCLELLAN,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
