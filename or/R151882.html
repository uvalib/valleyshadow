<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Randolph Marcy writes General George Stoneman in October, 1862, to
                    report that Confederate forces left Chambersburg, and to discuss further
                    movements and attempts at pursuit.</p>

<p>Gen. G. STONEMAN, Poolesville, Md.:</p>
<p>HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,</p>
<p>October 12, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>By direction of the commanding general I telegraphed to you at 1 p. m. yesterday,
                    informing you that a force of about 2,000 rebel cavalry had left Chambersburg at
                    9 o'clock yesterday morning, in the direction of Gettysburg, and that as they
                    might be making for some ford opposite Leesburg, you would keep your cavalry
                    scouts well out on the approaches from the direction of Frederick, so that you
                    might receive notice in time to mass your troops at any point the rebels might
                    attempt to cross. It does not appear either from your own dispatches, or from
                    those of Gen. Pleasonton, that, with the exception of a few companies of
                    infantry, he received any support from you. His men had marched seventy-eight
                    miles during the previous twenty-four hours, and he states that in consequence
                    of having so little assistance after holding them in check for two hours, they
                    were allowed to escape across the river. Troops were placed at other points to
                    prevent the rebels getting back into Virginia, and the commanding general relied
                    upon you to intercept them if they came in your immediate vicinity. He now
                    requires from you a written explanation of the reasons why you did not carry out
                    the instructions communicated to you in my dispatch of 1 p. m. yesterday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. B. MARCY,<br> Chief of Staff.</p>
