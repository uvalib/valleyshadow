<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Fitz-John Porter, Assistant Adjutant to Union General Robert Patterson, writes
                    from Chambersburg in June, 1861, with orders for General George Cadwalader.
                    Porter instructs him to detail men to aid Union forces at Cumberland. Porter
                    also mentions the burning of Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>Brevet Maj. Gen. GEORGE CADWALADER,<br> Commanding First
                        Division, Pennsylvania Volunteers:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA,</p>
<p>June 15, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>Cumberland is threatened by a large force (three thousand men) and asks for aid.
                    If you are certain that the enemy has abandoned the right bank of the Potomac
                    and cannot injure you in any possible manner, the commanding general desires you
                    to detail towards Cumberland, as assistance, a section of artillery, a squadron
                    of cavalry, and three regiments of infantry, using for the purpose the
                    transportation of other regiments. No risk, however, must be run to endanger
                    your own force, lest you be cut up in detail. The burning of Harper's Ferry may
                    be a decoy, and hence the general enjoins the utmost caution upon you and Capt.
                    Newton and every officer. Just at this time, when a movement is made, the danger
                    is the greatest. If you can hire a man to go to Cumberland and tell Col. Wallace
                    what you have decided to do, the general desires it.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
