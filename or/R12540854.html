<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones writes Robert E. Lee regarding June, 1863,
                    supply transfers and troop movements. He reports ordering artillery sent from
                    Richmond to Staunton for General Albert Jenkin's use.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Gen. R. E. LEE.</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>June 6, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letters of the 1st and 3d instant have been received. Though I have relied
                    on the cattle brought out from Northwestern Virginia by my commissary for the
                    subsistence in part of my own troops, I cannot, with a clear conscience,
                    withhold from your army anything it absolutely needs, and which it is in my
                    power to give; you may, therefore, have the cattle. There are only 1,140
                    remaining now, and I will have them turned over to any one you may designate;
                    but, general, they are in no condition now to be butchered. They are now on fine
                    grass in Greenbrier, and, if allowed to remain there until October, will
                    probably be nearly double in weight what they are now. It would be a great waste
                    to butcher them now. They are yours, however, to be disposed of as you think
                    proper.</p>
<p>So with the transportation that Imboden's expedition captured and brought out. I
                    shall be obliged to let you have it, or rather that part of it which I thought
                    fully belonged to this department. Indeed, I did not know that any of it would
                    go to your army proper, but supposed Imboden would keep it all and it was no
                    more than he needed.</p>
<p>I hope you will be able to send the Fiftieth Virginia Regt. back to me soon. My
                    command is smaller, I think, than you imagine, and whilst there is no decided
                    indication that the enemy in my front contemplate an advance soon, it is
                    impossible to tell when they may do so, their facilities for suddenly
                    re-enforcing their troops in the Kanawha Valley are so great. In the meantime
                    there are very decided indications that Burnside is moving on East Tennessee,
                    and if he does, Gen. Buckner will expect me to aid him, and I can do so only to
                    a very limited extent.</p>
<p>I send with this a copy of a letter from Lieut. Col. W. P. Thompson, of the
                    Nineteenth Virginia Cavalry. It gives information which I think it desirable you
                    should have, especially as Brig.-Gen. Imboden acts directly under your orders. I
                    have only the Nineteenth Virginia Cavalry, a new regiment recently organized in
                    Pocahontas County, near Huntersville. I have no other troops nearer that line
                    than Meadow Bluff.</p>
<p>Will you please inform me where Jenkins' cavalry is, and where it is intended to
                    operate? I desire to send to him an artillery company which I organized for his
                    brigade. The guns for the company were ordered to be sent from Richmond to
                    Staunton. I understand that Jenkins' cavalry is only temporarily detached from
                    my command.</p>
<p>I am much obliged for your kind wishes for my success in the summer campaign. In
                    the present reduced condition of my command, the most that I can expect is to
                    guard securely all the country I now occupy.</p>
<p>With great respect and esteem, general, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
