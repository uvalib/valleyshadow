<p>Capt. WAGER:<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Cedar Creek,</p>
<p>May 19, 1864. (Received 11 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch dated May 17, 10 p. m., has been received. I reported to the
                    Adjutant-Gen., from Mount Jackson and Strasburg on the 15th and 16th instant,
                    that we had me Breckinridge on the 15th at New Market, and fought him the whole
                    day with about 5,500 men, against about 8,000 to 9,000 men. After a loss of 800
                    killed and wounded, I withdrew my force slowly to Mount Jackson. The enemy
                    sustained heavy losses. I deemed it prudent to withdraw behind Cedar Creek, in
                    which position I am at present, with my advance between Strasburg and Woodstock.
                    The enemy has made no advance; his main force is at Mount Jackson and New Market
                    and his cavalry at Woodstock. I will watch his movements, follow him closely if
                    he withdraws, and resist him if he advances. I have ordered the last two
                    regiments from the interior of the department to join me, and have directed Gen.
                    Crook, through Gen. Kelley, to operate from Lewisburg in the direction of
                    Staunton.</p>
<p></p>
<p>F. SIGEL,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
