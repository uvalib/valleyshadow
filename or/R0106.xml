				<p>In compliance with your circular of this date, I have the honor to make the
					following report of the operations of my regiment in the late movement:</p>
				<p>On the afternoon of the 5th instant I received orders to break up camp at Fort
					Dushane, and, as soon as relieved, to join the brigade near the Gurley house.
					Being relieved at once by the One hundred and nineteenth Regt. Pennsylvania
					Volunteers, I was soon, with the other regiments composing the brigade, at the
					designated place. The march was continued until we reached the Jerusalem plank
					road, where we were offered to bivouac for the night. During the 6th we remained
					quietly in camp. On the evening of that day orders were received to move at
					daylight on the next morning. On the morning of the 7th we were on the march
					before daylight, with our brigade leading the column. The march was southward on
					the Jerusalem plank road, which we followed for thirteen miles, when the march
					was directed southwest toward Sussez Court-House (passing the Nottoway on
					pontoons), at which place we arrived at 9 p. m., and bivouacked for the night,
					after having marched about twenty miles. It rained some during the day; there
					was no fighting. At daylight of the 8th the column was on the march southward on
					the Sussex road, but after marching in that direction for two miles turned to
					the right and westward past Coman's Well, and in the direction of the Weldon
					railroad at Potts' Store. On this part of the march a body of the enemy's
					cavalry was met with, and, after some skirmishing, was driven off, only serving
					to retard the march for a half hour. At a point near the railroad my regiment
					was formed in line and across the road running parallel with the railroad to
					support a small body of cavalry, and to hold and defend the approach while other
					troops were engaged in destroying the railroad. We occupied this point until 7
					p. m., when the brigade was ordered to the railroad, where we were employed in
					the labor of destroying the road until about 11 p. m., when we bivouacked for
					the night.</p>
				<p>On the morning of the 9th the march continued southward along the railroad,
					destroying it as we advanced. The station at Jarratt's was utterly destroyed by
					troops of the First Division. The march and the destruction was continued until
					evening, the enemy being met near Belville [Belfield], and after considerable
					cannonading and skirmishing was driven over the river. My regiment, with the
					other regiments of the brigade, was thrown across the roads leading from the
					rear, and bivouacked for the night. The weather had now become very cold and
					stormy; it was raining and snowing . On the morning of the 10th the return
					movement began at daylight. The roads were deep with mud and water. The trees
					were covered with ice. Our brigade was designated to cover the rear. Cannonading
					and skirmishing began early, mostly with the cavalry. The rear guard did not
					move until about 12 m. After it marched some two hours, and was so wearied as a
					wood. Soon after halting, and before all the flankers and skirmishers had
					emerged from the woods, leaving a squadron of cavalry still in their rear, the
					enemy's cavalry charged, driving the squadron of Second New York Cavalry* into
					our infantry lines in great confusion. Brig.-Gen. Baxter, commanding brigade,
					immediately formed a line of battle across the road (my regiment being on the
					left of the road), part of which opened fire on the enemy as they emerged from
					the wood, when they quickly turned and fled. The march was continued, the men
					becoming very weary before reaching the camp some four miles south of Sussex
					Court-House, after having marched in mud, water, and show for sixteen miles. The
					enemy's cavalry again attacked part of our brigade, and were repulsed with loss.
					It rained during the night. The line of march on the 11th was taken up nearly,
					our brigade leading the division. Thursday's march brought us through Sussex
					croup-House, across the Nottoway, into the Jerusalem plank road, and continuity
					the march up to 8 p. m. brought us within ten miles of our original camp, and
					the next day's march brought us to our present camp within the rear line of the
					army south of Petersburg.</p>
				<p>I have to regret the loss of 7 men (see report annexed+) who I presume were not
					able to keep up with the column, and were dauntless captured and perhaps
					murdered by the enemy's cavalry and guerrillas, who were continually hovering
					around our flank and rear. My men being nearly all new recruits, and this being
					their first hard service, I am pleased to be able to say that they conducted
					themselves well, exhibiting a good spirit and true soldierly qualities.</p>
				<closer>
					<salute>I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
					<signed>T. F. McCOY, Col., Cmdg. Regt.</signed>
