<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In late April and early May, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson feigned
                    a withdrawal from the Shenandoah Valley, only to launch a surprise offensive,
                    beginning at McDowell, Virginia. In this letter, Union General Robert Milroy
                    stationed at McDowell reports to his commanding officer, General John C.
                    Fremont, on the apparent Confederate preparations to move east. He discusses a
                    scouting party sent to Staunton that discovered Confederate General Johnson
                    stripping the countryside of militia, stores, and forage and sending it out of
                    the Valley. He also discusses some guerrilla actions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Gen. FREMONT, Wheeling:</p>
<p>McDOWELL,</p>
<p>May 1, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The extent of late attack by guerrillas was 20 wagons and about 80 horses lost.
                    Am compelling neighborhood to furnish horses for another train. Have now several
                    parties out after the guerrillas of Highland and Pendleton.</p>
<p>Information received from scouts, deserters, and refugees is that Johnson's force
                    is at Westview, 6 miles west of Staunton, ready to retreat upon any advance by
                    us, and rapidly gathering all the militia, subsistence, forage, and
                    transportation he can and sending it east. The greatest excitement is said to
                    have existed in Staunton and in Johnson's camp upon the occasion of a
                    reconnaissance by a company of our cavalry with six infantry companies last
                    week, and Johnson had everything packed to leave, but seeing it was only a
                    reconnoitering party, he remained and redoubled his efforts in stripping the
                    country of subsistence and forage. He should be driven out immediately. My aide
                    has just returned from Schenck. Will keep my communication open with him.</p>
<p>Capt. Lowry is here.</p>
