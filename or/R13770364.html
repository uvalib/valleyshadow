<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Franz Sigel writes General Grant concerning Confederate forces in
                    the Shenandoah Valley during May, 1864. Sigel speculates that Confederate
                    General Elzey has moved from Staunton to Woodstock.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> Culpeper, Va.:</p>
<p>BUNKER HILL, VA.,</p>
<p>May 1, 1864</p>
<p>The following dispatch just received; I also forwarded it to Gen.
                    Crook:</p>
<p>BEVERLY, VA., April 30, 1864--6 p. m.</p>
<p>Just arrived. Went to Greenbrier bridge, Marling's Bottom; attacked rebel pickets
                    there and captured 7; brought 6 in; left 1 badly wounded. There were three
                    companies of the Nineteenth Virginia Cavalry at Little Levels, two companies at
                    Huntersville and Jacktown. Was between Sulphur Springs and the Warm Springs.
                    There were 300 of the Twentieth Virginia Cavalry at Crab Bottom. Very little
                    forage in the country. Several horses gave out. Did not think it prudent to go
                    further. Col. Harris says I took the right course under circumstances.<br> J.
                    B. GORE,<br> Capt., Cmdg. Detachment.</p>
<p>I have no positive information yet whether a large force of the enemy is in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. From all reports received I believe that there is not.
                    McNeill and Imboden, with 1,000 men, and Rosser, with 2,000 men, are near Front
                    Royal and Woodstock; their pickets at Cedar Creek and their scouts at
                    Winchester. Gen. Elzey has probably moved from Staunton to Woodstock with about
                    3,000 to 4,000 infantry and artillery. We will occupy Winchester to-day with all
                    our forces, consisting of about 4,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and three
                    batteries, and push our advance toward Cedar Creek.</p>
