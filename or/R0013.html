<p>Col. E. SCHRIVER, Chief of Staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 14, 1862</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>Agreeably to orders I have the honor to submit the following report of the part
                    taken by my division in the late engagement near Cedar Mountain:</p>
<p>On Friday, the 8th instant, the division was ordered from camp north of Culpeper,
                    and took position on the Orange road, near its junction with the road leading to
                    Stevensburg, and remained there until ordered forward about 5 p.m. on the 9th,
                    reaching the field about 7 o'clock. The division was immediately directed to
                    relieve the right of Gen. Banks' corps, which was done by forming line of
                    battle--Tower's brigade on the right, Carroll's on the left, Hartsuff's brigade
                    in close column of division in rear of Tower's, and Durea's in rear of
                    Carroll's; two batteries of artillery--Leppien's and Matthews'--on the right,
                    and two batteries--Thompson's and Hall's--toward the left and center.</p>
<p>This arrangement was being rapidly completed when the enemy advanced a battery
                    near a point of woods to our left in close range and opened a brisk fire,
                    followed by discharges of infantry. Hall's battery had formed, Thompson's camp
                    into action while receiving the enemy's fire, and both replied with such good
                    effect as to cause the withdrawal of the enemy, leaving us in undisturbed
                    possession of the field for the night. The excellent practice of the artillery
                    and the general good conduct of the division are deserving of praise.</p>
<p>I herewith submit the reports of brigade commanders, chief of artillery, and the
                    colonel commanding Firs Maine Cavalry, who was temporarily allotted to Gen.
                    Bayard's brigade, the casualties amounting to 103 killed, wounded, and missing,
                    according to the accompanying list.* In this connection I must knowledge the
                    attention and zeal of my staff, Surg. N.R. Moseley, medical director; Maj. D.
                    Tillson, chief of artillery; Maj. William Painter, division quartermaster; Capt.
                    J.W. Williams, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. William Fisher, aide-de-camp;
                    Capt. B.W. Richards, aide-de-cam, who each rendered important services in his
                    appropriate duties.</p>
<p>I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JAMES B. RICKETTS, <br> Brig.-Gen. Volunteers, Commanding Division. </p>
