                <p>Confederate Colonel John Imboden writes Secretary of War George Randolph in June,
                    1862, concerning the organization of a regiment of partisan rangers in Staunton
                    Virginia. Imboden reports that the citizens of Augusta County gave him $2,500
                    for the purpose, and that he is securing arms for his men in Staunton. Imboden
                    asks for more arms and money, and outlines his plans for raids into West
                    Virginia to encourage and arm Confederate supporters in the area.</p>

                    <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Under the authority conferred upon me on the 7th of May to raise a regiment of
                    partisan rangers, I have four full companies ready to be organized and mustered
                    into service, and four more that will be ready in the course of ten days. In
                    addition to these eight companies I have several others partially enlisted. Can
                    I complete my regimental organization and take the field with these eight
                    companies or must I have the full number of ten companies? Three of my companies
                    are now rendering important service in Pendleton and Randolph Counties in
                    breaking up Peirpoint's militia musters and capturing notorious Union men. I
                    deem it a matter of great importance to be able to cross the Alleghanies in
                    July. I have daily intelligence from the region between here and Clarksburg. It
                    is very encouraging. Hundreds of men will join me as soon as I can penetrate
                    their country. The Federal troops have nearly all been withdrawn from the
                    Northwest, and the bogus State government is left to take care of itself.
                    Peirpoint has issued a proclamation calling out his militia. Half the people
                    will refuse to obey his call, and are represented as ready to join me as soon as
                    I can appear amongst them with arms to put in their hands. I am collecting all
                    the country arms that I can, and repairing them here. Citizens of this county
                    have placed $2,500 in cash in my hands for this purpose, but I will not be able
                    thus to arm half of my men. Can the War Department furnish me now 500 rifles and
                    ammunition, and as many more in three or four weeks? I have agents at work in
                    the heart of the Northwest sending out to me small parties of two or three
                    unarmed men at a time. These people must be armed to be of any value to us. I
                    believe that with reasonable and comparatively small assistance from the
                    Government I will be able in the course of ninety days, with the men I can raise
                    in the mountains, to do much toward re-establishing our rightful authority in
                    the Northwest. I am satisfied we can do more for our cause in that region
                    through the instrumentality of the true men there (and there are thousands of
                    them), if properly managed, than has been accomplished by more regular military
                    operations. But to begin I must have money and arms. I shall go to Pendleton,
                    Randolph, Highland, Bath, and Pocahontas this week to muster in several
                    companies. On my return I will go to Richmond in the hope that my organization
                    will be so far advanced that you can see your way clear to give me the
                    assistance in money and arms indispensable to enable me to take the field. My
                    wants are small just now, but if I succeed, as I have every reason to believe I
                    shall, in getting 1,500 or 2,000 men in my corps in a short time after I get
                    fairly to work, I shall perhaps need more assistance from time to time. Can you
                    furnish me 500 of the rifles captured by Gen. Jackson and sent to Lynchburg?
                    They are both Belgian and Austrian, either admirably adapted to our purposes,
                    though the Belgian is preferable. I have addressed this directly to you, when
                    perhaps it should have gone to some other officer in your Department. If so,
                    please give it its proper destination, so that I may have an answer to my
                    questions on my return from the West.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Yours, respectfully,</salute>
