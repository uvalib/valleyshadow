                <p>In early 1864, a Jewish citizen of the Shenandoah Valley named Hyman reported
                    being robbed near Woodstock. One of the accused, a Confederate cavalryman named
                    Cherry, had a mother in Staunton who allegedly received $500 after the
                robbery.</p>

                    <salute/>
                </opener>
                <p>The first proof is a letter from Mr. Phil. Williams, of Winchester, a very
                    prominent citizen, whom Hyman consulted on his arrival at that place. The letter
                    is to Gen. Early, and is dated February 15, 1864. It contains Hyman's version of
                    the robbery. Hyman says that as he passed a brick house on the west side of road
                    near Woodstock (north of it), he saw 7 Confederate cavalry; at Fisher's Hill.
                    Hyman had two wagons, driven by two sons of Mr. Cross, of Newtown, and there was
                    a young man in one of them named Grove, also of Newtown, who remarked as the men
                    passed, "There goes Cherry." (Grove subsequently denied having made the
                    remarks.) There was also with Hyman a boy of about seventeen years of age named
                    Ezekiel, from Richmond. The men halted at the foot of the hill near the river,
                    and one of them rode back to the wagons and asked Hyman if he had any pursue.
                    Hyman gave him a small purse with ten gold dollars and some paper money, when
                    the man said to him that he had a belts, and while he was trying to get off one
                    without showing the other was knocked down and robbed of about $6,000 in gold
                    (chiefly twenty-dollar pieces), a silver watch, a great coat (invisible green
                    with yellow silk sleeve linings), in the pocket of which was a fur collar and a
                    small Hebrew prayer-book. There was taken from young Ezekiel a lady's gold watch
                    and a belt containing a number of silver coins and medals.</p>
                <p>It appears from the letter of Col. Carrington, provost-marshal at Richmond, that
                    soon after the robbery Gen. Winder sent two detectives to the valley to
                    investigate the matter, at the request of the father of Ezekiel. These
                    detectives reported that they were convinced that Cherry and some other men
                    committed the robbery; that they determined to arrest Cherry, and were piloted
                    by a negro 6 miles beyond Strasburg in search of him. Fearing foul play they
                    turned back, but on searching the negro found on him the watch stolen from young
                    Ezekiel, which was subsequently identified by his father. They did not bring off
                    the negro because they said they were afraid to encumber themselves with him. It
                    should be mentioned that the detective got Mr. Williams' letter from Gen. Early
                    before they went down the valley.</p>
                <p>On March 9, 1864, a letter was written by a Maj. E. W. Cross from Harrisonburg to
                    Col. Carrington, in which he charges that the detectives did find out the guilty
                    parties but were bribed to say nothing. Cross says that he had examined some of
                    the money said to have been taken at the railroad robbery, but that all was
                    marked in a peculiar manner. (In Mr. Williams' letter it was stated that the
                    stolen money was marked.) Cross further says that the perpetrators were
                    generally known in the vicinity of Harrisonburg. He gives the names of a number
                    of persons who can show some of the money. He also states that Maj. Gilmor,
                    while under the influence of liquor,had boasted that he had arranged the whole
                    affair. He says he can name every man concerned but could not prove the fact,
                    but gives the names of others who can; also states that Gilmor had boasted that
                    he had arranged the matter with the detectives, and could manage the whole
                    detective force of the Government.</p>
                <p>The papers above referred to were sent by the department to Gen. Imboden, with
                    orders to investigate the whole matter. The proof obtained by Gen. Imboden was
                    as follows:</p>
                <p>Capt. Owings, quartermaster of Gilmor's battalion, states that Gilmor gave him
                    $160 in gold to buy a horse with, and told him that most of it was taken from a
                    Jew, and that he had arranged the affair, though he did not take the money
                    personally. Gilmor stated that Cherry, Martin, and others were engaged; other
                    names not remembered. The robbery took place below Harrisonburg. The
                    conversation took place soon after Gilmor's return from the railroad expedition.
                    Gilmore was in liquor when the conversation occurred.</p>
                <p>Capt. Ross, of Gilmor's battalion, testifies that he conversed with several of
                    the men engaged in the railroad robbery, who told him they got no gold. He
                    talked with Martin, and told him that if he had had anything to do with robbing
                    the Jew named Hyman he had better make a clean breast of it. Martin said that he
                    met Maj. Gilmor near Fisher's Hill with other men not recognized. He did not
                    know Gilmor until the latter hailed him, nor was Gilmor riding his own horse.
                    Gilmor ordered Martin with some others to follow a wagon then near to a certain
                    place, and take out two boys named Cross and remove them out of sight of the
                    wagon. The wagon contained Jews. Martin's share of the gold was about $800.
                    Gilmor acknowledged to Capt. Ross that he had arranged the affair of robbing the
                    Jew; had put the men concerned all right, and had stood off and seen the thing
                    well done.</p>
                <p>Quartermaster-Sergeant Gorsuch, of Gilmor's battalion, testifies that the men got
                    but little gold, if any, from the railroad.</p>
                <p>Private John Bosley, Company C, Gilmor's battalion, told Gorsuch that he had seen
                    a pile of gold in the possession of Maj. Gilmor.</p>
                <p>Private Todd, of Company C, told Bosley that he (Todd) had received about $800,
                    and also that Maj. Gilmor, Cherry, Mel. Todd, Martin, and one man in McNeill's
                    company were engaged in robbing the Jew. Bosley also stated that Martin had
                    given more than $500 to Cherry's mother, in Staunton.</p>
                <p>Private Bosley testified substantially as above. Says that M. Todd admitted that
                    he was engaged in the robbery, and gave the names of the others above mentioned.
                    Todd says his share was about $860, and there were eight persons concerned.</p>
                <p>Private Harding, Company C, testifies that he stopped all night below Woodstock
                    the day after the railroad affair, and that the next morning he met Gilmor,
                    ex-Lieut. Billings, and Snodgrass, with two or three others, going down the
                    valley, and a man remarked that he would "bet the major was on the make now."</p>
                <p>Lieut. Kemp testifies that he heard Cherry say that he had placed some money in
                    the hands of Todd; do not know how much. Heard Maj. Gilmor say that he was not
                    there, or that they would not catch him in the affair; does not remember the
                    words.</p>
                <p>In Maj. Gilmor's report of the attack on the railroad he says Cherry was present,
                    but he was aware of it until after the affair was over.</p>
