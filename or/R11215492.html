<p>Gen. S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NEW RIVER,<br> Giles Court-House, Va.,</p>
<p>May 16, 1862.</p>
<p>GENERAL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the battle of Giles
            Court-House, fought on the 10th instant:</p>
<p>The Forty-fifth Virginia Regiment, Lieut.-Col. Peters commanding, stationed at The
          Narrows of New River, in Giles County, was directed to retire from its position at that
          point on April 30 by Col. Jennifer, for reasons which he gives in the inclosed document,
          marked A.</p>
<p>This regiment fell back as far the base of Cloyd's Mountain, 10 miles from Dublin Depot,
          Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. When this occurred I was at the White Springs, preparing
          to withdraw the forces on the James River and Kanawha turnpike to some point at or near
          the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which was rendered necessary in consequence of the
          abandonment of the Virginia Central Railroad by the withdrawal of all the rolling stock on
          that road west of Staunton, thus cutting off my source of supplies. At that time I did not
          know whether my force on the James River and Kanawha turnpike could render better service
          by re-enforcing Gen. Jackson or strengthening the force defending the approaches to the
          Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. I wrote and telegraphed Gen. Lee on this subject. On
          receiving his telegram on the 5th instant I proceeded with all dispatch to strengthen my
          force covering the approach to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at Dublin Depot. As
          soon as the forces were united I determined to attack the enemy at Giles Court-House and
          try and retake The Narrows of New River.</p>
<p>On the night of the 9th instant orders were issued to this effect: I divided the command
          into two brigades and a reserve, the first consisting of the Forty-fifth Virginia Regiment
          (Lieut.-Col. Peters), Otey's battery, and one company of the Eighth Virginia Cavalry,
          under Col. Jenifer, and the second composed of the Twenty-second Virginia Regiment (Col.
          Patton), Chapman's battery, and one company of the Eighth Virginia Cavalry, under Col.
          McCausland, the reserve consisting of fragments of three companies and two mountain
          howitzers, under Capt. Vawter.</p>
<p>We marched at 10 p.m., and discovered the enemy's mounted pickets about 2 1/2 miles from
          the Court-House. The pickets were driven and hotly pursued. On reaching a point within 1
          mile of Giles Court-House we found the enemy occupying a ridge running from the main road
          to the mountain (a strong position), sheltered by a fence.</p>
<p>Cols. Jenifer and McCausland, as previously ordered, deployed their commands, the first
          to the right of the main approach to the Court-House and the second to the left. This was
          done in handsome style. The battle then commenced by Otey's, Chapman's, and Lowry's
          artillery opening upon the enemy, the infantry steadily advancing under a line of
          skirmishers. When within a few hundred yards of the enemy's position, with a determined
          should, the force simultaneously charged, driving the enemy before them. The enemy
          retreated beyond the town of Pearisburg (Giles Court-House), when he made a second stand,
          but was soon dislodged. He disputed with us a series of hills in rear of Giles
          Court-House, but was driven from hill to hill until his retreat became a rout. On reaching
          The Narrows of New River, the great point to be gained, he made his last stand. I ordered
          two pieces of artillery, under Maj. King, chief of ordnance, supported by a company of
          infantry, to cross New River and occupy a commanding position on the right bank. As soon
          as our artillery opened, which was admirably served ( the enemy losing 4 men by the
          explosion of a single shell from a mountain howitzer), he retreated, leaving in our
          possession the key to his approach to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad by way of Giles
          Court-House.</p>
<p>The force under my command was composed chiefly of the recent levies; they, as all
          others, acted like veterans. I never witnessed better or more determined fighting. It is
          with some hesitation, where all did so well, that I mention names. To Cols. Jenifer and
          McCausland, commanding brigades, my special thanks are due, and they deserve the
          approbation of the department.</p>
<p>The gallant Col. Patton fell while leading his regiment and carrying the last and
          probably most determined stand made by the enemy. I take pleasure in saying his wound is
          not serious.</p>
<p>Lieut.-Col. Peters (commanding Forty-fifth Virginia Regiment) displayed much coolness and
          gallantry, leading his men in the thickest of the fight. Lieut.-Col. Fitzhugh (Eighth
          Virginia Cavalry) also displayed great coolness and bravery during the engagement. I
          recommend Col. Patton (Twenty-second Virginia Regiment ) and Lieut.-Cols. Peters
          (Forty-fifth Virginia Regiment) and Fitzhugh (Eighth Virginia Cavalry) to your notice.</p>
<p>Capts. Otey, Chapman, and Lowry, commanding batteries, all behaved well and did excellent
          service. The mountain howitzer is found to be exceedingly useful.</p>
<p>To Lieut. King (elected major of the artillery battalion) I take this occasion of
          returning my thanks for the energy displayed by him in procuring for my command and for
          the excellent service performed by him in driving the enemy from The Narrows.</p>
<p>My command was much exhausted when it went into the engagement, a portion of it having
          lost three nights' sleep. The enemy was pursued 6 or 7 miles, and this at a run.</p>
<p>Our loss was, providentially, small, only 2 killed and 4 wounded. That of the enemy is
          known to have been comparatively very large, but not accurately ascertained, from the fact
          that they succeeded in carrying off most of their dead and wounded by the assistance of
          their cavalry. From the best information I can obtain their loss amounted to about 20
          killed and 50 wounded. We captured a considerable amount of quartermaster's and
          subsistence stores, including a number of horses and a few prisoners.</p>
<p>My special thanks are due to my personal staff-Capt. Finney, assistant adjutant-general;
          Capt. Heth, aide-de-camp, and Capt. Swann, volunteer aide; also to Mr. Albert Gibboney-for
          their energy and activity in communicating orders. Capt. Selden, aide-de-camp, was absent
          assisting Lieut.-Col. Finney in bringing forward troops and supplies.</p>
<p>I respectfully refer you to the reports of the colonels commanding brigades for
          additional details.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>H. HETH,<br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
