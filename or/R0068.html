<p>Lieut. S. C. JUDSON, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General</p>
<p>Brandy Station, Va</p>
<p>December 3, 1863</p>
<p>SIR</p>
<p>SIR: In compliance with circular from headquarters Third Brigade, Third Division,
                    Third Army Corps, bearing date December 3, 1863, I have the honor to report the
                    following as the part taken by my command in the recent movements and operations
                    of the Third Brigade:</p>
<p>Marched from camp at Brandy Station, Va., November 26, at 8 a.m., marching on the
                    left of the brigade, left in front; arrived at Rapidan River, crossing over the
                    river on pontoon bridge, marched about 3 miles, then marched back to the river,
                    and bivouacked. November 27, 7 a.m., marched with Third Brigade on the left
                    center of the brigade, left in front, about 2 miles, rested in the woods till 3
                    p. m., marched forward, met the rebels, and had a very brisk fight, losing 1 man
                    killed and 11 men wounded. Marched with Third Brigade to a new position; lay on
                    arms during the night. November 28, 3 a. m., marched with Third Brigade on the
                    right center of the brigade, left in front: bivouacked in the field. November
                    29, brigade formed line at 3 p.m. for the purpose of storming rebel
                    fortifications, my regiment on the right center of the brigade; remained in line
                    till night, then bivouacked.</p>
<p>November 30, marched at 3 a.m. on the right of Third Brigade, left in front;
                    formed line of battle by brigade, my regiment on the right; deployed one company
                    of 60 men in advance of regiment as skirmishers. The company advanced about 500
                    yards into a very thick under growth of pine woods, when they were fired upon by
                    the rebels lying in ambush, killing 3 enlisted men and wounding 4 enlisted men.
                    The company returned the fire, and held their position. I immediately sent one
                    company of 40 men to support the skirmishers. The two companies remained in
                    position till relieved by the Second Corps, and then rejoined the regiment,
                    which had marched to the ground from where it had marched in the morning;
                    bivouacked in the woods.</p>
<p>December 1, 1 p.m., marched on the right center of the Third Brigade, right in
                    front; bivouacked in the woods. December 2, marched at 6 a.m. on the right of
                    the brigade, right in front, crossing the Rapidan River on pontoon bridge; took
                    position in line of battle on a hill in the woods close by the river to guard
                    the ford; remained in position for three hours, then marched on the right of
                    brigade; bivouacked in the woods.</p>
<p>December 3, marched at 1 a.m. on the left of brigade, right in front, arriving at
                    Brandy Station 8 a.m.; encamped in the woods near Brandy Station.</p>
<p>Hoping this will prove satisfactory and correct, I am, sir, very
                        respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JAMES A. STABLE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Comdg. 87th Pennsylvania
                        Volunteers.</p>
