<p>Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, Comdg. Army of the Potomac</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 15, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>ADDENDA</p>
<p>I feel it is my duty to inform you of the intense mortification and
					disappointment felt by my division in reading your report of the battle of
					Gettysburg.</p>
<p>For nearly four hours on July 1 we were hotly engaged against overwhelming
					numbers, repulsed repeated attacks of the enemy, captured three flags and a very
					large number of prisoners, and were the last to leave the field.</p>
<p>The division formed the right of the line of battle of the First Corps, and
					during the whole time had to fight the enemy in front and protect our right
					flank (the division of the Eleventh Corps being at no time less than half a mile
					in rear). We went into action with less than 2,500 men and lost considerably
					more than half our number.</p>
<p>We have been proud of our efforts on that day, and hoped that they would be
					recognized. It is but natural we should feel disappointed that we are not once
					referred to in the report of the commanding general.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will investigate this matter and give us due credit, I
						am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. C. ROBINSON, Brig.-Gen., Comdg. Division.</p>
