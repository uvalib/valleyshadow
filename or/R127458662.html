<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Samuel Jones concerning June, 1863, action in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. Lee asks Jones to keep watch for any Federal forces advancing

<p>Maj. Gen. Samuel Jones,<br> Comdg. Dept. of Western
                        Virginia, Dublin Depot:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 7, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have directed Gen. Imboden, after leaving a guard at the Shenandoah Mountain,
                    to move with the rest of his force upon Romney, with the view of striking a
                    damaging blow upon the enemy guarding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in that
                    region. He may be detained along that line some time, and my object is to
                    request your attention to any movements that may be made by the enemy from
                    Northwestern Virginia in the direction of Staunton.</p>
<p>I hope you have sufficient cavalry to scout in the direction of Huttonsville from
                    Lewisburg, and to keep yourself informed of any hostile expedition from that
                    quarter. Gen. Imboden's whole effective force, cavalry, infantry, and artillery,
                    does not much exceed 1,300 men. I am anxious for him to get all the recruits he
                    can in Hampshire and Hardy, and otherwise improve his efficiency.</p>
<p>I do not know whether you have sent to Gen. Jenkins all the cavalry you can
                    spare. He has mentioned to me several regiments still behind, which he is
                    desirous of obtaining, but not knowing whether you had enough for your purposes,
                    I have delayed submitting to you his request. He has advanced down into the
                    Valley, and driven the enemy close to Winchester, having his advance pickets at
                    Kernstown.</p>
<p>I require now all the additional force I can get.</p>
<p>I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
