<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In early May, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson launched his famous
                    offensive in the Shenandoah Valley after feigning a retreat from the area. This
                    letter, from Union General Nathaniel P. Banks, reports on Jackson's return to
                    the Valley, with Staunton a possible destination.</p>

<p>Gen. [LORENZO THOMAS],<br> Adjutant-Gen.'s Office:</p>
<p>NEW MARKET,</p>
<p>2nd-7 p.m.<br> (Received May 3, 1862, 9 p.m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jackson moved his army yesterday on the road to Port Republic, east of the
                    Shenandoah. The signal officers report at 2.30 p.m. that they saw his army
                    moving toward that place. His tents still standing this side Blue Ridge. His
                    destination either Waynesborough or Staunton. If latter place, possibly to join
                    Johnson and attack Milroy. Gen. Ewell is said to be near Stanardsville. Our
                    cavalry scouts from Columbia Bridge advanced 8 miles in direction of the Blue
                    Ridge, encountering the enemy in a sharp skirmish, in which they lost 1 killed,
                    4 wounded. Our guide was badly wounded.</p>
<p>No change of forces except to strengthen Harrisonsburg somewhat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>N.P. BANKS,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
