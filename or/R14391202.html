<p>Brig. Gen. W. MERRITT,<br> Cmdg. First Cavalry Division:</p>
<p>Harrisonburg,</p>
<p>September 28, 1864</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The major-general commanding directs that you leave a small force at Swift Run
                    and Brown's Gaps, to watch said gaps, and with the balance of your own and
                    Custer's division swing around through or near Piedmont, extending toward and as
                    near Staunton as possible. Destroy all mills, all grain and forage, you can,
                    drive off or kill all stock, and otherwise carry out the instructions of
                    Lieut.-Gen. Grant, and extract of which is sent you, and which means, "leave the
                    Valley a barren waste." In carrying out these instructions, no villages or
                    private houses will be burned. Camp close to the left of the infantry at Mount
                    Crawford to-morrow night. The Sixth and Nineteenth Army Corps will move to Mount
                    Crawford to-morrow.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JAS. W. FORSYTH,<br> Lieut.-Col. and Chief of Staff.</p>
