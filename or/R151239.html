<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Thomas Fauntleroy requests assignment to head a command at
                    Staunton or Winchester in August, 1861.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HDQRS. DIVISION VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Gen. R. E. LEE:</p>
<p>Richmond,</p>
<p>August 17, 1861.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The command of Camp Lee having been taken from me, and the other camps most
                    seriously interfered with, so as that it is evident that I am not recognized
                    with the full rights of a commanding officer, I most respectfully desire that I
                    may be relieved from the order placing me in command of the troops in and about
                    Richmond and be directed to await orders either here or at Winchester or
                    Staunton. The withdrawal of the troops at Camp Lee reduces the forces to a mere
                    trifle, and I am sure I can do no good by remaining in charge. Col. Dimmock
                    could with perfect ease command the other camps in addition to his present
                    troops. I have made application for relief to Governor Letcher; but he says he
                    has parted with the power, and the Confederate authorities have repudiated me
                    altogether. I will thank you to let me have the order immediately.</p>
<p>With respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>TH. T. FAUNTLEROY,<br> Brig.-Gen., Provisional Army of Virginia, Cmdg.</p>
