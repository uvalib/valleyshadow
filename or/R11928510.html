<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General George McClellan writes Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Curtin in October,
                    1862, to inform them of Union troop positions. McClellan suggests sending newly
                    drafted men to Chambersburg.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,<br> President of the
                        United States, and<br> His Excellency ANDREW G. CURTIN,<br> Governor of
                        Pennsylvania:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 30, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am about leaving this line, and leave behind me all the troops I can safely
                    spare to hold Harper's Ferry and the line of the Upper Potomac, but I do not
                    consider the force sufficient to prevent raids, and have so represented to Gen.
                    Halleck, who informs me that he has no more troops to send. I leave Gen. Morell
                    at Hagerstown, in command from mouth of Antietam up to Cumberland. I urge that
                    you expedite as much as possible the organization of the nine-months' drafted
                    men, that some of them may be sent, with the least possible delay, to
                    Chambersburg, Hagerstown, Sharpsburg, Williamsport, and Hancock, to prevent the
                    possibility of raids. If I could have filled the old Pennsylvania regiments with
                    the drafted men, I could have left men enough to have made your frontier
                    reasonably safe; as it is, I cannot do it with due regard to the success of the
                    main army, and beg to warn you in time. Without reference to the safety of the
                    frontier, I wish to urge again in the strongest terms the absolute necessity of
                    filling the old regiments with drafted men.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. McCLELLAN,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
