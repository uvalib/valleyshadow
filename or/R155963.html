<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Jefferson Davis writes General Joseph E. Johnston on the November, 1861,

<p>Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, C. S. A., Centreville, Va.:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>November 18, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Upon representations as to the defective construction of the batteries at and
                    near Evansport and the hazard of bombardment by batteries recently established
                    by the enemy on the Maryland shore, directions have been given to remove the
                    guns to Cockpit, as recommended by Gen. Whiting and others. It will, however,
                    give to the enemy opportunity to make a landing at Ship Point, and thence
                    threaten the position of Gen. Holmes. If a large force should be landed on the
                    Potomac below Gen. Holmes, with a view to turn or to attack him, the value of
                    the position between Dumfries and Fredericksburg will be so great, the I wish
                    you to give to that line your personal inspection. With a sufficient force the
                    enemy may be prevented from leaving his boats, should he be able to cross the
                    river. To make the force available at either of the points which he may select,
                    it will be necessary to improve the roads connecting the advanced posts with the
                    armies of the Potomac and of the Aquia as well as with each other, and to have
                    the required teams to move heavy guns with celerity. At Cockpit, if the
                    topography has been correctly reported, our batteries will not be in danger of
                    bombardment from the Maryland shore, but will be more liable to a land attack
                    than when at Evansport; and being removed from support by Gen. Holmes, will need
                    to have a larger garrison in the event supposed.</p>
<p>As I notified you, unarmed troops have been sent to receive the arms in your
                    possession, and three regiments have been sent to your department since my last
                    letter to you. (The troops from Staunton may be soon expected.) We must ask of
                    our army that it will perform such service as has distinguished it heretofore,
                    and we hope that our just cause is safe in its keeping, through, if it were
                    possible, I would send to you many more troops.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your,</p>
<p>JEFFERSON DAVIS.</p>
