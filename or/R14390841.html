<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Phillip Sheridan writes General Grant to discuss the August, 1864,
                    strategic situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Sheridan mentions that he has
                    destroyed crops in the Valley south of Winchester forcing Confederates to haul
                    supplies from the Staunton area.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT:</p>
<p>CHARLESTOWN,</p>
<p>August 19, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the information received to-day shows a large concentration of the enemy at
                    Winchester. I receive constant reports of the passage of troops across to this
                    Valley from Culpeper. I have taken the defensive until their strength is more
                    fully developed. They have made no attempt to pass down the Valley to
                    Martinsburg, which I hold with a small force of cavalry. If they cross the
                    Potomac they expose their rear and I will pitch into them. I destroyed
                    everything that was eatable south of Winchester, and they will have to haul
                    supplies from well up toward Staunton. Our loss at Winchester will be about 200.
                    Guerrillas give me great annoyance, but I am quietly disposing of numbers of
                    them. The enemy appears to be uncertain as to what course to pursue. The
                    intention so far as I can learn was to send a column direct from Culpeper to the
                    Potomac and Early to advance at the same time from Martinsburg. This was
                    frustrated by Early being compelled to fall back and your operations on the
                    north side of the James. I still think that two divisions of infantry have come
                    here and Fitz Lee's cavalry. My force will have to be weakened to supply the
                    place of the 100-days' men serving at Harper's Ferry and in West Virginia.
                    Grover has joined me. I now can calculate on bringing into action about 22,000
                    or 23,000 infantry and about 8,000 cavalry.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
