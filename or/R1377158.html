<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Secretary of War Edwin Stanton writes Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin
                    in July, 1864, concerning an impending Confederate raid across the Potomac.
                    Stanton instructs Curtin to cooperate with General Darius Couch, commanding at
                    Chambersburg, in raising a state force for defense. Stanton offers War

<p>His Excellency Governor CURTIN,<br> Harrisburg:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 4, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following instructions have been given Gen. Couch, commanding the Middle
                    Department Department of the Susquehanna, including the State of Pennsylvania:</p>
<p>JULY 4, 1864.<br> Maj.-Gen. COUCH,<br> Chambersburg:</p>
<p>The rebel force which has made its appearance at Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry
                    may extend its raid into Pennsylvania. You are authorized to confer with the
                    Governor of Pennsylvania, and take such measures, in concert with the State
                    authorities, as you may deem advisable for raising troops and providing adequate
                    defense. The Department will offer every facility in its power for transporting,
                    arming, and subsisting such force as may be raised, and supplying every means of
                    defense within it power.<br> EDWIN M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War.</p>
<p>Your co-operation with Gen. Couch will doubt raise promptly an adequate force to
                    guard against any threatened danger. We have not been able to obtain from Gen.
                    Sigel any reliable report as to the numbers or description of the rebel force
                    that attacked Harper's Ferry to-day. Gen. Hunter has orders to move against the
                    enemy with his force, but no information has been received from him. This
                    Department will promptly co-operate with the State authorities in any measure
                    that may be needed for defense against the rebels, and for raising, arming, and
                    supplying troops. You will please communicate your wishes and any information
                    you may acquire as to the movements of the enemy.</p>
