<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Schenck writes General Darius Couch concerning a wagon train
                    destined for Chambersburg. Schenck fears the train was lost in the confusion
                    accompanying the Confederate advance on the town.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. Couch,<br> Harrisburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>Baltimore,</p>
<p>June 16, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>A part of a battery at Martinsburg, in the retreat from that place Sunday night,
                    was cut off, and is reported to have taken the Williamsport road, and followed
                    on after the wagon trains and some cavalry which were sent, via Greencastle, to
                    Chambersburg. I mention this that you may look out for those field guns and take
                    possession of them, and also as it may, perhaps, account for the enemy's column
                    supposed to have been seen yesterday morning approaching Chambersburg. I
                    directed that the trains should be turned over to the quartermaster at
                    Chambersburg. Can you ascertain for me what has become of them?</p>
