<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William Averell writes General Benjamin F. Kelley on the January,
                    1864, strategic situation in the Shenandoah Valley. He mentions that Confederate
                    General Jubal Early has established headquarters at Staunton.</p>

<p>Brig.-Gen. KELLEY, Cumberland:</p>
<p>Martinsburg,</p>
<p>January 1, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have not much confidence in the pickets of the Twelfth Pennsylvania, who
                    brought in the report that they captured 4 prisoners 4 miles this side of
                    Winchester at 4 o'clock this morning; that the prisoners were subsequently
                    recaptured by 30 rebels, who pursued the scouts of the Twelfth Pennsylvania to
                    Bunker Hill; also that the prisoners had stated that two brigades arrived at
                    Winchester last night. I have sent out Maj. Gibson to relieve the pickets of the
                    Twelfth and have requested Gen. Sullivan to direct his cavalry at Charlestown to
                    communicate with mine at Bunker Hill. It seems probable that Gen. Early has been
                    assigned to the command of the Valley Department, with headquarters at Staunton,
                    and it is likely he is determined to establish an outpost at Winchester or to
                    make a raid on this road. I have placed the infantry and battery in position and
                    taken all measures for defense. If the enemy will wait until my brigade is on
                    its feet he may come. I think it proper, however, to urge that a force of at
                    least 5,000 infantry should be at once established at this point.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
