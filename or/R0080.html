<p>AJDT. Gen., Lieut. Gen. EWELL'S COMMAND, Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>STAUNTON</p>
<p>November 25, 1864</p>
<p>MAJ</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
                    artillery of the Second Corps from May 4 to 31, 1864:</p>
<p>I received orders on May 4 from Lieut.-Gen. Ewell to move my artillery to the
                    front. I immediately broke up my grazing camps in the neighborhood of
                    Gordonsville, and directed Col. Brown to move his division of artillery in the
                    direction of Locust Grove. Cutshaw's battalion was ordered to report to Col.
                    Carter, who had been ordered some days before the vicinity of Raccoon Ford with
                    Page's battalion, of his division. Nelson's battalion had been some time on the
                    front operating with Early's division of infantry.</p>
<p>On the 5th all my artillery was concentrated at Locust Grove, on the old turnpike
                    from Orange Court-House to Fredericksburg, in the immediate vicinity of the
                    infantry of the Second Corps. On reporting to Gen. Ewell I learned that the
                    enemy was in his front. Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson's division of infantry was
                    advanced, accompanied by Nelson's battalion of artillery. After moving a short
                    distance the division was deployed across the pike, and one battery (Milledge's)
                    was put in position to the right of the road in</p>
<p>CHAP. XLVIII.] RAPIDAN TO THE JAMES. PAGE 1085 [Series I. Vol. 36. Part I,
                    Reports. Serial No. 67.]</p>
<p>front of Jones' brigade. The enemy attacking while the position of this brigade
                    was being changed, it became necessary to withdraw Milledge's battery. After a
                    very spirited attack the enemy was repulsed with considerable loss. Gen. Ewell
                    then took up his position without further opposition. His line extended on each
                    side of the turnpike, the road passing through the center of his division. The
                    right wing was nearly at right angles to the pike, and the left wing was bent
                    back to cover the road leading to the Germanna plank road. The country was of
                    such a character (being a dense wilderness) that but few opportunities offered
                    for the effective use of artillery; nevertheless, a portion of Nelson's guns
                    were posted on a commanding ridge, with a small field in front, immediately on
                    the road, 1 mile from the Lacy house. Two others of Nelson's guns were placed on
                    the road leading to Germanna Ford, to operate with the troops of the left wing
                    of the corps. The artillery during the day was several times used with effect in
                    repulsing partial attacks of the enemy. For the better service of the artillery,
                    our line being quite extended, I directed Col. Brown to take charge of that
                    portion posted on the right of the turnpike, and Col. Carter that on the left.
                    Early on the morning of the 6th Col. Carter was directed to concentrate as many
                    guns as could be spared on the left of our position, which was a good deal
                    exposed, and the enemy was feeling in that direction as if intending to attempt
                    our flank. These guns, with a small infantry support, sufficiently protected
                    this point. During the day the enemy made an attack on Gordon's brigade, which
                    was on our extreme left. Some of these guns were used with considerable effect
                    in assisting to repel this attack. Early in the day Col. Brown, while selecting
                    a position for a battery, was shot by a sharpshooters and instantly killed. His
                    loss was deeply felt throughout the whole army. He not only exhibited the
                    highest social qualities, but was endowed with the first order of military
                    talents. On every where he was called to act he was distinguished for gallantry
                    and skill. The artillery will ever remember him as one of its brightest
                    ornaments. Nelson's battalion was relieved during the day by guns from
                    Lieut.-Col. Hardaway's and Maj. Cutshaw's battalions, Cutshaw occupying the
                    position on the right of the pike, and Hardaway that on the Germanna road.
                    Lieut.-Col. Braxton's battalion was put in position on our extreme right,
                    filling the intervals between Rodes' right and Hill's left. A few guns were
                    distributed along Rodes' front.</p>
<p>Being absent from my command, I am unable to append a list of casualties. The
                    chief loss was upon the capture of Custhaw's and Page's battalions on May 12.</p>
<p>This report would have been submitted at a much earlier period had it not been
                    for the difficulties incident to an active campaign in getting sub-reports, and
                    my own lines.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. L. LONG, Brig.-Gen., Chief of Artillery.</p>
