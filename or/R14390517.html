<p>Lieut. Col. J. W. FORSYTH,<br> Chief of Staff, Middle
                        Military Division.</p>
<p>GRAVELLY SPRINGS, ALA.,</p>
<p>February 18, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the 31st of July till the 4th of August the division picketed from the left
                    of the infantry line to Lee's Mill, connecting at that place with the Second
                    Division. On the 4th of August I received orders to move my division, via
                    Washington City, to the Shenandoah Valley and report to Maj.-Gen. Sheridan. At
                    daylight the next day the division broke camp and marched to City Point, where
                    it arrived the same day and made preparations to embark upon steam transports
                    for Giesborough Point, near Washington. On the night of August 12, the whole
                    division having arrived at Giesborough, it began the march to the Shenandoah
                    Valley, via Leesburg and Snicker's Gap. While near Washington the First Brigade
                    had been armed with Spencer carbines. On the 17th of August, about noon, the
                    command arrived at Winchester, having marched from Berryville by the way of
                    White Post. The army had fallen back from Cedar Creek and was just retiring from
                    Winchester. I was ordered to report to Gen. Torbert, chief of cavalry and hold
                    Winchester as long as possible. I posted my command so as to cover all the roads
                    into the place from the south, particularly the Millwood, Front Royal, and
                    Valley pikes. About 2 p.m. Lowell's brigade of cavalry and Penrose's brigade of
                    infantry arrived; the latter were deployed as skirmishers between the Valley and
                    Front Royal pikes. At 4 p.m. the enemy advanced to the attack with infantry
                    skirmishers, but were repulsed, but at 6 p.m. returned with Breckinridge's
                    entire corps, and after a sharp fight compelled us to withdraw from the place.
                    This was done under cover of night, Col. Chapman's brigade, with Pennington's
                    battery, having been previously sent back to occupy a strong position on the
                    Martinsburg road, just north of Winchester. The command then marched to the east
                    side of the Opequon and bivouacked at Summit Point just before daylight. The
                    army having halted at Charlestown my division was kept employed in picketing and
                    patrolling the Opequon from Middleway to the Berryville and Winchester pike. On
                    the 21st of August the rebels crossed the Opequon in force at Middleway, drove
                    in our pickets at that place, and threatened to interpose themselves between us
                    and Charlestown. After a sharp fight, in which both Chapman and McIntosh gave
                    the enemy a severe check, I received orders from Gen. Sheridan to communicate
                    with Gen. Merritt's division then operating in the direction of Berryville, and,
                    in conjunction with it, to lose no time in joining the army at Charlestown. I
                    therefore called in everything except a light skirmish line, withdrew by the
                    right and left flank of brigades at the same time, and marched directly for the
                    Charlestown and Berryville pike. After hearing that Gen. Merritt was unmolested,
                    I retired slowly to Charlestown and went into position on the Leetown road,
                    covering the right of the infantry. Gen. Merritt was unmolested, I retired
                    slowly to Charlestown and went into position on the Leetown road, covering the
                    right of the infantry. Gen. Sheridan having determined to withdraw to the strong
                    position at Halltown during the night, I was directed to cover the rear with my
                    division. I was ordered to be ready to move at dawn, and had my command under
                    arms accordingly. Merritt's division and Duffie's brigade were late in starting
                    and thereby delayed my march. The enemy, having discovered the withdrawal of the
                    infantry, advanced just after dawn, and a sharp skirmish ensued. The road was
                    soon cleared by the march of Merritt's division, marching toward Shepherdstown.
                    The withdrawal was finally effected with but little difficulty. The division
                    camped that night near the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and covered all
                    approaches between the right of the infantry and the Potomac.</p>
<p>In pursuance of instructions from Gen. Sheridan, on the morning of the 25th of
                    August my division marched through the country to Walper's Cross-Roads, where it
                    met Merritt's division. The corps, under the command of Gen. Torbert, proceeded
                    by the pike toward Leetown for the purpose of ascertaining the position and
                    movements of the rebel army. The advance had hardly crossed the Baltimore and
                    Ohio Railroad at Kearnesville before it encountered the enemy's pickets. The
                    command, moving by flanks of brigades, with the artillery on the pike, formed
                    line of battle with great rapidity, and advanced at once to the
                    attack--McIntosh's brigade, with Ransom's battery, formed on the left of and
                    across the pike, dismounted in a heavy piece of woods; Chapman's brigade, with
                    Pennington's battery, moved well off to the left, partly mounted and partly
                    dismounted, while Merritt's division kept to the right of the pike. The enemy
                    was encountered in the woods, and after a very sharp fight of twenty minutes was
                    driven back nearly a mile in great confusion. My division took sixty prisoners
                    all from Breckinridge's corps. From them we learned that Early's whole force had
                    begun the march that morning for Shepherdstown with the intention of again
                    crossing the Potomac into Maryland. Having accomplished the object of the
                    reconnaissance I was directed to return with my division to its old camp.
                    Although by this time the enemy had recovered from their surprise and succeeded
                    in forming their line for an attack upon us, no difficulty was experienced by my
                    command in regaining its camp. Gen. Sheridan hearing that the rebels,
                    notwithstanding the discovery of their movements, would endeavor to make a new
                    invasion of Maryland, directed me to cross the Potomac at Harper's Ferry and
                    proceed, by the way of Pleasant Valley and Boonsborough, to the vicinity of
                    Sharpsburg, for the purpose of watching the fords on the Potomac as far up as
                    Williamsport. At 11 p.m. the same night I began the march, and after crossing
                    the river sent parties to communicate with Gen. Custer, near Antietam Furnace,
                    and the pickets of Averell's division, still farther up the river. The enemy
                    having failed to attempt a crossing and fallen back beyond the Opequon, my
                    division recrossed the river at Shepherdstown on the 28th of August, and marched
                    via Charlestown, to Berryville from which place it was engaged till the 18th of
                    September in making daily reconnaissance in the direction of Millwood, White
                    Post, and the Opequon. On the 13th of September Gen. McIntosh was directed to
                    make a strong reconnaissance toward Winchester for the purpose of determining
                    the enemy's position. Rushing rapidly across the Opequon on the Winchester pike
                    he struck the enemy's cavalry pickets near the stream and captured 37 men and 2
                    officers. Without halting he marched rapidly forward. Within two miles of
                    Winchester he struck a strong force of infantry posted so as to cover the town,
                    broke through their line, captured one entire regiment, the Eighth South
                    Carolina Infantry, with their colors, 14 commissioned officers, including the
                    colonel, and 92 enlisted men.</p>
<p>September 18, orders were issued for a general movement against the enemy, and in
                    pursuance thereof, at 2 a.m. the next morning, the division, McIntosh's brigade
                    in advance, moved by the Berryville, and Winchester pike crossed the Opequon,
                    drove in the enemy's pickets and attacked Ramseur's division of infantry, found
                    in the same position occupied by the rebel infantry on the 13th. It was not yet
                    dawn, but Gen. McIntosh posted Peirce's battery, Second U. S. Artillery,
                    supported by Gen. Chapman attacked at once with his entire brigade, mounted and
                    dismounted and after a most gallant and determined effort drove the enemy from
                    their strong position. Knowing the ground they had lost was of the greatest
                    importance to them, they returned at once to the attack with both infantry and
                    cavalry, but were gallantly met and repulsed. I then disposed of my forces on
                    the right and left of the road so as to hold all they had gained till the
                    infantry could reach and relieve them. Sharp skirmishing continued till 8 p.m.
                    at which time the Sixth Corps had all arrived and occupied the position we had
                    gained. I was then directed to move to the left and watch for an opportunity to
                    attack the enemy again. About eighty prisoners were taken during the morning.
                    Lieut.-Col. Brinton, in charging the enemy got so entangled with them as to fall
                    into their hands as a prisoner. Our loss was quite severe in killed and wounded.
                    Gen. McIntosh displayed the highest qualities of a cavalry officer in this
                    morning's work. The pike runs all the way from the Opequon through a deep ravine
                    heavily wooded on both flanks; at a point about two miles and a half from
                    Winchester crosses a commanding ridge. The enemy was strongly posted along the
                    ridge, in the woods and hastily constructed breast-works commanding the road and
                    the open fields on both sides of it. This position, the most commanding one on
                    the entire field, securely in our possession the infantry were enabled to form
                    at leisure and to deliver battle with every prospect of success. Having moved
                    well round toward the Millwood pike, numerous demonstrations were made upon the
                    enemy's right during the day, in one of which Gen. McIntosh was severely wounded
                    through the leg by a musket-ball. He was compelled to leave the field, and that
                    night had his leg amputated below the knee. Gen. Chapman was also struck and
                    partially disabled for several hours. Peirce's battery was posted well to the
                    front, and from the commanding position it occupied did excellent service in
                    enfilading the rebel infantry line. About 3 p.m., seeing that the enemy were
                    giving way, I directed Lieut.-Col. Purington, Second Ohio Cavalry, then
                    commanding Gen. McIntosh's brigade, to march at once toward Kernstown, on the
                    Valley pike, followed as closely as practicable by Chapman's brigade. The Second
                    New York Cavalry, Capt. Hull commanding in advance had not proceeded far before
                    it found Bradley Johnson's brigade of rebel cavalry posted upon the Millwood
                    pike to cover the enemy's flank. Capt. Hull formed his regiment by platoon, at a
                    trot, and with sabers drawn dashed gallantly forward, riding through and
                    scattering the rebels in all directions. Their flight was accelerated by a
                    simultaneous charge upon their right flank and rear by Capt. Boice, Fifth New
                    York, commanding a squadron of scouts. The march across the country, although
                    impeded by stone fences and rough ground, was made with rapidity. The Third New
                    Jersey and the Second Ohio Cavalry continued the pursuit till 10 p.m.,
                    repeatedly charging the enemy's infantry during the night. The command
                    bivouacked 10 p.m. at Kernstown.</p>
<p>Early next morning the pursuit was renewed, but at Middletown I turned toward
                    Front Royal and drove the rebel cavalry on that road to the south side of the
                    Shenandoah. When near Cedarville Capt. Russell, assistant inspector-general of
                    the division, was severely wounded in the knee, from the effects of which he
                    died a few days after. At daybreak of the 21st the division crossed the
                    Shenandoah and attacked the rebels at Front Royal, while the First Vermont and
                    the First New Hampshire, under command of Lieut.-Col. Wells, Fist Vermont,
                    marched up the south fork and crossed it at Kendrick's Ford. The rebels were
                    driven with confusion up the Luray Valley and closely followed to Gooney Run
                    that night. The valley at this place is a mere gorge impracticable for any kind
                    of troops, except on the pike. The position was turned the next day by Custer's
                    brigade, of the First Division, and the march continued through Luray,
                    Massanutten Gap, and New Market, to Harrisonburg where we joined the army
                    September 25. The enemy by occupying the numerous advantageous positions which
                    the valley afforded him, had been enabled to delay us long enough to prevent any
                    damage to the army under Gen. Early. September 26, marched to Staunton with
                    Lowell's brigade, of First Division, Gen. Torbert in command of the whole, where
                    we captured a number of a convalescent and wounded men, a large quantity of hard
                    bread, flour, tobacco, saddles, bridles clothing, and camp equipage. After
                    supplying the wants of the command the balance was destroyed. On the 27th moved
                    to Waynesborough and bivouacked. The next day the command was engaged in
                    destroying the track and bridges of the Gordonsville and Staunton railroad. On
                    the 29th, at 5 p.m., the enemy drove our pickets back to the village and
                    advanced to attack our main force about a mile west of them, with a strong force
                    of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. Heavy skirmishing continued till dark, but
                    Gen. Torbert, having heard from Gen. Sheridan, and the balance of the cavalry in
                    the neighborhood of Port Republic, though best to retire without delivering
                    battle. The withdrawal had already begun, with nearly all the command on the
                    march, when a small force of the enemy succeeded in getting to the pike on the
                    left and rear of the force covering the movement. I ordered Col. Lowell to
                    charge through with his command and sent word to Col. Wells, commanding the rear
                    guard, to follow him. The former went through handsomely by following the road,
                    and Col. Wells inclined to the left avoiding the rebels entirely. The march was
                    continued through Staunton to Spring Hill, where we bivouacked and fed at
                    daylight. The same day we marched to Bridgewater seven miles from Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>In pursuance of instructions from Lieut.-Gen. Grant, I was relieved from command
                    of the division September 30, and directed to proceed without delay to Atlanta,
                    Ga., and report to Maj.-Gen. Sherman, as chief of cavalry of the Military
                    Division of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>In closing this report I have the honor to commend the zeal, gallantry, and
                    soldierly conduct of both officers and men of the division throughout the entire
                    period they remained under my command.</p>
<p>Gen.'s McIntosh and Chapman performed every duty assigned them with the utmost
                    promptitude and fidelity, and are entitled to promotion for distinguished and
                    meritorious services.</p>

                    Pennsylvania; Col. W. Wells and Lieut.-Col. Bennett First Vermont; Col.
                    Benjamin, Lieut.-Col. Pope and Maj. Caleb Moore, Eighth New York; Maj. Samuel

                    Maj. Patton, Third Indiana, were always conspicuous for the zealous and
                    intelligent performance of their duties in the field, and in the care of their
                    men in camp. They are worthy the special confidence and care of the War
                    Department.</p>

                    rendered me.</p>
