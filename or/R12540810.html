<p><b>Summary:<br></b>The death of General Thomas J. Jackson prompted Robert E. Lee to think hard about
                    dividing the two large corps composing the Army of Northern Virginia into three.
                    In this May, 1863, letter, Lee writes Jefferson Davis with suggestions for
                    reorganization of the army. Among other changes, Lee proposes placing forces in
                    the Valley, including H. D. Davidson's men at Staunton, under the command of
                    General Isaac Trimble.</p>

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS:</p>
<p>FREDERICKSBURG,</p>
<p>May 20, 1863.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>I cannot express the concern I felt at leaving you in such feeble health, with so
                    many anxious thoughts for the welfare of the whole Confederacy weighing upon
                    your mind. I pray that a kind Providence will give upon you, and that you may
                    soon have the gratification of seeing the country liberated from its enemies,
                    and all your labors crowned with success.</p>
<p>In the matters I propose now to submit to the consideration of Your Excellency, I
                    shall endeavor to be brief.</p>
<p>Paxton's and J. R. Jones' places have been filled by Walker and John M. Jones.
                    Should the latter officer fail in his duty, he will instantly resign. I have not
                    yet been able to fill Nicholls' place. I have not seen Col. Walton, but
                    Longstreet thinks he would not like the exchange, and I am doubtful whether he
                    would answer. The misfortune is that the brigade is at present commanded by Col.
                    Edmund Pendleton, who is not highly considered, and its services, I fear, will
                    be lost to the army. I have determined to place Gordon in command of Rodes'
                    former brigade. That will leave Lawton's vacant. If the latter is not wanted
                    elsewhere, he can be returned to it. But I believe Col. Edward Willis, of the
                    Twelfth Georgia, or Col. John T. Mercer, of the Twenty-first, would answer
                    better for the field. Both have been educated at West Point; the later served
                    several years in the army. I think it better to relieve Colston from duty, and
                    to place Gen. George H. Steuart in command of his brigade. The brigade is
                    composed of two North Carolina and three Virginia regiments. The former have
                    complained of being commanded by a Virginia brigadier, and I presume the latter
                    would complain if commanded by a North Carolinian. Gen. Steuart being of the old
                    army, no one has a right to complain. I shall write to Gen. Cooper for Gen.
                    Steuart. I shall also write to Gen. Trimble to know whether he can take general
                    control of affairs in the Valley. He will have Col. H. B. Davidson at Staunton,
                    and Gen. Jenkins with the cavalry below.</p>
<p>I have for the past year felt that the corps of this army were too large for one
                    commander. Nothing prevented my proposing to you to reduce their size and
                    increase their number but my inability to recommend commanders. Each corps
                    contains, when in fighting condition, about 30,000 men. These are more than one
                    man can properly handle and keep under his eye in battle in the country that we
                    have to operate in. They are always beyond the range of his vision, and
                    frequently beyond his reach. The loss of Jackson from command of one-half the
                    army seems to me a good opportunity to remedy this evil. If, therefore, you
                    think Ewell is able to do field duty, I submit to your better judgment whether
                    the most advantageous arrangement would not be to put him in command of three
                    divisions of Jackson's corps, to take on of Longstreet's divisions, A. P. Hill's
                    division, and form a division of Ransom's, Cooke's, and Pettigrew's brigades,
                    and give the corps thus formed to A. P. Hill. In this event I also submit to you
                    whether it would not be well to promote Ewell and A. P. Hill. The former is an
                    honest, brave soldier, who has always done his duty well. The latter, I think
                    upon the whole, is the best soldier of his grade with me.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as this army has done hard work, and there is still harder before it, I
                    wish to take advantage of every circumstance to inspire and encourage them, and
                    induce the officers and men to believe that their labors are appreciated, and
                    when vacancies occur that they will receive the advantages of promotion if they
                    deserve it. I believe the efficiency of the corps would be promoted by being
                    commanded by lieutenant-generals, and I do not know where to get better men than
                    those I have named.</p>
<p>R. H. Anderson and J. B. Hood are also capital officers. They are improving, too,
                    and will make good corps commanders, if necessary.</p>
<p>I think it is better to take officers from each corps respectively for promotion
                    in the respective corps, as far as practicable, consideration being always given
                    to the best man in the particular army. If A. P. Hill is promoted, a
                    major-general will be wanted for his division. Heth is the senior brigadier in
                    the division. I think him a good officer. He has lately joined this army, was in
                    the last battle, and did well. His nomination having been once declined by the
                    Senate, I do not know whether it would be proper to promote him. Pender is an
                    excellent officer, attentive, industrious, and brave; has been conspicuous in
                    every battle, and, I believe, wounded in almost all of them.</p>
<p>I must now ask you to do in all this matter as seems best to you from your point
                    of view. I have frankly given you my opinions from mine. I hope you will be able
                    to give me your conclusions at your earliest convenience, as it is time I was in
                    motion.</p>
<p>With earnest wishes for your health and happiness, and with great
                        respect, I am your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
