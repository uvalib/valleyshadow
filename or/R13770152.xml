                <p>In early June, 1864, Union troops captured Staunton, Virginia. By the 15th,
                    Confederate Colonel Edwin Lee returned to the town. In this letter to
                    Confederate Assistant Adjutant General J. Stoddard Johnston, Lee reports how he
                    discovered sick and wounded Federals in the Staunton hospital, and worked
                    quickly to parole them before Union troops arrived.</p>

                </opener>
                <p>Your note of the 13th reached me yesterday by return courier. It states "McNeill
                    and Gilmor are in the Valley below." Maj. Gilmor has just showed me your note of
                    the 12th requesting him to join the major- general commanding with all his
                    force, and directing him to order similar force likewise-McNeill and Mosby, I
                    suppose. If the intention of yours of the 13th to me was to supersede that of
                    the 12th to Gilmor, I would respectfully call attention to the fact that there
                    is now only McNeill's sixty men between me and the Potomac, and he will, under
                    Maj. Gilmor's order, be removed. If consistent with the exigencies of the case,
                    would it not be well to permit Gilmor and McNeill to remain below? If both, or
                    either, are kept there, I ask that they be instructed to keep me advised of the
                    enemy's movements, and especially of all that threatens this point. I will have
                    the telegraph ready for work to-morrow.</p>
                <p>There are 200 wounded Yankees here at the hospital and forty nurses. I had no
                    guard when I got here and did not know when the enemy might get back; so I went
                    to work and paroled the whole of them. I sent a copy of the parole. It is the
                    same that they gave our hospital men, except the clause regarding escape, which
                    I added because I had no guard, and because I did not know whether the paroles
                    were binding anyhow. Is the parole they gave our men binding now? Is mine
                    binding to them unless we keep the men and deliver them at a point of exchange?
                    Is there not some special agreement between the two Governments about hospital
                    paroles? Cannot these fellows be returned to their own lines as fast as
                    convalescent by mutual consent of Gen.'s Breckinridge and Hunter, instead of
                    sending them to Richmond? I have not yet deliver to the surgeon in charge of
                    them a copy of the parole or the list.</p>
