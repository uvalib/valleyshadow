<p>Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War:</p>
<p>STAUNTON,</p>
<p>December 1, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have come to Staunton with the view of carrying out the plans proposed in my
                    communication to you. I have already given every order necessary to do so. Shall
                    I proposed? Four regiments from the Monterey line have been ordered by Gen.
                    Cooper to Mannassas. I have directed two other regiments to come here from
                    Millborough. Is it your intention to detach all those regiments from his
                    command? I thought preparatory to the movement I would order them here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
