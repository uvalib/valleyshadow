<p>February 28, 1865.</p>
<p>COL</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
                    artillery serving with this army during the campaign of 1864:</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>On the 7th the enemy, apparently despairing of forcing our line, remained mainly
                    passive and not many shots were fired. The general chief of artillery, under
                    instructions from the commanding general reconnoitered positions on the right
                    and caused a road to be opened by portions of the artillery to facilitate a
                    rapid movement in that direction. At the same time on the extreme left a
                    reconnaissance was made by the chief of artillery Second Corps, under orders
                    from Gen. Ewell, with Jones' infantry brigade, attended by Carter's battery.
                    Striking the Germanna road near Beale's house, this force encountered there,
                    about a mile from the ford, several regiments of the enemy's cavalry. These
                    received but a few cannon shots, when they dispersed, a few retreating toward
                    the ford, the major number going toward the main body of the enemy. The ford and
                    Germanna road being thus found virtually abandoned, it became obvious the enemy
                    was contemplating another movement and leaving our immediate front. The battle
                    of the Wilderness was over. The enemy, wholly repulsed and foiled, was leaving
                    his dead and some of his wounded within the range of our guns. About dark of the
                    7th the general chief of artillery [was] directed by the commanding general to
                    send to Gen. Anderson, who had on Gen. Longstreet's being wounded succeeded to
                    the command of the First Corps, a staff officer who could guide that general
                    along the new road cut out that day. The general chief of artillery went himself
                    to Gen. Anderson described the route, and left and officer as guide. Here a
                    circumstance occurred which should be specially noticed. Gen. Anderson stated
                    that his orders were to march by 3 next morning. He was preparing to start at 11
                    that night. Those four hours anticipated proved of incalculable value next day.
                    The artillery of the First Corps, which, as already mentioned, had not been able
                    to find opportunity in the battle of the Wilderness, received orders to march on
                    the night of the 7th, and from its several positions struck into the column en
                    route for Spotsylvania Court-House.</p>
<p>About 9 a.m. of the 8th the head of the column came in sight of the Court-House,
                    and found the enemy just getting into view on the Fredericksburg road, driving
                    back a small cavalry force which there opposed them. At the same time a strong
                    infantry column assailed another cavalry force which disputed their entrance on
                    the Todd's Tavern road. Gen. Alexander, accompanying Gen. Anderson with his
                    advanced column immediately sent Maj. Haskell with two batteries to the
                    assistance of our cavalry. On the Todd's Tavern road two infantry brigades also
                    went in support. These batteries were stubbornly engaged for two hours. Their
                    ammunition being then exhausted and considerable loss experienced, they were
                    withdrawn. During a part of the action they had suffered under a flank reverse
                    fire from a battery belonging to that force of the enemy which had reached the
                    Court-House by the other route. In the engagement Capt. Potts, a most deserving,
                    gallant, and efficient officer, was mortally wounded. Field's division meanwhile
                    drove the enemy from the Court-House, and Huger's battalion was posted on the
                    front. Upon the Todd's Tavern road, the enemy still pressing in force, more of
                    our infantry had to be there concentrated, and five of Cabell's guns were sent
                    under Maj. Hamilton to that line and assisted materially in repelling the
                    enemy's assaults. Subsequently a front line having been selected by the general
                    chief of artillery, under advice of Gen. Stuart, crossing the Todd's Tavern road
                    on a piney knoll with an opening in front, five of Huger's batteries were placed
                    in position on that line in very close proximity to the enemy, his guns being
                    not more than 400 yards off, his sharpshooters scarcely over 100 yards. The same
                    afternoon (8th) Ewell's corps (Second), which had left the Wilderness at dawn,
                    arrived and bivouacked on the line which it was to occupy on the right of the
                    Todd's Tavern road and beyond that wing of the First Corps. A few of its guns
                    were put in position on the Court-House front, the rest parked for the night.
                    The Third Corps, temporarily commanded by Gen. Early (Gen. Hill being, unwell),
                    remaining with its artillery as rear guard of the army, did not leave position
                    at the Wilderness till, late in the day of the 8th, and did not that night
                    proceed beyond Shady Grove. One section of McIntosh's battalion was in the
                    evening engaged with the rear guard of the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 9th, our line being established, most of the artillery was posted along
                    its entire course and protected by slight earth-works: Cabell's battalion on the
                    left flank, four Napoleons, under Maj. Gibbes, occupying the left of the line of
                    battle, the remaining guns being on an interior or second line upon higher
                    ground, so as to cover and assist the front line. Haskell's battalion and
                    Woolfolk's battery, of Huger's battalion, on the second line, to Cabell's right,
                    and Huger's five batteries close up to the enemy on the front line, crossing the
                    Todd's Tavern road. Farther to the right Page's and Braxton's guns were in
                    position, with the infantry (Second Corps) on the intrenched line of battle. On
                    this part of the line, as at the Wilderness, dense woods prevented the effective
                    use of much artillery. A portion of Hardaway's and Nelson's guns occupied the
                    line much farther to the right on the left of the Court-House opening, Cutshaw's
                    being in reserve. As the artillery of the Third Corps arrived in the course of
                    this day it was posted on the line still farther to the right-Poague's guns on
                    the left of the front to be occupied by this corps, Pegram's next, crossing the
                    Fredericksburg road a few hundred yards from the Court-House, and Cutts' on the
                    extreme right, in advance of the road to Massaponax Church. Lieut.-Col. Pegram
                    advanced with a section of Ellett's battery and co-operated with the enemy until
                    our line was established. McIntosh's battalion remained with Mahone's division
                    near the crossing of the Po River by the Shady Grove road to guard the left
                    flank of our army, and Richardson's battalion was held in reserve. Along the
                    left wing and left center there was on this day continual skirmishing. Our
                    artillery, however, fired but little and almost entirely at the enemy's
                    infantry.</p>
<p>The 10th was a day of more vigorous battle. The enemy made incessant attacks on
                    Anderson's (First Corps) front, but were continually repulsed with great
                    slaughter. The guns on the front line, and two others from Manly's battery
                    brought forward about noon, again during the day mowed down the enemy's columns
                    with canister at short range. Skirmishing also occurred during the forenoon on
                    the left of Ewell's (Second Corps) front, occupied by Rodes' division with
                    Hardaway's guns, which had relieved Page's, but did not extend to its right,
                    held by Johnson's division, where Nelson's guns had relieved Braxton's. Early on
                    this day Richardson's battalion accompanied Heth's division in a flank movement
                    conducted by Gen. Early around our left upon the enemy's right, and was severely
                    engaged. A section of Ellett's battery, Pegram's battalion, accompanied
                    Richardson's battalion in this expedition and did good service. As our troops in
                    this movement came upon the enemy's flank they were met by a galling fire from a
                    number of batteries he had there posted; and Cabell's guns, from their elevated
                    position on our left, were directed by the general chief of artillery to open
                    upon those batteries, so as to draw their fire and aid Early's advance. The
                    effect was as anticipated. Soon after McIntosh's guns from the east bank of the
                    Po poured into the ranks of the enemy, retreating before Gen. Early, a
                    destructive fire; and some of the guns of this battalion advancing with a
                    portion of Mahone's division as soon as the bridge was cleared, contributed
                    still further to the good effect of the movement on that flank. On this day the
                    enemy made also a demonstration against our right immediately at Spotsylvania
                    Court-House, advancing several lines of infantry. Pegram's and Cutts' guns,
                    however, opened upon them with vigor and speedily drove them back to the cover
                    of their trenches. In the afternoon the enemy, having massed a large force in
                    front of Second Corps' left center, under cover of a pine thicket, made a sudden
                    attack upon Doles' brigade, which, having no skirmishers out, in consequence of
                    the close proximity of the lines, was taken entirely by surprise. The brigade
                    gave way for a season, and the enemy entered our works and captured Smith's
                    battery, of Hardaway's battalion. Our infantry, being soon railed and
                    re-enforced, repulsed the enemy with considerable loss and recovered the guns.
                    The captain had fought his battery until he was actually seized by soldiers from
                    the enemy's ranks, and some of his men were carried off by the retreating foe
                    and not recovered. On this occasion Hardaway's guns alone were engaged and were
                    extremely well served. Two of Cutshaw's batteries were hastened up for the
                    crisis and put in position to command the broken line. The men from one of these
                    batteries (Graham's) being called for to work the guns on the line left weak
                    handed by the capture of Smith's cannoneers, sprang forward under their captain
                    and served two of those guns with fine spirit.</p>
<p>Maj. David Watson, second in command of Hardaway's battalion, an accomplished
                    gentleman, faithful patriot, and gallant soldier, fell at his post during this
                    attack mortally wounded. Lieut.-Col. Hardaway was also wounded-only slightly,
                    however, though his clothes were riddled with bullets. He did not leave the
                    field.</p>
<p> The enemy, thus punished along the entire line on the 10th, made no serious
                    attack on the 11th. Heavy skirmishing, however, occurred from left to right, in
                    which the artillery occasionally took part. Late in the afternoon of this day
                    the commanding general, having reason to believe the enemy withdrawing and
                    intending to leave him no time to gain distance upon us, directed the general
                    chief of artillery to have brought back from the front line before it should be
                    entirely dark all guns so situated as to be difficult to withdraw at night, so
                    that everything might be ready to march at any hour. Under this order Gen.
                    Alexander had his ammunition-chests in the trenches mounted on the caissons, and
                    gun carriages taken to the vicinity of their guns, but retained the latter in
                    position as the safest course. Gen. Long having a more difficult route for his
                    artillery on Johnson's front-by a narrow and intricate road through a
                    wood--preferred executing the order literally, especially as the night promised
                    to be very dark.[1] Nelson's and Page's battalions
                    were accordingly withdrawn. This left unprotected an extensive salient of about
                    a quarter of a mile across and nearly a mile around, which constituted the left
                    of Johnson's line. A section of Page's battalion was sent, with a proper
                    infantry guard, to escort a wagon train to Guiney's Depot, on the Richmond and
                    Fredericksburg Railroad. </p>
<p>At 3 a.m. of the 12th Page's battalion was hastily summoned back to the line, it
                    having been found that the enemy was preparing to make there a heavy attack. It
                    was prepared and moved up with extraordinary speed and arrived at the proper
                    point, but not in time to arrest disaster. Before the guns could be brought into
                    action, or even more than one or two unlimbered, the enemy's masses, had
                    overpowered Johnson's division and taken possession of the Salient. All of
                    Page's guns were enveloped and captured except 2, which succeeded in getting
                    off. At the same time 2 of Cutshaw's batteries, which had the previous evening
                    been posted on the left bank of the Salient to enfilade Doles' front, were also
                    captured. The enemy could thus boast of getting 20 guns-12 from Page and 8 from
                    Cutshaw. In addition to the unfortunate withdrawal of our guns the enemy was
                    favored in his movement and we were obstructed in counteracting it by the
                    extreme darkness of a very dense fog. Arrangements were made as soon as possible
                    to check the enemy and prevent any additional damage. Braxton's and Nelson's and
                    a portion of Hardaway's battalions were posted by Col. Carter on a second line
                    about the prolongation leftwise of that held by the guns near the Court-House.
                    Other guns were also taken to the front near the gorge of the Salient. Maj.
                    Cutshaw and Capt. Garber, with their men that had escaped capture, reached some
                    of the guns which the enemy could not carry off, and, turning them, used them
                    with good effect. Capt. Montgomery plied effectively also a single gun at short
                    range, and with such constancy as to exhaust three caissons of ammunition. The
                    enemy could not advance, but the pressure of his enormous force rendered it
                    necessary to increase our own efforts. Hardaway's battalion was therefore moved
                    forward and posted to command the rear of the Salient, Capt. Dance in command,
                    Lieut.-Col. Hardaway having been wounded in the act of advancing to the front.
                    Col. Cabell also came from the left with four of this guns and took position on
                    the left of Dance's. These guns were brought up and used with admirable
                    steadiness under a severe fire. McIntosh's battalion was in like manner brought
                    to the support of this point. Only one section of it was, however, actively
                    engaged. By these and other vigorous measures the enemy was prevent from
                    profiting by the advantage he had gained. Repelled from the most of the Salient
                    and kept at bay in its apex, he could not during the day carry off the guns he
                    had captured.</p>
<p>While this contest was raging battle was also joined with great fury along the
                    entire line. On the left from early dawn column after column of the enemy as it
                    came up to assault was shivered by the tremendous destructiveness of missiles
                    hurled upon them at close range from our guns. Batteries here posted on our
                    second line participated in the action by firing upon the enemy's batteries, so
                    as to draw their fire away from our line of battle, That fire from the enemy was
                    at times most furious. One or two of our guns in the front line were struck and
                    disabled, and First Lieut. Dent Burroughs, a gallant young officer, commanding
                    Moody's battery, was killed by a shot which passed through the parapet. On the
                    right center another salient of our line attacked by the masses of Burnside's
                    corps was effectively swept by Nelson's, Poague's, and Pegram's guns. The enemy
                    was here driven back in confusion, those guns contributing largely to the
                    result. To the right our batteries engaged those of the enemy, so as to prevent
                    their fire being concentrated on our center. Thus passed and closed this
                    eventful day. At all points except at the prominent Salient the enemy had been
                    repulsed with immense loss. There he had gained a lodgment and captured a number
                    of guns and prisoners, but he had been effectually prevented from profiting by
                    it, and had himself suffered severely. Our interior line was there well
                    established and protected during the night with guns in position so that by next
                    morning the enemy was as far from his object as ever. The enemy now for some
                    days remained quiet. and the time was improved on our part in strengthening our
                    lines and reorganizing commands that had been seriously shattered. Maj. Cutshaw
                    was assigned to the command of Hardaway's battalion and Maj. Page, put in
                    command of the combined remnants of his own and Cutshaw's battalions. While the
                    artillery with the main army was thus engaged in this great conflict, that with
                    the cavalry was actively operating-one portion with Gen. W. H. F. Lee on our
                    right flank, another with Gen. Hampton, on our left, and the remainder
                    (Johnston's battery, Baltimore Light Artillery, and a section of Hart's battery,
                    under Maj. Breathed) with Gen.'s Stuart and Fitzhugh Lee in their pursuit of
                    Sheridan attempting to raid into Richmond. In the severe conflict which ensued
                    at the Yellow Tavern all these guns were used, though Hart's section and the
                    Baltimore Light Artillery bore the brunt of the fight. The latter suffered most
                    severely and lost a number of men and horses captured by the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 14th the enemy were found to have withdrawn from Anderson's front (our
                    left), leaving his thickly-strewn dead unburied, and among them many who had
                    fallen wounded between the lines and had lain there perishing for days. His
                    demonstration then appearing on our right Anderson's corps was on the night of
                    the 15th transferred to that flank, extending our line in that direction to the
                    Po. Huger's and Haskell's battalions were here placed in position and Cabell's
                    held in reserve.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 18th the enemy again attempted to carry the line still held
                    by the Second Corps near the scene of the former conflict. This time, however,
                    he met guns in position to receive him. His heavy was allowed to get within good
                    range of our breast-works. There the guns under Col. Carter (Hardaway's
                    battalion and Page's reorganized) opened upon him a murderous fire of spherical
                    case and canister which at once arrested his advance, threw his columns into
                    confusion, and forced him to retreat in disorder. Heavily as he suffered on this
                    occasion, our loss was nothing, and this was accomplished against a force of
                    12,000 picked infantry, by twenty-nine pieces of artillery alone, but well
                    handled. In the afternoon, Gen. Ewell having determined to make a flank
                    movement, Lieut.-Col. Braxton was directed to accompany him with six guns of
                    select caliber. The roads, however, were found impracticable for artillery, and
                    Col. Braxton was ordered to return to his position on the line. Simultaneously
                    with his attack on Ewell's front on this day the enemy assailed, but in a
                    different manner, our line near the Court-House. Having gotten a number of guns
                    into a position to enfilade part of our line, he at attempted under cover of
                    their fire to advance his front batteries. Pegram's and Cutts' guns promptly
                    opened in reply. A furious cannonade ensued for about an hour. By that time the
                    enemy's batteries in front were silenced and all further attempt to advance
                    there was abandoned. In this cannonade Maj. McGraw, second in command of
                    Pegram's battalion, was severely wounded, as were several other officers.
                    Richardson's battalion on this day occupied the line to the right of Cutts'
                    guns, those of First Corps being still farther to the right. The enemy,
                    apparently satisfied with his fruitless efforts near Spotsylvania Court-House,
                    made there no further attempt, and being found on the 21st shifting his position
                    and moving beyond our right, our army was also on that day put in motion in the
                    same direction. The Second Corps (Ewell's), then our left, having no enemy
                    remaining on its front, moved with its artillery early in the day, passing the
                    other corps, to the Telegraph road south of the of the Po, and then by that road
                    toward Hanover Junction. Later in the day the Third Corps (Hill's) marched,
                    accompanied by a portion of its artillery, toward the same point on a road
                    nearly parallel to and not the west of the Telegraph road; and in the afternoon
                    the First Corps (Anderson's) took up the line of march toward an on the
                    Telegraph road, attended by Huger's and Haskell's battalions, Cabell's
                    battalion, with others from the Third Corps, having previously marched by other
                    roads as little to the west, so as to avoid crowding.</p>
