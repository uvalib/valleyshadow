<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Brigadier General W. W. Loring attests to Staunton's importance as a base of

<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS, Adjutant-Gen., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Huntersville, Va.,</p>
<p>July 30, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>Upon reaching here I find the country is very scarce of supplies, and that it
                    will be necessary for us to rely mostly upon Staunton and Richmond. Since I
                    reached the command I have put the quartermaster's department and commissariat
                    in such order as it was possible to do. Gen. Jackson informs me that he has made
                    frequent and urgent requisitions for supplies, and that his requisitions are
                    scarcely filled from day to day. In order to place the thing beyond doubt and
                    insure a sufficiency, I have renewed the requisitions, and have written to the
                    different agents, sending one of my aides to see in person that the supplies are
                    forwarded from Richmond and Staunton. I respectfully request that orders may be
                    issued at the earliest possible moment for them to be forwarded. I am satisfied,
                    if we can be furnished in a few days, that a successful movement can be made.</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding, &amp;c.</p>
