                <p>I have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders, my command was reported
                    on the brigade parade ground at 6 a.m. February 5. The regiment marched with the
                    brigade until we reached the picket-line on the Vaughan road. The One hundred
                    and eighty-fourth was then assigned to the right of the brigade, and, after
                    several maneuvers, was formed in line immediately west of the Riddle house. Here
                    fortifications were erected and skirmishers thrown in front. I remained in this
                    position until the morning of the 11th instant, when, after destroying all the
                    fortifications of the brigade, I withdrew the regiment to the lines it now
                    occupies. The regiment was not heavily engaged with the enemy, and consequently
                    I lost but two men wounded, viz, Joseph Jenkins, sergeant, Company B, wounded,
                    and John Adams, private, Company K, wounded in hand. I have every reason to be
                    proud of the deportment of the officers and men during this campaign. No special
                    opportunity was presented for unusual gallantry, except on the night of the 5th,
                    when a portion of the picket-line was driven in by the enemy. Lieut. Col.
                    Charles Kleckner promptly re-established the line, driving the enemy from the
                    pits he had captured. I accordingly recommend him to the favorable notice of the
                    Col. commanding the brigade.</p>
