                    Staunton on their way to take part in fighting in the Shenandoah Valley. In this
                    dispatch, Colonel Shipp of the cadet corps reports on the part the cadets played
                    in the June campaigns, including a battle near New Market.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. F. H. SMITH,<br> Superintendent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 4, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>In obedience to General Orders, No.--, headquarters Virginia Military Institute,
                    June 27, 1864, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations
                    of the Corps of Cadets under my command in the field from May 11 to June 25,
                    inclusive:</p>
<p>In obedience to orders from Maj.-Gen. Breckinridge, communicated through you, at
                    7 a. m. on the morning of May 11 the Corps of Cadets, consisting of a battalion
                    of four companies of infantry and a section of 3-inch rifled guns, took up the
                    line of march for Staunton. The march to Staunton was accomplished in two days.
                    I preceded the column on the second day some hours for the purpose of reporting
                    to Gen. Breckinridge, and was ordered by him to put the Cadets in camp one mile
                    south of Staunton.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th I received orders to march at daylight on the road to
                    Harrisonburg, taking position in the column in rear of Echols' brigade. We
                    marched eighteen miles and encamped; moved at daylight on the 14th; marched
                    sixteen miles and encamped.</p>
<p>At 12 o'clock on the night of the 14th received orders to prepare to march
                    immediately, without beat of drum and as noiselessly as possible. We moved from
                    camp at 1.30 o'clock, taking position in the general column in rear of Echols'
                    brigade, being followed by the column of artillery under the command of Maj.
                    McLaughlin. Having accomplished a distance of six miles and approached the
                    position of the enemy, as indicated by occasional skirmishing with his pickets
                    in front, a halt was called, and we remained on the side of the road two or
                    three hours in the midst of a heavy fall of rain. The general having determined
                    to receive the attack of the enemy, made his dispositions for battle, posting
                    the corps in reserve. He informed me that he did not wish to put the Cadets in
                    if he could avoid it, but that should occasion require it, he would use them
                    very freely. He was also pleased to express his confidence in them, and I am
                    happy to believe that his expectation were not disappointed, for when the tug of
                    battle came they bore themselves gallantly and well.</p>
<p>The enemy not making the attack as was anticipated, or not advancing as rapidly
                    as was desired, the line was deployed into column and the advance resumed. Here
                    I was informed by one of Gen. Breckinridge's aids that my battalion, together
                    with the battalion of Col. G. M. Edgar, would constitute the reserve, and was
                    instructed to keep the section of artillery with the column, and to take
                    position, after the deployments should have been made, 250 or 300 yards in rear
                    of the front line of battle, and to maintain that distance. Having begun a flank
                    movement to the left, about two miles south of New Market, the nature of the
                    ground was such as to render it impossible that the artillery should continue
                    with the infantry column. I ordered Lieut. Minge to join the general artillery
                    column in the main road and to report to Maj. McLaughlin. After that I did not
                    see the section of artillery until near the close of the engagement. Maj.
                    McLaughlin, under whose command they served, was pleased to speak of the section
                    in such complimentary terms that I was satisfied they had done their duty.</p>
<p>Continuing the advance on the ground to the left of the main road and south of
                    New Market, at 12.30 p. m. we came under the fire of the enemy's batteries.
                    Having advanced a quarter of a mile under the fire we were halted and the column
                    was deployed, the march up to this time having been by flank in column. The
                    ground in front was open, with skirts of woods on the left. Here Gen.
                    Breckinridge sent for me and gave me in person my instructions. The general's
                    plans seem to have undergone some modification. Instead of one line, with a
                    reserve, he formed his infantry in two, artillery in rear and to the right, the
                    cavalry deployed and guarding the right flank, left flank resting on a stream.
                    Wharton's brigade of infantry constituted the first line; Echols' brigade the
                    second. The battalion of Cadets, brigades with Echols, was the last battalion
                    but one from the left of the second line, Edgar's battalion being on the left.
                    The lines having been adjusted the order to advance was passed. Wharton's line
                    advanced; Echols' followed at 250 paces in rear. As Wharton's line ascended a
                    knoll it came in full view of the enemy's batteries, which opened a heavy fire,
                    but not having gotten the range, did but little damage. By the time the second
                    line reached the same ground the Yankee gunners had gotten the exact range, and
                    their fire began to tell on our line with fearful accuracy. It was here that
                    Capt. Hill and others fell. Great gaps were made through the ranks, but the
                    cadet, true to his discipline, would close in to the center to fill the interval
                    and push steadily forward. The alignment of the battalion under this terrible
                    fire, which strewed the ground with killed and wounded for more than a mile on
                    open ground, would have been creditable even on a field day.</p>
<p>The advance was thus continued until having passed Bushong's house, a mile or
                    more beyond New Market, and still to the left of the main road, the enemy's
                    batteries, at 250 or 300 yards, opened upon us with canister and case-shot, and
                    their long lines of infantry were put into action at the same time. The fire was
                    withering. It seemed impossible that any living creature could escape; and here
                    we sustained our heaviest loss, a great many being wounded and numbers knocked
                    down, stunned, and temporarily disabled. I was here disabled for a time, and the
                    command devolved upon Capt. H. A. Wise, Company A. He gallantly pressed onward.
                    We had before this gotten into the front line. Our line took a position behind a
                    line of fence. A brisk fusillade ensued; a shout, a rush, and the day was won.
                    The enemy fled in confusion, leaving killed, wounded, artillery, and prisoners
                    in our hands. Our men pursued in hot haste until it became necessary to halt,
                    draw ammunition, and re-establish the lines for the purpose of driving them from
                    their last position on Rude's Hill, which they held with cavalry and artillery
                    to cover the passage of the river, about a mile in their rear. Our troops
                    charged and took the position without loss. The enemy withdrew, crossed the
                    river, and burnt the bridge.</p>
<p>The engagement closed at 6.30 p. m. The Cadets did their duty, as the long list
                    of casualties will attest. Numerous instances of gallantry might be mentioned,
                    but I have thought it better to refrain from specifying individual cases for
                    fear of making invidious distinctions, or from want of information, withholding
                    praise where it may have been justly merited. It had rained almost incessantly
                    during the battle, and at its termination the Cadets were well nigh exhausted.
                    Wet, hungry, and many of them shoeless-for they had lost their shoes and socks
                    in the deep mud through which it was necessary to march-they bore their
                    hardships with that uncomplaining resignation which characterizes the true
                    soldier.</p>
<p>The 16th and 17th were devoted to caring for the wounded and the burial of the
                    dead.</p>
<p>On the 17th I received an order from Gen. Breckinridge to report to Gen. Imboden,
                    with the request upon the part of Gen. Breckinridge that the corps be relieved
                    from further duty at that time and be ordered back to the Institute. The
                    circumstances of Gen. Imboden's situation were such as to render our detention
                    for a time necessary. We were finally ordered by him to proceed to Staunton
                    without delay, for the purpose of proceeding by rail to Richmond, in obedience
                    to a call of the Secretary of War. Returning, the corps marched into Staunton on
                    the 21st; took the cars on the 22d; reached Richmond on the 23d; were stationed
                    at Camp Lee until the 28th; were then ordered to report to Maj.-Gen. Ransom;
                    ordered by him to encamp on intermediate line. On the 28th left Camp Lee; took
                    up camp on Carter's farm, on intermediate line, midway between Brook and Meadow
                    Bridge roads; continued in this camp until June 6. On the 6th received orders to
                    return to Lexington; reached Lexington on the 9th; Yankees approached on 10th;
                    drove us out on the 11th; we fell back, taking Lynchburg road; marched to mouth
                    of the North River and went into camp. Next day (Sunday, the 11th) remained in
                    camp until 12 a.m.; scouts reported enemy advancing; fell back two miles and
                    took a position at a strong pass in the mountains to await the enemy. No enemy
                    came. We were then ordered to Lynchburg; went there; ordered to report to Gen.
                    Vaughn; ordered back to Lexington; reached Lexington on the 25th. Corps
                    furloughed on June 27.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>S. SHIPP,<br> Lieut.-Col. and Commandant.</p>
