<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In late November and early December, 1862, General Ambrose E. Burnside,
                    commanding the Army of the Potomac, positioned his troops for an attack on
                    Fredericksburg. In this letter, Robert E. Lee writes Jefferson Davis concerning
                    these movements. Lee speculates on Burnside's plans and intentions. He also
                    discusses sending Confederate troops to Staunton to operate against Federals in
                    the Valley.</p>

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 6, 1862.</p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>The enemy still maintain his position north of the Rappahannock. I can discover
                    no indications of his advancing, or of transferring his troops to other
                    positions. Scouts on both of his flanks north of the Rappahannock report no
                    movement, nor have those stationed on the Potomac discovered the collection of
                    transport or the passage of troops down that river.</p>
<p>Gen. Burnside's whole army appears to be encamped between the Rappahannock and
                    Potomac. His apparent inaction suggests the probability that he is waiting for
                    expected operations elsewhere, and I fear troops may be collecting south of
                    James River. Yet I get no reliable information of organized or tried troops
                    being sent to that quarter, nor am I aware of any of their general officers in
                    whom confidence is placed being there in command. There is an evident
                    concentration of troops hitherto disposed in other parts of Virginia, but
                    whether for the purpose of augmenting Gen. Burnside's army or any other I cannot
                    tell.</p>
<p>Col. Imboden reports that the Federal forces in Northwestern Virginia have
                    retired toward New Creek, leaving a guard of some 200 at Beverly. There are none
                    at Moorefield, or in the valley of the South Branch of the Potomac. There is but
                    one company at Springfield, one at Paw Paw, one at the mouth of Little Cacapon,
                    and three at Oldtown, in Maryland just opposite.</p>
<p>Gen. Jones reports, on the 4th instant, that Gen.'s Cox and Milroy were marching
                    from New Creek toward Martinsburg, Col. Imboden having previously reported the
                    rumor of Cox's withdrawal from the Kanawha Valley. Gen. Geary, I fear, is in
                    possession of Winchester, as on the evening of the 3d he was reported, with his
                    division, within 4 miles of that place. Cox's, Milroy's, and Geary's forces may
                    be intended to occupy the valley, and reconstruct the railroads in that section,
                    but I have thought it more probable that the greater portion were intended for
                    operations elsewhere. I have heard that, on the 30th ultimo, ten regiments from
                    Virginia had reached the Baltimore depot, in Washington, their destination
                    unknown. Should Gen. Cox have withdrawn from the Kanawha Valley, I should think
                    the State troops, under Gen. Floyd, could protect that country, and would
                    recommend that the Confederate troops be brought at once to Staunton, to operate
                    in the Shenandoah Valley, if necessary, or south of James River. I think the
                    strength of the enemy south of James River is greatly exaggerated, but have no
                    means of ascertaining the fact.</p>
<p>From the reports forwarded to me by Gen. G. W. Smith, the officers serving there
                    seem to be impressed with its magnitude. If I felt sure of our ability to resist
                    the advance of the enemy south of that river, it would relieve me of great
                    embarrassment, and I should feel better able to oppose the operations which may
                    be contemplated by Gen. Burnside. I presume that the operations in the
                    Department of the West and South will require all the troops in each, but,
                    should there be a lull of the war in these departments, it might be advantageous
                    to leave a sufficient covering force to conceal the movement, and draw an
                    active, when the exigency arrives, to the vicinity of Richmond. Provisions and
                    forage in the mean time could be collected in Richmond. When the crisis shall
                    have passed, these troops could be returned to their departments with
                    re-enforcements.</p>
<p>I need not state to you the advantages of a combination of our troops for a
                    battle, if it can be accomplished, and, unless it can be done, we must make up
                    our minds to fight with great odds against us.</p>
<p>I hope Your Excellency will cause me to be advised when, in your judgment, it may
                    become necessary for this army to move nearer Richmond. It was never in better
                    health or in better condition for battle than now. Some shoes, blankets, arms,
                    and accouterments are still wanting, but we are occasionally receiving small
                    supplies, and I hope all will be provided in time.</p>
<p>There was quite a fall of snow yesterday, which will produce some temporary
                    discomfort.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
