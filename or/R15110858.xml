                <p>J. H. Sherrard writes Roy Conrad on Confederate attempts to defend the Shenandoah
                    Valley in April, 1861. Sherrard expresses fear about a Union build-up of force
                    at Chambersburg, and discusses the state of Confederate forces defending
                    northern Virginia.</p>

                    <salute>MY DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>So tardy and irregular are our mails, even between this and Richmond, where, so
                    far as we know, there is no cause for it arising out of the general disturbed
                    condition of the country, that I have only just now received yours of the 27th.
                    My attention had been attracted, as yours has been to the suspicious assemblage
                    of a large and increasing military force at Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, which
                    is undoubtedly the very point of all others at which a hostile force designed
                    for operations in the Valley, or for the capture of Harper's Ferry, would most
                    probably be concentrated. The whole force at the latter point, rank and file, is
                    about 2,000. I had been under the impression until a day or two ago that it was
                    as much as 5,000; but the figures I give you are reliable unless the number has
                    been varied within the last two days. In general they are an uncommonly fine
                    body of volunteers, and the cavalry especially is of the best description; but
                    there is said to be a great deficiency in the quality of the arms, in the
                    quantity and quality of the artillery, and a deplorably inadequate supply of
                    ammunition. The presence there of Col. Jackson, who went on yesterday, will, it
                    is to be hoped, supply another deficiency which had been sorely felt. At this
                    place we have no military force except a fragment of the Continentals (about
                    thirty men). All the other volunteer companies of the town and country who have
                    arms are at Harper's Ferry, and the same may be said of the volunteers of the
                    neighboring counties, except those of Hampshire and Hardy, who are kept at home
                    by the want of ammunition, which they find it impossible to obtain in any
                    quarters. I had a letter yesterday from William A. Vance, of Romney, who
                    informed me that they had been writing to Richmond fort he preceding ten days
                    for arms and ammunition, and had not even received an answer to their letters,
                    and mentioned further that a good deal of uneasiness was felt for fear of a
                    rising of their negroes, of which he thought there were indications. So in Hardy
                    they have several volunteer companies, but no ammunition--literally none. Young
                    Alexander has been here for two or three days past to procure a supply, but as
                    none was to be had here he went to Harper's Ferry, in the hopes of obtaining it
                    there; but it was like going to the goat's house for wool, and he has now
                    written to Richmond. If there is a supply of powder in the State, it should
                    certainly be promptly distributed where it is so much needed. To meet the hosts
                    who are arming against us, we should at least be provided with articles so
                    indispensable necessary as powder and ball. We have not a piece of artillery
                    nearer Winchester than Harper's Ferry, and our own home guards are without arms
                    of any kind, except one in ten of us who may have a revolver, a musket, or a
                    rifle, and fifty well-armed men could capture the town as easily as old John
                    Brown captured Harper's Ferry. Angus W. McDonald, who has been at Harper's Ferry
                    since the day before the burning of the arsenal, has made himself exceedingly
                    useful there by employing himself very diligently in a close examination and
                    personal inspection of all the passes, highways, and byways leading to our
                    border from the enemy's country, and especially from the direction of
                    Chambersburg and Carlisle. In addition to this he has men in his employment who
                    are bringing him daily intelligence of what is passing at Chambersburg and along
                    that part of the Pennsylvania border, so that if his agents are reliable we
                    cannot be reached without notice.</p>
                <p>Parker, William, and Barton, according to your suggestion, have just left my
                    house, where we have been in conference for the last two hours, and we have
                    prepared a letter to Gen. Lee, which will inclose with this. You mentioned that
                    you will probably be at home to-morrow. I do not know whether I am to infer from
                    that you expect the convention to adjourn immediately. If so, neither you nor
                    Marshall will be in Richmond when this arrives there, and it has occurred tome,
                    therefore, as a best means of securing our object in that instance, to inclose
                    this with the letter to Gen. Lee, under care to Col. Munford, with a request
                    that in the absence of yourself and Marshall he will place the letter to Gen.
                    Lee in his hands at once. I write very hurriedly, as the postmaster is keeping
                    his office open for me past his hours to mail my letter.</p>
