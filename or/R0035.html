<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Col. Clement A. Evans commanded Lawton's brigade of the Army of Northern Virginia
                    which included the Staunton Artillery. In this report, Evans compliments his

<p></p>
<p>Maj. S. HALE, Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Ewell's
                        Division. </p>
<p>Near Port Royal, Va.</p>
<p>December 19, 1862</p>
<p>MAJ:</p>
<p>On the 13th instant, about 9 a.m., Lawton's brigade, Col. E. N. Atkinson
                    commanding, was formed in line of battle in a wood about three-fourths of a mile
                    west of the railroad, nearly opposite Hamilton's Crossing, below Fredericksburg,
                    Va., the right resting on the left of another brigade of Ewell's division, the
                    Thirteenth Georgia, Col. J. M. Smith commanding, being the extreme right, and
                    successively toward the left the Sixtieth Georgia, Col. W. H. Stiles;
                    Sixty-first Georgia, Col. J. H. Lamar; Thirty-eighth Georgia, Capt. William L.
                    McLeod; Thirty-first Georgia, Col. C. A. Evans, and the Twenty-sixth Georgia,
                    Capt. [B. F.] Grace, being six regiments, numbering about 2,000 rank and file.
                    While thus resting in line, the shells of the enemy fell upon the regiment on
                    the right, wounding several, but was borne without flinching by men who in many
                    engagements have proved themselves not deficient in courage or patriotism.</p>
<p>It is gratifying to me to be able to record that officers and men generally
                    behaved with a courage characteristic of the Southern soldier, continuing for
                    the brigade a well-deserved reputation. The report of casualties will testify
                    how severe the fire was through which these brave men passed in driving the
                    enemy before them.</p>
<p>The Staunton Artillery, commanded by Lieut. A. W. Garber [attached to this
                    brigade], at 4.30 o'clock was ordered to the extreme right of our lines, and was
                    actively engaged on the plain about two hours, when the batteries of the enemy
                    ceased firing. The officers and men behaved with coolness and gallantry. Lieut.
                    Garber had his horse shot under him during the engagement, but suffered no loss
                    of his men.</p>
<p> I am extremely gratified to mention that by the activity of Surg. George F.
                    Cooper, senior surgeon of the brigade, although with limited transportation, our
                    numerous wounded received prompt attention.[1]</p>
<p>
                    <sup>[1]</sup> Lieuts. Thomas B. Settle and Joel D. Wilson, Thirty-first<br>
                        Georgia, reported killed. 
                </p>
<p>I have the honor to be, major, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>C. A. EVANS, <br> Col., Cmdg. Brigade. </p>
