<p>Brevet Brig.-Gen. FORSYTH,<br> Chief of Staff, Middle
                        Military Division.</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 23, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In obedience to the instructions of the major-general commanding I submit the
                    following report of the recent expedition of this division up the Valley:</p>
<p>Late on the evening of the 18th instant I received instructions from the chief of
                    cavalry to move with my division up the Valley pike at an early hour on the
                    morning of the 19th. A copy of my orders have already been forwarded to you. My
                    command was supplied with three days' rations and forage for one day. At 7 a. m.
                    on the 19th my command left camp and moved to Newtown, when it followed the
                    pike. Upon arriving at Strasburg I learned that a force of about fifty of the
                    enemy had passed through Strasburg up the valley, having come from the direction
                    of Front Royal. When within about six miles of Woodstock two scouts of the enemy
                    were discovered in front of the advance. Several attempts were made to effect
                    their capture, but without success. They continued in sight of the column until
                    the command had reached Woodstock, when, my impression is, they conveyed the
                    intelligence of our approach to the force stationed near New Market, from which
                    point the report was forwarded by telegraph to Staunton and Waynesborough. In
                    Woodstock I learned there was no force of the enemy north of Staunton, except a
                    picket force of three companies, which were posted so as to watch the three
                    roads--pike, Middle and Back roads--the right of the line resting near Edenburg,
                    the left extending to Little North Mountain.</p>
<p>At daylight on the morning of the 20th my command moved from Woodstock; a small
                    force of the enemy continued to annoy my advance, but without causing any damage
                    to be inflicted. My instructions from the chief of cavalry were evidently
                    written under the impression that I would meet the enemy enforce at some point
                    south of New Market, if not sooner. This is inferred from the amount of supplies
                    ordered for my command by the chief of cavalry. From the information I derived
                    along the line of my first day's march, which was confirmed by the report of
                    scouts, that the enemy had retired all his forces beyond Staunton, I believed
                    that if the enemy permitted my command to reach Staunton without serious
                    opposition, I could, with reasonable hope of success, continue my movement to
                    Lynchburg, trusting to the supplies in the country beyond Staunton upon which to
                    subsist my command, and had it not been for the advantage the enemy derived from
                    his telegraphic communication with New Market my impressions would have proven
                    correct. As it was, Rosser, who, with his division, was camped between Staunton
                    (sic), was informed of my presence at Woodstock before 10 p. m. of the 19th,
                    and, as stated by prisoners, his command received orders at 1 a. m. of the 20th
                    to get easy to move. My command, after leaving Woodstock at daylight, moved
                    without serious molestation to Lacey's Springs, nine miles from Harrisonburg,
                    where I encamped during the night. The encampment was at the junction of the
                    road leading from the Keezletown road to the pike, and for the road from
                    Timberville to the pike. Pennington's brigade encamped in front, and on the left
                    of the pike, one regiment, the Third New Jersey, was posted one mile and a half
                    in advance on the pike to picket in the direction of Harrisonburg. Another
                    regiment of the same brigade, the First Connecticut, was sent out on the road
                    leading to the Keezletown road and picketed the country to the left of the pike.
                    The First New Hampshire, of general Chapman's brigade, was posted on the
                    Timberville road to picket in the direction of the latter point. One battalion
                    of the Fifteenth New York, about 200 strong, was ordered to its support. The
                    Eighth New York picketed the country in front and between the Timberville road
                    and the pike, while the two remaining battalions of the Fifteenth New York,
                    numbering upward of 400 men, were posted on the pike about one mile and a half
                    in rear of the camp of the division. It will thus be seen that of the nine
                    regiments composing my command five were on picket.</p>
<p>In the orders sent to brigade commanders, soon after reaching camp, reveille was
                    ordered at 4 o'clock and the command was to move promptly at 6.30, Chapman's
                    brigade taking the advance. In conformity with these instructions, Gen. Chapman
                    called in his pickets at the proper time and the Eighth New York, the regiment
                    farthest in advance in the direction of the Middle road, having formed in
                    columns of squadrons and mounted, had begun to move off by fours when a brigade
                    of the enemy (Payne's) which, under cover of the darkness and the withdrawal of
                    our pickets, had advanced to within a very short distance of the regiment,
                    charged in the direction of the camp-ground of the Second Brigade. The attack
                    was heard by the entire command, and although Pennington's brigade was the rear
                    in the order of march, it was at once mounted and placed in position receive the
                    enemy. The Eighth New York, although somewhat astounded by this attack, behaved
                    well under the circumstances and opened an effective fire upon the enemy. At the
                    same time an attack was made upon the First New Hampshire, which regiment was
                    mounted and had a line of skirmishers in advance. The enemy did not attempt to
                    engage either of the regiments with determination, but acted as if the intention
                    was to surprise a sleeping camp. Charging past the Eighth New York and First New
                    Hampshire, they moved at the top of their speed in the direction of the pike and
                    to our rear. Gen. Chapman had, at the first attack, moved the First Vermont and
                    Twenty-second New York from the left of the pike, and when the column of the
                    enemy advanced near enough attacked with the First Vermont. The enemy, after his
                    first attack upon the Eighth New York his only object was to get safely away. He
                    did not attempt to engage any of my troops, although by the cheering kept up by
                    my command be could early have determined their locality. One regiment, the
                    Sixth Virginia Cavalry, charged Pennington's brigade, but was met by one of his
                    regiments which was already advancing and repulsed, with little or no fighting,
                    in which Pennington suffered no loss, while the enemy suffered a loss of several
                    in killed, wounded, and missing. Ten of the enemy were left dead on the ground.
                    Chapman attacked the enemy wherever he could be found, and with one regiment,
                    the First Vermont, drove him over a mile in the direction from which the attack
                    had come. The division was in position to give or receive battle, and waited
                    until after daylight, but the enemy made no further demonstrations at that
                    point.</p>
<p>My loss in prisoners, although not officially reported to me yet, will not, I
                    think, reach twenty. I have thirty-two of the enemy taken in the fight. My loss
                    in wounded is twenty-two; most, if not all, are saber cuts, as the enemy had
                    orders to charge with the saber. As my men used the carbine alone, and at short
                    range, I am confident, from the number of dead left on the ground by the enemy,
                    and from the verbal reports of brigade and regimental commanders, that the
                    enemy's loss in wounded was more than treble my own. I do not think that more
                    then one or two of my command were killed.</p>
<p>From prisoners I learned that the enemy had left their camps, five miles beyond
                    Staunton, at 10 a. m. the day previous, marched until 10 p. m., then halted two
                    miles beyond Harrisonburg until 1 a. m., when the march was resumed in the
                    direction of New Market. At Harrisonburg Payne's brigade marched on the Middle
                    road; Rosser's old brigade and Wickham's moved on the Back road. Payne's brigade
                    attacked the Eighth New York and First New Hampshire immediately upon arriving
                    in front of them. The prisoners reported that the halt did not last over five
                    minutes, and that the enemy was under the impression that reveille had not been
                    sounded yet in my camp, and that by charging upon us the men would be asleep and
                    taken by surprise. Instead of this they found the command in the saddle, and
                    they became the surprised party. I do not think the entire loss of the enemy
                    will fall short of 100.</p>
<p>I was confident of my ability to defeat Rosser, although he had three brigades;
                    and although some of the prisoners stated that division of infantry was expected
                    to follow them, I knew that infantry could not march to that point from
                    Waynesborough in time to be of any assistance to Rosser, but I was influenced by
                    the following reasons: My command would exhaust their rations that night and no
                    opportunity would be afforded to procure any short of two days. Another and
                    stronger reason was my unprepared state to take charge of a large body of
                    wounded, particularly under the inclement state of the weather. In addition, I
                    was convinced that if it was decided to return, the sooner my return was
                    accomplished the better it would be for my command. Accordingly, my command
                    began the return march soon after daylight and reached their present encampment
                    yesterday p. m.</p>
<p>As the object of your communication yesterday seemed to be to obtain an
                    explanation as to "how it happened that" my "camp was charge by the enemy," I
                    have gone into the details of that affair more than I otherwise should,
                    particularly as my previous dispatches contained all the information which I
                    deemed of value or interest. I will forward a list of casualties as soon as
                    obtained from brigade commanders.</p>
<p>Respectfully, submitted.</p>
<p>G. P. CUSTER,<br> Brevet Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Third Division.</p>
