<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Henry Halleck reports to Grant that Confederate forces have been
                    sighted at Staunton in mid-June, 1864. Union forces had briefly occupied the
                    town, but withdrew as Union General David Hunter's advance ended.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> Bermuda Hundred, Va.:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>June 19, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Telegram from West Virginia state that the cavalry sent out with dispatches to
                    Gen. Hunter find the enemy in possession of Staunton and Lexington, in Hunter's
                    rear, and have returned without being able to reach him or ascertain his
                    whereabouts. I hardly think it possible that Gen. Stahel, who was sent back for
                    ammunition, can return to him, even if he knew where Hunter is. He, however,
                    will make the attempt, hopeless as it appears. If the enemy's force, as
                    reported, is superior to Hunter's his only escape will be into West Virginia, or
                    by crossing the James and reaching you on the south side. The latter is very
                    possible for cavalry, but extremely perilous for infantry. It is hardly possible
                    to get any communication to him from this side.</p>
