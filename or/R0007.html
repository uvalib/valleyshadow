<p>Capt. G. CAMPBELL BROWN, Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Third
                        Division. </p>
<p></p>
<p>August 2, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>I submit the following report of the operations of this brigade at or near
                    Malvern Hill on the 1st ultimo:</p>
<p>On that morning I was ordered by Gen. Lee to report to Maj.-Gen. Jackson for
                    temporary duty with one of the brigades of his command, and was by him assigned
                    to the command of the brigade lately commanded by Brig.-Gen. Elzey, in the
                    division of Maj.-Gen. Ewell. Of this brigade I assumed command about midday on
                    the road leading from White Oak Swamp to Willis' Church.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the same day the brigade, consisting of fragments of the
                    Thirteenth, Twenty-fifth, Thirty-first, Forty-fourth, Fifty-second, and
                    Fifty-eighth Virginia Regt.'s, and the Twelfth Georgia Regt., numbering in all
                    about 1,050 men present, was formed, by order of Gen. Ewell, in line of battle
                    in the woods on the left of the road leading from Willis' Chuch to Malvern Hill,
                    where it remained until very late in the afternoon during a heavy cannonading
                    between the enemy's artillery and our own, an occasional shell falling near the
                    brigade doing no damage however, except the killing by the same shot of a
                    private in the Forty-fourth Virginia Regt., and a young gentleman named Field,
                    who was a volunteer on the staff of Col. Walker, of the Thirteenth Virginia
                    Regt.</p>
<p>About sunset an order was received by Gen. Ewell, in my presence from Gen.
                    Jackson, through a staff officer, to send my brigade to the right to the support
                    of Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill and the brigade was immediately put in motion and
                    marched, under the guidance of an officer sent for the purpose, across the road
                    and through the woods, passing along the side of a ravine covered with trees and
                    thick undergrowth, until the head of it reached a small road leading across an
                    open bottom on a creek. Here the brigade was halted for a few minutes until the
                    guide could ascertain the route to be pursued, when it was again put in motion,
                    and as the head of it arrived in the open bottom, by the guide's direction the
                    brigade was started across the bottom, and Gen. Ewell and myself, with my staff
                    officers, were directed to cross by a detour to the right over an old dam, as
                    the only practicable way for horses. On arriving at the point where it was
                    expected to meet the head of the brigade nothing could be seen of it, a thick
                    brush-wood excluding it from view.</p>
<p>In the mean time a large number of men, retreating from the battle-field, began
                    to pass along the road into which we had then got, and filled the brush-wood
                    mentioned, producing great confusion and rendering in impossible for me to
                    ascertain whether the brigade was passing through this brush-wood. After many
                    fruitless efforts to ascertain this fact I rode toward the route over which the
                    brigade was started as far as I could, and found a very deep ditch filled with
                    skulkers from the battle-field, over which it was impossible for me to pass with
                    my horse. I then rode around to a point where I could get a view of the place at
                    which I separated from the brigade, and seeing none of it passing, I rode
                    forward on the road leading to the battle-field with the hope of finding the
                    brigade emerging from the woods farther on. It was then getting dark, and I
                    found the road filled with a large number of men retreating in confusion, being
                    mostly from Gen. Toombs' Georgia Brigade. These troops, aided by my assistant
                    adjutant-general, Capt. Gardner, I endeavored to rally, but found it very
                    difficult to do so.</p>
<p>During my exertions to rally these men the Twelfth Georgia Regt., of my own
                    brigade, came up, under the command of Capt. James G. Rodgers, and I marched it
                    off, accompanied by Col. Benning, with a few men from his regiment, of Toombs'
                    brigade. These men were formed in line by direction of Gen. Ewell, who had
                    preceded me with some men rallied by him in a field over which a considerable
                    body of our troops had charged in the early part of the engagement and in rear
                    of some regiments then engaged with the enemy. Here I was soon joined by the
                    Thirty-first and Twenty-fifth Virginia Regt.'s, which were brought up by my
                    aide, Capt. S. H. Early who had gone to the rear to look for the brigade. With
                    these regiments I remained on the field during the night in the position
                    designated by Gen. Ewell, Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill being present at the time they
                    were posted and for some time thereafter.</p>
<p>During the march the brigade was exposed to a terrific cannonading and shells
                    were constantly bursting over and around it. For some time the regiments, with
                    me on the field, which were ordered to lie down, were exposed to the fiercest
                    artillery fire that I have ever witnessed. About the close of this fire
                    Brig.-Gen. Ransom, with a portion of his command, retired to the rear past my
                    position, leaving none of our troops in front of me. A short time after the
                    cessation of the fire we heard very distinctly the rumbling of wheels,
                    indicating a movement of the enemy's artillery, and a large number of lights
                    were seen moving about over the field in immediate proximity to the enemy's
                    position, which were doubtless borne by persons from the enemy's lines in search
                    of their wounded.</p>
<p>As soon as it was light enough next morning an appalling spectacle was presented
                    to our view in front. The field from some distance from the enemy's position was
                    literally strewn with the dead and wounded, and arms were lying in every
                    direction. It was apparent that the enemy's main body with his artillery had
                    retired, but a body of his cavalry, supported by infantry, was soon discovered
                    on the field. To the right, near the top of a steep hill leading up toward the
                    enemy's position, we saw a body of our own troops, some distance off, lying
                    down, which proved to be a small body under Brig.-Gen.'s Mahone and Wright.</p>
<p>In the mean time parties of our men were going to the front in search of the
                    wounded, and after a demonstration by the enemy's cavalry, which was abandoned
                    on the firing of a few shots by the Maryland regiment posted in the woods some
                    distance to my left, the parties from both armies in search of the dead and
                    wounded gradually approached each other and continued their mournful work
                    without molestation on either side, being apparently appalled for the moment
                    into a cessation from all hostile purposes by the terrible spectacle presented
                    to their view.</p>
<p>About 10 a.m the last of the enemy's forces retired and left the field of battle
                    to our occupation. The other regiments of the brigade, which on the march were
                    in front of those who got with me on the field, not being able to find any
                    practicable way for marching over the route designated by the guide across the
                    bottom mentioned, in their effort to discover one reached the battle-field at a
                    different point from that at which I had arrived and got very near to the enemy;
                    but as it had become very dark, and amid the confusion it was impossible to
                    distinguish friend from foe, they retired, and went back that night to the
                    position at which the brigade was first drawn up in line of battle. This
                    separation of the brigade was caused by the impracticable character of the route
                    over which it was marched the confusion produced by the immense number of men
                    retiring in disorder from the field, and the attempt of the guide to send the
                    brigade over a nearer route than that taken by Gen. Ewell and myself. The men
                    with me did not get under a musketry fire, and were only exposed to the fire
                    from the enemy's artillery within the range for the round shot and shell.</p>
<p>I was favorably impressed with the deportment of the officers and men of the
                    brigade so far as it came under my own observation, and was particularly struck
                    with that of Capt. James G. Rodgers, in command of the Twelfth Georgia Regt.,
                    who led the regiment through a large body of disorganized men who were giving
                    the most disheartening accounts of the state of things in front, he all the time
                    encouraging his own men and endeavoring to induce the fugitives to fall into his
                    ranks and return to the battle-field.</p>
<p> Subjoined is a list of killed and wounded.[1]</p>
