<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Chief of Staff Henry Halleck writes General David Hunter to discuss efforts
                    to meet Confederate General Jubal Early's July, 1864, advance into Maryland and
                    southern Pennsylvania. Halleck mentions the size of the Confederate force that
                    entered Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HUNTER,<br> Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON,</p>
<p>July 30, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Emory's command, of 4,600 infantry, will leave by cars this afternoon and
                    evening for the Monocacy. His train, with small cavalry escort, will go by the
                    Frederick pike. Clendenin's cavalry has been ordered to scout toward Emmitsburg
                    and send back information. If the railroad can assist Wright's movement it
                    should be used. Averell's cavalry should give a more satisfactory account of the
                    enemy's movements. If the enemy's army crossed the Potomac yesterday morning, it
                    certainly should have been reported here earlier than this morning. The rebel
                    force that entered Chambersburg this morning does not seem to have been over
                    1,000. Nothing heard from there since.</p>

<p>H. W. HALLECK,<br> Maj.-Gen. and Chief of Staff.</p>
