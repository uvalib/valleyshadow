<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones writes General John Imboden, commanding at
                    Staunton, concerning Imboden's plans for a spring, 1863, raid into western
                    Virginia to destroy the Cheat River bridge. Jones reports sending a group of
                    engineers to report to Imboden at Staunton.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>March 20, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have ordered Lieut. Hart, of the Engineers, to proceed with 8 men and the
                    necessary tools and materials to Staunton,and report in person to you for
                    orders. I do this with the understanding that your expedition embraces that of
                    Capt. McNeill. If I am in error in this, I wish you would so inform me
                    immediately.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing from Gen. Lee in regard to the two regiments of his army
                    which you had asked for, or in reply to my suggestion as to how he could replace
                    those regiments by two others.</p>
<p>I hope you will get the troops you asked for, and that your expedition may be as
                    successful as you anticipate.</p>
<p>Please inform me when you expect to start.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
