<p><b>Summary:<br></b>John Brannon writes to support the innocence of Dr. Washington Hilleary, held at
                    Staunton in August, 1861, for allegedly aiding Union troops.</p>

<p>I have known Doctor Hilleary for several years. He has always been a true
                    Southern man, and I am greatly surprised that any suspicion of unsoundness
                    should have attached to him. Of course I know nothing of the charges against
                    him, but cannot from my knowledge of him suppose for a moment that he has been
                    guilty of any act inconsistent with his known devotion to the Southern cause or
                    in the least affecting his integrity as a man.</p>
