                <p>In May, 1864, Union General David Hunter advanced in the Shenandoah Valley in
                    conjunction with Grant's drive toward Richmond. In this letter, Grant writes
                    Henry Halleck to discuss plans for the Valley. He mentions the importance to
                    Lee's army of supplies arriving on the branch road from Staunton, and the
                    consequent need to capture that town.</p>

                <p>In regard to the operations is it better for Gen. Hunter to engage in, with the
                    disposable force at his command, I am a little in doubt. It is evident that he
                    can move south, covering the road he has to guard, with a larger force than he
                    can spare to be removed to re-enforce armies elsewhere. Then, too, under the
                    instructions of Gen. Sigel, Crook was to get through to the Virginia and
                    Tennessee Railroad, cut New River bridge, and move eastward to Lynchburg, if he
                    could; if not, to Fincastle, Staunton, and down the Shenandoah Valley. Sigel was
                    to collect what force he could spare from the railroad, and move up the valley
                    with a supply train to meet him. The enemy are evidently relying for supplies
                    greatly on such as are brought over the branch road running through Staunton. On
                    the whole, therefore, I think it would be better for Gen. Hunter to move in that
                    direction; reach Staunton and Gordonsville, or Charlottesville, if he does not
                    meet too much opposition. If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own, he
                    will be doing good service.</p>
                <p>In a letter to the Secretary of War, written about one week ago, I recommended
                    Gen.'s Sherman and Meade for promotion to major-generals in the Regular Army,
                    and Hancock for brigadier. I wish you would urge this again. The Secretary
                    replied that there was but one vacancy for major-general. I think this must be a
                    mistake. I was appointed before Gen. Wool was retired, or at least was notified
                    of the fact that an original vacancy existed before his retirement. Gen. Wright
                    is one of the most meritorious officers in the service, and with opportunity
                    will demonstrate his fitness for any position; but at present I doubt whether
                    Sheridan has not most entitled himself to the other vacant brigadier-generally.
                    This, however, I would leave open for a time.</p>
