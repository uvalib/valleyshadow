<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter, John C. Fremont, commanding Union forces in western Virginia in
                    June, 1862, requests reinforcements from President Lincoln. He proposes to take
                    Staunton, VA, and gain control of railroads in the Valley. He also refers to the
                    importance of the wheat crop in the Valley, and the advantage the Confederates
                    derive from the friendly populace.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President United States.</p>
<p>Mount Jackson,</p>
<p>June 15, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I respectfully remind the President that when assigned to this command I was
                    informed that I should have a corps of 35,000 men. I now ask from the President
                    the fulfillment of this understanding, and ask it only because, under the
                    conditions of the war here, I should be able to render good and immediate
                    service. Such a force would enable me to take Staunton, hold the railroad there,
                    go down through Lexington, seize the railroad between Lynchburg and Newbern, and
                    hold it for Gen. Banks' troops, or destroy it, according to circumstances.
                    Whether from Richmond or elsewhere, forces of the enemy are certainly coming
                    into this region, which the great wheat crop makes a granary for him, and which
                    he will not abandon without a struggle. Casualties have reduced my force to such
                    numbers in many of the regiments as 176, 250, 300, and so on. This makes me very
                    weak, and the small corps scattered about the country, not being within
                    supporting distance of each other, as the topography of the country will show,
                    are exposed to sudden attack by greatly superior force of an enemy, to whom
                    intimate knowledge of country and universal friendship of inhabitants give the
                    advantages of rapidity and secrecy of movements.</p>
<p>I respectfully submit this representation to the President, taking it for granted
                    that it is the duty of his generals to offer for his consideration such
                    impressions as are made by knowledge obtained in operations on the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p>J. C. FREMONT,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
