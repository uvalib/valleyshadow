                <p>The pursuit was resumed at 5.30 a.m. on the 8th, on the road to Lynchburg (by the
                    Cumberland Court-House and Appomattox Court-House stage road). Four pieces of
                    artillery were abandoned by the enemy on the route and fell into our hands. At
                    New Store the enemy's cavalry pickets were come up with. A halt was made of
                    about two hours at sunset, and the march resumed, with the object of coming up
                    with the main force of the enemy; but finding no probability of doing so during
                    the night, and the men being much exhausted form the want of food and from
                    fatigue, the head of the column was halted at midnight. The rear did not get up
                    until morning, and the supply train of two days' rations later. As soon as the
                    rations could be issued the troops moved forward again (at 8 a.m.), and at 11
                    a.m. came up with the enemy's skirmishers about three miles form Appomattox
                    Court-House, where they remained during the day under the flags of truce. At
                    about 4 p.m. it was announced that the Army of Northern Virginia had
                    capitulated.</p>
                <p>The captures of the Second Corps during the campaign were 35 guns, 16 flags, over
                    4,600 prisoners, and the capture or destruction of over 400 wagons and their
                    contents.</p>
                <p>Nothing could be finer than the spirit of the officers and men during all the
                    operations of this campaign.</p>
                <p>I beg leave to ask the attention of the commanding general to the services of
                    Brevet Maj.-Gen. Miles, whose division had the good fortune to be most
                    frequently and heavily engaged with the enemy; but it would be an injustice to
                    the other division commanders and their troops not to acknowledge the skill and
                    bravery and fine spirit which they, in common with the First Division and its
                    commander, exhibited throughout all the operations. For the prompt and
                    intelligent manner in which all orders were carried out my thanks are dire to
                    Brevet Maj.-Gen. Miles, Brevet Maj.-Gen. Mott, Brevet Maj. Gen. Barlow,
                    Brig.-Gen. De Trobriand, and Lieut.-Col. Hazard, commanding the Artillery
                    Brigade.</p>
                <p>To my staff--and especially to Lieut.-Col. Willian, Lieut.-Col. Whittier, Maj.
                    Livermore, Maj. Bingham (wounded on the 7th instant), and my aides-de-camp--I am
                    under many obligations for the active, zealous, and intelligent assistance they
                    gave me.</p>
                <p>Such brilliant successes have not been gained without severe loss, though
                    comparatively small in number. Among those who fell are fell are Brig.-Gen.
                    Smyth, in whom the service has lost a noble, gallant, and experienced soldier,
                    and Maj. Mills, an accomplished, courteous, and gallant staff officer.</p>
                <p>Among the wounded are Maj.-Gen. Mott and Brig.-Gen. madill, both severely, and
                    Brig.-Gen. MacDougall, Col. Starbird, Nineteenth Maine, dangerously wounded.</p>
                <p>For further details I beg leave to ask you attention to the reports of the
                    division and artillery commanders, which accompany this.</p>
                <p>I append hereto a statement of the number killed, wounded, and missing during the
                    campaign.</p>
