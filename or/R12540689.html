<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones writes General John Imboden, commanding at
                    Staunton, concerning preparations for a proposed spring, 1863, expedition into
                    West Virginia.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>March 27, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I returned last night from a visit to a part of my troops at Princeton, in Mercer
                    County, and received to-day your letter of the 24th instant.</p>
<p>The storm of last week has, I think, been very general throughout Virginia, and
                    will probably delay your expedition beyond the 1st of April. The high water and
                    condition of the roads will render it impracticable to move any of my men for
                    several days, and I presume you will find the same difficulties in your way.</p>
<p>The engineer officer whom I directed to report to you is now seriously ill with
                    fever. I have directed Capt. Poor, of the Engineers, to report to you with the
                    men and material for the expedition. Capt. Poor is in every way well qualified
                    for the service.</p>
<p>I will aid you at Beverly with a regiment of infantry, if the roads are in
                    condition to admit of it. I wish you would keep me informed of your movements,
                    and of any information you receive, as well of the condition and strength of the
                    enemy as of the roads and water-courses over which you will have to pass.</p>
<p>This will be delivered to you by Capt. Poor, whom I desire to introduce to you.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
