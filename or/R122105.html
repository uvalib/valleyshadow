<p><b>Summary:<br></b>E. D. Townsend writes from Chambersburg to Union Colonel C. P. Stone regarding
                    the first tentative advances against the Confederacy in June, 1861.</p>

<p>Col. C.P. STONE, U.S. Army, Commanding, &amp;c.,
                        Rockville, Md.:</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERS,</p>
<p>June 11, 1861</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>The following is a copy of a dispatch received this afternoon from Gen.
                    Patterson, which is communicated for your guidance:<br> CHAMBERSBURG, June 11,
                    1861.</p>
<p>Col. Wallace (regiment of volunteers from Evansville, Ind.) yesterday peaceably
                    occupied Cumberland, and acts on my instructions of the 6th instant. He will
                    call to-day on small parties of secession militia in his vicinity. I advance on
                    Friday, the earliest day.</p>
<p>Maj. Porter, A.A.G., in a note says the general will not receive all his
                    transportation before Monday, the 17th instant. The Gen.-in-Chief thinks you are
                    a day or two in advance of Gen. Patterson's movement, taking the above date in
                    connection with the rise in the river, and he suggests that you time your
                    advance accordingly.</p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>E.D. TOWNSEND.</p>
