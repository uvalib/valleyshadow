<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Staunton, VA, served as a rendezvous point for Confederate troops during July,
                    1861, campaigning in western Virginia. In this letter, Michael G. Harman,
                    quartermaster at Staunton, informs General Lee of the locations of various
                    regiments.</p>

<p> Maj. Gen. R. E. LEE:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>July 23, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch received. The Twelfth Georgia Regiment Col. Johnson, is on top the
                    Alleghany Mountains near Yager's; the First (should read Sixth. Correction from
                    General Index.) North Carolina Regiment has been ordered to Elk Mountain;
                    Forty-fourth North Carolina Regiment (should read North Carolina Regiment), Col.
                    Lee. Virginia Regiment, Col. Scott, is at Monterey; Twenty-third Virginia
                    Regiment, Col. Taliaferro, is at McDowells, for recruits; First Georgia
                    Regiment, Col. Ramsey, is at McDowells', to recruit; Maj. Jones, with five iron
                    pieces of artillery, is with the Twelfth Georgia Regiment; Capt. Shumaker's
                    battery, with two companies of the Twentieth Regiment, Capts. Jones and Bruce,
                    is at Monterey; six remnants of companies of the Twentieth Regiment have been
                    ordered to general headquarters, and are on the march of Staunton. This was the
                    position of the army yesterday at 4 p.m., when Maj. Tyler left Monterey. I would
                    suggest that our forces are now so much scattered that the three Tennessee
                    regiments be sent to Monterey. If you desire to re-enforce Elk Mountain, it
                    could be done from Monterey, or be used to oppose the advance from Cheat
                    Mountain, if this should be attempted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Commanding.</p>
