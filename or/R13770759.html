<div id="mainResults">
<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union forces briefly occupied Staunton, VA, in early June, 1864. In this letter,
                    Confederate Reserve Colonel Kenton Harper reports that after the Federal
                    departure, Staunton's slaves began acting badly. He suggests sending troops to
                    the town to aid and protect the citizens.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,<br> Cmdg. Forces in the
                        Valley District:</p>
<p>ON THE MARCH,</p>
<p>June 12, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have information from Staunton that the slaves in the town and its vicinity
                    have been greatly demoralized, and are acting quite as badly as the enemy did
                    while occupying the place. I would respectfully suggest, therefore, that a small
                    force be sent there to aid the citizens left behind who were deprived of their
                    arms by the enemy. Capt. Noes with his guard would be quite sufficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KENTON HARPER,<br>
                        Col. Reserve.</p>
