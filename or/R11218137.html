<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During the first week of May, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson
                    prepared a surprise attack on Union troops at McDowell, Virginia. In this
                    letter, Union General Robert Milroy, commanding at McDowell, reports on
                    Jackson's movements and speculates as to his intent. He promises to report from
                    Staunton to commanding officer, General John C. Fremont, within 48 hours.</p>

<p>Gen. FREMONT:</p>
<p>McDOWELL,</p>
<p>May 6, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your dispatch of 4th instant received. I believe Jackson's movement to be a feint
                    for relief of Johnson. He cannot move from Port Republic toward my advanced
                    position without leaving Banks in his rear, which, the former experience, he
                    will not do, and the latter would have the opportunity to attack him in the rear
                    as he moves in this direction. I shall not retire beyond this point, but in case
                    of an attack by a superior force will await re-enforcements-Schenck's and
                    Blenker's force. I cannot give up the country now in our possession. Why cannot
                    they move up rapidly, and then push on vigorously together and clear the
                    department before the May days are over? I may, in case of threatened attack,
                    move on some 7 miles to Shaw's Ridge and make a stand there, if permission is
                    granted. I will try and report to you from Staunton within forty-eight hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MILROY.</p>
