<p>Received, War Department, 1 p. m.<br> Hon. E. M.
                        Stanton,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 4, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Judge Kimmell, who remained at Chambersburg, came from there yesterday. He states
                    that Lee has concentrated all his force, amounting to not over 75,000, 12,000 of
                    which is cavalry; 200 pieces of artillery of all calibers, 40 siege, 60
                    Napoleons; the rest different calibers, including rifled guns; wagons, about
                    3,000. Depot of supplies at the base of the mountains in the Cumberland Valley.
                    There is a belief in the rebel army that Beauregard, with 40,000 men, is in the
                    vicinity of Manassas.</p>
<p>The available force here pushed forward to join Gen. Smith on his march from
                    Carlisle. Col. Pierce, from Bedford County, is at Loudon. We are cheered to hear
                    how splendidly Gen. Meade is doing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>L. THOMAS,<br> Adjutant-Gen.</p>
