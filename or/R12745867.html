<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June, 1863, General Isaac Trimble traveled to Staunton to take command of
                    Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley. In this letter, Lee writes Trimble,
                    advising him of present orders and locations of cavalry units in the Valley.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble,<br> Comdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 7, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have directed Gen. Imboden to leave a guard at Shenandoah Mountain, and move
                    with the rest of his effective force upon Romney. I have also directed Gen. A.
                    G. Jenkins to concentrate his command near Strasburg or Front Royal, or any more
                    convenient point in advance of either. Gen. Jenkins will receive subsequent
                    orders as regards his operations in the Valley. Not knowing whether you have yet
                    reached Staunton, I have sent these orders direct to those officers, but should
                    you have assumed command of the Valley District, I beg you to facilitate their
                    execution.</p>
<p>I have sent no special directions concerning the Maryland troops in the Valley,
                    but if they can be serviceable with Gen. Jenkins, they had better operate with
                    him, or, at least, be so disposed as to guard the approaches up the Valley while
                    Gen. Jenkins is operating below. Should you have entered upon your duties in the
                    Valley, and your health be sufficiently restored, you are, of course, at liberty
                    to accompany the troops, and take part in their operations.</p>
<p>Most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
