<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Phillip Sheridan reports to Henry Halleck in October, 1864, on operations
                    in the Shenandoah Valley. Sheridan discusses raids on Staunton, and supplies
                    destroyed near the town. He also estimates the extent and importance of the
                    damage done to the Confederate cause, and mentions prominent Valley farmers
                    moving north to escape the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG, VA.,</p>
<p>October 1, 1864--6 p. m.<br> (Received 7 a. m. 3d.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your telegram of the 28th received. My cavalry was rapidly pushed to Staunton and
                    Waynesborough, some of the results of which I have telegraphed. All the crops,
                    mills, &amp;c., have been destroyed from Staunton to Mount Crawford, which
                    is my present front. I will make another raid with cavalry and infantry to
                    Staunton and Lexington. Early was driven out of the Valley, and only saved
                    himself by getting through Brown's Gap in the night, and has probably taken
                    position at Charlottesville, and will fortify, holding Waynesborough and
                    Rockfish Gap. I strongly advise Gen. Grant to terminate this campaign by the
                    destruction of the crops in the Valley and the means of planting, and the
                    transfer of the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps to his army at Richmond. This is my
                    best judgment. With Crook's force, the Valley can be held. If this course is not
                    deemed best, then the Orange and Alexandria Railroad should be opened. If it is,
                    it will require an army corps at least to protect it. This force cannot be
                    furnished from this army; and wherever these troops come from, it will be loss
                    of that number of men from the fighting force. There is no objective point,
                    except Lynchburg, and it cannot be invested on the line of this Valley, and the
                    investing army supplied. What we have destroyed and can destroy in this Valley
                    in worth millions of dollar to the rebel Government. A large number of the best
                    farmers of the Valley are moving north, taking advantage of our presence to get
                    out. If it is deemed best to transfer this army to the east side of the Blue
                    Ridge, the repairs on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad should be commenced at
                    once, and a notification sent to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
