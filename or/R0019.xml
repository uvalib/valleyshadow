                <p>I have the honor to submit the report of operations of my division from the 17th
                    of August, when directed by you to retire to the east side of Cedar Mountain, to
                    this date:</p>
                <p>At sunrise on the 30th, I was ordered by you to send two brigades to report to
                    Gen. Kearny, and conducted the First Brigade, Gen. Duryea; Fourth Brigade, Col.
                    Thoburn, which relieved a portion of Gen. Kearny's division. Gen. Duryea's
                    brigade advanced in the woods, driving the enemy along the line of the old
                    railroad excavation until directly under their guns, the Fourth Brigade a little
                    retired on his right. While occupying this ground Gen. Duryea was subjected to a
                    heavy fire of artillery and infantry, in which he received a slight wound and
                    severe contusion from a shell, but remained at his post animating his men, who
                    behaved admirably. It was in this heavy fire that my aide, Capt. Fisher, while
                    with his usual zeal, acting under orders, had his horse shot under him, and was
                    taken prisoner. The Second and Third Brigades, under Gen. Tower, with the four
                    batteries, occupied our left.</p>
                <p>While thus disposed I received the order to "Forward my division" from the right
                    on the road leading from Sudley Springs to New Market and follow along that road
                    "in pursuit of the enemy." I gave this order, and reported to Gen. Heintzelman
                    as directed, when informed that the enemy following up the already advanced
                    brigade, and confident that they had no intention of retiring, so reported
                    personally to you, and was then directed to abandon pursuit and resume my first
                    position, where the brigades were soon exposed to a galling cross-fire.</p>
                <p>Gen. Tower commanding Second and Third Brigades, was detached to the extreme left
                    with Hall's and Leppien's Maine batteries. This portion of the division most
                    gallantly endeavored to maintain their position, suffering severely, until Gen.
                    Tower fell seriously wounded, and the loss of officers and men was very great.</p>
                <p>The engagement now became general from right to left. I moved Thompson's battery
                    to the extreme right of the line to dislodge the enemy, but was outnumbered in
                    guns, and withdrew it to unite with Matthews' battery on the right of Stevens'
                    division, to aid in checking the enemy's advance, which was now pushed along the
                    front. Their loss in men and horses entirely disabled these batteries, and in
                    connection with the casualties among the commanding officers, compelled the
                    division to retire toward night, making a desperate stand at Mrs. Carter's
                    house, used for a hospital, which proved unavailing against the superior force.</p>
                <p>On the 31st we remained at Centreville, supplying the exhausted division. The
                    Fourth Brigade was here detached, and the commanding officer, Col. Thoburn,
                    being wounded, I have been unable to obtain his report, but respectfully submit
                    the casualties in the First Second, and Third Brigades.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of September we took up position on the Aldie road, acting in
                    conjunction with Gen. Reno's division, and held this point until the 2nd
                    September, when, in compliance with orders, we fell back to Hall's Hill, near
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>In recapitulating the services of the brigade commanders I would make particular
                    mention of Brig.-Gen. Duryea, commanding First Brigade, for his noble conduct at
                    Thoroughfare Gap and his indomitable courage displayed at Bull Run while holding
                    a trying position.</p>
                <p>I desire to express my especial obligations to Brig.-Gen. Tower, commanding
                    Second Brigade, for his indefatigable zeal and valuable services on all
                    occasions, particularly at Thoroughfare Gap and at Bull Run, where he was
                    detached with two brigades and their batteries, and highly distinguished
                    himself. I commend the conduct of Col. Root, Ninety-fourth Regiment New York
                    Volunteers, who, although painfully wounded at Bull Run, continued on duty.</p>
                <p>The Third Brigade, although early deprived of their efficient commander,
                    Brig.-Gen. Hartsuff, behaved admirably. I particularly noticed Col. Coulter,
                    Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment bore the brunt of the
                    engagement at Thoroughfare Gap.</p>
                <p>Col. Thoburn, First Virginia, commanding Fourth Brigade, deserves high
                    commendation for his valuable services. Capts. Matthews' and Thompson's
                    Pennsylvania batteries and Capts. Leppien's and Hall's Maine batteries deserve
                    to be mentioned not only for their uniform attention to their duties, but for
                    their efficiency throughout the 30th August. My thanks are due to the officers
                    of my staff, Capt. John W. Williams, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. W.
                    Fisher, aide-de-camp, and Capt. B.W. Richards, aide-de-camp, who severally
                    exhibited a high degree of efficiency and personal bravery.</p>
                <p>Surg. N.R. Moseley, medical director, was untiring in his exertions and care of
                    the wounded.</p>
                <p>Maj. William Painter showed remarkable zeal and energy; also Acting Ordnance
                    Officer Lieut. M.S. Smith, Thirteenth Massachusetts Volunteers.</p>
                <closer>
