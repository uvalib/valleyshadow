<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During the summer of 1864, Confederate forces under General Jubal Early raided

                    dispatch, Union General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the
                    Susquehanna, reports on the campaign, including the burning of Chambersburg. He
                    describes the approach of Confederate forces, a skirmish for Chambersburg, the
                    occupation of the town, the ransom demanded of principle citizens by the

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>August 8, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that on the 27th ultimo, Brig.-Gen. Averell, of the
                    Department of West Virginia, with his force lay at Hagerstown, Md., covering the
                    several fords of the Potomac in that vicinity. At his request I sent him my
                    mounted men, orders and within the department Lieut. H. T. McLean's party of
                    forty cavalry from Carlisle Barracks, that covered the roads leading toward
                    Mercersburg, and Capt. R. M. Evans' company of Independent Philadelphia Scouts,
                    an unpaid force that watched in the vicinity of Emmitsburg. At Chambersburg
                    there was part of an infantry company, under Capt. T. S. McGowan, and a piece of
                    field artillery.</p>
<p>On the 28th six companies of 100-days' infantry that were called to Chambersburg
                    were directed by orders to be sent to Hagerstown, where they arrived on the
                    morning of the 29th. After midday of this date Gen. Averell fell back to
                    Greencastle, where I had previously detached fifteen men and an officer from
                    Lieut. H. T. McLean's party. This latter officer had pickets near McCoy's Ferry,
                    which were driven, about 3 p. m., back to Mercersburg. The enemy's advance, 200
                    men, charged through the town, forced the small party to fall back after a
                    severe skirmish. Dark coming on, a picket was left at Bridgeport, while Lieut.
                    H. T. McLean fell back to Saint Thomas, seven miles from Chambersburg, on the
                    Pittsburg pike. In course of the day and evening all of the horses in the
                    Valley, amounting to several thousand, were moved north by order, and the trains
                    of Gen. Averell, with those at Hagerstown, refugees, &amp;c., came through
                    and encamped near Chambersburg. I notified Gen. Averell that I had no force to
                    protect them. That officer was duly notified of Lieut. H. T. McLean's movements
                    as well as that I had no force to protect his trains.</p>
<p>The following dispatch was sent:</p>
<p>HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,<br> Chambersburg, July 29, 1864--10.15 p.
                    m.<br> Gen. W. W. AVERELL,<br> Greencastle:</p>
<p>Lieut. McLean was driven out of Mercersburg by about 200 of the enemy. A force of
                    about 400 and two artillery afterward came up.<br> D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
<p>At 12.30 a. m. July 30 a dispatch from Lieut. H. T. McLean was received that his
                    pickets at Bridgeport had been driven in. I immediately notified Gen. Averell as
                    follows:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, July 30, 1864.<br> Brig. Gen. W. W. AVERELL,<br> Greencastle:</p>
<p>Lieut. McLean's pickets have been driven in at Bridgeport, on the road leading
                    from Mercersburg to Saint Thomas. The force moving via Mercersburg has at least
                    two pieces of artillery.<br> D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
<p>At 2 a. m. a verbal message from Lieut. H. T. McLean informed me that he was
                    being pressed in from Saint Thomas.</p>
<p>The following dispatch by telegraph was sent:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, July 30, 1864--2 a. m.<br> Gen. W. W. AVERELL,<br> Greencastle:</p>
<p>My force, Lieut. McLean, is being driven in from Saint Thomas, and falling back
                    upon Chambersburg.<br> D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
<p>At 1 a. m. Maj. John S. Schultze, assistant adjutant-general, gave orders to
                    Capt. Brown, quartermaster in charge of the train above mentioned, to move via
                    Shippensburg north. At 3 a. m. the enemy was near the town and I directed Maj.
                    John S. Schultze to so notify Gen. Averell and ask him what he intended to do.
                    No replies had been received from that officer, and he subsequently informed me
                    that he did not receive my dispatches of the enemy's advancing until 3.45 a. m.
                    Upon finding the enemy so near, in order to save the trains, including those of
                    the railroad, as well as to give warning to Gen. Averell, one piece of artillery
                    was directed to take position on the Pittsburg pike, a mile from town, covered
                    by the infantry, about thirty-five men, and the cavalry, twenty-four men, which
                    was my whole strength, excepting one gun, ordered to cover the rear of the
                    trains, then not all on the road. The gun that was on the pike opened on the
                    enemy about 3.30 a. m. Maj. C. H. Meneely, commissary of musters, was present to
                    carry out my instructions. I respectfully call attention to the report of Lieut.
                    H. T. McLean, commanding officer, inclosed.</p>
<p>The enemy were held in check about two hours, my people slowly retiring through
                    the town, being careful not to fire a shot within its limits, in order that
                    there should be no excuse for firing buildings or committing any barbarities
                    upon the people. The enemy, consisting of Brig.-Gen. McCausland's brigade of
                    five regiments, and four pieces of artillery, and Brig. Gen. B. T. Johnson's
                    brigade of two regiments, four battalions, with two pieces of artillery,
                    numbering 2,600 in all, formed line of battle on the fair grounds, men
                    dismounted, and after firing two or three cannon shots into the town, entered
                    the same at about 5.30 a. m. with from 400 to 500 mounted and dismounted men. It
                    is certain that both McCausland and Johnson were present.</p>
<p>The chief burgess being absent, some of the principal citizens were arrested by
                    Maj. Gilmor and notified that by order of Maj.-Gen. Early $100,000 in gold or
                    $500,000 in currency was required to ransom the town. He was told by these
                    gentlemen that there was not probably $50,000 in currency at hand; to with he
                    replied that "The town must be burnt." Details were made and placed under charge
                    of officers and fires kindled, it is said, almost simultaneously in fifty
                    different places. In some instances the first warning to occupants of buildings
                    came from the fire and smoke beneath them, thus barely escaping with their
                    lives. Some of the officers and men refused, or were persuaded not to carry out
                    their barbarous orders, and assisted people in fleeing from the flames, but
                    generally an inhuman and savage ferocity characterized their actions. The
                    sufferers, with few exceptions, only saved the clothing on their persons. Thus
                    was consummated this premeditated deed of barbarity. At about 11 a. m. enemy
                    drew in their pickets, and a little later their pillaging and burning parties
                    retired toward McConnellsburg; Gen. Averell entered three hours after from the
                    direction of Fayetteville.</p>
<p>A lieutenant from Georgia, attached to a Virginia regiment, who deserted to our
                    lines, states that it was understood by their troops that all building were to
                    be burned from the moment Pennsylvania soil was touched.</p>
<p>Accompanying I invite attention to a telegram to Gen. Averell, with his reply,
                    also a statement made by an intelligent sergeant on duty at these headquarters,
                    who was in Chambersburg during the rebel occupation, and part of time a
                    prisoner.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Department.</p>
