<p>October 4, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I. The necessity of the service requires an immediate reorganization of the
                    artillery of this army. The combination of the companies hereafter named is to
                    be considered temporary and subject to the order of the Secretary of War. Their
                    selection has been made entirely with a view of the efficiency of the artillery,
                    and implies no blame or degradation to the batteries thus combined. Many of the
                    batteries have served with distinction, and their enfeebled condition is
                    attributable to the dangers and hardships they have encountered. Whenever
                    circumstances will permit, the batteries will again be restored.</p>
<p>II. Col. Walton, of the Louisiana Washington Artillery, will retain one section
                    of Capt. Miller's battery, with the best guns and horses of that company, and
                    turn over the rejected guns, horses, &amp;c., to the proper departments. The
                    me of Capt. Leake's battery and those of Capt. Anderson's are relieved from duty
                    with the Louisiana Washington Artillery, and will be at once returned to their
                    proper companies.</p>
<p>III. The ten companies of the First Regt. Virginia Artillery, Col. Brown, will be
                    formed into six. The officers of the batteries of Capt.'s Wyatt, Coke, and
                    Ritter--except First Lieut. Thurmond, of Wyatt's; First Lieut. Robertson, of
                    Ritter's; First Lieut. Pendleton and Second Lieut. Hawes, of Coke's
                    batteries--are relived from duty with their companies, and the men of those
                    batteries will be distributed by Col. Brown among the retained companies. Capt.
                    Young's company, originally belonging to the infantry, will be returned to that
                    arm of the service if it is preferred. Should they wish to continue in the
                    artillery, the officers will be relieved from duty and the men distributed by
                    Col. Brown among the retained companies of his regiment.</p>

                    retained companies. Capt. Peyton is relieved from duty with his company, and
                    First Lieut. Fry will assume command of it. Lieut. W. A. Deas is assigned to
