<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Grant forwards General Halleck a September, 1864, newspaper article
                    announcing the entrance of Union cavalry into Staunton, and their burning of
                    railroad tracks to that town.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>CITY POINT, VA.,</p>
<p>September 28, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Richmond Whig of this morning contains the following:</p>
<p>CHARLOTTESVILLE, September 28, 1864.<br> The fight near Port Republic on Monday
                    was an engagement between our cavalry and that of the enemy. They came over the
                    river, and were driven back three miles by our cavalry to and across the river.
                    The enemy's cavalry entered Staunton about 8 p. m. on Monday. A force appeared
                    at Waynesborough about 9 o'clock this morning, and then went back about one mile
                    from two. No damage has been done up to 4 p. m. The smoke seen indicates that
                    they are burning the railroad track between Christian's Creek and Staunton.
                    There has been no serious fighting up to 4 o'clock this evening.</p>
<p>This dispatch should probably have been dated the 27th, but I give it as given in
                    the Richmond paper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>U. S. GRANT,<br> Lieut.-Gen.</p>
