                <p>Union Colonel and Chief of Secret Police R. A. Crawford reports on intelligence
                    gathered from a Confederate soldier who deserted while stationed near Staunton,
                    VA, in January, 1864. The soldier gives Crawford information on troop positions,
                    and the likelihood of mass desertion from the Confederate ranks.</p>

                <p>Willis White, a sergeant from the First Tennessee Infantry, commanded by Col.
                    Turney, stationed near Staunton, Va., deserted and came in this morning.</p>
                <p>Reports that he left Staunton, Va., on the 10th of January on furlough to come to
                    Tennessee; that he saw no troops on the road at any point until he came to
                    Russellville and Morristown, which points he reached on the 25th ultimo. At
                    these places the most of Longstreet's infantry were encamped. On the day of the
                    fight above Sevierville the most of the infantry and artillery went to Dandrige,
                    crossed the French Broad River, and marched toward Sevierville, but returned the
                    next day, recrossed the river, and camped near Dandridge. Gen. Longstreet came
                    over to Dandridge on last Monday and returned to Morristown.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday morning, the 3d instant, when he (the deserter) left Dandridge, the
                    infantry were preparing to return to Morristown. The most of the cavalry were
                    said to be in the neighborhood of Sevierville.</p>
                <p>On last Sunday he says he met in the evening above Dandridge Gen. Ransom's
                    division going toward the railroad station. One of the captains and several of
                    the men told him that they were going to take the cars and were going to Mobile,
                    Ala. The men were hallowing and seemed delighted. They said they would march all
                    night. He states that provisions are quite scarce at Morristown; that he saw
                    over 300 men entirely barefoot and badly clad; Bushrod Johnson's command is
                    daily deserting; that there is great dissatisfaction amongst the soldiers. He
                    says it was the desire of the officers and men to remain at their quarters until
                    spring, but they were in constant dread of being flanked by the Federal army. He
                    says the men will desert by hundreds just as soon as the leaves come out. No
                    fortifications at Morristown or Russellville. Rebels have comfortable cabins.
                    They were in constant dread of being cut off from Virginia. I examined him
                    closely; he seems to be rather an intelligent man. Says he has been in army
                    nearly two years; lives in Lincoln County, Tenn.; had two brothers in the
                    Forty-fourth Tennessee, under Bushrod Johnson, who deserted shortly after they
                    went to Morristown.</p>
