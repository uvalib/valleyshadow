<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Adjutant General Samuel Cooper writes General Joseph E. Johnston
                    concerning the movement of troops to northern Virginia in November, 1861. Cooper
                    mentions troops moving through Staunton to Manassas.</p>

<p>Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,<br> Cmdg. Department of
                        Northern Virginia, Centerville:</p>
<p>RICHMOND,</p>
<p>November 19, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Your communications of the 14th, 15th, and 16th instant were duly received and
                    submitted to the Secretary of War and to such department of the staff to which
                    they related, with instructions. Your inquiries respecting unarmed regiments
                    sent from this city to Manassas and Evansport have been answered by telegraph.</p>
<p>The regiments as they arrive at Staunton from Gen. Loring's command will be
                    pushed forward to Manassas, but it is proper to state that by a letter received
                    to-day from Gen. Loring it is apprehended that the force that quarter will be
                    considerably reduced, as he remarks that his position immediately in front of
                    the enemy cannot be weakened by the withdrawal of his troops at present.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.</p>
