<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Wheat from the Shenendoah Valley played a vital role in feeding the Confederate

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 19, 1863.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>I go down this morning to examine the preparations which the enemy seem to be
                    making on the banks of the Rappahannock. I understand that a redoubt has been
                    built on the hill overlooking the river, where their causeway has been
                    constructed. Since my arrival, I have learned nothing more of the designs of the
                    enemy than what had been previously received, except the inclosed notes from two
                    of our scouts, on their right and left flank.</p>
<p>Everything combined seems to indicate a movement, and I believe that their army,
                    instead of being diminished by detachments to North Carolina, has been
                    re-enforced since the battle of the 13th December. I therefore have suspended
                    the march of the brigades ordered to North Carolina, until I can ascertained
                    something more difficulty. If, in your opinion, the necessity there is more
                    urgent than here, I will dispatch them immediately; they are ready for the
                    march.</p>
<p>I have directed the chief quartermaster of this army to take 50 wagons belonging
                    to its transportation, and apply them exclusively to convey the wheat that may
                    be purchased by the agents of the Commissary Department, at Richmond, in the
                    counties lying between the Rappahannock and Pamunkey, to the Central Railroad at
                    Hanover Court-House. I think this a more convenient point than any on the
                    Fredericksburg Railroad, and one from which transportation to Richmond can be
                    more readily obtained.</p>
<p>I would suggest that the Quartermaster-Gen., in Richmond, collect all the wagons
                    that can be spared from the posts at Gordonsville, Charlottesville, Staunton,
                    Lynchburg, Richmond,&amp;c., which may probably amount to 50, and apply them
                    to the transportation of the wheat in Greene, Madison, and Culpeper
                    Counties,&amp;c., to the railroad, for conveyance to Richmond. Our
                    necessities make it imperative that every exertion be made to supply the army
                    with bread. As the Commissary Department purposes to issue sugar to the army in
                    lieu of part of its meat ration, it has occurred to me that if its supply will
                    warrant it, that by offering to exchange sugar for salt meat in the counties
                    where grain is being collected, many persons might be tempted to part with bacon
                    now retained for their own use. A few thousand pounds even, collected in this
                    way, would be of assistance to the army.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
