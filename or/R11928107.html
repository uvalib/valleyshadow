<p>Gen. R. B. MARCY.</p>
<p>PURCELLVILLE,</p>
<p>October 28, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two young men have been brought in by my pickets, who say they left Martinsburg
                    last Thursday, and passed through Winchester; that all the rebel army was at
                    Martinsburg, except Jackson, Longstreet, and Hill, who were at Winchester; that
                    at Winchester they saw 2,500 men with small-pox, who were to be sent to
                    Staunton; Stuart's two brigades of cavalry were at Berryville, between
                    Winchester and Charlestown; that yesterday morning Walker's brigade was at
                    Upperville; that this brigade had been picked from the whole rebel army. At
                    Snickersville they saw one company of Second Virginia Cavalry and one piece of
                    artillery, Shall send them, with other prisoners, to headquarters, to be
                    examined.</p>
<p>My scouts captured a rebel signal-sergeant this afternoon, near the mountain.</p>
<p>A Union man told me to-day that Longstreet was at Upperville, and occupied Paris,
                    Bloomfield, and Middleburg.</p>
<p>My people are not yet in from Aldie. A part of Stoneman's force is at Leesburg.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>A. PLEASONTON,<br> Brig.-Gen., &amp;c.</p>
