<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee sends Jeb Stuart orders for an October, 1862, cavalry raid into

                    holding state or government office, anyone aiding the Union army, and any horses

<p>Maj. Gen. J. E. B. STUART,<br> Cmdg. Cavalry,
                        &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Camp near Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p>October 8, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>An expedition into Maryland with a detachment of cavalry, if it can be
                    successfully executed, is this time desirable. You will, therefore, form a
                    detachment of from 1,200 to 1,500 well-mounted men, suitable for such an
                    expedition, and, should the information from your scouts lead you to suppose
                    that your movement can be concealed from bodies of the enemy that would be able
                    to resist it, you are desired to cross the Potomac above Williamsport, leave
                    Hagerstown and Green castle on your right, and proceed to the rear of
                    Chambersburg and endeavor to destroy the railroad bridge over the branch of the
                    Conococheague. Any other damage that you can inflict upon the enemy or his means
                    of transportation you will also execute. You are desired to gain all information
                    of the position, force, and probable intention of the enemy which you can, and
                    in your progress into Pennsylvania you will take measures to inform yourself of
                    the various routes that you may take on your return to Virginia.</p>
<p>To keep your movement secret, it will be necessary for you to arrest all citizens
                    that may give information to the enemy, and should you meet with citizens of
                    Pennsylvania holding State or Government offices, it will be desirable, if
                    convenient, to bring them with you, that they may be used as hostages, or the
                    means of exchanges, for our own citizens that have been carried off by the
                    enemy. Such persons will, of course, be treated with all the respect and
                    consideration that circumstances will admit. Should it be in your power to
                    supply yourself with horses or other necessary articles on the list of legal
                    captures, you are authorized to do so.</p>
<p>Having accomplished your errand, you will rejoin this as soon as practicable.
                    Reliance is placed upon your skill and judgment in the successful execution of
                    this plan, and it is not intended or desired that you should jeopardize the
                    safety of your command, or go farther than your good judgment and prudence may
                    dictate.</p>
<p>Col. Imboden has been desired to attract the attention of the enemy toward
                    Cumberland, so that the river between that point and where you may recross may
                    be less guarded. You will, of course, keep out your scouts to give you
                    information, and take every other precaution to secure the success and safety of
                    the expedition. Should you be led so far east as to make it better, in your
                    opinion, to continue around to the Potomac, you will have to cross the river in
                    the vicinity of Leesburg.</p>
<p>I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
