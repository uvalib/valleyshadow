<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General John Echols reports to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on the
                    state of his command in western Virginia during September, 1864. Echols
                    discusses the confusion of the command, in part due to the movement of troops
                    previously stationed in his area to Early's army in Staunton.</p>

<p>Gen. S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.,
                        Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>September 7, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have now been in command of this department for a week, during which time I
                    have been industriously at work endeavoring to inform myself of its condition.
                    It is due to the Government and to all parties concerned that I should state
                    that I have found almost everything in the worst possible condition. The troops
                    are almost without organization and without discipline. When I reached here some
                    600 or more of the troops in the field were reported to me as entirely without
                    arms, and, of course, valueless as soldiers. This state of things resulted from
                    the fragmentary character of the different commands.</p>
<p>The Kentucky troops being only the remnant, with the exception of a small brigade
                    of the original command of Gen. Morgan, left after his raid of the summer of
                    1863 through Ohio, and his raid of last summer into Kentucky, and of the
                    fragments of various regiments and battalions of Tennessee troops, which
                    formerly constituted the brigades of Brig.-Gen.'s Vaughn and Raynolds. Some of
                    these fragments were very small and were all thrown together; an attempt is
                    still being made to preserve their original organizations. In the case of the
                    Tennessee troops there is this also to be stated: In the month of May last these
                    regiments, &amp;c., all under the command of Brig.-Gen. Vaughn, were ordered
                    to Staunton by the late Gen. William E. Jones, and all whose horses were in
                    proper condition obeyed the order and went to Staunton, from which point they
                    continued in the command of Gen. Breckinridge, in the army of Lieut.-Gen. Early,
                    leaving, however, in this department and in North Carolina some 600 men, whose
                    horses were not in condition to be moved, and the various regiments and
                    battalions have ever since been thus divided, producing the greatest confusion,
                    probably more than half of every regiment and battalion and a part of almost
                    every company, with a portion of the officers of each, being here, and the
                    balance in the army of Gen. Early. I am informed by Gen. Vaughn that there are
                    now in this department 900 of these men, and with Gen. Early not more than some
                    400 or 500, the number of the first having been constantly increasing, and of
                    the latter decreasing, many men coming through the lines of the enemy to the
                    command here, and a good many, no doubt, leaving the command under Gen. Early
                    and joining the one here.</p>
<p>Of course not much can be done to organize properly these troops until the
                    portions of the command in this department and in Early's army are united. I
                    would respectfully suggest that the troops with Gen. Early, known there as
                    Vaughn's brigade, be ordered to this department, in order that the various
                    regiments may be properly organized. I do not know that I have stated number
                    with entire accuracy, as the records in the assistant adjutant-general's office
                    of the department do not enable me to determine the strength of the various
                    commands, no reports having been made since 1st of August, and then very
                    imperfectly and unsatisfactory. I would also suggest the propriety of authority
                    being given to me to consolidate some of the regiments and battalions, which are
                    very small, which I think might be done with much advantage to the service and
                    without detriment to the rights of individuals. I have not yet seen a roster of
                    the officers of the department, there being none at the department headquarters.
                    To show the lamentable want of discipline heretofore existing, I may state that
                    some two or three weeks ago one of the regiments in the department refused to
                    obey an order to move from their then location, and mutinied, and a captain and
                    a large number of the men separated from the balance of the regiment, many of
                    whom have not yet returned. When I assumed the command these facts were reported
                    to me, and I at once directed the most active measures to be taken for the
                    arrest of the captain and his close confinement until he could be tried and
                    punished. This arrest has before this been effected, I hope. I have already
                    taken steps which will insure hereafter regular returns from the command, and a
                    full roster of all officers attached thereto; and I have also adopted measures
                    which will insure a better state of discipline. Everything in my power shall be
                    done to bring about a better state of things than has existed for some time as
                    to the condition and effectiveness of the troops. In order to produce a thorough
                    reform I need very much the services of one or two rigid and experienced
                    inspectors, who, I hope, will be sent as soon as possible to me. I also need the
                    services of an active and systematic ordnance officer, and I would be glad if
                    one can be spared from Richmond, and that he would be sent to me, at least
                    temporarily. I am, endeavoring as rapidly as rapidly as possible to make the
                    reserve forces effective.</p>
<p>I have now three battalions of these troops, which have been organized in
                    Southwestern Virginia, which could all be made quite efficient if they had not
                    had the power to select their own field officers. They will at any rate,
                    however, perform pretty good service I believe. The condition of East Tennessee
                    is a very bad one, the large majority of the people being opposed in sentiment
                    to us, and the country being filled with bushwhackers and marauders in organized
                    bands. Murders are of almost daily occurrence on the persons of peaceable
                    citizens, and enormities and atrocities are constantly being perpetrated. Some
                    portions of Southwestern Virginia were also fast coming to the same condition,
                    in a great measure, I think, in consequence of the inefficiency of the agents of
                    the conscript department and enrolling officers in the region of the Southwest
                    whose duty it is to see to the arrest and return of deserters. I am also
                    convinced that the conscript laws are not faithfully and rigidly enforced in
                    this portion of the State, there being many persons who ought to be in active
                    service who have thus far escaped. I am now employing the reserves in driving
                    out and arresting these deserters. Three days ago the enemy had about 2,200 men
                    in East Tennessee, or this side of Knoxville, under command of Brig.-Gen.
                    Gillem, a favorite officer of Andrew Johnson and Brownlow. They have but a small
                    force in Knoxville. In the Kanawha Valley their strength was, upon the last
                    report to me, about 2,000, and a force of some 1,200 or 1,500 men near the
                    Kentucky line. They are constantly making demonstrations from the one point or
                    the other, but I hope to be able to protect the great interests of this region
                    with the forces now here, unless the enemy should make a serious advance before
                    I can bring about better organization and discipline than now exists, in which
                    event I should have serious fear of the result. My principal apprehension is
                    that now Atlanta is in their hands they will throw forward into East Tennessee a
                    sufficient force to take permanent and entire occupation of that section, and
                    advance into Southwestern Virginia as far as the salt-works. The corn crop in
                    East Tennessee is a very fine one, and I am adopting measures to be ready to get
                    the benefit of it for the Government in the event that we are able to take and
                    hold possession of any considerable portion of that section. After the death of
                    Gen. Morgan I assigned Col. Basil W. Duke to the command of Morgan's old
                    command, although he was not the senior officer in the command, and I am sure
                    that he will improve its condition, as he is a most intelligent and efficient
                    officer. I found brigadier-Gen. Vaughn in the department, and I have assigned
                    him temporarily to the command of the troops in the field in East Tennessee, as
                    I found that he had the confidence of the people there, and also the respect and
                    confidence of the people there, and also the respect and confidence of the
                    troops. I hope that the inspector and ordnance officer, whom I have asked for,
                    may be sent me as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. ECHOLS,<br> Brig.-Gen., &amp;c.</p>
