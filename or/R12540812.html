<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Isaac Trimble in May, 1863, to offer him command of
                    Confederate forces in the Valley. Colonel Davidson's men at Staunton would form
                    the backbone of his force.</p>

<p>Gen. ISAAC R. TRIMBLE,<br> Shocco Springs, N. C.:</p>
<p>FREDERICKSBURG, VA.,</p>
<p>May 20, 1863.</p>
<p>MY DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear by your letter of the 13th that you are doing so well. I
                    was very much grieved at your attack, and started one day to see you, but was
                    told it was thought better you should be quiet. I hope you will soon recover
                    your strength, but you must not return to the field until able to endure
                    fatigue. I have a proposition to make: it is that you take command, if able, of
                    the Shenandoah Valley. Col. Davidson is in local command at Staunton. Gen.
                    Jenkins with his cavalry will be below. You will have all the Maryland troops,
                    which I hope you will be able to organize and build up into something
                    respectable. Their organization has been a failure so far. You will be in a
                    beautiful, healthy county; can give general supervision of operations there;
                    will form the left wing of this army, and shall have permission to capture
                    Milroy and take Maryland as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Let me know when you will be able to enter on your new command and I will issue
                    the order. I want some one there at once, as I intend to bring W. E. Jones'
                    brigade east of the mountains as soon as he returns from the west. He ought to
                    reach Staunton to morrow.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your kind letter, and feeling with you sympathy at
                        our heavy loss of the great and good Jackson, I remain, very truly yours,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE.</p>
