<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson writes from Chambersburg to Assistant Adjutant E.
                    D. Townsend in June, 1861. Patterson discusses his plans for an advance into
                    Maryland, mentions regiments he is expecting to receive, and details troop
                    strengths in the Chambersburg area.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> Asst. Adjt. Gen., U. S.
                        Army, Washington City:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, Pa.,</p>
<p>June 7, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>The inclosed telegrams will inform the Gen.-in-Chief how the Elmira regiment
                    succeeded in passing out of this department and what companies of the Second
                    Infantry have been to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>From private information I have reason to believe Company C, Second Infantry,
                    will soon be in from Fort Ripley. Am I authorized to take it and others of the
                    regiment passing East?</p>
<p>I desire in a few days to occupy the road beyond Hagerstown, and to establish my
                    headquarters in that town, but do not, in face of the order of the Gen.-in-Chief
                    not to make a forward movement, like to advance beyond Greencastle, to which
                    point Col. Thomas' brigade moved to-day. I can in a few days hence throw with
                    wagons eight thousand men beyond that point, and by rail at the same time two
                    thousand more.</p>
<p>While the river is high from recent rains, I wish to establish my depots and to
                    intrench my left flank on the Boonsborough road, placing there the force with
                    which I can threaten the Maryland Heights, and, should a favorable occasion
                    offer, storm them. This force will be that which I will not be able to provide
                    with sufficient transportation at present. The approaches to Harper's Ferry are
                    so well guarded, and the sympathizers with the rebels in the immediate vicinity
                    so numerous, that no spy can approach their works. The little information I can
                    gain assures me that they are fortifying west of Harper's Ferry as well as at
                    the Maryland Heights, and design on this field to make a desperate struggle for
                    supremacy.</p>
<p>Independent of the regular force with Col. Thomas, I have now in this vicinity
                    seventeen regiments, all the force which is to join me, except the New York and
                    Ohio regiments, of which I know nothing.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
