<p>Gen. S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector Gen.</p>
<p>Hdqrs. Army of Northern Virginia,</p>
<p>January, 1864.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit a detailed report of the operations of this army from
                    the time it left the vicinity of Fredericksburg, early in June, to its
                    occupation of the line of the Rapidan, in August.</p>
<p>Upon the retreat of the Federal Army, commanded by Maj.-Gen. Hooker, from
                    Chancellorsville, it reoccupied the ground north of the Rappahannock, opposite
                    Fredericksburg, where it could not be attacked excepting at a disadvantage. It
                    was determined to draw it from this position, and, if practicable, to transfer
                    the scene of hostilities beyond the Potomac. The execution of this purpose also
                    embraced the expulsion of the force under Gen. Milroy, which had infested the
                    lower Shenandoah Valley during the preceding winter and spring. If unable to
                    attain the valuable results which might be expected to follow a decided
                    advantage gained over the enemy in Maryland or Pennsylvania, it was hoped that
                    we should at least so far disturb his plan for the summer campaign as to prevent
                    its execution during the season of active operations.</p>
<p>The commands of Longstreet and Ewell were put in motion, and encamped around
                    Culpeper Court-House June 7. As soon as their march was discovered by the enemy,
                    he threw a force across the Rappahannock, about 2 miles below Fredericksburg,
                    apparently for the purpose of observation. Hill's corps was left to watch these
                    troops, with instructions to follow the movements of the army as soon as they
                    should retire.</p>
<p>The cavalry, under Gen. Stuart, which had been concentrated near Culpeper
                    Court-House, was attacked on June 9 by a large force of Federal cavalry,
                    supported by infantry, which crossed the Rappahannock at Beverly and Kelly's
                    Fords. After a severe engagement, which continued from early in the morning
                    until late in the afternoon, the enemy was compelled to recross the river with
                    heavy loss, leaving about 500 prisoners, 3 pieces of artillery, and several
                    colors in our hands.</p>
<p>Gen. Imboden and Gen. Jenkins had been ordered to cooperate in the projected
                    expedition into the Valley, Gen. Imboden by moving toward Romney with his
                    command, to prevent the troops guarding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from
                    re-enforcing those at Winchester, while Gen. Jenkins advanced directly toward
                    the latter place with his cavalry brigade, supported by a battalion of infantry
                    and a battery of the Maryland Line.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell left Culpeper Court-House on June 10. He crossed the branches of the
                    Shenandoah near Front Royal, and reached Cedarville on the 12th, where he was
                    joined by Gen. Jenkins. Detaching Gen. Rodes with his division, and the greater
                    part of Jenkins' brigade, to dislodge a force of the enemy stationed at
                    Berryville, Gen. Ewell, with the rest of his command, moved upon Winchester,
                    Johnson's division advancing by the Front Royal road, Early's by the Valley
                    turnpike, which it entered at Newtown, where it was joined by the Maryland
                    troops.</p>
<p>BATTLE OF WINCHESTER.</p>
<p>The enemy was driven in on both roads, and our troops halted in line of battle
                    near the town on the evening of the 13th. The same day the force which had
                    occupied Berryville retreated to Winchester on the approach of Gen. Rodes. The
                    following morning, Gen. Ewell ordered Gen. Early to carry an intrenched position
                    northwest of Winchester, near the Pughtown road, which the latter officer, upon
                    examining the ground, discovered would command the principal fortifications.</p>
<p>To cover the movement of Gen. Early, Gen. Johnson took position between the road
                    to Millwood and that to Berryville, and advanced his skirmishers toward the
                    town. Gen. Early, leaving a portion of his command to engage the enemy's
                    attention, with the remainder gained a favorable position without being
                    perceived, and, about 5 p. m., twenty pieces of artillery, under Lieut. Col. H.
                    P. Jones, opened suddenly upon the intrenchments. The enemy's guns were soon
                    silenced. Hays' brigade then advanced to the assault, and carried the works by
                    storm, capturing six rifled pieces, two of which were turned upon and dispersed
                    a column which was forming to retake the position. The enemy immediately
                    abandoned the works on the left of those taken by Hays, and retired into his
                    main fortifications, which Gen. Early prepared to assail in the morning. The
                    loss of the advanced works, however, rendered the others untenable, and the
                    enemy retreated in the night, abandoning his sick and wounded, together with his
                    artillery, wagons, and stores. Anticipating such a movement, as soon as he heard
                    of Early's success, Gen. Ewell directed Gen. Johnson to occupy, with part of his
                    command, a point on the Martinsburg road, about 2 1/2 miles from Winchester,
                    where he could either intercept the enemy's retreat, or aid in an attack should
                    further resistance be offered in the morning. Gen. Johnson marched with
                    Nicholls' and part of Steuart's brigades, accompanied by Lieut.-Col. R. S.
                    Andrews with a detachment of his artillery, the Stonewall Brigade being ordered
                    to follow. Finding the road to the place indicated by Gen. Ewell difficult of
                    passage in the darkness, Gen. Johnson pursued that leading by Jordan Springs to
                    Stephenson's Depot, where he took a favorable position on the Martinsburg road,
                    about 5 miles from Winchester. Just as his line was formed, the retreating
                    column, consisting of the main body of Gen. Milroy's army, arrived, and
                    immediately attacked him. The enemy, though in superior force, consisting of
                    both infantry and cavalry, was gallantly repulsed, and, finding all efforts to
                    cut his way unavailing, he sent strong flanking parties simultaneously to the
                    right and left, still keeping up a heavy fire in front. The party on the right
                    was driven back and pursued by the Stonewall Brigade, which opportunely arrived.
                    That on the left was broken and dispersed by the Second and Tenth Louisiana
                    Regt.'s, aided by the artillery, and in a short time nearly the whole infantry
                    force, amounting to more than 2,300 men, with eleven stand of colors,
                    surrendered, the cavalry alone escaping. Gen. Milroy, with a small party of
                    fugitives, fled to Harper's Ferry. The number of prisoners taken in this action
                    exceeded the force engaged under Gen. Johnson, who speaks in terms of
                    well-deserved praise of the conduct of the officers and men of his command.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gen. Rodes marched from Berryville to Martinsburg, reaching the
                    latter place in the afternoon of the 14th. The enemy made a show of resistance,
                    but soon gave way, the cavalry and artillery retreating toward Williamsport, the
                    infantry toward Shepherdstown, under cover of night. The route taken by the
                    latter was not known until it was too late to follow; but the former were
                    pursued so rapidly, Jenkins' troops leading, that they were forced to abandon
                    five of their six pieces of artillery. About 200 prisoners were taken, but the
                    enemy destroyed most of his stores.</p>
<p>These operations resulted in the expulsion of the enemy from the Valley; the
                    capture of 4,000 prisoners, with a corresponding number of small-arms; 28 pieces
                    of superior artillery, including those taken by Gen.'s Rodes and Hays; about 300
                    wagons and as many horses, together with a considerable quantity of ordnance,
                    commissary, and quartermaster's stores.</p>
<p>Our entire loss was 47 killed, 219 wounded, and 3 missing.</p>
<p>MARCH INTO PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
<p>On the night of Ewell's appearance at Winchester, the enemy in front of A. P.
                    Hill, at Fredericksburg, recrossed the Rappahannock, and the whole army of Gen.
                    Hooker withdrew from the north side of the river. In order to mislead him as to
                    our intentions, and at the same time protect Hill's corps in its march up the
                    Rappahannock, Longstreet left Culpeper Court-House on the 15th, and, advancing
                    along the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, occupied Ashby's and Snicker's Gaps.
                    He had been joined, while at Culpeper, by Gen. Pickett, with three brigades of
                    his division. Gen. Stuart, with three brigades of cavalry, moved on Longstreet's
                    right, and took position in front of the Gaps. Hampton's and W. E. Jones'
                    brigades remained along the Rappahannock and Hazel Rivers, in front of Culpeper
                    Court-House, with instructions to follow the main body as soon as Hill's corps
                    had passed that point.</p>
<p>On the 17th, Fitz. Lee's brigade, under Col. Munford, which was on the road to
                    Snicker's Gap, was attacked near Aldie by the Federal cavalry. The attack was
                    repulsed with loss, and the brigade held its ground until ordered to fall back,
                    its right being threatened by another body, coming from Hopewell toward
                    Middleburg. The latter force was driven from Middleburg, and pursued toward
                    Hopewell by Robertson's brigade, which arrived about dark. Its retreat was
                    intercepted by W. H. F. Lee's brigade, under Col. Chambliss, jr., and the
                    greater part of a regiment captured.</p>
<p>During the three succeeding days there was much skirmishing, Gen. Stuart taking a
                    position west of Middleburg, where he awaited the rest of his command.</p>
<p>Gen. Jones arrived on the 19th, and Gen. Hampton in the afternoon of the
                    following day, having repulsed, on his march, a cavalry force sent to
                    reconnoiter in the direction of Warrenton.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the enemy attacked with infantry and cavalry, and obliged Gen.
                    Stuart, after a brave resistance, to fall back to the gaps of the mountains. The
                    enemy retired the next day, having advanced only a short distance beyond
                    Upperville.</p>
<p>In these engagements, the cavalry sustained a loss of 510 killed, wounded, and
                    missing. Among them were several valuable officers, whose names are mentioned in
                    Gen. Stuart's report. One piece of artillery was disabled and left on the field.
                    The enemy's loss was heavy. About 400 prisoners were taken and several stand of
                    colors.</p>
<p>The Federal Army was apparently guarding the approaches to Washington, and
                    manifested no disposition to assume the offensive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the progress of Ewell, who was already in Maryland, with
                    Jenkins' cavalry advanced into Pennsylvania as far as Chambersburg, rendered it
                    necessary that the rest of the army should be within supporting distance, and
                    Hill having reached the Valley, Longstreet was withdrawn to the west side of the
                    Shenandoah, and the two corps encamped near Berryville.</p>
<p>Gen. Stuart was directed to hold the mountain passes with part of his command as
                    long as the enemy remained south of the Potomac, and, with the remainder, to
                    cross into Maryland, and place himself on the right of Gen. Ewell. Upon the
                    suggestion of the former officer that he could damage the enemy and delay his
                    passage of the river by getting in his rear, he was authorized to do so, and it
                    was left to his discretion whether to enter Maryland east or west of the Blue
                    Ridge; but he was instructed to lose no time in placing his command on the right
                    of our column as soon as he should perceive the enemy moving northward.</p>
<p>On the 22d, Gen. Ewell marched into Pennsylvania with Rodes' and Johnson's
                    divisions, preceded by Jenkins' cavalry, taking the road from Hagerstown,
                    through Chambersburg, to Carlisle, where he arrived on the 27th. Early's
                    division, which had occupied Boonsborough, moved by a parallel road to
                    Greenwood, and, in pursuance of instructions previously given to Gen. Ewell,
                    marched toward York.</p>
<p>On the 24th, Longstreet and Hill were put in motion to follow Ewell, and, on the
                    27th, encamped near Chambersburg.</p>
<p>Gen. Imboden, under the orders before referred to, had been operating on Ewell's
                    left while the latter was advancing into Maryland. He drove off the troops
                    guarding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and destroyed all the important
                    bridges on that route from Martinsburg to Cumberland, besides inflicting serious
                    damage upon the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. He was at Hancock when Longstreet and
                    Hill reached Chambersburg, and was directed to proceed to the latter place by
                    way of McConnellsburg, collecting supplies for the army on his route.</p>
<p>The cavalry force at this time with the army, consisting of Jenkins' brigade and
                    E. V. White's battalion, was not greater than was required to accompany the
                    advance of Gen. Ewell and Gen. Early, with whom it performed valuable service,
                    as appears from their reports. It was expected that as soon as the Federal Army
                    should cross the Potomac, Gen. Stuart would give notice of its movements, and
                    nothing having been heard from him since our entrance into Maryland, it was
                    inferred that the enemy had not yet left Virginia. Orders were, therefore,
                    issued to move upon Harrisburg. The expedition of Gen. Early to York was
                    designed in part to prepare for this undertaking by breaking the railroad
                    between Baltimore and Harrisburg, and seizing the bridge over the Susquehanna at
                    Wrightsville. Gen. Early succeeded in the first object, destroying a number of
                    bridges above and below York, but on the approach of the troops sent by him to
                    Wrightsville, a body of militia stationed at that place fled across the river
                    and burned the bridge in their retreat. Gen. Early then marched to rejoin his
                    corps.</p>
<p>The advance against Harrisburg was arrested by intelligence received from a scout
                    on the night of the 28th, to the effect that the army of Gen. Hooker had crossed
                    the Potomac, and was approaching the South Mountain. In the absence of the
                    cavalry, it was impossible to ascertain his intentions; but to deter him from
                    advancing farther west, and intercepting our communication with Virginia, it was
                    determined to concentrate the army east of the mountains.</p>
<p>BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG.</p>
<p>Hill's corps was accordingly ordered to move toward Cashtown on the 29th, and
                    Longstreet to follow the next day, leaving Pickett's division at Chambersburg to
                    guard the rear until relieved by Imboden. Gen. Ewell was recalled from Carlisle,
                    and directed to join the army at Cashtown or Gettysburg, as circumstances might
                    require. The advance of the enemy to the latter place was unknown, and the
                    weather being inclement, the march was conducted with a view to the comfort of
                    the troops. Heth's division reached Cashtown on the 29th, and the following
                    morning Pettigrew's brigade, sent by Gen. Heth to procure supplies at
                    Gettysburg, found it occupied by the enemy. Being ignorant of the extent of his
                    force, Gen. Pettigrew was unwilling to hazard an attack with his single brigade,
                    and returned to Cashtown.</p>
<p>Gen. Hill arrived with Pender's division in the evening, and the following
                    morning (July 1) advanced with these two divisions, accompanied by Pegram's and
                    McIntosh's battalions of artillery, to ascertain the strength of the enemy,
                    whose force was supposed to consist chiefly of cavalry. The leading division,
                    under Gen. Heth, found the enemy's vedettes about 3 miles west of Gettysburg,
                    and continued to advance until within a mile of the town, when two brigades were
                    sent forward to reconnoiter. They drove in the advance of the enemy very
                    gallantly, but subsequently encountered largely superior numbers, and were
                    compelled to retire with loss, Brig.-Gen. Archer, commanding one of the
                    brigades, being taken prisoner. Gen. Heth then prepared for action, and as soon
                    as Pender arrived to support him, was ordered by Gen. Hill to advance. The
                    artillery was placed in position, and the engagement opened with vigor. Gen.
                    Heth pressed the enemy steadily back, breaking his first and second lines, and
                    attacking his third with great resolution. About 2.30 p. m. the advance of
                    Ewell's corps, consisting of Rodes' division, with Carter's battalion of
                    artillery, arrived by the Middletown road, and, forming on Heth's left, nearly
                    at right angles with his line, became warmly engaged with fresh numbers of the
                    enemy. Heth's troops, having suffered heavily in their protracted contest with a
                    superior force, were relieved by Pender's, and Early, coming up by the
                    Heidlersburg road soon afterward, took position on the left of Rodes, when a
                    general advance was made.</p>
<p>The enemy gave way on all sides, and was driven through Gettysburg with great
                    loss. Maj.-Gen. Reynolds, who was in command, was killed. More than 5,000
                    prisoners, exclusive of a large number of wounded, three pieces of artillery,
                    and several colors were captured. Among the prisoners were two
                    brigadier-generals, one of whom was badly wounded. Our own loss was heavy,
                    including a number of officers, among whom were Maj.-Gen. Heth, slightly, and
                    Brig.-Gen. Scales, of Pender's division, severely, wounded. The enemy retired to
                    a range of hills south of Gettysburg, where he displayed a strong force of
                    infantry and artillery.</p>
<p>It was ascertained from the prisoners that we had been engaged with two corps of
                    the army formerly commanded by Gen. Hooker, and that the remainder of that army,
                    under Gen. Meade, was approaching Gettysburg. Without information as to its
                    proximity, the strong position which the enemy had assumed could not be attacked
                    without danger of exposing the four divisions present, already weakened and
                    exhausted by a long and bloody struggle, to overwhelming numbers of fresh
                    troops. Gen. Ewell was, therefore, instructed to carry the hill occupied by the
                    enemy, if he found it practicable, but to avoid a general engagement until the
                    arrival of the other divisions of the army, which were ordered to hasten
                    forward. He decided to await Johnson's division, which had marched from Carlisle
                    by the road west of the mountains to guard the trains of his corps, and
                    consequently did not reach Gettysburg until a late hour.</p>
<p>In the meantime the enemy occupied the point which Gen. Ewell designed to seize,
                    but in what force could not be ascertained, owing to the darkness. An
                    intercepted dispatch showed that another corps had halted that afternoon 4 miles
                    from Gettysburg. Under these circumstances, it was decided not to attack until
                    the arrival of Longstreet, two of whose divisions (those of Hood and McLaws)
                    encamped about 4 miles in the rear during the night. Anderson's division of
                    Hill's corps came up after the engagement.</p>
<p>It had not been intended to deliver a general battle so far from our base unless
                    attacked, but coming unexpectedly upon the whole Federal Army, to withdraw
                    through the mountains with our extensive trains would have been difficult and
                    dangerous. At the same time we were unable to await an attack, as the country
                    was unfavorable for collecting supplies in the presence of the enemy, who could
                    restrain our foraging parties by holding the mountain passes with local and
                    other troops. A battle had, therefore, become in a measure unavoidable, and the
                    success already gained gave hope of a favorable issue.</p>
<p>The enemy occupied a strong position, with his right upon two commanding
                    elevations adjacent to each other, one southeast and the other, known as
                    Cemetery Hill, immediately south of the town, which lay at its base. His line
                    extended thence upon the high ground along the Emmitsburg road, with a steep
                    ridge in rear, which was also occupied. This ridge was difficult of ascent,
                    particularly the two hills above mentioned as forming its northern extremity,
                    and a third at the other end, on which the enemy's left rested. Numerous stone
                    and rail fences along the slope served to afford protection to his troops and
                    impede our advance. In his front, the ground was undulating and generally open
                    for about three-quarters of a mile.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell's corps constituted our left, Johnson's division being opposite the
                    height adjoining Cemetery Hill, Early's in the center, in front of the north
                    face of the latter, and Rodes upon his right. Hill's corps faced the west side
                    of Cemetery Hill, and extended nearly parallel to the Emmitsburg road, making an
                    angle with Ewell's. Pender's division formed his left, Anderson's his right,
                    Heth's, under Brig.-Gen. Pettigrew, being in reserve. His artillery, under Col.
                    R. L. Walker, was posted in eligible positions along his line.</p>
<p>It was determined to make the principal attack upon the enemy's left, and
                    endeavor to gain a position from which it was thought that our artillery could
                    be brought to bear with effect. Longstreet was directed to place the divisions
                    of McLaws and Hood on the right of Hill, partially enveloping the enemy's left,
                    which he was to drive in.</p>
<p>Gen. Hill was ordered to threaten the enemy's center, to prevent re-enforcements
                    being drawn to either wing, and co-operate with his right division in
                    Longstreet's attack.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell was instructed to make a simultaneous demonstration upon the enemy's
                    right, to be converted into a real attack should opportunity offer.</p>
<p>About 4 p. m. Longstreet's batteries opened, and soon afterward Hood's division,
                    on the extreme right, moved to the attack. McLaws followed somewhat later, four
                    of Anderson's brigades, those of Wilcox, Perry, A. R. Wright, and Posey
                    supporting him on the left, in the order named. The enemy was soon driven from
                    his position on the Emmitsburg road to the cover of a ravine and a line of stone
                    fences at the foot of the ridge in his rear. He was dislodged from these after a
                    severe struggle, and retired up the ridge, leaving a number of his batteries in
                    our possession. Wilcox's and Wright's brigades advanced with great gallantry,
                    breaking successive lines of the enemy's infantry, and compelling him to abandon
                    much of his artillery. Wilcox reached the foot and Wright gained the crest of
                    the ridge itself, driving the enemy down the opposite side; but having become
                    separated from McLaws and gone beyond the other two brigades of the division,
                    they were attacked in front and on both flanks, and compelled to retire, being
                    unable to bring off any of the captured artillery. McLaws' left also fell back,
                    and, it being now nearly dark, Gen. Longstreet determined to await the arrival
                    of Gen. Pickett. He disposed his command to hold the ground gained on the right,
                    withdrawing his left to the first position from which the enemy had been driven.</p>
<p>Four pieces of artillery, several hundred prisoners, and two regimental flags
                    were taken. As soon as the engagement began on our right, Gen. Johnson opened
                    with his artillery, and about two hours later advanced up the hill next to
                    Cemetery Hill with three brigades, the fourth being detained by a demonstration
                    on his left. Soon afterward, Gen. Early attacked Cemetery Hill with two
                    brigades, supported by a third, the fourth having been previously detached. The
                    enemy had greatly increased by earthworks the strength of the positions assailed
                    by Johnson and Early.</p>
<p>The troops of the former moved steadily up the steep and rugged ascent, under a
                    heavy fire, driving the enemy into his intrenchments, part of which was carried
                    by Steuart's brigade, and a number of prisoners taken. The contest was continued
                    to a late hour, but without further advantage. On Cemetery Hill, the attack by
                    Early's leading brigades--those of Hays and Hoke, under Col. I. E. Avery--was
                    made with vigor. Two lines of the enemy's infantry were dislodged from the cover
                    of some stone and board fences on the side of the ascent, and driven back into
                    the works on the crest, into which our troops forced their way, and seized
                    several pieces of artillery.</p>
<p>A heavy force advanced against their right, which was without support, and they
                    were compelled to retire, bringing with them about 100 prisoners and four stand
                    of colors. Gen. Ewell had directed Gen. Rodes to attack in concert with Early,
                    covering his right, and had requested Brig.-Gen. Lane, then commanding Pender's
                    division, to co-operate on the right of Rodes. When the time to attack arrived,
                    Gen. Rodes, not having his troops in position, was unprepared to co-operate with
                    Gen. Early, and before he could get in readiness the latter had been obliged to
                    retire for want of the expected support on his right. Gen. Lane was prepared to
                    give the assistance required of him, and so informed Gen. Rodes, but the latter
                    deemed it useless to advance after the failure of Early's attack.</p>
<p>In this engagement our loss in men and officers was large. Maj.-Gen.'s Hood and
                    Pender, Brig.-Gen.'s J. M. Jones, Semmes, G. T. Anderson, and Barksdale, and
                    Col. Avery, commanding Hoke's brigade, were wounded, the last two mortally.
                    Gen.'s Pender and Semmes died after their removal to Virginia.</p>
<p>The result of this day's operations induced the belief that, with proper concert
                    of action, and with the increased support that the positions gained on the right
                    would enable the artillery to render the assaulting columns, we should
                    ultimately succeed, and it was accordingly determined to continue the attack.
                    The general plan was unchanged. Longstreet, re-enforced by Pickett's three
                    brigades, which arrived near the battle-field during the afternoon of the 2d,
                    was ordered to attack the next morning, and Gen. Ewell was directed to assail
                    the enemy's right at the same time. The latter, during the night, re-enforced
                    Gen. Johnson with two brigades from Rodes' and one from Early's division.</p>
<p>Gen. Longstreet's dispositions were not completed as early as was expected, but
                    before notice could be sent to Gen. Ewell, Gen. Johnson had already become
                    engaged, and it was too late to recall him. The enemy attempted to recover the
                    works taken the preceding evening, but was repulsed, and Gen. Johnson attacked
                    in turn.</p>
<p>After a gallant and prolonged struggle, in which the enemy was forced to abandon
                    part of his intrenchments, Gen. Johnson found himself unable to carry the
                    strongly fortified crest of the hill. The projected attack on the enemy's left
                    not having been made, he was enabled to hold his right with a force largely
                    superior to that of Gen. Johnson, and finally to threaten his flank and rear,
                    rendering it necessary for him to retire to his original position about 1 p. m.</p>
<p>Gen. Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the high, rocky hills on the
                    enemy's extreme left, from which his troops could be attacked in reverse as they
                    advanced. His operations had been embarrassed the day previous by the same
                    cause, and he now deemed it necessary to defend his flank and rear with the
                    divisions of Hood and McLaws. He was, therefore, re-enforced by Heth's division
                    and two brigades of Pender's, to the command of which Maj.-Gen. Trimble was
                    assigned. Gen. Hill was directed to hold his line with the rest of his command,
                    afford Gen. Longstreet further assistance, if required, and avail himself of any
                    success that might be gained.</p>
<p>A careful examination was made of the ground secured by Longstreet, and his
                    batteries placed in positions, which, it was believed, would enable them to
                    silence those of the enemy. Hill's artillery and part of Ewell's was ordered to
                    open simultaneously, and the assaulting column to advance under cover of the
                    combined fire of the three. The batteries were directed to be pushed forward as
                    the infantry progressed, protect their flanks, and support their attacks
                    closely.</p>
<p>About 1 p. m., at a given signal, a heavy cannonade was opened, and continued for
                    about two hours with marked effect upon the enemy. His batteries replied
                    vigorously at first, but toward the close their fire slackened perceptibly, and
                    Gen. Longstreet ordered forward the column of attack, consisting of Pickett's
                    and Heth's divisions, in two lines, Pickett on the right. Wilcox's brigade
                    marched in rear of Pickett's right, to guard that flank, and Heth's was
                    supported by Lane's and Scales' brigades, under Gen. Trimble. The troops moved
                    steadily on, under a heavy fire of musketry and artillery, the main attack being
                    directed against the enemy's left center.</p>
<p>His batteries reopened as soon as they appeared. Our own having nearly exhausted
                    their ammunition in the protracted cannonade that preceded the advance of the
                    infantry, were unable to reply, or render the necessary support to the attacking
                    party. Owing to this fact, which was unknown to me when the assault took place,
                    the enemy was enabled to throw a strong force of infantry against our left,
                    already wavering under a concentrated fire of artillery from the ridge in front,
                    and from Cemetery Hill, on the left. It finally gave way, and the right, after
                    penetrating the enemy's lines, entering his advance works, and capturing some of
                    his artillery, was attacked simultaneously in front and on both flanks, and
                    driven back with heavy loss.</p>
<p>The troops were rallied and reformed, but the enemy did not pursue.</p>
<p>A large number of brave officers and men fell or were captured on this occasion.
                    Of Pickett's three brigade commanders, Gen.'s Armistead and R. B. Garnett were
                    killed, and Gen. Kemper dangerously wounded.</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Trimble and Brig.-Gen. Pettigrew were also wounded, the former
                    severely.</p>
<p>The movements of the army preceding the battle of Gettysburg had been much
                    embarrassed by the absence of the cavalry. As soon as it was known that the
                    enemy had crossed into Maryland, orders were sent to the brigades of B. H.
                    Robertson and William E. Jones, which had been left to guard the passes of the
                    Blue Ridge, to rejoin the army without delay, and it was expected that Gen.
                    Stuart, with the remainder of his command, would soon arrive. In the exercise of
                    the discretion given him when Longstreet and Hill marched into Maryland, Gen.
                    Stuart determined to pass around the rear of the Federal Army with three
                    brigades and cross the Potomac between it and Washington, believing that he
                    would be able, by that route, to place himself on our right flank in time to
                    keep us properly advised of the enemy's movements. He marched from Salem on the
                    night of June 24, intending to pass west of Centreville, but found the enemy's
                    forces so distributed as to render that route impracticable. Adhering to his
                    original plan, he was forced to make a wide detour through Buckland and
                    Brentsville, and crossed the Occoquan at Wolf Run Shoals on the morning of the
                    27th. Continuing his march through Fairfax Court-House and Dranesville, he
                    arrived at the Potomac, below the mouth of Seneca Creek, in the evening.</p>
<p>He found the river much swollen by the recent rains, but, after great exertion,
                    gained the Maryland shore before midnight with his whole command.</p>
<p>He now ascertained that the Federal Army, which he had discovered to be drawing
                    toward the Potomac, had crossed the day before, and was moving toward Frederick,
                    thus interposing itself between him and our forces.</p>
<p>He accordingly marched northward, through Rockville and Westminster, to Hanover,
                    Pa., where he arrived on the 30th; but the enemy advanced with equal rapidity on
                    his left, and continued to obstruct communication with our main body.</p>
<p>Supposing, from such information as he could obtain, that part of the army was at
                    Carlisle, he left Hanover that night, and proceeded thither by way of Dover.</p>
<p>He reached Carlisle on July 1, where he received orders to proceed to Gettysburg.</p>
<p>He arrived in the afternoon of the following day, and took position on Gen.
                    Ewell's left. His leading brigade, under Gen. Hampton, encountered and repulsed
                    a body of the enemy's cavalry at Hunterstown, endeavoring to reach our rear.</p>
<p>Gen. Stuart had several skirmishes during his march, and at Hanover quite a
                    severe engagement took place with a strong force of cavalry, which was finally
                    compelled to withdraw from the town.</p>
<p>The prisoners taken by the cavalry and paroled at various places amounted to
                    about 800, and at Rockville a large train of wagons coming from Washington was
                    intercepted and captured. Many of them were destroyed, but 125, with all the
                    animals of the train, were secured.</p>
<p>The ranks of the cavalry were much reduced by its long and arduous march,
                    repeated conflicts, and insufficient supplies of food and forage, but the day
                    after its arrival at Gettysburg it engaged the enemy's cavalry with unabated
                    spirit, and effectually protected our left.</p>
<p>In this action, Brig.-Gen. Hampton was seriously wounded, while acting with his
                    accustomed gallantry.</p>
<p>Robertson's and Jones' brigades arrived on July 3, and were stationed upon our
                    right flank. The severe loss sustained by the army and the reduction of its
                    ammunition, rendered another attempt to dislodge the enemy inadvisable, and it
                    was, therefore, determined to withdraw.</p>
<p>The trains, with such of the wounded as could bear removal, were ordered to
                    Williamsport on July 4, part moving through Cashtown and Greencastle, escorted
                    by Gen. Imboden, and the remainder by the Fairfield road.</p>
<p>The army retained its position until dark, when it was put in motion for the
                    Potomac by the last-named route.</p>
<p>A heavy rain continued throughout the night, and so much impeded its progress
                    that Ewell's corps, which brought up the rear, did not leave Gettysburg until
                    late in the forenoon of the following day. The enemy offered no serious
                    interruption, and, after an arduous march, we arrived at Hagerstown in the
                    afternoon of the 6th and morning of July 7.</p>
<p>The great length of our trains made it difficult to guard them effectually in
                    passing through the mountains, and a number of wagons and ambulances were
                    captured. They succeeded in reaching Williamsport on the 6th, but were unable to
                    cross the Potomac on account of the high stage of water. Here they were attacked
                    by a strong force of cavalry and artillery, which was gallantly repulsed by Gen.
                    Imboden, whose command had been strengthened by several batteries and by two
                    regiments of infantry, which had been detached at Winchester to guard prisoners,
                    and were returning to the army.</p>
<p>While the enemy was being held in check, Gen. Stuart arrived with the cavalry,
                    which had performed valuable service in guarding the flanks of the army during
                    the retrograde movement, and, after a short engagement, drove him from the
                    field. The rains that had prevailed almost without intermission since our
                    entrance into Maryland, and greatly interfered with our movements, had made the
                    Potomac unfordable, and the pontoon bridge left at Falling Waters had been
                    partially destroyed by the enemy. The wounded and prisoners were sent over the
                    river as rapidly as possible in a few ferry-boats, while the trains awaited the
                    subsiding of the waters and the construction of a new pontoon bridge.</p>
<p>On July 8, the enemy's cavalry advanced toward Hagerstown, but was repulsed by
                    Gen. Stuart, and pursued as far as Boonsborough.</p>
<p>With this exception, nothing but occasional skirmishing occurred until the 12th,
                    when the main body of the enemy arrived. The army then took a position
                    previously selected, covering the Potomac from Williamsport to Falling Waters,
                    where it remained for two days, with the enemy immediately in front, manifesting
                    no disposition to attack, but throwing up intrenchments along his whole line.</p>
<p>By the 13th, the river at Williamsport, though still deep, was fordable, and a
                    good bridge was completed at Falling Waters, new boats having being constructed
                    and some of the old recovered. As further delay would enable the enemy to obtain
                    re-enforcements, and as it was found difficult to procure a sufficient supply of
                    flour for the troops, the working of the mills being interrupted by high water,
                    it was determined to await an attack no longer.</p>
<p>Orders were accordingly given to cross the Potomac that night, Ewell's corps by
                    the ford at Williamsport, and those of Longstreet and Hill on the bridge.</p>
<p>The cavalry was directed to relieve the infantry skirmishers, and bring up the
                    rear.</p>
<p>The movement was much retarded by a severe rain storm and the darkness of the
                    night. Ewell's corps, having the advantage of a turnpike road, marched with less
                    difficulty, and crossed the river by 8 o'clock the following morning. The
                    condition of the road to the bridge and the time consumed in the passage of the
                    artillery, ammunition wagons, and ambulances, which could not ford the river, so
                    much delayed the progress of Longstreet and Hill, that it was daylight before
                    their troops began to cross. Heth's division was halted about a mile and a half
                    from the bridge, to protect the passage of the column. No interruption was
                    offered by the enemy until about 11 a. m., when his cavalry, supported by
                    artillery, appeared in front of Gen. Heth.</p>
<p>A small number in advance of the main body was mistaken for our own cavalry
                    retiring, no notice having been given of the withdrawal of the latter, and was
                    suffered to approach our lines. They were immediately destroyed or captured,
                    with the exception of two or three, but Brig.-Gen. Pettigrew, an officer of
                    great merit and promise, was mortally wounded in the encounter. He survived his
                    removal to Virginia only a few days.</p>
<p>The bridge being clear, Gen. Heth began to withdraw. The enemy advanced, but his
                    efforts to break our lines were repulsed, and the passage of the river was
                    completed by 1 p. m. Owing to the extent of Gen. Heth's line, some of his men
                    most remote from the bridge were cut off before they could reach it, but the
                    greater part of those taken by the enemy during the movement (supposed to amount
                    in all to about 500) consisted of men from various commands who lingered behind,
                    overcome by previous labors and hardships, and the fatigue of a most trying
                    night march. There was no loss of materiel excepting a few broken wagons and two
                    pieces of artillery, which the horses were unable to draw through the deep mud.
                    Other horses were sent back for them, but the rear of the column had passed
                    before their arrival.</p>
<p>The army proceeded to the vicinity of Bunker Hill and Darkesville, where it
                    halted to afford the troops repose.</p>
<p>The enemy made no effort to follow excepting with his cavalry, which crossed the
                    Potomac at Harper's Ferry, and advanced toward Martinsburg on July 16.</p>
<p>They were attacked by Gen. Fitz. Lee, with his own and Chambliss' brigades, and
                    driven back with loss.</p>
<p>When the army returned to Virginia, it was intended to move into Loudoun, but the
                    Shenandoah was found to be impassable. While waiting for it to subside, the
                    enemy crossed the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge, and seized the passes we
                    designed to use. As he continued to advance along the eastern slope, apparently
                    with the purpose of cutting us off from the railroad to Richmond, Gen.
                    Longstreet was ordered, on July 19, to proceed to Culpeper Court-House, by way
                    of Front Royal. He succeeded in passing part of his command over the Shenandoah
                    in time to prevent the occupation of Manassas and Chester Gaps by the enemy,
                    whose cavalry had already made its appearance.</p>
<p>As soon as a pontoon bridge could be laid down, the rest of his corps crossed the
                    river, and marched through Chester Gap to Culpeper Court-House, where it arrived
                    on the 24th. He was followed without serious opposition by Gen. A. P. Hill.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell having been detained in the Valley by an effort to capture a force of
                    the enemy guarding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad west of Martinsburg, Wright's
                    brigade was left to hold Manassas Gap until his arrival. He reached Front Royal
                    on the 23d, with Johnson's and Rodes' divisions, Early's being near Winchester,
                    and found Gen. Wright skirmishing with the enemy's infantry, which had already
                    appeared in Manassas Gap. Gen. Ewell supported Wright with Rodes' division and
                    some artillery, and the enemy was held in check.</p>
<p>Finding that the Federal force greatly exceeded his own, Gen. Ewell marched
                    through Thornton's Gap, and ordered Early to move up the Valley by Strasburg and
                    New Market. He encamped near Madison Court-House on July 29.</p>
<p>The enemy massed his army in the vicinity of Warrenton, and, on the night of July
                    31, his cavalry, with a large supporting force of infantry, crossed the
                    Rappahannock at Rappahannock Station and Kelly's Ford.</p>
<p>The next day they advanced toward Brandy Station, their progress being gallantly
                    resisted by Gen. Stuart with Hampton's brigade, commanded by Col. L. S. Baker,
                    who fell back gradually to our lines, about 2 miles south of Brandy. Our
                    infantry skirmishers advanced, and drove the enemy beyond Brandy Station. It was
                    now determined to place the army in a position to enable it more readily to
                    oppose the enemy should he attempt to move southward, that near Culpeper
                    Court-House being one that he could easily avoid. Longstreet and Hill were put
                    in motion August 3, leaving the cavalry at Culpeper.</p>
<p>Ewell had been previously ordered from Madison, and, by the 4th, the army
                    occupied the line of the Rapidan.</p>
<p>The highest praise is due to both officers and men for their conduct during the
                    campaign. The privations and hardships of the march and camp were cheerfully
                    encountered, and borne with a fortitude unsurpassed by our ancestors in their
                    struggle for independence, while their courage in battle entitles them to rank
                    with the soldiers of any army and of any time. Their forbearance and discipline,
                    under strong provocation to retaliate for the cruelty of the enemy to our own
                    citizens, is not their least claim to the respect and admiration of their
                    countrymen and of the world.</p>
<p>I forward returns of our loss in killed, wounded, and missing. Many of the latter
                    were killed or wounded in the several assaults at Gettysburg, and necessarily
                    left in the hands of the enemy. I cannot speak of these brave men as their
                    merits and exploits deserve. Some of them are appropriately mentioned in the
                    accompanying reports, and the memory of all will be gratefully and
                    affectionately cherished by the people in whose defense they fell.</p>
<p>The loss of Maj.-Gen. Pender is severely felt by the army and the country. He
                    served with this army from the beginning of the war, and took a distinguished
                    part in all its engagements. Wounded on several occasions, he never left his
                    command in action until he received the injury that resulted in his death. His
                    promise and usefulness as an officer were only equaled by the purity and
                    excellence of his private life.</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen.'s Armistead, Barksdale, Garnett, and Semmes died as they had lived,
                    discharging the highest duty of patriots with devotion that never faltered and
                    courage that shrank from no danger.</p>
<p>I earnestly commend to the attention of the Government those gallant officers and
                    men whose conduct merited the special commendation of their superiors, but whose
                    names I am unable to mention in this report.</p>
<p>The officers of the general staff of the army were unremittingly engaged in the
                    duties of their respective departments. Much depended on their management and
                    exertion. The labors of the quartermaster's, commissary, and medical departments
                    were more than usually severe. The inspectors-general were also laboriously
                    occupied in their attention to the troops, both on the march and in camp, and
                    the officers of engineers showed skill and judgment in expediting the passage of
                    rivers and streams, the swollen condition of which, by almost continuous rains,
                    called for extraordinary exertion.</p>
<p>The chief of ordnance and his assistants are entitled to praise for the care and
                    watchfulness given to the ordnance trains and ammunition of the army, which, in
                    a long march and in many conflicts, were always at hand and accessible to the
                    troops.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to my personal staff for their constant aid afforded me at all
                    times, on the march and in the field, and their willing discharge of every duty.</p>
<p>There were captured at Gettysburg nearly 7,000 prisoners, of whom about 1,500
                    were paroled, and the remainder brought to Virginia. Seven pieces of artillery
                    were also secured.</p>
<p>I forward herewith the reports of the corps, division, and other commanders
                    mentioned in the accompanying schedule, together with maps of the scene of
                    operations, and one showing the routes pursued by the army.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
