<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel William B. Taliaferro writes S. M. Barton in November, 1861,
                    concerning the return of Taliaferro's men to Staunton. Taliferro makes
                    arrangements to have deserters arrested in the town, and to have supplies sent
                    to meet him.</p>

<p>HDQRS.,</p>
<p>Col. S. M. BARTON,<br> Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>McDowell, Va.,</p>
<p>November 28, 1861.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>The troops under my command reached this place yesterday en route to Staunton,
                    and we expected to move this morning for Ryan's, but at 8 o'clock last night I
                    received the communication from Col. C. L. Stevenson, acting assistant
                    adjutant-general, which is inclosed, and acting under the suggestions of that
                    officer have halted here to-day,expecting to hear definitely from the general
                    commanding this evening. It is a sad disappointment to the command, but I trust
                    should orders come to retrace our steps they will be obeyed without much
                    murmuring. I inclose you a list of those who have gone on or gone off without
                    leave, and trust you will attend to having them arrested on their arrival at
                    Staunton and confined until we reach that place, or sent back should we be
                    ordered to Monterey. The commissary at Monterey made arrangements with the
                    commissary at Staunton for a supply of beef to meet us at Buffalo gap. I beg you
                    will see that the cattle, if sent as directed to meet us on the evening of the
                    29th, shall not be butchered, as we certainly shall not reach that point before
                    the 30th, and may not go at all. I sent the sick and convalescents who were
                    unable to stand the march and the inclement weather on to Staunton in advance,
                    acting upon the advice of the surgeons.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. B. TALIAFERRO,<br> Col., Cmdg. Troops at McDowell.</p>
