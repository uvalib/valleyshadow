<p>Maj. F. J. PORTER,<br> A. A. G., Hdqrs. Dep't of
                        Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa.:</p>
<p>FRANKFORD ARSENAL,</p>
<p>May 23, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>In answer to your letter of to-day I have the honor to state, for the information
                    of the general commanding, that only two thousand two hundred and ninety-nine
                    sets of round-ball accouterments are to be received from the Philadelphia
                    manufacturers. I will be able to equip the Seventh Regiment, at Chambersburg,
                    to-morrow, and the Eighth and Tenth Regiments probably early next week.</p>
<p>As I have no further orders for accouterments to give out, my further supply will
                    be derived from Newark, from a contract recently made to deliver twenty thousand
                    sets at this arsenal, dated May 15, at the rate of eight hundred or more sets
                    per week, the first delivery to be made in ten days from date of contract. I
                    will also receive from the Philadelphia makers eight thousand five hundred sets
                    of elongated-ball accouterments, and will be able to equip regiments requiring
                    these at the rate of about three thousand sets per week. I have communicated
                    with the Newark contractor for twenty thousand, requiring him to deliver first
                    five thousand sets of round ball accouterments, and requesting him to send here
                    as soon as possible any of this or any other kind he may have ready. Three
                    thousand sets of round-ball accouterments, ordered to Washington Arsenal, have
                    delayed the supplying of the Pennsylvania regiments from this arsenal. I will
                    fill the requisitions in the order designated in your letter as rapidly as the
                    stores are received.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>T. J. TREADWELL,<br> First Lieut. of Ordnance.</p>
