<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch reports from Chambersburg to General David Hunter
                    regarding the situation in Maryland and southern Pennsylvania in July, 1864.
                    Couch reports cavalry fighting in Maryland, and describes the arrival of the
                    Hagerstown quartermaster at Chambersburg with a large supply column.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. HUNTER,<br> Cmdg. Dept. of West Virginia,
                        Cumberland, Md.:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 19, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inform you that a few cavalrymen of this department have been
                    scouting and fighting some in Maryland. More will be ordered along the line near
                    Greencastle, Waynesborough, and Emmitsburg. As this cavalry is mostly new and
                    unacquainted with the country it will be necessary for them to extend their
                    reconnaissance into the adjacent State of Maryland in order that they make
                    themselves thoroughly acquainted with the roads and general features of the
                    country, to which I trust you will have no objection. At 11 p. m. on the evening
                    of the 3d instant Capt. Hopkins, assistant quartermaster at Hagerstown, appeared
                    at my headquarters, Chambersburg, at the head of a train of wagons, loose
                    horses, mules, &amp;c., extending below Greencastle. About 150 of strays
                    were gathered by my orders the next day. I consider that this officer shamefully
                    abandoned his post and Government property, and have no words to express to you
                    my indignation at his conduct.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Department.</p>
