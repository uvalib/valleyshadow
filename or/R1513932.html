<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel S. M. Barton writes Colonel Taliaferro concerning operations

<p></p>
<p>Col. W. B. TALIAFERRO,<br> Cmdg. Troops en route for
                        Staunton:</p>
<p>Staunton,</p>
<p>November 28, 1861.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Col. Harman has forwarded, I believe, some telegrams from Richmond entirely
                    changing all plans heretofore made for your command. Gen. Jackson left here this
                    morning, and I inclose you a copy of the telegram sent by me in duplicate to
                    him. Not having received a reply, I think it not improbable that he deems it
                    unnecessary to make one till he can explain the state of affairs to the War
                    Department. The exhaustion of the teams, the inadequacy of the transportation
                    suggested, the bad state of the roads, and the extreme weather are matters that,
                    I think, are not understood in Richmond. The troops, under the first order,
                    divested themselves of all baggage that could not be transported with them.
                    Under the next they left with only "the necessary camp equipage and ammunition,"
                    with the expectation of going by rail on arriving at Staunton after a short
                    march. They are, therefore, unprovided to encounter the privations and
                    sufferings of so long a march as that contemplated by the telegram. I am
                    informed that you gain about twenty-two miles by turning off the turnpike near
                    Ryan's. I therefore feel authorized by the general supervision of this office
                    intrusted to me to direct that you halt your command a few hours that you may
                    receive orders for your future movements, beginning leave to suggest that you
                    gain much time by sending forward a pioneer party to repair the road in your
                    front, which I learn is much washed. An express will start for you immediately
                    upon receipt of a reply from Richmond.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully,</p>
<p>S. M. BARTON,<br> Lieut.-Col., Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
