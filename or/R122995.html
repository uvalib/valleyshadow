<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During July, 1861, Confederates in the Valley sought to stop Union General George
                    B. McClellan's advance through what is now West Virginia. Staunton served as an
                    important depot and rail center during the campaign. In this letter, Confederate
                    General Joseph E. Johnston mentions troops sent through Staunton to meet
                    McClellan.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS,</p>
<p>Gen. COOPER?</p>
<p>Manassas,</p>
<p>July 23, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>I respectfully inclose herewith a note just received from Col. Stuart. The
                    President knows the person from whom the colonel received the information and
                    the value of his statements. He came with a Mr. Magraw to as permission to come
                    within our lines to look for the body of a friend; taking this course, they
                    said, because a rule established by their authorities forbids flags of truce in
                    such cases. Col. Stuart is directed to treat them as prisoners. Should they be
                    permitted to go to the North from Richmond, I suggest that the sea furnished
                    their best route.</p>
<p>The last paragraph indicates a diversion in Western Virginia effected by the
                    recent battle.</p>
<p>Col. A. W. McDonald has just reported to me, and been ordered to repair through
                    Staunton to the forces assembling to operate against the troops commanded by
                    McClellan.</p>
<p>Most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. E. JOHNSTON,<br> Brig.-Gen., C. S. Army.</p>
