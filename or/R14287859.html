<p>Lieut. Col. W. H. TAYLOR,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Army of Northern Virginia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>February 28, 1865.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>About August 10, Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's division of cavalry having received orders
                    to join Gen. Early in the Valley, Johnston's and Shoemaker's batteries marched
                    with the division, Capt. Johnston in command, Maj. Breathed having been wounded
                    in a skirmish on June 29. This force reached Front Royal on August 14, and
                    henceforward participated in Gen. Early's campaign. Nothing material occurred on
                    the Petersburg line until August 18. On that day Brander's battery, Pegram's
                    battalion, accompanied Heth's division and was warmly engaged in an attack upon
                    the enemy at the Davis house, on the Weldon railroad. The next day Lieut.-Col.
                    Pegram was sent with three of his batteries to co-operate with Gen.'s Heth and
                    Mahone in another attack at the same point. His battalion again participated on
                    the 21st in an attack at Poplar Spring Church. Again on the 24th Col. Pegram was
                    directed with Brander's and Cayce's batteries, of his own battalion, Ross', of
                    Lane's, and sections of Hurt's and Clutter's, of McIntosh's to accompany the
                    column sent to attack the enemy at Reams' Station, on the Weldon railroad.
                    Success was marked on this occasion, and due in no small degree to the
                    efficiency of Col. Pegram and the good conduct of his officers and men.</p>
<p>From September 14 to 30 Hart's and McGregor's batteries, and Graham's previously
                    connected with Gen. Beauregard's command, participated in several spirited
                    affairs of the cavalry on our right flank, under command of Gen. Hampton.
                    Desultory skirmishing continued along the lines during this month and the
                    following with no further movement of importance till September 29. On that day
                    the enemy commenced more vigorous operations on the north side of James River,
                    and succeeded in carrying, chiefly by surprise, a commanding salient of our
                    works, known as Fort Harrison, not far from Chaffin's Bluff. To meet this
                    advance of the enemy, forces were promptly moved from Petersburg. Maj. Johnson,
                    of McIntosh's battalion, marched the same evening in command of Clutter's
                    battery, of his own battalion, and the Fredericksburg Artillery, of Pegram's
                    battalion, and the next morning Haskell's battalion moved also to co-operate
                    with the troops north of the James. Gen. Alexander accompanied the expedition to
                    command the artillery. Lieut.-Col. Hardaway, commanding his own battalion, and
                    Maj. Stark's, previously of Lieut.-Col. Pemberton's command, reported at once to
                    Gen. Alexander. The field artillery on that line had been left in his charge,
                    when Col. Carter repaired under orders on September 2 to Gen. Early's army in
                    the Valley as his chief of artillery in place of Gen. Long, disabled by
                    sickness. These battalions (Hardaway's and Stark's, Haskell's and Johnson's)
                    constituted an effective artillery force for operations on that front.
                    Hardaway's and Stark's battalions co-operated as far as practicable, though,
                    from the nature of the ground and the course of the lines and the position of
                    the enemy, they could accomplish but little in the unsuccessful attempt to
                    recover Fort Harrison on the 30th; and in the attack, resumed for the same
                    purpose on October 1 Haskell's guns were added to them and posted as favorably
                    as possible, Lamkin's company, experienced in mortar practice at Petersburg,
                    having charge of a number of mortars. The attack being abandoned and defensive
                    measures resumed, Johnson's and Haskell's guns were posted for use as occasion
                    might arise. Lamkin's mortars remained, as they have done ever since, in
                    position bearing on Fort Harrison. While these occurrences transpired on the
                    lines below Richmond active movements were also going on upon the right of our
                    line below Petersburg. Lieut.-Col. Pegram, with Brander's and Ellett's
                    batteries, participated in an attack made by Heth upon the enemy's left. On the
                    following day (October 1), with Brander's and Cayce's batteries, he again took
                    part in the combined attack of Heth and Wilcox. Col. Pegram warmly commends
                    Capt. Brander and Lieut. Hollis, commanding these batteries, for their gallantry
                    and efficiency on this occasion. On the day succeeding (2d) the enemy, attacking
                    Heth's line, was effectually repulsed by the vigorous co-operation of Ellett's
                    battery with the infantry, Cayce's and Gregg's batteries also assisting from
                    their respective positions. On October 8 (7) Haskell's and Johnson's battalions,
                    north of James River, shared in the repulse of the enemy by our troops on the
                    Darbytown and New Market roads, and performed their part with accustomed energy
                    and success. On this occasion Maj. Haskell, narrowly escaping with his life,
                    received a grazing wound on the head from a minie-ball, and Lieut. McQueen, of
                    one of his batteries (Garden's), was severely wounded.</p>
<p>Haskell's battalion, under Capt. Garden, was again slightly engaged on the 12th
                    (13th) in repelling feeble attacks of the enemy. Corporal Fulsher, of Flanner's
                    battery, performed on this occasion a service deserving of special mention to
                    his honor. Explosion having occurred among some ammunition improperly exposed,
                    wounding six men, this soldier, though himself wounded, caught up several shells
                    with burning fuses and extinguished them in a pool of water near by, and this
                    when other shells were bursting around him.</p>
<p>On October 27 the enemy made a simultaneous attack on our lines below Richmond
                    and on our right flank beyond Petersburg. His advance below Richmond was general
                    and in considerable force. It was, however, repelled with comparative ease, the
                    artillery rendering as usual, its share of service. Haskell's and Johnson's
                    battalions operated against the enemy's flanking on our extreme left as far as
                    the Williamsburg and even the Nine-Mile road, and thence across to Charles City
                    road. Hardaway's and Starks' battalions met the direct attack on their front
                    between the Darbytown road and Fort Harrison. On this occasion Lieut. C. H.
                    Wilkes, commanding Clutter's battery while gallantly discharging his duty, fell
                    at his post mortally wounded. No further attempt has since been made by the
                    enemy on the line north of James River, and the field artillery has remained
                    there, with supporting troops, quietly awaiting such further service as future
                    operations of the enemy may render necessary.</p>
<p>The enemy on October 27 experience on the extreme right below Petersburg as
                    serious reverse as on the left below Richmond. Early in the day, when
                    encountered by the cavalry alone, his numbers proved of avail to advance,
                    gradually pressing back our horsemen to and across the Boydton plank road.
                    Hart's battery, resolutely served, rendered valuable service in checking that
                    advance. Is faithful commander, Capt. Hart, received in the engagement a severe
                    wound. Subsequently McGregor's and Graham's batteries effectively co-operated in
                    the combined attack which drove back the enemy in confusion and with a heavy
                    loss. Two of Lieut.-Col. Pegram's batteries (Ellett's, under Lieut. Hollis, and
                    Gregg's) also participated in the sharp conflict on this wing that afternoon,
                    Gregg's battery being partially and Ellett's sharply engaged and contributing to
                    the success of the day. After this signal reverse the enemy for some time
                    attempted no movement of consequence, though skirmishing and shelling were
                    continuously practiced on considerable portions of the lines, and at times with
                    much severity.</p>
<p>On December 7 an extensive raid by a large force of the enemy being in progress
                    along the Weldon railroad, toward Belfield and beyond, our cavalry hastened to
                    arrest the operation, attended by Hart's, McGregor's, and Graham's batteries.
                    Their guns were effectual in repelling the enemy at Hicksford and admonishing
                    him speedily to retrace his steps. Our infantry column, which followed in
                    pursuit of this raiding force, was accompanied by four batteries, under
                    Lieut.-Col. Pegram and Maj. Owen. They were not able to obtain a fair
                    opportunity at the enemy, or more than a slight skirmish, owing to his prompt
                    retreat, and after a tour of seven days' extremely hard service, in severe
                    weather and through roads scarcely passable, returned to camp. This effort
                    closed the campaign. Nothing significant has since transpired.</p>
<p>While the campaign around Richmond and Petersburg had thus progressed to its
                    close, that portion of our army detached under Gen. Early on June 18, and
                    operating mainly in the Valley of Virginia, had been engaged in a series of
                    movements and conflicts of very great importance the artillery performing
                    throughout a conspicuous part. Nelson's and Braxton's battalions (Second Corps),
                    which accompanied the expedition to Lynchburg to meet Hunter, though marching
                    with great effort, could not reach that place in time to deal a decisive blow to
                    that atrocious dispenser of fire and fury to the defenseless. He had hastily
                    retreated. Gen. Early was making as rapidly as possible toward the Ohio. On June
                    22 these two battalions joined the artillery of Gen. Breckinridge's command, and
                    all the other troops under Gen. Early near Salem in Roanoke County. Thence the
                    Army of the Valley moved by the direct route to Staunton. Here in the delay of
                    two days which occurred some judicious adjustments in his command were made by
                    Gen. Long, chief of artillery, Second Corps. Leaving Maj. Leyden, of the
                    Department of Southwestern Virginia, in charge of a reserve camp of batteries
                    least efficient, he fitted out with the best guns McLaughlin's battalion and a
                    force of horse artillery. The army thus moved from Staunton for the lower Valley
                    with three efficient battalions of artillery-Nelson's, Braxton's, and
                    McLaughlin's-under Lieut.-Col. King, having forty reliable guns well equipped,
                    and ten additional also well provided, to serve with the cavalry. Encountering
                    little resistance on any part of the route, Gen. Early's forces crossed the
                    Potomac into Maryland, at Shepherdstown, on July 5 and 6. On the morning of the
                    9th they advanced upon Fredericktown. The enemy had evacuated that place, but
                    was found in force on the line of the Monocacy a mile or two to the east, the
                    railroad bridge and the ford below, on the Georgetown road, being the principal
                    points of demonstration. Here a number of our guns were judiciously posted to
                    bear upon the opposite side and operated with great effect, when McCausland's
                    cavalry and Gordon's infantry, having crossed the stream, attacked the enemy and
                    were met by him in line of battle at right angles to the river. Taken in flank
                    and reverse by our artillery, the enemy's line immediately gave way and was soon
                    routed and driven from the ford and bridge. The victory was complete.</p>
<p>Officers and men of the artillery behaved on this occasion with accustomed
                    fidelity. Lieut.-Col.'s Nelson, Braxton, and King and Maj. McLaughlin were
                    engaged throughout the day in maneuvering and fighting their commands. With the
                    exception of Lieut. Hobson, of Kirkpatrick's battery (an officer beloved for his
                    worth and admired for his gallantry), who was killed by a musket-ball near the
                    close of the action, and Lieut. Southall, acting assistant adjutant-general,
                    painfully wounded, the loss in the artillery on this occasion was slight.</p>
<p>The artillery subsequently accompanied the army in its demonstration against
                    Washington City; then with it recrossed the Potomac at White's Ford on the 14th,
                    and encamped for a few days at Leesburg; thence it proceeded across the Blue
                    Ridge at Snicker's Gap, encamped near Berryville, and held the adjacent fords of
                    the Shenandoah. King's battalion was here engaged in repelling an attempt of the
                    enemy to cross at Castleman's Ferry. From this position the army retired before
                    the enemy's force, the main body moving by White Post to Newtown. Lieut.-Col.
                    Nelson, however, with two batteries accompanied Ramseur's division to
                    Winchester. Ramseur attacked the enemy but was unsuccessful, and Kirkpatrick's
                    battery was lost. The guns had been advanced so close to the enemy that it was
                    impossible to withdraw them when the infantry gave way. Col. Nelson and his
                    command elicited warm commendations for their gallantry in this affair.</p>
<p>Gen. Early, after retiring to Strasburg and allowing the enemy to occupy
                    Winchester and push his advance to Newtown, turned upon him a few days later and
                    drove him in great haste through Winchester toward Martinsburg. His retreat was
                    so rapid that little punishment could be inflicted on him. Gen. Early
                    subsequently pursued him across the Potomac at Williamsport, but so returned
                    into Virginia, and after some time resumed position at Strasburg. During these
                    movements the artillery could do little more than march and counter-march.</p>
<p>Sheridan now commanded the enemy in the Valley. Gen. Early moved back before his
                    large force to Fisher's Hill and took position. Meanwhile re-enforcements
                    arrived for Gen. Early. Cutshaw's battalion of artillery, accompanying Gen.
                    Anderson with Kershaw's division of infantry, and Johnston's and Shoemaker's
                    batteries of horse artillery, accompanying Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's division of
                    cavalry, reached Front Royal on the 14th, and were engaged in driving off the
                    enemy on the 15th. The enemy, after demonstrating a few days in front of
                    Fisher's Hill, retired. Gen. Early again pursued, and, driving out of Winchester
                    the force there remaining, once more occupied the town. The artillery was but
                    little used on this advance. Gen. Long, being now taken ill, turned over the
                    command of the artillery to Lieut.-Col. Nelson on August 19, and Capt.
                    Kirkpatrick came into command of Nelson's battalion. The enemy, still with
                    occasional skirmishers, in which our artillery took part, retired, and reached
                    Harper's Ferry on the 21st.</p>
<p>Our troops remained in the neighborhood of Charlestown till the 25th. Moving
                    thence to Shepherdstown, the army afterward encamped at Bunker Hill, and on the
                    31st Milledge's and Massie's batteries accompanied Rodes' division to
                    Martinsburg, and Massie's was engaged with the enemy's cavalry and artillery.
                    Kirkpatrick's battery received guns in place of those lost July 20. The army
                    then moved to and encamped near Stephenson's Depot.</p>
<p>September 9 Col. Carter, having been detached from his immediate command below
                    Richmond, arrived and took command of the artillery with Gen. Early's army, in
                    place of Gen. Long, disabled by sickness. From this date to the 19th several
                    movements occurred, with considerable skirmishing on the line toward
                    Martinsburg.</p>
<p>On the 19th was fought a sanguinary battle near Winchester. Ramseur's division,
                    aided by Col. Nelson's artillery, first received Sheridan's attack on the
                    Berryville turnpike, and well held their ground. Braxton's battalion, artillery,
                    with Rodes' and Gordon's divisions, was then hurried up and posted on Ramseur's
                    left, and received the concentrated assault hurled against that point. The
                    artillery did noble service. Nelson's guns held back the enemy on the right and
                    enabled Ramseur's infantry to rally after being much broken; and Braxton's
                    pieces, in the center, were equally effective, sweeping from the field the
                    enemy's masses as they rushed on, pursuing Gordon's yielding line, and enabling
                    a portion of Rodes' division to dash in and drive back their shattered column a
                    considerable distance. Unhappily the accomplished division commander, Gen.
                    Rodes, here fell when his practiced skill was greatly needed. Meanwhile
                    Breckinridge's division, with King's artillery battalion, which had held the
                    Martinsburg turnpike, was removed toward the right and Gen.'s Fitzhugh Lee and
                    Lomax left to withstand the enemy's large force of cavalry. This, however,
                    becoming, impracticable one of Breckinridge's brigades was detached to aid Gen.
                    Lee in keeping back the enemy's cavalry. At the same time the enemy's main force
                    was massed nearer to their cavalry and advanced on Gordon's left. This
                    necessarily gave ground to the rear, and our whole left wing swung back nearly
                    at right angles to the original front, Braxton's guns at the salient still
                    maintaining their hold and doing noble service. King's battalion held a hill in
                    rear of Breckinridge's line, fronting to the left, and Breathed's guns, of the
                    Horse Artillery, were operating with good effect from point as occasion offered.
                    Late in the day the right was still steady, but the left was becoming more and
                    critical. The enemy's cavalry in driving back Fitzhugh Lee's small force dashed
                    through the infantry brigade sent to his support and captured many of its men.
                    Our left still receding, the center became more and more salient, and had also
                    to be gradually drawn back. The retrograde movement was, of course, each time
                    more difficult and the infantry was becoming unmanageable.</p>
<p>Fortunately (says Col. Carter), the artillery was under perfect control to the
                    last, and maneuvered and fought with untiring courage. The guns retired from
                    point to point, halting, unlimbering, and firing, while efforts were made by
                    general officers to rally the infantry.</p>
<p>Near the close of the day Col. Carter received a painful wound from a fragment of
                    shell, which compelled him to turn over the command of the artillery to
                    Lieut.-Col. Nelson. Happily, it did not permanently disable him. For a fuller
                    account of the battle I refer to Col. Carter's intelligent and interesting
                    report. It is, however, just that one or two more of his important statements be
                    here quoted:</p>
<p>The whole army (he adds) will testify to the stout resistance made by the
                    artillery in this long and exhausting struggle. It may be safely said that had
                    the other arms of service done their duty as faithfully as did the artillery the
                    army might have rested afterward on the Potomac. Our loss of the day was mainly
                    due to the enemy's immense excess in cavalry. This, by enveloping our left,
                    forced it steadily back and ultimately compelled the abandonment of the field.
                    For a strictly defensive battle as this soon became I had not artillery enough.
                    Another artillery battalion to have held the Martinsburg turnpike and the
                    heights northwest of Winchester would have prevented the fatal progress of the
                    enemy's cavalry.</p>
<p>Three guns were lost on this occasion-two lent by Lieut.-Col. King to the
                    cavalry, and another from the same battalion late in the evening on the retreat.
                    Cutshaw's battalion was all the time absent with Kershaw's division on an
                    expedition resisting a force of the enemy east of the Blue Ridge in Fauquier and
                    Culpeper Counties.</p>
<p>After this serious reverse of September 19 the army retired during the night, and
                    reaching Fisher's Hill, beyond Strasburg, formed line of battle early on the
                    20th, King's guns on the right, Braxton's next and Nelson's still farther to the
                    left. Owing to some misapprehension or oversight certain precautions recommended
                    by the acting chief of artillery in adjusting the line on the left, where the
                    enemy's movements indicated his chief attack was to be made, were neglected and
                    the result proved again disastrous.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 22d the enemy made a dash upon our extreme left, occupied
                    by Gen. Lomax's cavalry. It soon gave way, and the enemy swept down the line,
                    capturing 4 of Nelson's 2 guns, from Lomax's Horse Artillery, 7 of Braxton's and
                    1 of King's-14 in all. Yet the artillery was not in fault. Col. Nelson affirms
                    that they did their duty fully and efficiently, as testified by all officers and
                    men who had opportunity to observe. All was brought off which could possibly be
                    secured, and while retiring halted, unlimbered and checked the enemy from point
                    to point, that the trains might be gotten safely to the rear.</p>
<p>The army still moved back on the 24th beyond New Market retiring in line of
                    battle, and portions of each artillery battalion from time to time taking
                    position and operating effectually in keeping the enemy in check. While
                    assisting in keeping the enemy at bay, about seven miles from New Market, Capt.
                    John. L. Massie, of Nelson's battalion-a gentleman of fine character, superior
                    powers, and high culture, a soldier of tried merit, and a battery commander
                    unsurpassed in the service-received a mortal wound. Lieut. N. B. Cooke, a
                    promising young officer of Braxton's battalion, was also wounded.</p>
<p>The army then deflected toward Port Republic, and arriving at Brown's Gap on the
                    25th encamped. Here it was joined on the 26th by Kershaw's division and
                    Cutshaw's artillery battalion. On the same day Col. Carter again reported for
                    duty and resumed command of the artillery. Carpenter's and Hardwicke's batteries
                    were engaged in skirmishers near Port Republic on the 26th and 27th.</p>
<p>On the 28th the army was again put in motion, and marched by Waynesborough to
                    Mount Sidney, and thence slowly down the Valley, the advance reaching Hupp's
                    Hill, below Strasburg, on October 13. Here an affair occurred between a force of
                    the enemy and Gordon's division with Conner's brigade, of Kershaw's division,
                    attended by Fry's battery. In this affair the enemy was repulsed, with
                    considerable loss. Lieut. S. S. France, acting adjutant to Col. Carter, was on
                    this occasion severely wounded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the cavalry marched by the back road, and on the morning of the 8th
                    encountered the enemy. Thomson's and Johnston's guns were used with good effect
                    to the last. Their supports giving way at critical moment the six guns were
                    lost. As on other occasions the artillery officers and men faithfully did their
                    duty.</p>
<p>On the next day (October 9) Shoemaker's battery and a section of Thomson's
                    accompanying Lomax's cavalry as a guard to the wagon train on the Valley
                    turnpike near Woodstock, were greatly exposed by the irresolution of the
                    cavalry, but were all, except one of Thomson's guns, saved by the extraordinary
                    gallantry of artillery officers and men. On this occasion Capt. Carpenter, of
                    Braxton's battalion, was particularly distinguished. Observing the hazard
                    occasioned by the failure of the cavalry, he pressed forward as a volunteer, and
                    by judicious intrepidity succeeded in rallying a few of the fugitives so as
                    again and again to keep the enemy at bay. He thus contributed materially toward
                    rescuing the guns and saving the trains. I regret to add that in this gallant
                    service he received a painful wound resulting in the loss of an arm.</p>
<p>On October 19, at a very early hour, the artillery was moved forward with the
                    main body of the army to attack the enemy beyond Cedar Creek and by 10 a.m.
                    remarkable results had been achieved. Two corps of the enemy had been surprised
                    and routed, their camps captured and they driven from the field. The Sixth Corps
                    had been dislodged from its strong position near Middletown chiefly by the fire
                    of our artillery, and the whole hostile army driven three or four miles.
                    Twenty-four pieces of artillery by the enemy's admission (17 are known to us)
                    had been captured, and some 1,500 prisoners. There was a lull from 10 to 3.30
                    p.m. our line of battle ranging across the turnpike at right angles north of
                    Middletown, Wofford's brigade on the right, then Wharton, the Pegram crossing
                    the turnpike, then Ramseur considerably in advance, then Kershaw, then Gordon,
                    then an interval of about a mile, and then Rosser's cavalry, which, with
                    Thomson's battery, had joined Gen. Early on his last advance after October 1.</p>
<p>About 3 p.m. six of Cutshaw's pieces and two of Jones' were posted to guard the
                    interval between Gordon and Rosser. On the enemy's attack at 3.30 Gordon's line
                    gave way and the guns were retired by Gen. Gordon's order. The guns operating
                    with the other divisions held their positions until the left gave way. They were
                    then posted on commanding ground 100 to 200 yards in rear, and aided by a small
                    infantry force, held the enemy in check for more than an hour and until
                    ammunition failed. Other guns were posted on the heights south of Cedar Creek to
                    cover the withdrawal of the infantry and artillery from the field.</p>
<p>An important victory had thus been strangely reversed, but everything was brought
                    safely across Cedar Creek. Night had come and no further danger was apprehended.
                    But a more serious disaster now occurred. The artillery being on the march in
                    column toward Hupp's Hill, a small body of the enemy's cavalry charged the train
                    on the right flank and by their bugle blasts, cheers, horses' feet clattering,
                    and pistol shots in the darkness, occasioned an incurable panic in the infantry,
                    already seriously disorganized. The artillery officers and men appealed in vain
                    for muskets, with which they would have stoutly and effectually defended their
                    guns. They could not secure them, and the result was a large capture by the
                    enemy, as elating to them as it was disgraceful to us. All the guns taken from
                    the enemy in the morning and 23 of our own fell into their hands. "One hundred
                    men in an organized state, with muskets," Col. Carter thinks, "could have saved
                    the train." As it was, the loss would not have been so great but for a very
                    narrow passage south of Strasburg, between the river on one side and the bluff
                    on the other, and had not the road been blocked with ordnance wagons,
                    ambulances, and 1,400 prisoners, and the difficulty of proceeding been increased
                    by the breaking of the bridge near Strasburg. This instance suggests the
                    desirableness of having a certain proportion of artillerymen ever armed with
                    carbines, at least when serving in campaigns like this of the Valley.</p>
<p>It is due to these admirable soldiers to state that on this occasion, as
                    previously they behaved with exemplary fidelity. Officers and men did their
                    whole duty, and throughout remained uninfluenced by the general panic.</p>
<p>After this misfortune the army retreated to New Market, in the neighborhood of
                    which it remained with occasional advances and skirmishes with the enemy, in
                    which the artillery slightly participated, until the last of November, when it
                    withdrew to the neighborhood of Harrisonburg; and active operations having
                    ceased for the season, the artillery subsequently went into winter quarters not
                    far from Staunton.</p>
<p>In the whole of the eventful campaign of 1864 the artillery of the Army of
                    Northern Virginia bore, it will be perceived, a distinguished part and in every
                    portion of the widely extended field of operation rendered signal service. In
                    common with other arms, in so great a contest against vastly preponderating
                    numbers, it again and again suffered severely, having many valuable officers and
                    men killed and wounded and horses destroyed, and in two or three unfortunate
                    affairs an unusual number of guns captured, making our loss in guns considerable
                    on the whole, though in several instances valuable captures were made from the
                    enemy. But it has everywhere and at all times proved reliable, how great severe
                    the emergency. In the wildest fury of battle, under ceaseless harassment and
                    exposure from sharpshooters and shelling on the lines on the toilsome march,
                    amid all the hardships of the trenches through summer, fall, and winter, and
                    when steadily breasting the tide of reverse against friends unnerved or
                    overpowered and foes flushed with triumph the brave officers and men of this
                    branch of our army have almost without exception exemplified the very highest
                    virtues of Christian soldiers battling for their faith, their honor, and their
                    homes.</p>
<p>To mention all who have thus admirably done their duty would be well night to
                    repeat the rolls of our battalions and companies. I can only designate those
                    chief commanders whose position has necessarily rendered their services most
                    conspicuous, and refer to their reports and this of their sub-commanders for
                    fuller details. Gen. Long, until disabled by sickness managed his command
                    (artillery Second Corps) with characteristic judgment and vigor; and Col. Carter
                    who then succeeded him, earned, as usual, high encomiums for the care, sagacity,
                    and skill, as well as boldness, with which he handled the command, as also did
                    Lieut.-Col. Nelson during the brief but important intervals in which the command
                    devolved upon him. Gen. Alexander, ever active, full of resources, energetic,
                    and enterprising, conducted his command (artillery First Corps) at all times
                    with skill and success, and in the interval of his absence from a disabling
                    wound his place was well supplied on one part of his line by Col. Cabell, on
                    another by Lieut.-Col. Huger. Col. Walker, zealous, bold, and vigorous, directed
                    his force (artillery Third Corps) with efficiency throughout the campaign, and
                    was aided in his responsible charge by the judicious co-operation of Col. Cutts;
                    and Col. Jones, first as chief of artillery of Gen. Beauregard's command, and
                    subsequently of Gen. Anderson's corps, earned high commendation by diligent,
                    intelligent, and successful attention to his arduous trust on a portion of the
                    line most exposed and harassed during all the latter months of the campaign.</p>
<p>These officers speak in high term of their subordinates and of the men in their
                    respective commands, and describe instances more than a few of extraordinary
                    good conduct and admirable achievement. Their reports and those of battalion
                    commanders are herewith submitted.</p>
<p>Of the several members of my own staff-Capt. Dudlely D. Pendleton, assistant
                    adjutant-general; Lieut. George W. Peterkin and Acting Lieut. . Charles Hatcher,
                    aides-de-camp; Capt. John Esten Cooke and Lieut. E. P. Dandridge, assistant
                    inspectors-general; Maj. John G. Barnwell, ordnance officer; Dr. John Graham,
                    surgeon, and Maj. John Page, quartermaster-it is just I should say that they
                    have uniformly discharged their duties with faithful alacrity and to my entire
                    satisfaction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am enabled to report that our artillery remains at the close of
                    this arduous campaign in a condition of most encouraging efficiency, and that
                    with reasonable effort toward supplying it with a few guns, to replace some lost
                    in unfortunate affairs that have been described, and with horses to
                    re-established a number of teams disabled in action or worn down by hard
                    service, it will be in full strength for the campaign of the ensuing spring. It
                    may be confidently relied upon to accomplish, by the Divine blessing, during the
                    next season, as it has so well done through the last, its entire share in the
                    defense of our country.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. N. PENDLETON,<br> Brig. Gen. and Chief of Artillery, Army of
                        Northern Virginia.</p>
