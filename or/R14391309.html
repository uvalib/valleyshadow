<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Phil Sheridan reports to Chief of Staff Halleck on October, 1864,

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>WOODSTOCK, VA.,</p>
<p>October 7, 1864--3 p.m.<br> (Received 8 p.m. 8th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your telegram of 3d received. I had one small division of cavalry in the Luray
                    Valley at Luray. From this I sent a party of 400 picked men to destroy the
                    bridge over the Rapidan. The balance of the division passed down to Millwood,
                    cleaning out the valley entire from Swift Gap to Millwood. They were driving
                    before them 3,000 head of stock. I directed the occupation of Chester Gap and
                    Front Royal, and will send additional force around via Strasburg. Under the
                    present condition of affairs here I do not deem the occupation of Thornton's Gap
                    as important, and it would very much weaken my force. I would not have advised
                    the opening of the road to Front Royal. For further particulars, I refer you to
                    my telegram of this date to Gen. Grant. I have been unable to communicate more
                    frequently on account of the operations of guerrillas in my rear. They have
                    attacked every party, and I have sent my dispatches with a view of economizing
                    as much as possible. Rebel papers speak of a battle at New Hope; it is
                    untruthful. I made a demonstration on Brown's Gap on that day with a small party
                    of cavalry, in order to cover Torbert's movements on Staunton and Waynesborough,
                    and drew out Kershaw's division and some other troops, and occupied their
                    attention, without the loss of anybody killed or wounded, and I think that the
                    rebel loss was about the same. The report of one of my brigades of cavalry being
                    ambuscaded in Luray Valley is also incorrect and untrue.</p>
