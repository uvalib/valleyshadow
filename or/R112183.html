<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Milroy outlines plans for possible movements in the Valley
                    during March, 1862. He proposes moving on Staunton. He also reports that the
                    militia draft in Pocahontas and Highland scared many citizens into hiding in the
                    mountains.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. W. S. ROSECRANS:</p>
<p>HUTTONSVILLE, VA.,</p>
<p>March 16, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My plank would be, with 3,000 infantry and good batteries, to march 7 miles
                    beyond Cheat Top, and there take a new road, not altogether cut out, to
                    Greenbank, which place is 8 miles to left of Baldwin. From Greenbank proceed to
                    Huntersville, which is now occupied by a regiment of infantry, several hundred
                    cavalry, and two pieces artillery. There effect junction with such force as Gen.
                    Cox may send from Lewisburg, and on good pike march to rear of Alleghany, now
                    occupied by force of about 2,000, according to my best information. Thence march
                    rapidly to Staunton, or, if thought best, on to Virginia and Tennessee road. I
                    can muster almost 3,000 infantry here, but have transportation for only two
                    pieces. All our cannon here are smooth bore; should have a good battery with
                    some rifled guns completely equipped. Reason of anxiety to move is, that
                    yesterday was time set for drafting militia of Pocahontas and Highland. Many
                    citizens now concealed in mountains and trying to escape. Seven arrived
                    yesterday report that Col. Johnson was lately at Richmond for re-enforcements;
                    that he states unless he receives 5,000 the Yankees would surround him; that
                    none have arrived. They say that loaded trains are leaving Lewisburg for south.
                    Fear that game I have watched so long will escape me at last.</p>
