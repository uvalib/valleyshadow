<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General Richard Ewell concerning the disposition of
                    Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley in June, 1863. Lee mentions the

<p>Lieut. Gen. R. S. Ewell, Comdg. Corps:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 10, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have written to Gen. A. G. Jenkins, commanding the cavalry in the Valley
                    District, to report to you for duty, on being notified of your arrival in the
                    Valley. I inclose a letter to Gen. Imboden, who has been ordered down into the
                    Valley of the South Branch of the Potomac, to fix the attention of the enemy
                    stationed at New Creek, Cacapon Bridge, &amp;c., and to endeavor to break
                    the railroad connection between Cumberland and Martinsburg. He is instructed to
                    communicate to you any intelligence of importance, and to comply with any
                    directions you may give him. This letter you had better forward to him on
                    reaching the Valley. He may probably be heard of at Moorefield or Romney. Gen.
                    I. R. Trimble has been placed in command of the Valley District, though I have
                    not yet heard of his arrival at Staunton. The Maryland troops stationed in the
                    Valley form a part of his command. Gen. Trimble, if able to take the field, will
                    carry out any instructions which you may give for their disposition, or, in his
                    absence, you may give them any directions which you may think proper. I request
                    you will keep me advised of your progress, and, as far as you can, notify me of
                    the different stages of your march as you proceed. Gen. Jenkins is establishing
                    a line of couriers between the Valley and my headquarters; their positions you
                    will probably ascertain on your route.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
