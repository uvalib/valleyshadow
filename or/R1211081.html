<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Staunton, Virginia, served as an important base of supply for the Confederate
                    armies as evidenced by this 1862 letter in which Lee requests that baggage kept
                    in Staunton be sent to the front. He also refers to Union oppression of the
                    inhabitants of the Valley.</p>

<p>Col. H. B. DAVIDSON,<br> Cmdg. at Staunton:</p>
<p>Camp near Fredericksburg, Va.,</p>
<p>December 29, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have received your letter of the 24th instant. Directions will be given for the
                    baggage of the different brigades of this army, and the men guarding it, to be
                    recalled from Staunton as soon as possible. I also direct that Jenkins' cavalry
                    brigade be ordered to the valley, if they can be spared from the Department of
                    Western Virginia.</p>
<p>I have directed Gen. W. E. Jones to concentrate the troops in the Valley
                    District, and to drive the enemy, if possible, beyond the Potomac. I am glad to
                    find that you consider our forces sufficient for the purpose. I hope the troops
                    under Gen. Jones, those under you and Col. Imboden, with such other aid as can
                    be obtained, will be able speedily to rid that section of country of the
                    presence of the enemy, and prevent the oppression of the inhabitants which they
                    seem to premeditate. I rely greatly upon the co-operation of yourself and Col.
                    Imboden.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
