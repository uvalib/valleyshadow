<p>Maj.-Gen. FRANKLIN,<br> Hagerstown, Md.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 28, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Couch telegraphs that a contraband, who left the Fifth Virginia Cavalry
                    yesterday, says that regiment is just beyond Charlestown; that on Sunday Hill's
                    division returned, passing near Leetown, and that cavalry said that Jackson was
                    coming with whole force to retake Harper's Ferry. Contraband is confident that
                    infantry is back of Charles town, as he heard drums.</p>
<p>Gen. Porter telegraphs that, from several sources, he has impression that Gen.
                    Lee is not far distant, and Stuart within an hour's reach. The same number of
                    cavalry regiments as usual are opposite him. He communicates same intelligence
                    as received form Maryland Heights, that enemy was moving to-day from Bunker Hill
                    to Shannondale.</p>
<p>The commanding general directs you to suspend movement to Berlin till result of
                    Ovarial's reconnaissance is known. Upon receipt of intelligence from him,
                    communicate it to these headquarters. In the mean time the general desires you
                    so to concentrate your command that it may serve to watch the portion of the
                    river above that now guarded by Porter's corps, and at same time be in position
                    to be thrown promptly toward Williamsport or Berlin, as circumstances may
                    require.</p>
<p>The general intends leaving Kenly, Campbell, Voss, and Davis to guard Upper
                    Potomac. He desires you to state the points at which they had best be posted.
                    The force herein mentioned he considers inadequate for the service designated,
                    but he cannot spare additional troops for the purpose. He will ask that some
                    cavalry and new levies of infantry be sent to Chambersburg, Hagerstown, and
                    vicinity, to aid in guarding the Upper Potomac, and desires your opinion as to
                    their strength and position. Reply immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. B. MARCY,<br> Col., &amp;c.</p>
