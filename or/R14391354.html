<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, writes Chief of Staff
                    Henry Halleck in October, 1864, to notify him of the expiration of the terms of
                    service of 100 day Pennsylvania volunteer cavalry. Couch makes arrangements for
                    the recruiting of new units, mostly for service in dealing with draft resisters
                    and deserters. Couch also discusses the problem of draft resistance in
                    Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK, U. S. Army,<br> Chief of Staff,
                        War Department, Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>October 12, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to state that in from ten to thirty days the term of service of
                    the 100-days' cavalry of this department will expire. It is now used almost
                    entirely to enforce the draft-that is, to protect enrolling officers, arrest
                    deserters, or run them out of the country, compelling them to leave their homes
                    and live in the mountains, &amp;c. Cavalry is the only arm which is of any
                    value for this duty, and in order to sustain the laws of the United States, as
                    well as convince the people that the Government will enforce its just demands, I
                    must replace those going out of service. Gen.ly, the draft is resisted only in
                    the mountainous and wooded districts, which are sparsely settled, where fifty
                    cavalrymen can do the service of 1,000 infantry. Men no doubt could be raised in
                    the State for this special service. I think, however, it would be better could
                    an efficient dismounted battalion of however, from 400 to 500 men be ordered
                    here. They could be mounted and put to good use.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Department.</p>
