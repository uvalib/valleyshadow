<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Schenck updates General in Chief Henry Halleck on January, 1863, action

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief.</p>
<p> BALTIMORE, MD.,</p>
<p>January 3, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have just received the following telegram from Gen. Kelley:</p>
<p>HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., January 3, 1863.</p>
<p>Col. WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,</p>
<p>Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Baltimore:</p>
<p>I have just received a dispatch, dated this a.m., from Col. Washburn, commanding at
     Moorefield, that he was attacked this morning. Thought there was a large force approaching him
     by way of Petersburg. He had withdrawn his force from the latter place, and sent his train to
     New Creek. I have ordered a force from New Creek to meet and protect the train. Have ordered
     Milroy to send a force from Winchester, to support Washburn. I fear the enemy has sent a force
     from Staunton down the Potomac Valley, to cut the railroad west of us. A dispatch, just
     received from Capt. Keys, at Romney, reports cannonading this afternoon in the direction of
     Moorefield. Washburn has two small infantry regiments, a battery, and one company of cavalry.</p>
<p>B. F. KELLEY,</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen.</p>
<p>I have telegraphed Gen. Kelley that if he thinks that now, or on the receipt of further
     intelligence, he must have re-enforcements, I can send him at once, from here, a regiment of
     infantry and a field battery. I have nothing else to spare him. I have also directed him to
     keep a lookout, lest the enemy approach the river or the railroad from the direction of
     Leesburg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ROBT. C. SCHENCK,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
