<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William S. Rosecrans discusses plans for movement in late April,
                    1862. He suggests that Fremont's troops, based in western Virginia, clear the
                    Shenandoah Valley and concentrate on Staunton.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HARPER'S FERRY,</p>
<p>April 23, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have my orders from you and Gen. Fremont's accord to take Blenker's division to
                    Moorefield, which, unless otherwise directed, I shall do with the least possible
                    delay. The supplies I am getting are necessary to fit the column for motion and
                    campaign. I am determined to see that nothing necessary is wanting before I
                    leave. Clothing, stationery, camp tools, and shelter-tents are now all ordered
                    and under way. Battery horses will reach them to-morrow night. Have, from
                    delicacy, said nothing to Gen. Fremont. My general views are as given in my
                    report: A clearing of the valley and concentration of Fremont toward Staunton
                    and on the railroad; Banks to incline over east and seize the Piedmont and
                    threaten or take Gordonsville and the Kanawha Valley; to seize Lewisburg and
                    support the forces breaking the Southwestern Virginia and Tennessee Railroad;
                    ulterior movements contingent, but tending to mass the troops as much as
                    requisite to supply each other and subsist. For goodness' sake order the plan of
                    supplies proposed. No man of experience, knowing the people and country, can
                    fail to approve it.</p>
<p></p>
