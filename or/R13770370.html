<p>Brig. Gen. MAX WEBER, Cmdg. Officer, Harper's Ferry:</p>
<p>WINCHESTER,</p>
<p>May 2, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have occupied Winchester to-day, and will advance further up the Shenandoah
                    Valley or retain my position here if the force of the enemy are not far superior
                    to mine. I have my outposts toward Berryville, Front Royal, Strasburg, and
                    Moorefield, and the greater part of the troops concentrated near Winchester. If
                    the enemy should move against me with a large force it will probably be his
                    object to cut me off from Harper's Ferry. I will, therefore, not rely on that
                    line of retreat, but take a position between Winchester and Romney. In this case
                    the troops in the vicinity of Harper's Ferry have to retire to Harper's Ferry,
                    those at Martinsburg and vicinity to Falling Waters and Williamsport. The trains
                    which may be at Martinsburg have also to cross at Falling Waters and at
                    Williamsport, if the river is fordable. The Government stores at Martinsburg
                    must in this case be shipped to Harper's Ferry and Cumberland by railroad. This
                    depends on the time we may have. From information received it seems that the
                    enemy has at this moment about 2,500 cavalry and from 3,000 to 4,000 infantry
                    and artillery between Strasburg and Staunton, but these troops may be
                    re-enforced very quickly, which depends upon the operations under Gen. Grant.
                    You see from this statement what position I am in, and that I must have every
                    available man to maintain it. Col. Rodgers' regiment should be sent to me
                    immediately, if possible. If, in case of a strong force of the enemy, I take the
                    position as indicated, I will defend Harper's Ferry indirectly, because the
                    enemy cannot attack that place when I am on his left flank, and rear with my
                    forces. I will, however, see what will be the best for me to do.</p>
<p></p>
