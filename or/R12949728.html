<p>His Excellency President DAVIS,<br> Richmond:</p>
<p>Zollicoffer,</p>
<p>September 16, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The indications in front of Jonesborough yesterday were such that I did not think
                    it necessary to withdraw to the line of the Watauga and Holston, being reluctant
                    to yield any more ground. I have tolerably reliable information that the main
                    body of the enemy's force left Cumberland Gap on the 12th. Do not know where
                    they went. There are indications that it is coming by Rogersville toward
                    Blountsville. If so, I must return from Jonesborough. From two to four regiments
                    of infantry reported occupying Cumberland Gap.</p>
<p>Gen. Corse telegraphed me from Bonsack's this morning that his orders from Gen.
                    Pickett were to go to Wytheville, and if the reports of the enemy's advance were
                    false, to return without further orders to Petersburg. Was that your intention?
                    I had ordered him here. If he can be spared, it is important to retain him. I
                    cannot withdraw any more troops from Lewisburg or Princeton without exposing too
                    much of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. I left Jenkins' cavalry brigade on
                    the Staunton and Parkersburg turnpike, near Monterey. Can I withdraw it with
                    safety to Staunton?</p>
<p></p>
<p> SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
