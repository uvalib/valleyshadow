<p>Hon. E.M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG,</p>
<p>April 28, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our force is entirely secure here. The enemy is in no condition for offensive
                    movements, and nothing can prevent our troops from joining the main body in
                    safety if attacked. Our supplies have not been in so good condition nor my
                    command in so good spirits since we left Winchester. Gen. Hatch made
                    reconnaissance in force yesterday, which resulted in obtaining a complete and
                    satisfactory view of the enemy's position. Two of our own men were wounded by
                    accident, one mortally. Five of the enemy were killed and 5 wounded in the
                    skirmish. Report forwarded. A negro employed in Jackson's tent came in this
                    morning, and reports preparation for retreat of Jackson to-day. Gen. Johnson is
                    reported to have passed Staunton, and Gen. Milroy to be 4 miles west of
                    Staunton. You need have no apprehensions for our safety. I think we are now just
                    in condition to do all you can desire of us in this valley-clear the enemy out
                    permanently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>N.P. BANKS,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
