<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General William Pendleton forwards March, 1865, orders from Lee that
                    a battery be moved to Petersburg. Pendleton mentions rumors that Confederate
                    troops had been captured near Staunton.</p>

<p>March 24, 1865.</p>

<p>Capt. McClanahan having been ordered, by telegram to Lieut.-Col. Chew, on the
                    27th of February, to prepare his battery for operations and report to Maj.
                    McGregor near Petersburg as soon as possible with his battery, and nothing
                    having been yet heard from him, it becomes necessary to hasten the movement of
                    the battery, especially as a report is heard that Capt. McClanahan was captured
                    by the enemy near Staunton. The officer commanding the battery will therefore
                    immediately collect his men, with all the horses belonging to the company, and
                    rendezvous at Lynchburg. He will then transport the company to Petersburg
                    without delay, and report for orders to Capt. D. D. Pendleton, assistant
                    adjutant-general, artillery. No time is to be lost in the execution of the
                    order.</p>
<p>By command of Gen. Lee:</p>
<p>W. N. PENDLETON,<br> Brig.-Gen. and Chief of Artillery.</p>
