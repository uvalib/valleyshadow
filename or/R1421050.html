<p>Maj.-Gen. HUMPHREYS,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>City Point, Va.,</p>
<p>September 27, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The Union men of Richmond sent us word last night, through our scouts, that the
                    telegraph operator had left Staunton night before last-Sunday night. The
                    dispatch also stated that the Yankees were expected to occupy Staunton early
                    yesterday morning; Gen. Early was retreating to Waynesborough; Gen. Lee was in
                    Richmond on Saturday in consultation with the War Department, and pontoon
                    bridges were being put across the Appomattox. Fitz Lee had arrived in town
                    wounded, his command remaining with Early. The three regiments formerly reported
                    as having been sent to Lynchburg are all there troops that have been moved
                    within the last week. Silver sold in Richmond yesterday at 29 for 1, and gold at
                    30 for 1. Mr. Davis had not returned from Hood's army up to yesterday morning at
                    10 o'clock The command rumors of the evacuation of Richmond are gaining
                    strength. The wounded of Early's army are expected to arrive in Richmond, but
                    none of them have yet arrived. The brigades at Chaffin's, if taken up, have been
                    replaced, as one of our agents saw South Carolinians on Sunday belonging to
                    Bratton's brigade, of Field's division, who had just crossed the bridge. Files
                    of Richmond papers are forwarded herewith.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>GEORGE H. SHARPE,<br> Col., &amp;c.</p>
