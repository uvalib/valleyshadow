<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, reports to General in
                    Chief Henry Halleck on July 30, 1864, on the progress of the Confederate raid
                    into southern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>July 30, 1864--3 a. m.<br> Received 3.30 a. m.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Averell informs me that the enemy commenced crossing at McCoy's Ferry at
                    daylight 29th instant, and continued up to 11 a. m. same day, with cavalry,
                    artillery, and infantry. Commenced crossing at Williamsport at 10 a. m. with
                    cavalry, and at Falling Waters at the same time with cavalry and trains; at
                    Shepherdstown with cavalry at the same time. Gen. Averell was forced to fall
                    back to Greencastle, where he now is with his whole force. The camp-fires of the
                    enemy are about four miles south of Greencastle. They have shown a column toward
                    Leitersburg, and about 600 have advanced to Mercersburg, where they drove my
                    pickets back to Bridgeport, in the rear of Saint Thomas. It will thus be seen
                    that the enemy is moving in three columns.</p>
