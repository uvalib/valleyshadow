<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Brigadier General William B. Taliaferro commanded the First Division of the Fifth
                    Virginia Infantry which is in the Army of Northern Virginia. Taliaferro reports
                    that the regiment began in a supporting role, and then fully entered the battle,
                    ultimately driving the enemy three miles.</p>

<p> Capt. A.S. PENDLETON, Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
<p>Camp near Liberty Mills, Va.</p>
<p>August 13, 1862</p>
<p>CAPTAIN:</p>
<p>By direction of the major-general commanding I have the honor to report the
                    operations of my command on the 9th instant, during the engagement near Cedar
                    Run:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th instant the First, Second, and Third Brigades of this
                    division, under Brig. Gen. C.S. Winder, First Brigade (the Fourth having been
                    detailed to protect the train), marched from their encampment near Barnett's
                    Ford of the Rapidan River upon the turnpike road leading in the direction of
                    Culpeper, the division of Maj.-Gen. Ewell having preceded it the morning
                    previous. After crossing the Robertson River and proceeding some 3 miles we
                    overtook the division of Gen. Ewell and discovered the enemy in front, when our
                    troops were halted to make dispositions to attack them. This division was
                    ordered to attack the enemy's right, while the division of Gen. Ewell was
                    ordered to attack him upon the left. On my riding to the front I perceived the
                    enemy's cavalry drawn up on the range of hills near Cedar Run, with a line of
                    vedettes in front, while the fall of the hills in rear and the woods beyond
                    evidently concealed their batteries and infantry. A corn field in front of this
                    position also concealed the movements of the enemy and the undulations of the
                    country made reconnaissances very difficult.</p>
<p>The field batteries of Gen. Ewell were now shelling the enemy, when Gen. Winder
                    ordered the division forward along the turnpike to a point at which the woods on
                    the right of the road terminated. Beyond this point the woods on the left
                    extended to a wheat field, beyond which a dense wood again appeared. On the
                    right of the road from the point of termination of the wood and extensive bare
                    field stretched to the left to a considerable distance and to the front to a
                    corn field. A brigade under Gen. Early, protected by the fall of the hills,
                    occupied the right of this field in line of battle, directly fronting the
                    general line of the enemy, as far as we could make it out.</p>
<p>Gen. Winder now ordered the Second Brigade, under Lieut.-Col. Garnett,
                    Forty-eighth Virginia, to move forward to the left under cover of the woods to
                    the wheat field, and to extend back to the left along the skirt of woods. He
                    then ordered some pieces of artillery, under the general charge of Maj. R.
                    Snowden Andrews, chief of artillery for the division, to the point where the
                    bare field commenced, and ordered the Third Brigade, under my command, to move
                    along up parallel to the road in rear of the batteries and under cover of the
                    wood until the head of the column rested near the rear of the Second Brigade.
                    The brigade was then faced to the road. The First Brigade (Col. C.A. Ronald,
                    Fourth Virginia Regiment, commanding) was ordered, as I was informed, to move up
                    as a reserve. While these dispositions were being made the troops were subjected
                    to a heavy discharge of shell and shot from the enemy's artillery, thrown mostly
                    at random into the woods. The effect of our batteries from the point of woods
                    and from a position subsequently taken in the open field to the right was very
                    great, to a great extent silencing the enemy's guns. After the pieces had been
                    placed in battery at the corner of the woods, and had opened some fifteen
                    minutes upon the enemy, I returned to my brigade, a short distance back in the
                    woods and out of sight of the enemy, to await Gen. Winder's orders. I left this
                    brave, generous, and accomplished officer at this point, and was informed a
                    short time afterward that he had been struck by a shell and mortally wounded.</p>
<p>I now assumed command of the division under the disadvantage of being ignorant of
                    the plans of the general, except so far as I could form an opinion from my
                    observation of the dispositions made. I at once rode to the front to acquaint
                    myself with the position of the Second Brigade, and reconnoitered the enemy's
                    position from the wheat field in front of the First Virginia Battalion, of that
                    brigade. I could discover no evidences of the enemy in front, but could discover
                    them in force on the right of that position in the corn field, somewhat
                    concealed from the view of our troops by the undulations of the country.</p>
<p>I now returned to the position occupied by our batteries, when I was overtaken by
                    an officer, who reported that the enemy were showing themselves in front of the
                    position I had just left and were advancing. I at once ordered the Tenth
                    Virginia Regiment to be detached from the Third Brigade and sent forward to
                    re-enforce the First Virginia Battalion, and sent an order to Col. Ronald to
                    move his brigade (the First) rapidly to the support of the Second Brigade. I now
                    perceived the enemy advancing through the corn field, and directed Col. Garnett
                    to throw his right forward and drive them back, and ordered Col. Taliaferro to
                    move his brigade into the open field to the right and attack and drive back the
                    enemy in front. The Twenty-first Virginia Regiment, Second Brigade, Lieut.-Col.
                    Cunningham, poured a destructive fire upon the enemy and exhibited a degree of
                    heroic gallantry rarely ever witnessed. The Third Brigade advanced in fine style
                    and the enemy gave way before the severity of its fire. At this moment I
                    discovered that, owing to the fact that the First Brigade had not been moved
                    sufficiently near originally, or that the order had not reached Col. Ronald in
                    time, the enemy had attacked the left wing of the Second Brigade and turned it,
                    and that it was falling back in some disorder. This movement exposed also the
                    left flank of the Third Brigade and caused it to fall back, but it was soon
                    afterward brought back to its original position. At this critical moment the
                    First Brigade moved up and, with Gen. Branch's brigade, of Gen. Hill's division,
                    encountered the enemy, confused by their severe conflict with the Second
                    Brigade, and drove them back with terrible slaughter. The Third brigade now
                    advanced to the brow of the hill overlooking the corn field and the Second
                    Brigade to the edge of the woods, and drove the enemy in front of them from
                    their positions in confusion. To cover his retreat the enemy's cavalry charged
                    the Third Brigade, but they were met by such a storm of missiles that the whole
                    column was turned, wheeled to the right, and before it could be wheeled off to
                    the enemy to make a stand. They retreated and our troops pursued them, capturing
                    a number of prisoners. This division crossed the corn field diagonally toward
                    the woods on the road toward the railroad. Brig.-Gen. Prince, U.S. Army, was
                    made a prisoner, and surrendered to me as we were crossing this field, and his
                    command, which was on our right and had been, I think, principally engaged with
                    Gen. Early's brigade, fled upon our approach with scarcely any opposition. We
                    continued to push forward until we had driven the enemy some 3 miles and until
                    the darkness rendered it impossible to distinguish our troops from those of the
                    enemy. After having made report of my position to the commanding general I was
                    ordered to permit the troops to rest for the night, which was done in advance of
                    the field of battle.</p>
<p>From my own personal observation and the reports of officers it affords me
                    pleasure to bear renewed testimony to the efficiency and gallantry of this
                    veteran division.</p>
<p>The First Brigade fully sustained its ancient reputation. It captured a number of
                    prisoners and four stand of colors. Col. Ronald, who ably and gallantly
                    commanded it, speaks in the highest terms of the support he received from the
                    courage and zeal displayed by his officers and men. He particularly mentions
                    Maj. Williams, Fifth Virginia Regiment; Lieut. Col. Lawson Botts, Second
                    Virginia Regiment; Lieut. Col. R.D. Gardner, Fourth Virginia Regiment; Lieut.
                    Col. Edwin G. Lee, Thirty-third Virginia Regiment; Capt. Charles L. Haynes,
                    Twenty-seventh Virginia Regiment; Capts. Carpenter and Poague, commanding
                    batteries; Capt. John H. Fulton, Fourth Virginia; Maj. Holliday, Thirty-third
                    Virginia, and Lieut. Garnett, of Gen. Winder's staff.</p>
<p>The Second Brigade-commanded by Lieut.-Col. Garnett, who exhibited a rare skill
                    and courage, refusing to leave the field, although severely [wounded], until the
                    close of the fight-although at one time overwhelmed by superior numbers,
                    pressing and turning their left flank, yet renewed the fight with determination
                    and bravery. The conflict of this command with the enemy was most severe. The
                    bayonet was freely used and a hand-to-hand fight with superior numbers ensued
                    before the right of the brigade fell back.</p>
<p>Col. Garnett makes especial mention of Lieut.-Col. Cunningham, who with most
                    heroic gallantry led the Twenty-first Virginia and fell at their head; of Maj.
                    Lane, of the Forty-second Virginia, who was mortally wounded; of Maj. Seddon,
                    commanding First Virginia Battalion; Capt. Hannum, of the Forty-eighth Virginia;
                    Capt. Deyerle, Forty-second, mortally wounded; Capt. Wilson, assistant
                    adjutant-general; Lieut. Dabney, aide-de-camp, and Lieut. White, acting
                    aide-de-camp.</p>
<p>The Third Brigade, Col. A.G. Taliaferro, Twenty-third Virginia, commanding, was
                    conducted into action by that officer with the intrepidity and courage which
                    have heretofore distinguished him. His command was subjected to a terrific fire,
                    which it gallantly withstood, and to a charge of cavalry, which it instantly
                    repulsed, and when the left flank for a time gave way under an overwhelming
                    force the right, and particularly the Twenty-third Virginia Regiment, which
                    deserves especial mention for its firmness and admirable conduct in the
                    engagement, remained unbroken.</p>
<p>Col. Taliaferro particularly mentions Maj. Stover, commanding Tenth Virginia
                    Regiment; Lieut.-Col. Curtis, commanding Twenty-third Virginia, who fell
                    mortally wounded; Maj. Walton, Twenty-third Virginia; Col. T.V. Williams, of the
                    Thirty-seventh Virginia, who was wounded; Maj. Wood, Thirty-seventh Virginia;
                    Lieut.-Col. Jackson, of the Forty-seventh Alabama Regiment; Col. Sheffield, of
                    the Forty-eighth Alabama Regiment, who was severely wounded; Maj. Alldridge,
                    Forty-eighth Alabama Regiment, who was severely wounded, and of his assistant
                    adjutant-general, Lieut. W.F. Coleman.</p>
<p>The batteries of the division engaged in this action were those of Capts.
                    Carpenter, Poague, and Caskie. The officers and men of these batteries behaved
                    well. Capt. Caskie was wounded. Capt. Wooding's battery was not engaged. He
                    himself acted for a time with the general commanding.</p>
<p>I have the honor to inclose herewith the reports of brigade, regimental, and
                    battery commanders, to which the major-general commanding is referred for more
                    minute detail, and a list* of killed and wounded of this division.</p>
<p>No one can estimate the loss his brigade, this division, the army has sustained
                    in the early fall of Brig.-Gen. Winder. He was warmly beloved by all who knew
                    him as a man and had the full confidence of his command as a soldier.</p>
<p>I beg leave, in conclusion, to allude to the gallantry of Maj. R. Snowden
                    Andrews, chief of artillery, who was severely, and I fear mortally, wounded; to
                    that of my adjutant-general, Capt. William B. Pendleton, who was severely
                    wounded, losing his leg; to Lieut. Meade, aide-de-camp; of Maj. W.T. Taliaferro,
                    volunteer aide-de-camp, who rendered me most efficient and important service,
                    and to speak particularly of the gallant conduct of my orderly, a youth of
                    sixteen, Private Clinton Depriest, Company H, Twenty-third Virginia Regiment.</p>
<p>It affords me pleasure to mention the efficient service in their department of
                    the medical officers of the command. I beg to refer especially to Surgeon
                    Coleman, Second Brigade; Surgeon Daily, Third Brigade, and Surgeon Black, First
                    Brigade.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. B. TALIAFERRO, <br> Brig. Gen., C.S. Army, Comdg. First Division,
                        Valley Army. </p>
