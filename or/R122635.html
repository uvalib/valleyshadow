<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson, commanding the Department of Pennsylvania,
                    reports to the Assistant Adjutant General in May, 1861, concerning the muster-in
                    and position of troops under his command. He mentions several regiments
                    stationed at Chambersburg.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p> HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,<br> Headquarters of the
                        Army, Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pa.,</p>
<p>May 11, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I forward for the information of the Gen.-in-Chief, on a department return, a
                    detailed statement of the regiments mustered into the service of the United
                    States, which are or have been in the department, and the present condition of
                    the equipments. Eight regiments in excess in the Pennsylvania quota arises from
                    troops having been mustered in at this place by authority and no attention taken
                    of them at Harrisburg. I have urged and pressed the equipping of these
                    regiments. The commander of Frankford Arsenal reports he cannot fill before the
                    25th instant the orders now in his possession for twelve regiments, three of
                    which are at Chambersburg and three at York. No requisition for ordnance
                    equipments for Gen. Negley's command has been received, and Lieut. Treadwell,
                    the ordnance officer at the arsenal, is, by order from Washington, providing
                    only for twelve thousand four hundred men, the Pennsylvania quota. I am aware
                    that Maryland has been invaded from Virginia at Harper's Ferry, but in the
                    present condition of my command am powerless.</p>
<p>I make the above statement that the Gen.-in-Chief may not rely at present upon
                    these regiments in his plan of attack upon Harper's Ferry. By Wednesday of the
                    coming week one regiment at York and two in this city will be provided with
                    accouterments. I request to be informed if troops from York are to march through
                    or around Baltimore, and whether the regiments on that line are to be pushed to
                    Washington. The railroad hence to Baltimore will be opened in a few days. I
                    desire also to be informed if there is any objection to using this route through
                    Baltimore.</p>
<p>I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
