<p> Capt. JOHN W. WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
<p>Near Sharpsburg</p>
<p>September 20, 1862</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report, for the information of the general commanding the
                    division, that on the morning of the 17th, at early dawn, we took the position
                    assigned us on the field of battle as a reserve in support of Gen. Hartsuff for
                    the engagements of the day. The action opened at daylight, but, owing to the
                    early fall of Gen. Hartsuff, we quickly gained the right of the division and
                    immediately became hotly engaged with the enemy. The position of the enemy was
                    in a corn-field slightly oblique with the center lines, forming an acute angle
                    with the left of the first line. There were two batteries on our right, which
                    opened with terrible effect upon the enemy. Our infantry, maintaining their
                    ground, poured in a flank fire with great execution. The conflict continued
                    until there were only about 100 men of the One hundred and fourth and One
                    hundred and fifth New York Regiments left on the right of the brigade. At this
                    point the cannoneers of one of the batteries were compelled to abandon their
                    guns. The remnants of the two regiments above named rallied behind a large rock
                    and continued to pour in a deadly fire until re-enforcements came up and covered
                    the guns. The enemy's dead upon the field were almost in as perfect line as if
                    on dress parade. It gives me pleasure to say that the men could not have fought
                    with more determination and gallantry.</p>
<p>Yours, most respectfully,</p>
<p>A. DURYEA, <br> Brig.-Gen. </p>
