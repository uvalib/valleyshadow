<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee retreated to Virginia after the battle of Sharpsburg, Maryland, in
     mid-September, 1862. In this October letter to Jefferson Davis, Lee discusses his efforts to
     move sick, wounded, and stores captured at Harper's Ferry to Staunton. Also of interest are
     Lee's suggestions for army promotions, and his opinion of the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p>His Excellency President DAVIS,<br> Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>Washington Run, near Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p>October 2, 1862.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>I received last night your letter of the 28th ultimo, and am much obliged to you for the
     attention given to my requests. I have stated so frequently my opinion of the necessity of
     improving the discipline of our armies that I need not repeat it. I hope Congress will grant
     every facility in their power.</p>
<p>In reference to commanders of corps with the rank of lieutenant-general, of which you request
     my opinion, I can confidently recommend Gen.'s Longstreet and Jackson, in this army. My opinion
     of the merits of Gen. Jackson has been greatly enhanced during this expedition. He is true,
     honest, and brave; has a single eye to the good of the service, and spares no exertion to
     accomplish his object. Next to these two officers, I consider Gen. A. P. Hill the best
     commander with me. He fights his troops well, and takes good care of them. At present I do not
     think that more than two commanders of corps are necessary for this army. I need not remind you
     of the merits of Gen. E. K. Smith, whom I consider one of our best officers. As regards the
     appointments for major-generals and brigadier-generals for this army, I have already forwarded
     to you the names of those whose merits I think have earned promotion. Should you conclude to
     promote Gen.'s Longstreet and Jackson, major-generals in their places will be required, but I
     believe you have sufficient names before you to fill the vacancies. Your own knowledge of the
     claims and qualifications of the officers will, I feel assured, enable you to make the best
     selection. I do not think it necessary to call your attention to the officers immediately
     around Richmond, as you are fully aware of their merits.</p>
<p>The returns of the 30th ultimo will show an increase of our strength. If completed in time, I
     will send them by this mail. But our reach have been restored to them. Strange to say, our sick
     are very numerous, and all the care and attention I can give to the subject do not seem to
     diminish the number. Until the regimental officers can be made to appreciate the necessity of
     taking care of their men, keeping them under control, attending to their wants and comforts,
     and enforcing cleanliness, &amp;c., I fear the sanitary condition of the army will not
     improve. It is the want of this attention and provision for comfort that causes our men so soon
     to break down under hardship.</p>
<p>I have written to you in reference to Gen. Loring's movements, and am glad to find my
     suggestions to him correspond in the main with your instructions.</p>
<p>Gen. McClellan's army is apparently quiescent. He himself is at Sharpsburg; his main body in
     that vicinity. I think he is yet unable to move, and finds difficulty in procuring provisions
     more than sufficient from day to day.</p>
<p>Gen. Sumner is strengthening himself at Harper's Ferry. The brigades over the Potomac are
     being reconstructed. My great anxiety is, lest, with other troops, Gen. McClellan may move upon
     Richmond. As at present there is no way in which I can endanger his safety, I have been in
     hopes that he would cross the river and move up the valley, where I wish to get him, but he
     does not seem so disposed.</p>
<p>I have been endeavoring to move back to Staunton everything captured at Harper's Ferry and
     all of valley in Winchester, together with our sick and wounded, in order that I may be
     unembarrassed. As soon as this is accomplished-which I regret to say from our weakness in
     transportation progresses slowly-unless something more advantageous offers, I shall move toward
     the Blue Ridge, so as to be prepared for any advance toward Richmond on the part of the enemy.
     I think it advisable that such troops as are north of James River, and not required for the
     support of the batteries at Drewry's Bluff, should be posted on the Rapidan and North Anna.
     They will guard the railroad, and by their presence prevent aggressions by small bodies of the
     enemy.</p>
<p>Four thousand four hundred pairs of shoes arrived yesterday, and 2,000 pairs expected today,
     which I hope will cover the bare feet in the army.</p>
<p>I am delighted to learn that the prospect of affairs in Kentucky and Louisiana is so bright.
     As regards Maryland, she is so tightly tied that I fear nothing but extraneous aid can relieve
     her. The military government of the United States has been so perfected by the recent
     proclamations of President Lincoln, which you have no doubt seen, and civil liberty so
     completely trodden under foot, that I have strong hopes that the conservative portion of that
     people, unless dead to the feeling of liberty, will rise and depose the party now in power.</p>
<p>I wish I felt that I deserved the confidence you express in me. I am only conscious of an
     earnest desire to advance the interests of the country and of my inability to accomplish my
     wishes. The brave men of this army fully deserve you thanks, and I will take pleasure in
     communicating them.</p>
<p>I am, with the highest respect and esteem your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
