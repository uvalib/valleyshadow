<p>Col. W. L. Jackson.</p>
<p>Camp Tilghman,<br> Hightown,</p>
<p>July 9, 1863.</p>
<p>Col.:</p>
<p>Your communication of the 4th instant was handed me by Maj. J. R. Claiborne on
                    yesterday. I am now in position at Hightown, carrying out my orders from you, I
                    having a company at Monterey, which company are picketing and scouting as far as
                    Franklin, in Pendleton County. I am diligently scouting, and I shall fight the
                    enemy if ever they should advance. I have sent to Staunton for twenty days'
                    rations for command.</p>
<p>I am sorry our plans were not successful in capturing the enemy. I was in my
                    position two hours before the time given by you, and did everything in my power
                    to carry out your orders, and, in fact, did more than you ordered me to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Caplinger, one of my guides, left near Beverly on Tuesday. He says the enemy
                    were re-enforced some 2,500 men, and on Friday morning, shortly after I fell
                    back, they advanced and surrounded the position I held, thinking I was still
                    there. They could not find out how I got in their rear, or how I went out. He
                    says the re-enforcement had left for Grafton, leaving Col. Harris' forces still
                    in Beverly.</p>
<p>I am, colonel, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. C. DUNN,<br> Lieut.-Col., Comdg.</p>
