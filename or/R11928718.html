<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes to Secretary of War Randolph in November, 1862. He discusses
                    the army's lack of shoes and blankets. He discusses blankets and shoes received
                    by Thomas J. Jackson from Staunton.</p>

<p>Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,<br> Secretary of War, Richmond,
                        Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 14, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I am unable at this time to answer specifically your telegram in reference to the
                    number of shoes required in this army. By a report received from Gen. Longstreet
                    to-day, the number of men in his corps without shoes in this vicinity is 6,648.
                    This does not include Gen. Ransom's division of two brigades, now at Madison,
                    the reserve artillery, or cavalry. When the 3,000 arrive (which you stated were
                    to have been forwarded from Richmond yesterday), it will reduce the number
                    required by the number received. The shoes and blankets that were forwarded to
                    Staunton were appropriated to Gen. Jackson's corps, who has informed me that
                    they have been issued, and he still has men without shoes or blankets; the exact
                    number I do not know.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
