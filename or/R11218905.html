<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In the Shenandoah Valley during May and June, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J.
                    Jackson won a series of victories over three Union forces under John C. Fremont,
                    Irvin McDowell, and Nathaniel P. Banks. In this June letter, President Jefferson
                    Davis writes to congratulate Jackson on his victories. He also mentions sending
                    reinforcements gathered by the general commanding at Staunton. Also of interest
                    is Davis's reference to the threat the Northern armies pose to Southern homes
                    and political rights.</p>

<p>Gen. THOMAS J. JACKSON,<br> Cmdg. in the Valley of
                        Virginia:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>June 4, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I return to you my congratulations for the brilliant campaign you have conducted
                    against the enemy in the valley of Virginia. Were it practicable to send to you
                    re-enforcements it should be done, and your past success shows how surely you
                    would, with an adequate force, destroy the wicked designs of the invader of our
                    homes and assailed of our political rights. From the Hon. Mr. Boteler I have
                    learned something of your probable movements. At this distance it is not
                    possible to obtain such exact information as would justify a conclusion, but I
                    hope you will not find at Front Royal a force which you cannot overcome. The
                    only aid which seemed to be in reach was such as could be collected at Staunton.
                    The commanding office at that place has been directed to gather all he could and
                    move down the valley to communicate with you. Such a movement may have an effect
                    on the enemy beyond its real value. But it is on your skill and daring that
                    reliance is to be places. The army under your command encourages us to hope for
                    all which men can achieve.</p>
<p>Very respectfully and truly, yours,</p>
<p>JEFFERSON DAVIS.</p>
