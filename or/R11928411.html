<p>Col. C. G. SAWTELLE, Quartermaster:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 11, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have just received your package, which shows us all that you have done all in
                    your power to supply the clothing. If it has not actually left Washington, I
                    think it had better not go on the Hagerstown road until we know better what the
                    rebels are doing at Chambersburg. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad cars should
                    not be diverted now; but why was not the clothing sent? Capt. Pitkin has not
                    received his supplies yet. He has no stationery, &amp;c. Where is the
                    trouble?</p>
<p></p>
<p>RUFUS INGALLS,<br> Lieut.-Col., Aide-de-Camp, and Chief Quartermaster.</p>
