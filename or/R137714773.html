<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, writes General William
                    Averell in July, 1864. In response to Averell's request for signal men, Couch
                    replies that he has none on hand, having ordered them to Harper's Ferry. Couch
                    also mentions rumors of an advance by Confederate forces into Maryland and
                    southern Pennsylvania, and asks Averell to keep him informed of the situation so
                    he can save the Valley's stock by warning farmers in the event of an
                emergency.</p>

<p>Gen. W. W. AVERELL:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG,</p>
<p>July 27, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sent all my signal officers to Harper's Ferry more than three weeks ago. They
                    have been ordered to return, and should they come by way of Hagerstown order the
                    line established as you may desire. I have a report, via Mercersburg, that
                    McCausland is crossing at Cherry Run, but have not believed it. This valley is
                    full of stock. Unless you can successfully resist their cavalry it is of great
                    importance that I have early information of their crossing in order to alarm the
                    farmers. Anything that I have got shall be at your disposal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
