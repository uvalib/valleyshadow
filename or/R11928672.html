<p>Col. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg. Partisan Rangers:</p>
<p>Camp near Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p>October 19, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 15th instant to Gen. Jackson has been received, and I am glad
                    to learn that you are progressing favorably in collecting cattle in Hardy and
                    Hampshire. Please give such attention to the subject as you can, and, in
                    addition to the cattle, collect for the army all the cloth, leather,
                    &amp;c., that you can send forward toward Staunton. I hope you will not lose
                    sight of the destruction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and of doing such
                    other damage to the enemy as your means will permit.</p>
<p>A gentleman who left Clarskburg on the 7th, and said to be reliable, states that
                    Mulligan and Kelley are at that place with three brigades numbering about 7,000
                    men; that there is one brigade at Parkersburg, one regiment at Buckhannon, and
                    300 men at Beverly. These were all the troops he could learn of in Northwestern
                    Virginia. If this intelligence is correct, Kelley's forces in front of you, at
                    New Bridge, &amp;c., must probably have been diminished, and it does not
                    accord will the intelligence you report brought by a lady from Clarksburg. You
                    will probably be able to ascertain the truth yourself, and shape your course
                    accordingly.</p>
<p>Gen. Jenkins, according to information from Gen. Loring, with about 1,500
                    cavalry, ought to be in the country about Clarksburg now. His instructions were
                    to destroy the roads in the vicinity of Clarksburg, Piedmont, Cheat River,
                    &amp;c. Gen. Loring has been informed of your position and operations, and
                    that you would be ready to co-operate with him if practicable. Gen. Loring
                    expected to move via Lewisburg and Monterey to Cheat River with his infantry.
                    Since then I have heard of the Kanawha Valley being again threatened, which may
                    detain his infantry.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
