                <p>In this October, 1864, dispatch, Union Colonel and Assistant Inspector General
                    for the Department of the Susquehanna T. S. Mather reports in detail to John
                    Schultze at Chambersburg concerning an inspecting trip to Pottsville. Mather
                    discusses the sentiments of the people of Schuylkill County, the Irish miners in
                    particular. He describes the many riots and incidents of violence occasioned by
                    the draft, as well as army attempts to pacify the area and deal with resisters
                    and deserters. Mather also expresses fear for the public order during the
                    impending election of 1864.</p>

                <p>I have the honor to report that during my late tour of inspection to Pottsville,
                    Pa., I took the opportunity to inform myself, as fully as time and circumstances
                    would permit, as to the general condition of affairs in the Tenth and Twelfth
                    Districts of the Eastern Division of Pennsylvania. I saw Capt. Bowen,
                    provost-marshal of the Tenth District, Mr. Parry and Mr. Green, of Pottsville,
                    Mr. Levi C. Leib, chief burgess of the borough of Ashland, and Mr. A. P.
                    Spinney, of the same place, who are reliable men, and inquired particularly as
                    to the state of the public feeling in the county of Schuylkill and in the
                    district. Capt. Bowen informed me that the Irish throughout the country are
                    disposed to give trouble, and are only restrained from a general outbreak by the
                    presence of the military. In Ashland Township the Irish have broken into houses,
                    destroyed furniture, insulted women, beaten wounded soldiers, and committed
                    other outrages. A few evenings since they turned out in a body and paraded the
                    streets, breaking the windows and doors of the houses. Mr. Green, superintendent
                    of the shops at Ashland, had his house broken into and furniture destroyed. At
                    Mahanoy City the rioters entered a house last week and wounded a man by a pistol
                    shot, without the least provocation, insulted an old lady and her daughter, and
                    beat a wounded soldier severely. There is also a go deal of trouble at
                    Heckscherville. Meetings have been broken up, the election interfered with, and
                    several families driven out of the place. Three Scotchmen came into Pottsville
                    the day I left who have been driven from their homes by the rioters. A large
                    number of the persons who commit these outrages are men who have been drafted
                    and who have not reported, joined with laborers at the mines. It is very
                    difficult to catch them, as on the first appearance of the troops they flee to
                    the hills. The cavalry at Pottsville are out in detachments of six and eight
                    almost every night, and have, so far as I am informed by the provost-marshal,
                    been quite successful in arresting deserters. They are fired upon quite often by
                    parties of men who secrete themselves near the roadside or among the rocks on
                    the sides of the hills. The feeling against the Government is growing stronger
                    as the time for the election approaches, and the leading men of the district
                    apprehend trouble unless there is a small military force stationed in the worst
                    localities until the election is over. Several gentlemen called to see me,
                    during my stay, from the different townships, and Capt. Leib and Mr. Spinnney
                    informed me that he people of Ashland, had erected quarters sufficient to
                    accommodate a small detachment of troops, in hopes that some may be sent there.
                    While it is no doubt true that the law-abiding people in that region are to some
                    extent, perhaps unnecessarily, frightened, I am still of the opinion that there
                    is some foundation for their fears, as the men who have given me information are
                    known to be reliable citizens and have been themselves witnesses of the
                    outrages. They informed me that within the last three weeks seven or eight
                    persons have been killed, or died of their wounds, in the county. These rioters,
                    to a very considerable extent, control the localities where they reside and
                    dictate terms to the better classes.</p>
                <p>I understand that there is a probability that, as the price of coal has fallen,
                    the coal operators will attempt a reduction of wages; and if so, there will
                    fresh cause of trouble. The worst localities in Schulylkill County are Mahanoy,
                    Cass, Ashland, Reilly, Rush, and New Castle Townships. A good many deserters are
                    scattered throughout these districts. It is estimated that in the county there
                    are between 400 and 500 deserters and drafted men who have not reported. In
                    order to arrest these men, cavalry are necessary, as, if they are taken at all,
                    it must be done in the night, and the detachments ordered out for that purpose
                    have to go and come under cover of darkness in orders to escape observation. It
                    is, in my opinion, necessary that at least twenty cavalry should remain in
                    Pottsville. Infantry cannot move with rapidity enough to do much service in
                    following these deserters among the mountains, but can be of valuable service if
                    scattered in small detachments through the district. Their presence will have a
                    tendency to hold the rioters in check, and they can make arrests in the
                    immediate vicinity where they are located through information obtained from
                    parties who know these deserters, but who, unless they are sure of protection by
                    the presence of troops, are afraid to point them out. It is very important that
                    officers in charge of troops sent into these localities should exercise the
                    greatest possible care over their men, and see that nothing is done or said to
                    injure or destroy property or inflame the passions of the people. The political
                    excitement runs high in the mining districts; and the fact cannot be disguised
                    that there are imprudent men belonging to both parties. The lower classes are
                    given to understand by their leaders that the triumph of one political party
                    will be the signal for a revolution at the North. The men who have committed the
                    riotous acts are mostly Irish laborers. The Welsh, German, and English are
                    generally peaceful, and when drafted have generally reported either in person or
                    by substitutes.</p>
                <p>I was informed while in Pottsville, by responsible parties, that Capt. Bradford,
                    the provost-marshal of the Twelfth District, in the Eastern Division of
                    Pennsylvania, has a brother who is in the bounty-broker business. It was from
                    this district that a large number of the recruits that I inspected at
                    Philadelphia, and which were mostly found unfit for service, came. Mr. Siliman,
                    a large coal operator in Hazleton, and a reliable man, says that the
                    provost-marshal of the Twelfth District has been advised as to the large number
                    of deserters in that township, an has paid no attention to the fact nor
                    attempted to have them arrested. Very few of the men drafted from Luzerne,
                    Wyoming, and Bradford Counties have reported. Many of these deserters are
                    working out, and are well known and can be arrested, especially in Luzerne
                    County. No arrests have been made, I was informed, in Mauch Chunk township,
                    though it abounds whit deserters. The commanding officer of the detachment of
                    cavalry on duty at Hazleton says that he has not been called upon to arrest
                    deserters, though there are a large number in the township.</p>
                <p>I give you the names of a few reliable men in Ashland and Mahanoy Townships,
                    which I have obtained form the provost-marshal of the Elevenths District. It is
                    respectfully recommended that small detachments of troops be stationed in the
                    townships of Ashland, Mahanoy, Reilly, and New Castle until after the election.
                    I think given you the fact as obtained from men who are considered reliable. I
                    am of the opinion that the interests of the service would be enhanced if a
                    competent officer be ordered to take command of the region included in the Tenth
                    and Twelfth Districts, and think that, with proper effort, he might be enabled
                    to have the deserters arrested and the riotous demonstrations quelled.</p>
