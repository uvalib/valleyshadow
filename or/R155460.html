<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General William Loring reports to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper on

<p>Gen. SAMUEL COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen. C. S.
                        Army, Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>December 17, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I inclose herewith a copy of the letter of 15th instant this day received from
                    Col. E. Johnson, commanding at Alleghany. In consequence of the necessity of
                    meeting the enemy at Alleghany, and the uncertainty of their movement, I have
                    determined to keep the command of Col. Johnson where it is for the present,
                    holding it in readiness to move at any time in the direction of Moorefield,
                    should it be thought best. I do this for the reason that it would be some days
                    before that command could move, and that it is undoubtedly the determination of
                    the enemy to occupy Alleghany Pass, if possible, and to re-enforce Gen. Kelley
                    by crossing the Alleghany and forming a junction with him via Moorefield. I
                    have, besides the command of Col. Taliaferro four regiments, advanced some days
                    ago, the whole of the troops from the Huntersville line, composed of the three
                    Tennessee, two Virginia regiments, and the Hampden and Danville batteries of
                    artillery, in all, about 6,000 men.</p>
<p>Two of the regiments, the Seventh Tennessee and the Twenty-first Virginia, left
                    here on yesterday, via the Valley road, and the remainder are now at Ryan's,
                    about 20 miles distant, on the Monterey road. I shall order to move to-morrow
                    morning, via Harrisonburg, the whole, to form a junction with Gen. Jackson at
                    the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
