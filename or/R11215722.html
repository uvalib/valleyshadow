<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In late May, 1862, Confederate forces defeated Union troops under Nathaniel Banks at
          Front Royal. The Confederate troops captured a large number of supplies during the battle.
          Confederate Chief Quartermaster John Harman reports to General Thomas J. Jackson on what
          was captured, and efforts to transport it to the rear. He mentions rounding up all
          available trains and transportation from Staunton for these purposes.</p>

<p>Gen. THOMAS J. JACKSON.</p>
<p>MOSS NECK, VA.,</p>
<p>March 10, 1863.</p>
<p>GENERAL: In response to your inquiry as to the amount of property captured and
            destroyed from the United States forces under Gen. Banks at Front Royal, in the latter
            part of May, 1862, I respectfully submit the following:</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to make an accurate estimate of the property captured, owing to
          the fact that I was only there a part of one day and night, when I was ordered to
          Winchester, and left Capt. S. M. Somers,assistant quartermaster, in charge of the public
          property captured at Front Royal. There was a very large and varied amount of supplies
          found there, consisting of harness, carpenter's tools, clothing, horseshoes and nails,
          blacksmith's tools, forges, axes, sutler's and commissary stores, &amp;c., upon which
          it is impossible to place a reliable estimate of value.</p>
<p>A very considerable amount of these stores passed at once into our possession, being
          taken in charge and use by the different quartermaster as they passed through with their
          trains. Many valuable wagons were thus exchanged, worn-out and injured ones being left in
          their stead. The same was done as to harness.</p>
<p>The subsequent capture of Capt. Somers prevented any detailed report being made of the
          property received and turned in to him.</p>
<p>Upon my arrival in Winchester I at once set about making the most ample preparations for
          removing this property to the rear, and had detailed from each brigade a large number of
          wagons for that purpose. In addition I ordered up all the available transportation from
          Staunton, and it had arrived within less than a day's travel of Front Royal when that
          place was recaptured by a portion of Gen. Shields' army. The trains from the brigades had
          partially arrived there, and a portion had been loaded and sent off, while a part turned
          back to Winchester. This train was placed by me in charge of Capt. J. L. Cole, assistant
          quartermaster, Thirty-seventh Virginia Regiment (since resigned), with instructions to
          take immediate charge of the shipment to the rear. He proceeded in part to the performance
          of his duty, but was interrupted by the entry of the enemy into Front Royal. He narrowly
          escaped capture, having remained behind our troops (on his own motion) for the purpose of
          firing the depot and an adjoining building, full of stores, both of which were burned to
          the ground. His estimate of the stores thus consumed is, I am informed, $300,000, in which
          I concur, from my own recollection of the contents of the buildings. Having accomplished
          this, Capt. Cole followed our retreating forces.</p>
<p>With the preparations made as above, had our forces held possession of Front Royal
          forty-eight hours longer, all the captured property would have been secured and taken to
          the rear.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JOHN A. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Chief Quartermaster, &amp;c.</p>
