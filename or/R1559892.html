<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel Johnston writes to Colonel C. L. Stevenson, Assistant
                    Adjutant for the Army of the Northwest, in December, 1861, to report on
                    information gathered from scouts regarding Union movements. He discusses the
                    threat the Union troops pose to Staunton.</p>

<p>Col. C. L. STEVENSON,<br> Assistant Adjutant Gen., Army
                        Northwest, Staunton:</p>
<p>CAMP ON ALLEGHANY,</p>
<p>December 7, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>If it is intended to abandon entirely this position, under the impression that
                    the enemy have left Cheat Mountain, or that if they have not, the roads and
                    climate, &amp;c., will prevent their making incursions into this country, a
                    grave mistake has been committed. The enemy are still on Cheat Mountain. Their
                    scouts are almost daily seen. To-day my scouts they were in the vicinity of
                    Green Bank, and stole a horse or two. If this post is abandoned there will be
                    nothing to prevent their march to Staunton, and my opinion is that they will
                    improve the opportunity thus offered them. Moreover, if they get possession here
                    it will be difficult to dislodge them. Our own entrenchments will afford them
                    shelter, and additional works will make this point very strong. The cavalry to
                    be here will be, in my opinion, of no avail against the forces of the enemy.
                    Little reliance can be placed in the cavalry I have thus far seen. Infantry and
                    artillery I consider essential in order to hold this position.</p>
<p>I have deemed it my duty thrown out these hints without making any suggestions,
                    and without knowing upon what information in regard to the enemy the
                    contemplated abandonment of this place is predicated. I only state what I know
                    in regard to the immediate presence of the enemy. They have created commodious
                    and comfortable buildings on Cheat Mountain, as I hear from a prisoner captured
                    a few weeks since. He furthermore states that they will annoy us all winter.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>E. JOHNSTON,<br> Col., Cmdg. Monterey Line.</p>
