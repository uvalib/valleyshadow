<p>Maj. GEORGE S. STEVENS, Cmdg., Nelson Station, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>October 3, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit to you the following remarks of Governor Letcher
                    relative to your detailed report of the state of the militia in the county of
                    Nelson, dated the 23d ultimo, viz:</p>
<p>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, September 28, 1861.<br> The county of Nelson not having
                    furnished her quota of volunteers, militia went into camp August 6, 1861. The
                    return of the colonel, one received at the office of the adjutant-general
                    (Richardson), on the 7th of this month, showed that he then had at Camp Mitchell
                    197. This return shows 163, a reduction of 34. Under the 10 percent regulation
                    they were short of their quota upwards of 150 men. While in the camp I proposed,
                    if they would furnish a company of 80 volunteers, I would accept them and
                    disband the balance. These men were to be furnished by a given day, which has
                    long since passed. I still indulged them, and told the officers and others who
                    called upon me that if the number of 80 was not furnished I would order the
                    militia to rendezvous at Staunton, where they would be attached to a regiment
                    being formed at that place. Finding they would do nothing, they were ordered to
                    Staunton. After the order was issued major Stevens came here to see me, and did
                    not pretend to justify their conduct. Among other things, he said, in the
                    presence of Col. Dimmock, that they did not think I would order them into
                    service; that I was not in earnest. I told him as the order had been given they
                    could now tell whether I had been jesting on so serious a subject, and that he
                    must return and execute the order without delay.<br> JOHN LETCHER,</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>GEO. DEAS,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
