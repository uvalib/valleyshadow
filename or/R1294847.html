<p>September 18, 1863.</p>
<p>MAJOR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report the operations of my command during the recent raid of
                    General Averell, U.S. Army.</p>
<p>On Friday, August 21, at 1 a. m. (my headquarters then at Camp Northwest, near
                    Huntersville, Va.), I received a dispatch from Col. W. W. Arnett, commanding
                    detachment at Hightown, Va., that the enemy in large force were in Monterey the
                    evening before, and that he had fallen back to Slaver's, 5 miles this side. I
                    dispatched the information to the commanding officer of the post at Staunton
                    (the dispatch was received in Staunton at 2 p. m. of that day, a distance of 75
                    miles), with the request that a copy be forwarded to General Imboden. I also
                    dispatched to the general commanding, and to Col. George S. Patton, commanding
                    First Brigade, at Lewisburg, and expressed the opinion in the several dispatches
                    that a raid was intended upon Staunton, and also my intention to so move as to
                    get in the rear of the invading force, as it was impossible for me then to get
                    to their front. To Colonel Patton I suggested the propriety of sending a force
                    to the Little Levels.</p>
<p>My command at this time was in detachments (rendered necessary to protect the
                    lines I had been ordered to guard), one at Hightown, 35 miles from my
                    headquarters; one at Camp Miller, 14 miles; one on Thorny Creek, near Green
                    Bank, 10 miles distant, and the other at Camp Northwest.</p>
<p>I directed Colonel Arnett, if pressed, to fall back to me in good order,
                    disputing the advance whenever he could, and I proceeded to draw in the other
                    detachments, which was accomplished during the day.</p>
<p>In the morning of that day, I moved Lieutenant-Colonel Evans with a detachment to
                    Gatewood's, on Back Creek, with a view to the protection of my rear if the
                    advance was on me, and to be my advance guard if the enemy proceeded to
                    Staunton. At 3 p. m., receiving a dispatch from Colonel Arnett, that he was
                    being pressed and was falling back down Back Creek toward Gatewood's, I moved my
                    infantry to that point, arriving at 6 p. m. (a distance of 9 miles), leaving my
                    mounted men at Camp Northwest. This movement was dispatched to the general
                    commanding, to Colonel Patton, and to Colonel Nadenbousch, commanding at
                    Staunton, expressing the opinion that Staunton was not the point of attack.</p>
<p>During that night, the mounted men (with train) of Colonel Arnett's detachment
                    arrived at Camp Northwest, reporting the enemy to be within 8 miles of that camp
                    advancing, and that Colonel Arnett, with his infantry, were cut off. I also
                    learned then that Colonel Arnett, after moving down Back Creek a short distance,
                    for the reason mentioned in his report, had returned to Irving's and fell back,
                    skirmishing with the enemy down Knapp's Creek, and had afterward been cut off
                    with his infantry. Upon my arrival at Gatewood's I re-enforced
                    Lieutenant-Colonel Evans by two companies, and moved his detachment 2 miles up
                    Back Creek and posted the residue of my infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel
                    Thompson, 1 mile in his rear.</p>
<p>On the next morning, the 22d, the enemy advancing on Camp Northwest, I ordered
                    the cavalry to Gatewood's, leaving Captain Hutton, with his company, between
                    Rider's and Camp Northwest, to watch the enemy. To ascertain positively whether
                    an advance was being made on Staunton, I ordered Major Kesler, with 60 mounted
                    men, to McDowell, on the Staunton and Parkersburg turnpike, via Jackson's River
                    and Warm Springs. I also ordered a scout to Warm Springs, to watch the route to
                    that place from Back Creek, and also scouted up Back Creek.</p>
<p>In the evening of the 22d, Captain Hutton had a skirmish with the enemy near camp
                    Northwest; was forced to fall back to Rider's, and reported the enemy making a
                    flank movement via the Little Back Creek route, and also an effort to get in my
                    rear. Ascertaining my position at Gatewood's to be not so tenable as I had
                    supposed, I moved my infantry that night to Jackson's River on the Warm Springs
                    road, leaving my cavalry a short distance below Gatewood's.</p>
<p>In the morning of Sunday, the 23d, the enemy not having advanced to Gatewood's,
                    and thinking it probable that they had gone toward Lewisburg by the Little
                    Levels, I ordered my infantry Gatewood's and the cavalry toward Camp Northwest,
                    directing the infantry to follow. By this time I had succeeded in bringing
                    Colonel Arnett, and the infantry cut off with him, to the command, and Colonel
                    Arnett was placed in command of the cavalry. He moved forward, and finding the
                    enemy advancing, he engaged their skirmishers a short distance this side of said
                    camp, and, finding that he was about to be flanked, fell back to Rider's. At
                    this juncture I reached the front, and discovering the condition of affairs, and
                    also learning that the enemy had been re-enforced by a mounted and an infantry
                    regiment and by additional artillery from Beverly, I fell back to Gatewood's and
                    remained there that night.</p>
<p>The next morning, the 24th, the enemy not then advancing and the horses needing
                    forage, I ordered the cavalry under Colonel Arnett, except 30 under Lieut. G. W.
                    Siple, to Jackson's River, Warm Springs road. At 10 a. m. the advance came in
                    sight, and here, after a skirmish, finding them too strong for me, I fell back
                    in good order to Jackson's River Mountain (Lieutenant Siple in the rear
                    skirmishing constantly with the advance of the enemy) and posted my infantry to
                    stay the advance. I ordered Colonel Arnett to dismount and send 100 of the
                    cavalry to the left on top of the mountain to repel any flanking party.</p>
<p>At this point I prevented the enemy from advancing in front for one hour, but
                    observing that they were surrounding me, I fell back in time, for ten minutes
                    afterward they surrounded the position I had occupied, and, discovering my
                    retreat, rushed after me. As the country between Jackson's River and Warm
                    Springs Mountain gave their large force of cavalry the advantage, and as I knew
                    there was a route to my left to Warm Springs which they could take and reach
                    there before I could with my train (which was then but a short distance in my
                    front), I fell back to Warm Springs Mountain, and placed my command in position
                    for defense. Here I remained for an hour before the enemy appeared, and he came
                    the route I did, and the route by the left aforesaid. I soon saw that the effort
                    of the enemy was merely to amuse me in front while he moved a force equal to
                    mine in my rear and also on my right flank. After skirmishing I fell back about
                    4 miles, and went into camp about 10 p. m. My pickets that night were beyond
                    Bath Alum, toward the Warm Springs.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 25th, I ordered my infantry to the opposite bank of Cow
                    Pasture River, and I proceeded in person to my cavalry camp, near Bath Alum, and
                    to my outer pickets. I then ordered Colonel Arnett to send foot scouts to top of
                    Warm Springs Mountain, if possible, to ascertain the movements of the enemy, and
                    to hold his detachment prepared to move at any moment. Finding that owing to a
                    misunderstanding of my order my infantry had been moved near Old Millborough (2
                    miles this side of Millborough Depot), I directed it to go into camp at that
                    place. My determination was, if the enemy advanced on me, to get to Panther Gap,
                    near Goshen Depot, and endeavor to hold that position until I could be
                    re-enforced from Lexington by the cadets and artillery of the institute, who,
                    with Colonel Edmondson's provost-guard, under General F. H. Smith, the
                    superintendent, was, coming to re-enforce me.</p>
<p>In the evening of this day, Major Kesler returned from his scout, reporting no
                    advance of the enemy upon Staunton, and the road between Monterey and McDowell
                    blockaded.</p>
<p>During this evening I received information from my scouts that the cavalry of the
                    enemy had moved from Warm Springs on the Hot Springs route, and that their
                    infantry was near Warm Springs.</p>
<p>Ascertaining that the enemy, from a point near Hot Springs, could move to my rear
                    at Old Millborough, I guarded against surprise from that point. That night I
                    went in person to my cavalry camp, and directed Colonel Arnett to occupy Warm
                    Springs next morning, if possible.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, I ordered Major Kesler to take his detachment of
                    cavalry to Covington, and, if possible, to Lewisburg, to ascertain and report
                    the movements of the cavalry that had left Warm Springs.</p>
<p>By 12 m. of this day. Colonel Arnett arrived at and occupied Warm Springs,
                    reporting that all the cavalry of the enemy, with six pieces of artillery, had
                    taken the Hot Springs route toward Covington or Lewisburg, and that their
                    infantry had fallen back to Gatewood's, and under my orders he proceeded to
                    scout after the enemy.</p>
<p>I did not move my infantry this day, as I had no reliable information of the
                    movement of the enemy. The most reliable at this time, from courier who met
                    Major Kesler, was that the enemy were moving through McGraw's Gap to Jordan's
                    Furnace.</p>
<p>During this evening Colonel Edmondson, from Lexington, with 40 mounted men,
                    arrived, and I received a dispatch from General Smith that he had arrived at
                    Goshen. Then ascertaining that there was no movement of the enemy through
                    McGraw's Gap, I dispatched to General Smith my opinion that the enemy were
                    making their way to Lewisburg; that I was most anxious to make a diversion in
                    favor of our forces there, and requesting him to co-operate with me, and if he
                    could do no more to lend me his artillery. This he declined to do for reasons
                    satisfactory to himself, and accordingly the general and Colonel Edmondson moved
                    back to Rockbridge Alum.</p>
<p>On the next morning, the 27th, I ordered my infantry to Warm Springs and rode
                    forward myself to that point. On my arrival there rumors of fighting near
                    Lewisburg reached me, and reports that our force there was falling back before
                    the enemy. I ordered Lieutenant Stifle to take the Hot Springs route, and
                    proceed until he saw and felt the enemy. Captain Lewis, with a detachment of 20
                    men, moved toward Gatewood's.</p>
<p>At 3 a. m., Friday (the 28th), I received a dispatch from Major Kesler that the
                    enemy were falling back toward Warm Springs, and for me to be on the lookout.</p>
<p>About this time William McClintoc, esq., surveyor of Bath County, a reliable
                    gentleman, informed me that the citizens were effectually blockading the
                    Jackson's River road (Boiler's, or Indian Draft}. I requested him to return
                    (which he did) and see that the blockade was made complete. I ordered Colonel
                    Arnett to have the road to Hot Springs, and the road leading from the Jackson's
                    River road into the Warm Springs road, near Richards' Mill, blockaded. This was
                    being accomplished when the report arrived that the enemy were near Gatewood's,
                    on the Indian Draft route, and to that place I moved my force as rapidly as
                    possible, overcoming the blockades of the enemy between Jackson's River and
                    Gatewood's.</p>
<p>Colonel Arnett arrived at Gatewood's in time to fire on the pickets and see the
                    rear of the enemy in rapid retreat, and following them to Little Back Creek he
                    turned to the right across the mountain to blockade the Knapp's Creek road;
                    Arriving at Little Back Creek, and ascertaining Colonel Arnett s movements, and
                    being satisfied that the enemy would not take the Knapp's Creek road, I ordered
                    him back and to the pursuit of the enemy on the Huntersville road. Directing the
                    infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Evans, to follow as rapidly as possible, I
                    moved on with the cavalry.</p>
<p>Between Rider's and Camp Northwest, about 6 p. m. of the 28th, I received the
                    dispatch of the general commanding, dated the 27th and headed via Union and
                    Dublin, announcing the victory at White Sulphur Springs, and intimating that the
                    enemy were retreating toward Warm Springs, and that his force was in pursuit,
                    and directing me to push and destroy them, if possible. Pushing on, my advance
                    ran in the pickets at Huntersville, and discovered the enemy there apparently
                    intending to make a stand in supporting distance of the infantry regiment which
                    had been left in their rear. That regiment, I have since learned, was then at
                    Marling's Bottom, 6 1/2 miles from Huntersville.</p>
<p>As it was now dark, and as no re-enforcement arrived to assist in the pursuit, I
                    halted at and near Camp Northwest, with a view not then to press the pursuit
                    until I could move a force by the Clover Lick route in ahead of the enemy at Big
                    Spring; to blockade the road and hold the enemy until we could get up to their
                    rear (it was entirely practicable to so move), and then, with any re-enforcement
                    that might arrive, attack. Accordingly, I directed Colonel Arnett, with the
                    cavalry at his disposal, after resting a few hours, to make that movement during
                    the night.</p>
<p>At 10 p. m. I received a dispatch from Colonel Corns, commanding the Eighth
                    Virginia, Cavalry and Dunn's battalion, that he had arrived at Gatewood's. I
                    requested him to come on as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At 2 a. m. on the 29th, Colonel Arnett started up Knapp's Creek to take the
                    Clover Lick route, and as soon as it was light I directed the infantry under
                    Lieutenant-Colonel Evans, to move toward Huntersville. Arriving at that
                    place--having to overcome a blockade-- I found that the enemy had gone on toward
                    Marling's Bottom, and to that point I directed my infantry. Stopping to write a
                    dispatch, Colonel Corns arrived, and I requested him to send 200 men to
                    re-enforce Colonel Arnett, who had gone the Clover Lick route, offering to
                    furnish guides, and expressing the opinion that there was yet time to make the
                    movement. After counseling with several officers he decided that his horses
                    could not make the trip in their then condition. I then requested him to come on
                    to Marling's Bottom, to which he assented and moved accordingly. Arriving at
                    Marling's Bottom, the rear of the enemy in retreat was reported as not being far
                    from the bridge.</p>
<p>I requested Colonel Corns to move his command rapidly up the bottom, cross the
                    river, and endeavor to cut off some of the rear of the enemy. He replied that
                    his horses could not raise a trot. On arriving at the bridge and riding forward
                    with Colonel Corns, we concluded the rear of the enemy was about 1 mile distant.
                    He afterward moved toward Lewisburg.</p>
<p>By this time Major Kesler's detachment arrived, and I ordered him to pursue as
                    rapidly as he could in the then condition of his horses, and the infantry to
                    follow. Arriving at Edray, and finding that my infantry could go no farther and
                    could not catch the enemy, I halted them. Major Kesler had gone on. Here I
                    dispatched to Colonel Wharton at Warm Springs, who had informed me that he was
                    coming on, that it was useless for him to do so.</p>
<p>Colonel Arnett on that day did get in ahead of the enemy at Big Spring; blockaded
                    the road beyond; posted some of his men; delayed and fired upon the enemy, but
                    with his small force could do nothing more. His report is here with inclosed. I
                    think his conduct throughout is praiseworthy. Major Kesler, owing to the
                    blockades of the enemy and the condition of his horses, could not get up in
                    time. His report accompanies this.</p>
<p>When General Averell arrived at Monterey his force was not less than 3,000 men.
                    He was afterward re-enforced by two regiments. He had in addition eight pieces
                    of artillery. This whole force came up after me to Warm Springs. At no time when
                    I had all together had I more than 1,000 effective men. Throughout the whole
                    affair I had no artillery. The government cattle within my lines were saved. My
                    train was safely brought out.</p>
<p>My loss in wounded and missing will not exceed 20; and only a few guns and
                    saddles, which could not be brought out, were destroyed by the enemy.</p>
<p>I recaptured a number of cattle and horses belonging to citizens, and captured a
                    number of horses from the enemy. These I will report as soon as I can get them
                    together.</p>
<p>The loss of the enemy in the various skirmishes with my command is believed to be
                    about 25 killed, a number wounded, and 20 prisoners. I have no means of
                    ascertaining the number wounded. General Averell's command suffered severely
                    during his whole advance, the fight at White Sulphur, and throughout his whole
                    retreat.</p>
<p>My command throughout, officers and men, behaved well, enduring patiently great
                    hardships, and conducted themselves as well as any new recruits under the same
                    circumstances.</p>
<p>Regretting that I did not accomplish more, but respectfully submitting that, with
                    all the means and information before me, I accomplished all that was possible,</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your Obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. L. JACKSON,<br> Colonel, Commanding Huntersville Line.</p>
