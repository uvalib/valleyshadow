<p>Lieut. C. W. KIRBY,<br> Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>Camp Piatt, W. Va.,</p>
<p>July 1, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of my command during the late expedition,
     from June 1 until the 29th:</p>
<p>On the 1st of June left Bunger's Mills, Greenbrier County, W. Va., and arrived at Staunton,
     Augusta County, Va.; on the 8th, had considerable skirmishing with the enemy, but met with no
     loss, marching a distance of 105 miles.</p>
<p>On the 10th left Staunton and proceeded to Lexington, via Middlebrook, where we skirmished
     with the enemy, lost 1 man killed and 1 severely wounded. Distance from Staunton thirty-six
     miles.</p>
<p>Left Lexington on the morning of the 14th and arrived at Liberty, on the Virginia and
     Tennessee Railroad, on the morning of the 16th a distance of forty-five miles. Occupied the day
     in destroying the railroad for a distance of eight miles.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th moved in direction of Lynchburg, a distance of sixteen miles,
     engaged the enemy, my regiment forming the right of the Third Brigade, Second Infantry
     Division; had 1 commissioned officer slightly wounded and 1 private severely wounded.</p>
<p>On the 18th, after some maneuvering, engaged the enemy about 1 p. m., and after a severe
     engagement was withdrawn from the field with a loss of 5 killed and 63 wounded.</p>
<p>Commenced retreating on the evening of the 18th and arrived at Lewisburg, Greenbrier County,
     W. Va., on the evening of the 26th, a distance of 148 miles.</p>
<p>Same evening left and arrived at this camp on the evening of the 29th, a distance of ninety
     miles. Whole distance marched 448 miles. Loss in killed, wounded, and missing, 70.</p>
<p>The men are much wearied and exhausted, not one-half of my command being able for effective
     duty at the present time.</p>
<p>I am, yours, very respectfully,</p>
<p>THOMAS MORRIS,<br> Lieut.-Col., Cmdg. Regt.</p>
