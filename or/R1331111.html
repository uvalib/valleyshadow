<p><b>Summary:<br></b>The Shenandoah Valley provided a rich source of food and supply for a Confederate
                    army at times hard pressed to procure adequate provisions. In this January,
                    1864, letter, Robert E. Lee orders General Jubal Early, commanding at Staunton,
                    to send expeditions into the countryside for the purpose of procuring
                cattle.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. A. EARLY,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c., Staunton,
                        Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 21, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 11th instant, with Gen. Rosser's dispatch inclosed, is
                    received.</p>
<p>I hope that you will bear in mind the great importance of obtaining supplies of
                    subsistence of the army. I fully appreciate the great difficulties that attended
                    the late expedition to Hardy and Hampshire, and have no doubt that the men
                    brought out all the cattle that they could under the circumstances; but I am
                    informed by Maj. Hawks and others that there are many cattle in that region
                    still which might be obtained, and which we should spare no effort to get. Owing
                    to the condition of the roads and the intense cold, rendering rapid movements
                    necessary, those parts of the country where most of the cattle are said to be
                    were not visited. The cattle brought out were obtained generally on the line of
                    march, as I am informed by Maj. Gilmor. In sending any expedition into that
                    country, care should be taken to select men well acquainted with it, and who
                    know where the cattle are to be found. I desire that if you find the weather and
                    roads unsuitable for the movements of an organized body of troops you will
                    endeavor to get all the cattle, &amp;c., that can be brought out by
                    intelligent and active individuals, giving them all the assistance in your
                    power. Maj. A. H. Johnson, commissary of subsistence, Harrisonburg; Capt.
                    Coontz, assistant commissary of subsistence, New Market; and Capt. Ross, of
                    Gilmor's battalion, have been named to me as well qualified to aid in this work,
                    by their energy, intelligence, and knowledge of the resources of the country. I
                    wish you to put them and other suitable persons at this important business as
                    soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from Gen. Sedgwick, dated the 20th instant, which
                    shows that he is present himself on the other side of the Rapidan, commanding in
                    the absence of Gen. Meade. How much of his corps has been sent to the valley is
                    uncertain. Some reports say a brigade, others a division, and others still a
                    brigade and a division. The camps are said to be still standing, so that it is
                    certain that the whole corps has not gone.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
