<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this July, 1863, dispatch, Union General William French writes General Daniel
                    Butterfield concerning efforts to cut off Lee's retreat from Gettysburg. He
                    mentions Confederate troop movements in the Chambersburg area.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Received 7 p. m.<br> Maj.-Gen. Butterfield,<br> Chief
                        of Staff:</p>
<p>Frederick City, Md.,</p>
<p>July 5, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have a brigade occupying the passes, with infantry and artillery. The cavalry
                    detachment which destroyed the pontoon bridge at Falling Waters, 3 miles this
                    side of Williamsport, also captured an ammunition train, which was thrown into
                    the river.</p>
<p>The enemy had commenced a trestle-bridge at the ferry. This has been ordered to
                    be broken up by me. I have positive information that there is no bridge at Clear
                    Spring.</p>
<p>I have just received information that the enemy are fortifying the heights
                    covering the Shepherdstown Ford, and that a bridge is constructed, all ready to
                    swing across from the Virginia side.</p>
<p>Lee is said to be moving to place his right on the river at Williamsport, his
                    left and mass being at Chambersburg. It seems as if he was taking up the
                    Antietam campaign.</p>
<p>I sent a dispatch about the smallness of my command, and that it would be
                    throwing away a regiment or two to put them into the cul-de-sac of Maryland
                    Heights without ammunition or supplies, there being only a few days' now here.</p>
<p>I can worry their rear through Crampton's Gap, and delay their passage of the
                    river, which I am told cannot now be forded. I want troops from Washington, and
                    supplies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WM. H. FRENCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
