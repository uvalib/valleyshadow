<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Benjamin Franklin Kelley informs General in Chief Henry Halleck of December, 1862, cavalry
     operations in the Shenandoah Valley. Franklin plans to threaten and harass the enemy from
     Winchester to Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p>CUMBERLAND, MD.,</p>
<p>December 9, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your telegram received. One of Gen. Thomas' (either Cox, Crook, or Scammon) brigades left New
     Creek for Petersburg, in Hardy County,on Saturday last, and he will follow in a day or two with
     the balance of his command, and occupy Moorefield, the county seat of Hardy, and Franklin, the
     county seat of Pendleton. This will give protection to the loyal citizens of the valley of the
     South Branch, and prevent the enemy from making raids into the adjoining counties lying west,
     as well as enable our troops to threaten and harass the enemy in the Shenandoah at all points
     from Winchester to Staunton. My cavalry are in Romney every day, but I will now, as you
     suggest, occupy it permanently. We have the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad repaired, and are now
     running construction trains as far east as North Mountain, within 8 miles of Martinsburg. I
     have parts of two regiments protecting the workmen. I write you fully by mail to-night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>B. F. KELLEY,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
