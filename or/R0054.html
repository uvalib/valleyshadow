<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Lieut. Col. James MacThomson was a member of the one hundred and seventh
                    Pennsylvania Infantry which was in the Army of the Potomac. MacThomson reports

<p>Lieut. Small, A. A. A. G., First Brig., Second Div.,
                        First Army Corps. </p>
<p></p>
<p>July 10, 1863.</p>
<p>Lieut</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following necessarily short report of the part the
                    regiment under my command took in the engagement of July 1:</p>
<p>Went into the fight at about 1 p. m., with 230 guns and 25 commissioned officers,
                    the men loading as they walked. Were in action about two hours. Captured more
                    prisoners than the regiment numbered. I regret to report the loss of large
                    numbers of most excellent soldiers.</p>
<p>The casualties are, as far as ascertained, as follows: Field officers,
                    lieutenant-colonel slightly, major severely, wounded; 3 commissioned officers
                    known to be wounded, and 6 commissioned officers missing; 11 enlisted men known
                    to be killed, 48 known to be wounded, and 93 missing.</p>
<p>Men could not have fought better than these men, and I am gratified to say that
                    not a single exhibition of cowardice of either officers or men was observed
                    during the whole engagement.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted. With much respect, I am, lieutenant, your most
                        obedient servant,</p>
<p>JAMES MacTHOMSON, Lieut.-Col., Comdg. 107th Pennsylvania Volunteers.</p>
