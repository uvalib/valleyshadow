<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During July, 1861, Union forces under George B. McClellan defeated Confederates
                    in what is now West Virginia, and threatened to advance toward the Shenandoah
                    Valley. Staunton served as an important Confederate base of supply during the
                    campaign. In this letter to Confederate Assistant Adjutant George Deas, General
                    Henry R. Jackson mentions artillery sent west from Staunton to meet the Federal
                    advance.</p>

<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>CAMP AT MONTEREY, VA.,</p>
<p>July 22, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Unless a considerable force be at once put upon the road from Millborough,
                    through Huntersville, towards Huttonsville, the enemy will overrun Pocahontas
                    and get possession of the Central Railroad. There is good reason for believing
                    that he is now upon Middle Mountain, twenty-five miles only beyond Huntersville,
                    and we have but one regiment (Col. Lee's) on the road to meet him. I shall do
                    what I possibly can to support Col. Lee from this point; but Monterey is
                    equidistant with Millborough from Huntersville. It is unfortunate that one of
                    the regiments, with the artillery, now in motion from Staunton, had not been
                    sent, in accordance with my suggestion, up to Millborough. I have dispatched
                    Capt. Cole, C. S. Army, to Huntersville, for the purpose of collecting and
                    reporting reliable information, and of providing for transporting and
                    provisioning the forces which may be sent in that direction, although the
                    prospect of obtaining provisions or transportation there is very limited.</p>
<p></p>
<p> H. R. JACKSON,<br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
