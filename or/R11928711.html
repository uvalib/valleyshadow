<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In November, 1862, General Thomas J. Jackson's Confederates guarded the
                    Shenandoah Valley against any possible advance by Federal forces. In this
                    letter, Lee discusses Jackson's movements and supply situation, including
                    blankets and shoes forwarded from Staunton.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gen. THOMAS J. JACKSON,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 10, 1862</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 9th instant has been received, and I am glad to learn that
                    your command is in condition to move whenever it becomes necessary. My letter of
                    yesterday will have explained to you my views, and informed you that I rely upon
                    your judgment and discretion in determining the time of your departure. As soon
                    as you think that your presence in that portion of the valley will not retard or
                    prevent the advance of the enemy east of the Blue Ridge, I wish you to advance
                    with all celerity to unite with Longstreet's corps. You must inform yourself of
                    the routes, prepare provision and forage for the occasion, and lose no time in
                    executing your march when it is commenced. As stated in my previous letter,
                    should you find yourself in danger at any time of being cut off from the route
                    west of the Massanutten Mountains, you must move at once.</p>
<p>I am in hopes that the shoes and blankets forwarded by Col. Corley from Staunton
                    will be sufficient for your wants.</p>
<p>I will endeavor to have the signal line through Thornton's Gap extended to these
                    headquarters, but we are very deficient in men.</p>
<p>I have heard of no change in the disposition of the forces of the enemy since I
                    wrote yesterday, except that their cavalry has retired from Washington, and the
                    route through Chester Gap is supposed to be open. Gen. Stuart, who drove the
                    enemy to-day the other side of Amissville, reports having seen large encampments
                    beyond Warrenton.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
