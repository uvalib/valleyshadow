<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Staunton, VA, served as an important point of communication in and out of the
                    Shenandoah Valley throughout the war. In this July, 1861, letter to Assistant
                    Adjutant General George Deas, William W. Loring reports finding Staunton crowded
                    with illegally furloughed men attempting to return to their homes in Georgia.
                    Loring countermanded the furloughs and arrested the men's commanding
                officer.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE NORTHWEST,</p>
<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Richmond,
                        Va.:</p>
<p>Monterey, Va.,</p>
<p>July 25, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that, upon reaching here, I found the command very
                    much scattered, and I am now endeavoring to concentrate it at points of strength
                    near the Alleghany and on the turnpike from Millborough to Huntersville. Before
                    my arrival Gen. Jackson had forwarded two regiments of infantry in the direction
                    of Elk Mountain. We have no positive information of their reaching it, but we
                    have heard indirectly that Col. Lee had succeeded in getting to Middle Mountain,
                    and was in position. I shall push forward re-enforcements to him, and thus
                    secure the turnpike and Central Railroad in that direction. I shall also
                    re-enforce Col. Johnson, who is in position on the Alleghany Mountains, which is
                    not thought to be a very strong one.</p>
<p>No information has been received from Gens. Wise or Floyd, except a rumor that
                    the former had been victorious in a fight with the enemy, and that McClellan had
                    sent Col. McCook, with one regiment of infantry and a battery of artillery, to
                    meet Gen. Wise. Should Gens. Wise and Floyd be delayed, it will be very
                    necessary to send additional forces to this point and Huntersville, in order to
                    secure beyond doubt the pass of the Alleghany and the turnpike leading to the
                    Central Road. This is rendered more necessary in consequence of the utter
                    demoralization of Col. Ramsey's regiment of Georgia volunteers. Two other
                    regiments are somewhat in the same condition. Upon my arrival at Staunton, day
                    before yesterday, I there found a large number of officers and several hundred
                    men belonging to Col. Ramsey's and to other regiments, with leaves of absence to
                    visit Georgia and other places. I immediately countermanded all of the
                    furloughs, and ordered a competent officer stationed there to take charge of
                    them, and to permit neither officer nor man to leave without authority from me.
                    En route from Staunton I passed large numbers on the road, and was told that the
                    farm houses on the road were filled with them. This is in consequence of Col.
                    Ramsey-stationed by Gen. Jackson some ten miles below this point-having given
                    his entire regiment leaves of absence. I have directed that every effort be made
                    to concentrate them, but it may now be impossible to do so. I have ordered the
                    arrest of Col. Ramsey. At the latest dates neither the Tennessee nor Georgia
                    regiments of infantry, nor the Georgia battery of artillery, which were assigned
                    to this army, had reached Staunton.</p>
<p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding, &amp;c.</p>
