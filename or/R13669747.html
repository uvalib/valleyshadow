<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Provost Marshall George Sharpe writes General Andrew Humphreys to discuss
                    Confederate positions, and the supply situation in the army. Sharpe mentions the
                    June, 1864, capture of Staunton, the results it had on Union supply, and the
                    subsequent capture by Confederates of a Union wagon train near Gordonsville.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HUMPHREYS,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 11, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The following memorandum is forwarded of the information brought by Mitchell, of
                    the Twenty-second North Carolina; communicated last night: He says that up to
                    Wednesday night of this week Anderson's division, of A. P. Hill's corps, was
                    lying in reserve in the rear of Breckinridge's division, which was to the left
                    of Wilcox's (his own) division: that on Wednesday night Anderson relieved
                    Breckinridge and the next day (Thursday) it was found that Breckinridge, had not
                    occupied the former position of Anderson, but it was well understood that he had
                    gone to the Valley.</p>
<p>Previous to this news had been received of the capture of Staunton and a
                    considerable number of prisoners by our forces, and it was also rumored within
                    the rebel lines that some of our forces were advancing this way and had got as
                    far as Orange Court-House. It was added that subsequent to the capture of
                    Staunton some successes had been achieved by the Confederates in the capture of
                    a large wagon train, reported 300 in number at a point which was only
                    indistinctly stated as being above Gordonsville.</p>
<p>On Thursday pease and onions were issued to Scales' brigade, potatoes to
                    McGowan's brigade, and curried cabbage to Thomas' brigade, all of Wilcox's
                    division. The amounts were ample, and the issues were understood to have been
                    the result of the capture. Mitchell states that it is well known that we are not
                    using the railroad to the White House, and that on Wednesday evening, lying near
                    Gen. Scales, who was talking with other officers, he heard him say that we were
                    not preparing to use it. He says that a large number of scouts are employed to
                    continually approach and reconnoiter our lines in front, as it is their
                    momentary expectation to find our lines withdrawn for the purpose of being
                    passed to the left to the James River. For this, it is claimed, full preparation
                    has been made, and it is given out in the rebel army that a portion of Gen.
                    Beauregard's forces have occupied and entrenched Malvern Hill, and that their
                    lines are sufficiently prolonged to connect with Malvern Hill from their present
                    position in our front. Wilcox's division lies in front of Gen. Birney's division
                    of the Second Army Corps.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>GEORGE H. SHARPE,<br> Col. and Deputy Provost-Marshal-Gen.</p>
