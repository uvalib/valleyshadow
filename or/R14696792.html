<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:</p>
<p></p>
<p> March 8th, 1865. (Via Winchester, Va. Received 4.15 p.m. 8th.)</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report the following operations of the forces under my
                    command since leaving Winchester:</p>
<p>We pushed rapidly up the valley to Staunton, arriving there on the night of the
                    1st instant, encountering but little opposition. Parties of the enemy made their
                    appearance on our flanks, but no attention was paid to them. At Mount Crawford,
                    Rosser, with a portion of his command, attempted to hold the position and
                    destroy the bridge, but was handsomely charged by a portion of Col. Capehart's
                    brigade, and drove them on a run to Mount Sidney. Gen. Early then hastily
                    evacuated Staunton, which was occupied by Col. Stagg's brigade, and the railroad
                    bridge over Christian's Creek was burned. On the morning of the 2d the whole
                    command marched into Staunton. I then directed Gen. Merritt to order Gen.
                    Custer, with his division, to follow up the enemy, who had moved in the
                    direction of Waynesborough, the First Division following in support of Gen.
                    Custer. Gen. Custer found the enemy in line of battle in a strong position at
                    Waynesborough, and at once attacked him with Pennington's and Wells' brigades,
                    of his division, and Capehart's brigade, of the Second Division (Gen.
                    Chapman's), with the following result: 9 pieces light artillery, 13
                    battle-flags, 1,165 enlisted men, 78 officers, from 125 to 150 wagons and
                    ambulances, with teams complete, captured. The caissons and teams of the
                    artillery were also complete. Nearly the entire force of the enemy was captured.
                    Gen.'s Early, Wharton, Rosser, and Lilley were present on the field. Gen.'s
                    Early and Lilley escaped to the mountain. In addition to the above captures, we
                    destroyed between Harrisonburg and Staunton 25 wagons and ambulances, and at
                    Staunton 100 wagons. At Swoope's Depot 1,200 uniforms and a quantity of
                    subsistence stores, burning the Government buildings. The force that made the
                    stand here was two brigades of Wharton's division and a portion of Rosser's
                    cavalry.</p>
