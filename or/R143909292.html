<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Assistant Adjutant for the Department of the Susquehanna, John Schultze, issues
                    in Chambersburg these August, 1864, orders. Schultze instructs Captain Samuel
                    Walker to gather his company for the purpose of obstructing roads and defending
                    Pennsylvania in the event of a Confederate move across the Potomac.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Capt. SAMUEL WALKER:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>August 26, 1864</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>The commanding general requests that you get your company together, and with axes
                    and rifles proceed to defend the roads through the gap between Fannettsburg and
                    Burnt Cabins. You must also have pickets at Loudon and be in readiness when they
                    inform you of the approach of the enemy to have the roads above mentioned made
                    inaccessible by felling trees and other obstructions, and thus defend the same
                    by bushwhacking, &amp;c. There is no enemy reported north of the Potomac
                    yet, but there is no doubt about there being a large force on the south side,
                    and it will be well for the Government and yourself to be in readiness to meet
                    any advance they might make in your direction. Please state by the bearer what
                    action you intend taking and the probable success.</p>
<p>I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. S. SCHULTZE,<br> Maj. and Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
