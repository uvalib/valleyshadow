<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June, 1863, General Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in what became the
                    Gettysburg campaign. In this dispatch, Union General Ambrose Burnside reports
                    that Lee's cavalry held points as far west as Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. ROSECRANS,<br> Murfreesborough, Tenn.:</p>
<p>CINCINNATI,</p>
<p>June 17, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lee seems to be moving up to the north, with a view to the invasion of
                    Pennsylvania and Ohio, he holds the Shenandoah Valley, and as far west as
                    Cumberland and as far as Chambersburg, with cavalry, and we still hold Harper's
                    Ferry. I think the main body of his force is still between the Blue Ridge and
                    Bull Mountains. Indications are that Hooker is followed him, and I hope he will
                    make a successful attack on his rear. I have sent out those two expeditions of
                    which I have already informed you, and am very much inclined to follow them with
                    all my available amount of force into East Tennessee, say, to the extent of 5,00
                    or 6,00 men. What is your opinion? Will it be of service to you if the move is
                    made?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. E. BURNSIDE,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
