<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee authorizes General Edward Johnson, commanding at Staunton, to
                    detain persons passing through his lines, and arrest any carrying unauthorized
                    letters. Lee designed his April, 1862, to prevent spying by the enemy.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. EDWARD JOHNSON,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>April 23, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>My attention has been directed to the recent capture by the enemy of certain
                    persons endeavoring to make their way to the enemy's country having in their
                    possession a large number of letters directed to persons in various parts of the
                    United States. The letters were detained and the bearers released. Other cases
                    of the same kind have occurred, and there is reason to believe that the enemy
                    obtains information of what transpires within our lines by means of
                    correspondence conducted in this way. I have therefore to request that you will
                    cause every precaution to be taken to prevent such correspondence, by directing
                    all persons attempting to pass your lines to be examined and letters found in
                    their possession to be scrutinized by your officers. Objectionable letters and
                    the bearers of them will be detained. I shall apply to the Governor to direct
                    the proper civil officers along the border to give their attention to this
                    subject, and you will please cause all necessary assistance that it may be in
                    your power to give to be rendered to such officers by the troops under your
                    command.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen., Cmdg.</p>
