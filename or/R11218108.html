<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General John C. Fremont reports on the progress of the April, 1862,
                    offensive in the Shenandoah Valley. In this letter, he reports to Secretary of
                    War Stanton on the collapse of Confederate militia, and the movement of sick on
                    railroads from Staunton, Virginia.</p>

<p>Hon. E.M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Wheeling,</p>
<p>April 26, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Milroy reports that his scouting parties at different times on the 23rd
                    attacked parties of enemy's infantry and cavalry 10 miles beyond Shenandoah
                    Mountain. Killed 1 lieutenant and 2 men, and captured 1 man of Churchville
                    Cavalry; also captured a lieutenant of Thirty-first Virginia, without loss or
                    injury to us. Militia impressed are deserting by hundreds, taking oath of
                    allegiance, and returning to their homes. The latest reports from Staunton are
                    that on the 24th the enemy were moving their sick on cars eastward, and that
                    large trains loaded with soldiers, supposed to be Johnson's were passing
                    eastward. No soldiers in or about Staunton and none this side, except one
                    regiment and one battalion of infantry and four companies of cavalry at Buffalo
                    Gap. He also reports that communication has been cut off between him and Gen.
                    Schenck by the high water. Snow fell 18 inches deep day before yesterday at
                    Monterey.</p>
