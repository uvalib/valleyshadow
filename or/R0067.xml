                <p>In obedience to circular from division headquarters, I have the honor to submit
                    the following report of the operations of the "Stonewall" Brigade, on the 27th
                    ultimo, in the affair at Payne's Farm:</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 27th, this brigade moved from the rifle-pits near Rhodes'
                    house, on the road leading by Bartlett's Mill to Locust Grove, following
                    Stafford's brigade, with the ambulances of the division, Andrews' artillery, and
                    Steuart's brigade in our rear. When about 2 miles from Bartlett's Mill, I was
                    informed by Major Moore, division inspector, that the enemy's skirmishers were
                    firing into General Steuart's column from the woods on our left. Halting my
                    brigade and facing it to the front in line of battle, I ordered
                    Lieutenant-Colonel Colston, commanding Second Virginia, to deploy his regiment
                    in my front and advance his skirmishers through the woods, which he did, and his
                    regiment remained in front, gallantly holding the enemy in check until the
                    brigade advanced to its support.</p>
                <p>I regret very much that Lieutenant-Colonel Colston lost his leg while commanding
                    this line of skirmishers, as he is a gallant and efficient officer, and his
                    services are very much needed with his regiment at this time.</p>
                <p>After remaining in line of battle along the road for two hours, I received orders
                    to advance with the rest of the division, and moved forward, with Stafford on my
                    right and Steuart on my left. The ground in my front for about 500 yards was
                    thickly wooded and brushy, and beyond that was a cleared farm owned by a man
                    named Payne. The brigade advanced rapidly through the woods and encountered the
                    enemy at the edge of the open ground, who soon gave way in confusion, and was
                    followed by my men some distance into the open field, when, finding that they
                    were unsupported on our left, and being exposed to a fire from the enemy on that
                    flank posted in the woods, which extended farther on our left than in our front,
                    they fell back to the edge of the woods, where we maintained our ground until
                    dark, when we fell back to the road, bringing off all our wounded and a portion
                    of our dead.</p>
                <p>The total loss of the brigade in this action was 20 killed and 124 wounded.</p>
                <p>About 10 o'clock that night the brigade moved off with the rest of the division
                    unmolested by the enemy. The subsequent operations of the brigade during the
                    rest of the campaign were unimportant, and no special report is deemed
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>To my personal staff, and especially to Captain Barton, assistant
                    adjutant-general, I am indebted for valuable assistance on the field.</p>
                <closer>
