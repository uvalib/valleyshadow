<p></p>
<p>Washington, D. C.,</p>
<p>December 14, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the eventful morning of July 1, between 7 and 8 o'clock, General Reynolds sent for me for
     the purpose of explaining the telegrams received by him in relation to the movements of the
     rebels and the latest position of our own troops. This information showed that the enemy was
     reported in force at Cashtown and Mummasburg, and that our cavalry was skirmishing with them on
     the roads leading from Gettysburg to those places. He told me he had already given orders to
     Wadsworth's division, with Hall's battery, to move forward, and that he would accompany these
     troops in person, while I remained to bring up the balance of the corps. Owing to the intervals
     between the divisions and the necessity of calling in the pickets, from an hour and a half to
     two hours elapsed before the remaining troops were en route. Wadsworth's division was,
     therefore, obliged to sustain the brunt of the action alone for this length of time. As soon as
     I saw that Robinson's and Rowley's divisions, with the remaining batteries, had commenced the
     march, I rode on in advance of the column.</p>
<p>The sound of rapid cannon firing convinced me that our cavalry was warmly engaged. I pushed
     forward at full speed, and soon overtook Wadsworth's division, which had left the main road and
     was filing rapidly through woods and fields toward a ridge which ran north and south, about 400
     yards to the west of the seminary, which is itself about a quarter of a mile to the west of
     Gettysburg, and located on a similar ridge parallel to the first. About 200 yards farther on,
     the former range of heights sloped down, and ended in a ravine called Willoughby's Run. On the
     most westerly of these ridges, General Reynolds had directed his line of battle to be formed,
     and was himself superintending the placing of Cutler's brigade as I rode up. I had previously
     sent an aide (Lieutenant Marten) to the general for instructions. He returned with orders for
     me to attend to the Millerstown road, on the left of our line. A small piece of woods cut the
     line of battle in about two equal parts. These woods possessed all the advantages of a redoubt,
     strengthening the center of our line, and enfilading the enemy's columns should they advance in
     the open spaces on either side. I deemed the extremity of the woods, which extended to the
     summit of the ridge, to be the key of the position, and urged that portion of Meredith's
     brigade, the Western men assigned to its defense, to hold it to the last extremity. Full of the
     memory of their past achievements, they replied cheerfully and proudly, "If we can't hold it,
     where will you find men who can?" General Reynolds' intention appeared to be simply to defend
     the two roads entering the town from the northwest and southwest, and to occupy and hold the
     woods between them. The principal effort of the enemy was made on the Cashtown road from the
     northwest, and was opposed at first by Cutler's brigade and Hall's battery, the former
     stretching across, the latter posted on, the right of the road.</p>
<p>Immediately on my arrival at the ridge, I rode to the left to examine the ground in that
     direction, and then was engaged in overseeing the operations of Meredith's brigade, commonly
     known as the Iron Brigade. These troops were formed in the following order, from right to left:
     The Second Wisconsin, Seventh Wisconsin, Nineteenth Indiana, and Twenty-fourth Michigan
     Volunteers. The Sixth Wisconsin, together with the brigade guard, under Lieutenants Harris, of
     the Sixth Wisconsin, and Showalter, of the Second Wisconsin, had been detached by my order, to
     remain with me as a reserve. There was no time to be lost, as the enemy was already in the
     woods, and advancing at double-quick to seize this important central position and hold the
     ridge. The Iron Brigade, led by the Second Wisconsin in line, and followed by the other
     regiments, deployed en echelon without a moment's hesitation, charged with the utmost
     steadiness and fury, hurled the enemy back into the run, captured, after a sharp and desperate
     conflict, nearly 1,000 prisoners--all from Archer's brigade--and reformed their lines on the
     high ground beyond the ravine.</p>
<p>The Second Wisconsin, in this contest, under the gallant Colonel Fairchild, was particularly
     distinguished. It accomplished the difficult task of driving superior numbers of rebel infantry
     from the shelter of the woods, and to it also belongs the honor of capturing General Archer
     himself. He was brought in by Private Patrick Maloney, of Company G. It is to be lamented that
     this brave Irishman was subsequently killed in the action.</p>
<p>The troops were now withdrawn to the eastern side of the run by my order, and reformed on a
     line with the Second Wisconsin, the Seventh Wisconsin taking the right of the new line and the
     Nineteenth Indiana the left. Immediately after this, I took my position behind the left wing. I
     had hardly done so when I learned, with deep sorrow, that our brave and lamented commander,
     Major-General Reynolds, had just been shot, and was no more. This melancholy event occurred in
     the beginning of the attack referred to, about 10.15 a. m. The whole burden of the battle was
     thus suddenly thrown upon me.</p>
<p>The death of General Reynolds was followed by other disasters. A column of the enemy's
     infantry had succeeded in approaching Hall's battery to within a distance of 60 yards by
     charging up the ravine on his right, and had poured in a terrible and destructive fire at that
     short range. At the same time a vastly superior force advanced in two lines against Cutler, in
     front and on his right flank. General Wadsworth directed this brigade to fall back to the
     shelter of the woods on Seminary Ridge. This left Captain Hall without any supports to his
     battery, and, as he received no orders to withdraw, his situation soon became a precarious one.</p>
<p>The One hundred and forty-seventh New York Volunteers, of Cutler's brigade, did not receive
     the order to retire; Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, its commander, having been wounded, was unable
     to communicate his instructions to his successor, Major Harney. The latter bravely held the
     regiment to its position until the enemy was in possession of the railroad cut on his left,
     thus intercepting his line of retreat. During the half hour which elapsed before he could be
     relieved, his loss was 207 killed and wounded out of 380.</p>
<p>The dispositions made by Captain Hall to meet the emergency and save his battery were both
     able and resolute. He broke the force of the charge against him by firing canister, and then
     ordered his battery to retire by sections. The right section, while falling back, was charged
     upon by the enemy's skirmishers, and 4 of the horses of one piece shot. The cannoneers,
     however, drew off the piece by hand. In reference to this period of the action, Captain Hall
     says, in his official report:</p>
<p>As the last piece of the battery was coming away, all of its horses were shot, and I was
     about to return for it myself, when General Wadsworth gave me a peremptory order to lose no
     time, but get my battery in position near the barn on the heights, to cover the retiring of the
     troops. I sent a sergeant and 5 men after the piece, all of whom were wounded or taken
     prisoners.</p>
<p>Captain Hall was now withdrawn behind Seminary Ridge by way of the railroad grading, which
     runs nearly parallel to the Cashtown road, and is about 100 yards from it--an unfortunate route
     to take, as it was swept by the enemy's guns. He was soon afterward assigned to a new and more
     advanced position by an aide-de-camp of the division commander, but, in attempting to occupy
     it, he was fired upon by the rebel advance, who already held possession of the ground, and he
     again withdrew.</p>
<p>The whole of these events had occurred on the right so soon after my arrival, that there was
     no opportunity for me to interpose, issue orders, or regulate the retreat. The moment was a
     critical one, involving the defeat, perhaps the utter rout, of our forces. I immediately sent
     for one of Meredith's regiments (the Sixth Wisconsin), a gallant body of men, whom I knew could
     be relied upon. Forming them rapidly perpendicular to the line of battle on the enemy's flank,
     I directed them to attack immediately. Lieutenant-Colonel Dawes, their commander, ordered a
     charge, which was gallantly executed. The enemy made a hurried attempt to change front to meet
     the attack, and flung his troops into the railroad cut for safety. The Ninety-fifth New York
     Volunteers, Colonel Biddle, and the Fourteenth Brooklyn, under Colonel Fowler, joined in the
     charge; the cut was carried at the point of the bayonet, and two regiments of Davis' (rebel)
     brigade were taken prisoners.</p>
<p>The results of this maneuver were the capture of the two rebel regiments referred to, with
     their battle-flags, the release of the One hundred and forty-seventh New York Volunteers, which
     had been cut off, and the recapture of one of Hall's pieces, which had been left, in
     consequence of all the horses having been shot down and men wounded or killed. I immediately
     directed the original line of battle to be resumed, which was done. All this was accomplished
     in less than half an hour, and before General Howard had arrived on the field or assumed
     command. Tidball's horse battery was now ordered up by General Wadsworth, to replace Hall's
     battery, which had been very much cut up. Tidball was soon hotly engaged with a battery in his
     front. Soon after, Captain Reynolds was sent to relieve him.</p>
<p>Upon taking a retrospect of the field, it might seem, in view of the fact that we were
     finally forced to retreat, that this would have been a proper time to retire; but to fall back
     without orders from the commanding general might have inflicted lasting disgrace upon the
     corps, and as General Reynolds, who was high in the confidence of General Meade, had formed his
     lines to resist the entrance of the enemy into Gettysburg, I naturally supposed that it was the
     intention to defend the place.</p>
<p>There were abundant reasons for holding it, for it is the junction of seven great roads
     leading to Hagerstown, Chambersburg, Carlisle, York, Baltimore, Taneytown, and Washington, and
     is also an important railroad terminus. The places above mentioned are o n the circumference of
     a circle of which it is the center. It was, therefore, a strategic point of no ordinary
     importance. Its possession would have been invaluable to Lee, shortening and strengthening his
     line to Williamsport, and serving as a base of maneuvers for future operations. I knew that
     Slocum's and Sickles' corps were within striking distance when we left Marsh Creek; that
     Howard's corps was already passing through the streets of the town, and that the remaining
     divisions of the First Corps were almost up. A retreat without hard fighting has a tendency to
     demoralize the troops who retire, and would, in the present instance, in my opinion, have
     dispirited the whole army and injured its morale, while it encouraged the enemy in the same
     proportion. There never was an occasion in which the result could have been more momentous upon
     our national destiny. Final success in this war can only be attained by desperate fighting, and
     the infliction of heavy loss upon the enemy; nor could I have retreated without the full
     knowledge and approbation of Gen. Howard, who was my superior officer, and who had now arrived
     on the field. Had I done so, it would have uncovered the left flank of his corps. If
     circumstances required it, it was his place, not mine, to issue the order. Gen. Howard, from
     his commanding position on Cemetery Hill, could overlook all the enemy's movements as well as
     our own, and I therefore relied much upon his superior facilities for observation to give me
     timely warning of any unusual danger.</p>
<p>I sent word to him shortly after this that, in addition to the forces opposed to me, Ewell's
     corps was coming down on my right flank, and requested him to protect that portion of the line
     with the Eleventh Corps. Almost at the same time he sent me the same information, together with
     instructions to hold Seminary Hill at all hazards, if driven back. Just previous to this, the
     remainder of the First Corps, consisting of Robinson's and Rowley's divisions, came up. I
     immediately directed Gen. Robinson to station his division in reserve at the seminary, and to
     throw up some slight intrenchments, to aid me in holding that point in case I should be driven
     back. I divided Rowley's division, sending Stone's brigade to the open space on the right of
     the wood, to close the interval between Cutler and Meredith. The other brigade, under Col.
     Biddle, One hundred and twenty-first Pennsylvania Volunteers, was posted on the left and rear
     of the Iron Brigade, toward the Millerstown road. Gen. Rowley had charge of this part of the
     line. Later in the day he intrusted the extreme left to Col. Gates, Twentieth New York State
     Militia, who, with his own regiment and the One hundred and fifty-first Pennsylvania
     Volunteers, under Lieut.-Col. McFarland, stubbornly maintained it to the last. He was greatly
     aided in this by two companies of skirmishers from his regiment, who occupied a house and barn
     in advance of our left, on the other side of the ravine. I relied greatly on Stone's brigade to
     hold the post assigned them, as I soon saw I would be obliged to change front with a portion of
     my line to face the northwest, and his brigade held the pivot of the movement. My confidence in
     this noble body of men was not misplaced, as will be shown hereafter. They repulsed the
     repeated attacks of vastly superior numbers at close quarters, and maintained their position
     until the final retreat of the whole line. Stone himself was shot down, battling to the last.
     The gallant Col. Wister, who succeeded him in command, was also wounded, and the command
     devolved upon Col. Dana, of the One hundred and forty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers. This
     brigade, in common with almost every regiment in the Third Division, were Pennsylvanians, and
     were actuated by a heroic desire to avenge the invasion of their native State.</p>
<p>Gen. Howard now formed his lines to resist the advance of Ewell's corps, which came from the
     northeast. The corps of A. P. Hill, opposite us, at once made a junction with the new-comers.
     This compelled me also to change front, with Wadsworth's division on Stone's brigade as a
     pivot, so that the two branches of my line of battle were facing, the one west, the other
     northwest. I relied upon the woods and ridges to partially shield the troops from an enfilading
     fire. In consequence of Ewell's new line of battle, Wadsworth threw back Cutler's brigade to
     Seminary Ridge, to avoid a battery upon his flank. Both Tidball's and Reynolds' batteries were
     obliged to retire, as they were exposed to a cross-fire from two directions. Capt. Reynolds was
     badly wounded in the eye, but for a long time refused to leave the field.</p>
<p>Col. Stone, who had been contending with very little shelter against the rebel infantry and
     two batteries on the other side of the run, suffered some loss from the same enfilading battery
     which had rendered a change of front necessary on the part of Wadsworth. Leaving Col. Wister's
     regiment, the One hundred and fiftieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, still facing the west, he threw
     successively Lieut.-Col. Dwight, with the One hundred and forty-ninth Pennsylvania, and Col.
     Dana, with the One hundred and forty-third Pennsylvania, into the Cashtown road, facing a
     little east of north. As this left an open space of some 200 yards between the right of Stone
     and the left of Cutler, and as the rebels at this time were not making any strong
     demonstrations against our left, Cooper's battery fired through the interval, and Biddle's
     brigade changed front to support it.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Lieut. Wilber, of Battery L, First New York Artillery, was sent, in
     answer to a request from Gen. Wadsworth for a battery, and posted in an orchard on the south
     side of the Cashtown road, where the right flank was sheltered by a house and barn. The
     remaining two sections were posted on the open crest, also to the south of the road.</p>
<p>I had hoped Gen. Howard would have been able to connect with the right of my line, but after
     Gen. Schurz had formed his division, there was a wide interval between the two corps. This gap
     might have been filled by my falling back to the Seminary Ridge, but unfortunately that ridge
     is open ground, and could have been, as it was afterward, enfiladed by Ewell's batteries
     throughout its whole extent. Finding it necessary to stop this gap at all hazards, I directed
     Gen. Robinson, whose division I had kept in reserve, to send one of his brigades there. He
     detailed Gen. Baxter for that purpose. This brigade moved forward and formed on the right of
     Wadsworth's division, but an interval still existed of nearly 400 yards between Baxter's right
     and the Eleventh Corps. The enemy attacked in this interval, and were driven back by a change
     of front. They then assailed the left flank of the brigade, obliging Baxter again to change
     front. He drove the rebels before him in handsome style, but was constantly outflanked and
     enfiladed. Nevertheless, the brigade behaved nobly, capturing a great number of prisoners, the
     Eighty-eighth Pennsylvania taking two battle-flags and the Ninety-seventh New York one. They
     were greatly aided in this by a galling fire poured in on the flanks of the enemy by the
     Twelfth Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Finding Baxter was in danger of being overpowered, I directed Gen. Robinson to go in person
     to his assistance with the remainder of his division (Paul's brigade). Stewart's battery, of
     the Fourth U. S. Artillery, was also sent to report to Gen. Robinson. Part of Paul's brigade
     was posted by Gen. Robinson as a support to Baxter against an enemy advancing on our front, and
     part was posted perpendicular to our line to protect the right flank. Gen. Robinson says:</p>
<p>The enemy now made repeated attacks on the division, in all of which he was handsomely
     repulsed, with the loss of three flags and about 1,000 prisoners. In one of these attacks I was
     deprived of the services of the veteran commander of the First Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Paul, who
     fell, severely wounded, while gallantly directing and encouraging his command. The division
     held this position on the right, receiving and repelling the fierce attacks of a greatly
     superior number, not only in front, but on the flanks, and, when the enemy's ranks were broken,
     charging upon him, and capturing his colors and his men, from about noon until nearly 5 p. m.,
     when I received orders to withdraw. These orders not being received until all the other troops,
     except Stewart's battery, had commenced moving to the rear, the division held its ground until
     outflanked right and left, and retired, fighting. From the nature of the enemy's attacks,
     frequent changes were rendered necessary, and they were made promptly, under a galling fire.
     Soldiers never fought better or inflicted severer blows upon the enemy. When out of ammunition,
     their boxes were replenished from those of their killed or wounded comrades.</p>
<p>Ewell's forces advanced about 1.30 p. m. in two deployed lines, supported by a third line of
     battalions en masse. A portion of these made the attack already referred to against Baxter's
     left, in which they were repulsed. Their defeat was partly owing to the fact that they became
     separated from their main line, and swung around in such a manner as to expose their flank to
     Col. Stone's troops in the road, who took advantage of the opportunity to pour in a destructive
     fire at long range.</p>
<p>Having thus failed in their assault upon Robinson's division, they next made a determined
     advance against the two regiments in the road. To meet this, Col. Stone sent one of these
     regiments, the One hundred and forty-ninth Pennsylvania, under Lieut.-Col. Dwight, forward to
     the railroad cut. This formed en echelon about 100 yards to the front and left of Col. Dana's
     regiment (One hundred and forty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers). In spite of two most effective
     volleys of musketry, the enemy struggled on to within 30 yards of the cut. Here, however, they
     were driven back in confusion by a spirited bayonet charge ordered by Lieut.-Col. Dwight. Dana
     was at the same time warmly engaged in protecting the flank of the advanced regiment. The
     enemy, immediately after this, brought a battery to enfilade the cut, and Dwight was forced to
     fall back to his first position, on Dana's left.</p>
<p>It was in this affair that Col. Stone was severely wounded, and Col. Wister assumed command
     of the brigade.</p>
<p>The rebels now advanced from the northwest to flank the two regiments in the road, but the
     One hundred and fiftieth Regt., under Lieut.-Col. Huidekoper, changed front forward and met the
     enemy precisely as Dwight had met them, with two volleys of musketry and a gallant bayonet
     charge, led by Col. Wister in person; this dispersed them. Another desperate onslaught came
     from the north, passed the railroad cut, and almost reached the road, only,</p>
<p>however, to encounter another defeat from the irresistible bayonets of our men. The next
     attack came from the west, but was again repulsed by the indomitable One hundred and fiftieth
     Regt.</p>
<p>Col. Wister was now severely wounded in the face. Col. Dana, who assumed command, contested
     the position with varying fortunes until the close of the battle. Just previous to this, the
     brave and resolute Lieut.-Col. Huidekoper had faced four companies of his regiment to contend
     with the opposing forces from the west, while six companies kept of an entire brigade from the
     north. Lieut.-Col. Huidekoper lost his arm at this point, and as Maj. Chamberlain was also
     wounded, the command devolved upon Capt. Widdis.</p>
<p>Lieut.-Col. Dwight was left upon the field wounded in three places, and fell temporarily into
     the hands of the enemy. Every regiment of Stone's brigade changed front forward, and two
     regiments changed front to the rear while closely engaged. The most eminent military writers
     regard the first movement as difficult, and the last as almost impossible, to be executed under
     fire.</p>
<p>About 4 p. m. the enemy, having been strongly re-enforced, advanced in large numbers,
     everywhere deploying into double and triple lines, overlapping our left for a third of a mile,
     pressing heavily upon our right, and overwhelming our center. It was evident Lee's whole army
     was approaching. Our tired troops had been fighting desperately, some of them for six hours.
     They were thoroughly exhausted, and Gen. Howard had no re-enforcements to give me. It became
     necessary to retreat. All my reserves had been thrown in, and the First Corps was now fighting
     in a single line.</p>
<p>It is stated by Gen. Wadsworth in his official report that the portion of the Eleventh Corps
     nearest to us, unable to stand the pressure, had fallen back some time before this, and that
     our right flank was thus uncovered, so far as that corps was concerned. Biddle's brigade about
     this time again changed front to meet the strong lines advancing from the west. I now gave
     orders to fall back, this and Meredith's brigades covering the movement by occupying the
     intrenchments in front of the seminary, which I had directed to be thrown up as a precautionary
     measure to assist in holding the new position. Cooper's battery was assigned by the chief of
     artillery on the north, and Stevens' battery (Fifth Maine) on the south of the seminary, and
     the shattered remnants of the Iron Brigade also fell into line. From behind the feeble
     barricade of rails these brave men stemmed the fierce tide which pressed upon them incessantly,
     and held the rebel lines, which encircled them on three sides, at bay until the greater portion
     of the corps had retired. The One hundred and fifty-first, One hundred and forty-second, One
     hundred and twenty-first Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Twentieth New York State Militia, of
     Biddle's command (the last two under Col. Gates, of the Twentieth New York State Militia), and
     the Second and Seventh Wisconsin and Nineteenth Indiana, of the Iron Brigade, here made their
     final stand. Capt. [Hollon] Richardson, acting assistant inspector-general, of Meredith's
     staff, rode up and down the lines, waving a regimental flag and encouraging the men to do their
     duty.</p>
<p>The troops, with the assistance of part of Stewart's battery, under Lieut. Davison, poured in
     so deadly a fire as to wholly break up and disable the first line of the enemy approaching from
     the west; but the other lines pressed on, and soon commenced a flank attack, which it was no
     longer possible to answer. When all the troops at this point were overpowered, Capt. Glenn, of
     the One hundred and forty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, in command of my headquarters guard,
     defended the building for fully twenty minutes against a whole brigade of the enemy, enabling
     the few remaining troops, the ambulances, artillery, &amp;, to retreat in comparative
     safety.</p>
<p>The batteries had all been brought back from their advanced positions and posted on Seminary
     Hill. They greatly assisted the orderly retreat, retarding the enemy by their fire. They lost
     heavily in men and horses at this point, and, as they retired to the town, were subjected to so
     heavy a fire that the last gun was left, the horses being all shot down by the enemy's
     skirmishers, who had formed line within 50 yards of the road by which the artillery was obliged
     to pass.</p>
<p>The First Corps only consisted of about 8,200 men when it entered the battle. It was reduced
     at the close of the engagement to about 2,450. It must be remembered that A. P. Hill's corps
     alone, which fought us on the west, was estimated at 35,000 men, of which 25,000, under Heth
     and Pender, were in line opposed to us, and that Ewell's corps, which attacked us on the north,
     was said to amount to 30,000 more. Its two divisions with which we contended, under Rodes and
     Early, contained about 20,000 men. Reserves amounting to 20,000 additional men, belonging to
     the two corps, and backed by the whole rebel army, were within a few hours' march. When that
     part of the Eleventh Corps adjacent to us fell back, a force of 30,000 men was thrown upon the
     First Corps, which in the beginning only contained about 8,200.</p>
<p>I remained at the seminary superintending the final movement until thousands of hostile
     bayonets made their appearance around the sides of the building. I then rode back and rejoined
     my command, nearly all of whom were filing through the town. As we passed through the streets,
     the pale and frightened inhabitants came out of their houses, offering us food and drink and
     the expression of their deep sorrow and sympathy. The written statements of the division
     commanders in regard to the details of this p riod are slightly conflicting. I therefore
     present extracts from the reports themselves. Gen. Robinson has already been quoted.</p>
<p>The operations of the day were of necessity accompanied by severe losses in killed, wounded,
     and missing, on account of the great disparity in numbers and the prolonged nature of the
     contest. This preliminary battle, however, had the most important bearing on the results of the
     next two days, as it enabled the whole army to come up and re-enforce the admirable position to
     which we had retreated. Had we retired earlier in the day, without co-operation with the other
     parts of the army, the enemy by a vigorous pursuit might have penetrated between the corps of
     Sickles and Slocum, and have either crushed them in detail or flung them off in eccentric
     directions. The whole retreat from the commencement was most creditable to the troops engaged.
     There was no hurry and no confusion, but the regiments fell back calmly, turning from time to
     time to check the enemy's advance by volleys of musketry, and again retreating. From the
     admixture of so many different regiments at the seminary, it became impossible to reorganize
     them in good order without a delay which would have exposed the men to certain destruction. I
     saw, however, no running or undue haste. All the troops passed tranquilly on, although the
     enemy was firing into the m from the side streets, and all reformed promptly on their arrival
     at Cemetery Hill, and in a very short time were again ready for service. The Sixth Wisconsin
     marched through the streets in a body, stopping from time to time to return the fire of the
     enemy, and giving hearty cheers for the good old cause and the Sixth Wisconsin Volunteers.</p>
<p>I have said the losses were exceedingly heavy. More than half of those who went into the
     battle were killed or wounded. In the Second Wisconsin, 69 came back out of 302; in the
     Nineteenth Indiana, 78 returned out of 288; the One hundred and fiftieth Pennsylvania
     Volunteers, Col. Wister's regiment, out of about 400 men and 17 officers, lost, in killed,
     wounded, and missing, 16 officers and about 316 men; the One hundred and and forty-ninth
     Pennsylvania Volunteers lost in the same proportion.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. DOUBLEDAY, Maj.-Gen. of Volunteers.</p>
