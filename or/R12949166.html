<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, writes Assistant Adjutant J. C. Kelton in September, 1863, to
                    express his fear that the Confederates may be planning a raid into Pennsylvania.
                    Couch says that Confederate spies have been seen in the area, and details the
                    strength of his small force.</p>

<p>Col. J. C. KELTON,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Army
                        Hdqrs.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg,</p>
<p>September 10, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I respectfully state, for the information of the Gen.-in-Chief, that the enemy
                    are apparently making preparations for a movement of some kind into
                    Pennsylvania. Their spies have been through this county within a few days. My
                    impression is that a raid is intended.</p>
<p>The Gen.-in-Chief is aware that my force is small, one company of infantry, one
                    battery, and three companies of horse in this county; two of cavalry and one of
                    infantry at Gettysburg and vicinity.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
