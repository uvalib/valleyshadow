<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General G. W. Smith writes in September, 1862, to General Henry Wise
                    to report on a telegraph received from Staunton discussing a battle in the
                    Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HDQRS.,</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. HENRY A. WISE,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Peninsula:</p>
<p>Richmond,</p>
<p>September 28, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Yours of the 21st is received. Be vigilant and careful. Don't bring on a doubtful
                    contest. But I know you will bear in mind the whole condition of affairs and
                    previous instructions. My object in writing at present is to say that the
                    companies of the Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry, now with you, under Maj. Belsches,
                    are much needed at Culpeper Court-House and beyond, with their regiment. As soon
                    as you can possibly dispense with their services, order Maj. Belsches to move
                    with his companies, to Culpeper Court-House and report to Col. J. R. Chambliss,
                    commanding the regiment at that point or in the vicinity, sending copy of your
                    order to Maj. Melton, adjutant-general. It is not intended that you should
                    cripple or materially embarrass your own movements by detaching this cavalry,
                    but to explain the necessity for their services on another point, and insure
                    that there shall be no delay that can be avoided. We have news from Winchester
                    of the 21st, by telegraph from Staunton, to-day: "The enemy crossed 10,000 men
                    over the river at Shepherdstown. Was immediately attacked by Jackson's corps and
                    routed. Their loss very heavy, ours slight. Quite a number of arms taken.
                    Jackson recrossed into Maryland. Signed, H. B. Davidson, colonel, Provisional
                    Army of the Confederate States." The New York Herald of last Saturday says they
                    (the enemy), lost 5,000 prisoners at Munfordville, Ky., McClellan's dispatch of
                    Friday last says: "We (the enemy) may safely claim a victory." Rather modest for
                    him, alluding to the fight at Sharpsburg of Wednesday last. The telegram from
                    Davidson is latter. I hope to hear from you often and in detail. Gen. French
                    found the enemy re-enforced at Suffolk and expecting him. Accordingly, under my
                    instructions, most of his forces were withdrawn, leaving only a strong
                    reconnoitering party on the Blackwater and between that point and Suffolk.</p>
<p>Respectfully and truly, yours,</p>
<p>G. W. SMITH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
