<p>WHEELING,</p>
<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON.</p>
<p>Skirmish at Grass Lick, W. Va.</p>
<p>APRIL 23, 1862</p>
<p>Gen. Kelley sends this evening the following dispatch from Lieut.-Col.
						Downey, in command at Romney:</p>
<p>Twenty-five of Firey's and Shaw's cavalry encountered Col. Parsons with some 50
					men at Peter Palling's house, on Grass Lick, before day this morning. Two of
					Firey's men were killed and one of Shaw's. A number of the rebels killed and
					wounded. I went out with re-enforcements burned the houses the rebels fired
					from, and scoured the whole country around.</p>
<p>Gen. Milroy also telegraphs that he made a reconnaissance yesterday with one
					cavalry and six infantry companies to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy. He
					overtook rear guard of cavalry 6 miles this side of the railroad, near Buffalo
					Gap. They retreated rapidly, pursued by our cavalry. Gen. Milroy was informed
					that the main body had stopped the night previous 6 miles beyond Buffalo Gap;
					that they had discovered that they were cut off from Staunton by Gen. Banks, and
					were bearing off to the right, to go down through Bath and Alleghany Counties to
					James River.</p>
<p></p>
