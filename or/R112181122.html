<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Prior to General Thomas J. Jackson's May, 1862, offensive in the Shenandoah
                    Valley, Federal troops in the area enjoyed quite times. In this April letter,
                    Union General Nathaniel P. Banks reports to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton on
                    the progress of operations in the Valley. He remarks on the absence of
                    opposition, and speculates that forces under Fremont should be sufficient to
                    take and hold Staunton.</p>

<p> Hon. E.M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG,</p>
<p>April 28, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If Jackson retreats from his present position there is no reason for our
                    remaining longer in this valley. If he does not, we can compel his retreat or
                    destroy him. Then a small force, two or three regiments, falling back to
                    Strasburg, which has been fortified for this purpose, will safely hold all that
                    is important to the Government in this valley. Gen. Fremont's forces will in
                    like manner cover Staunton. If we leave a force of 4,000 or 5,000 in the upper
                    valley it will invite attack, as at Winchester, and be insufficient for defense.
                    If no force is in the valley except at Strasburg the enemy will not return. The
                    whole of my command can then move from New Market to Madison by the mountain
                    road, which is the best turnpike in Virginia, at three days' notice, from which
                    we can occupy Culpeper Court-House, Orange Court-House, or Gordonsville, joined
                    by Gen. Abercrombie. The enemy will then be expelled from the whole of this
                    region. With certainty this is the safest and most effective operation, in our
                    view, in which we can be engaged. Our supplies can be drawn as now via
                    Strasburg, or from Front Royal via Manassas road on good pikes, or by the Orange
                    and Alexandria Railroad. Madison will be impregnable in our hands, and in
                    co-operation with Fremont we can possess Gordonsville any day the President may
                    wish. This is a safe and long-considered movement and is possible. Flour, beef,
                    and forage are plenty in the country about Madison. I submit these views with
                    great deference, and pray permission to put them in execution as early as the
                    Department may desire. There are not more than 15,000 rebels on the north of the
                    Virginia Central Railroad.</p>
