                <p>Union General Robert Patterson, commanding at Chambersburg, writes to assistant
                    adjutant Edward D. Townsend in June, 1861, to discuss an impending advance into

                    <salute>SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I yesterday notified you of the occupation of Cumberland by the Indiana regiment
                    under Col. Wallace, and the fact of secession militia being in his vicinity,
                    upon whom he designed to call. I now inclose for the information of the
                    Gen.-in-Chief the satisfactory report of his journey through Virginia.</p>
                <p>I have reason to believe that with few exceptions the people of Maryland are
                    loyal, and wherever a Federal force will appear disloyalty will hide its head
                    and the Government receive powerful auxiliaries. The Unionists now present a
                    bold front and call for aid, which, as I cannot now give and properly sustain,
                    would invite attack and perhaps cause defeat.</p>
                <p>In the counties bordering the Potomac are many Union-loving people, but the
                    secessionists are so powerful and violent and well armed, that our friends dare
                    not express open sympathy, and are often forced to array themselves against us.
                    For this reason and to sustain the command at Cumberland, which can gradually
                    work its way east, repairing bridges, I would respectfully suggest two regiments
                    at least, if they could be devoted to that purpose, be designated to protect the
                    road in the rear and permit Col. Wallace to approach. Supplies must also be sent
                    by rail from Wheeling, and require protection. I regret my command is not in
                    condition and sufficiently strong in face of a powerful foe to detach at present
                    a force towards Cumberland. I am resolved to conquer and risk nothing.</p>
                <p>On Saturday my depot will be established in Hagerstown, and immediately
                    thereafter my headquarters will be transferred to that place. The want of wagons
                    and the difficulty of procuring teams rapidly enough has trammeled me and does
                    so yet, but on Saturday night I shall have in front of Hagerstown over ten
                    thousand men, strongly posted. With depot there established the different
                    commands will be fitted with expedition and pushed towards the river. The Fourth
                    Artillery battery will not receive its horses before Saturday. The heavy battery
                    will arrive in Hagerstown after me. Before being prepared to advance from that
                    point the troops will be well drilled and disciplined. A marked improvement is
                    daily manifested in their military exercises, and the regiments lately arrived
                    are in excellent condition and drill. Their successes ere long will, I hope,
                    prove we have gained by delay.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
