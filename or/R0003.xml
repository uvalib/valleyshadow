                <p>It was marching left in front, and in the rapid movement forward was partly cut
                    in two by the Second Brigade, which created some confusion in the right
                    companies, and resulted in depriving me of some of my best men, who, in the
                    confusion and rapid movement, lost their way and were unable to join me during
                    the battle. I am happy, however, to state that some of those who were thus cut
                    off joined themselves to other regiments and no doubt did their duty as soldiers
                    of the First Brigade.</p>
                <p>On arriving at or near the tavern I, with the Second Virginia, was ordered to
                    support several batteries that were being placed in position just to the front
                    of it, which order I promptly executed, moving my regiment to the support of the
                    left battery, leaving the right for the Second Regt.</p>
                <p>This disposition had hardly been made before the news came [I do not know how]
                    "They are driving our men back," and now Brig.-Gen. Winder ordered the brigade
                    forward, thus placing my regiment on the left and the Second Regt. immediately
                    on its right. The movement was made at a rapid pace through swamps and bogs and
                    thick undergrowth, which made it exceedingly difficult to keep the proper
                    alignment. From the moment of my being placed in position to support the battery
                    the shells from the enemy's batteries fell around us thick and fast, and yet my
                    men, like veterans, pressed on to the front with a spirit and determination
                    which afterward contributed to the complete success of our general's
                    undertaking.</p>
                <p>After emerging from the woods there was an open and almost naked field, ascending
                    by a regular inclined plane for almost 1,000 yards to the tops of McGehee's
                    hill, on which the enemy was posted in strong force, both of artillery and
                    infantry. Being ordered to charge in connection with the entire brigade, and to
                    keep my right resting upon the left of the Second Regt., I found great
                    difficulty in doing so from the constant obliquing of the brigade to the right.
                    It was now dusk, and I could hardly see the left of the Second; but I urged my
                    men forward, being guided more by the cheering than by the sight of that
                    regiment.</p>
                <p>The charge was executed in gallant style and at a double-quick until I arrived
                    within 150 yards of the top of the hill, when I ordered a halt, seeing that the
                    Second Regt. had halted, closed up the regiment, and opened a fire upon the
                    enemy. By this time I found that my regiment had become separated a considerable
                    distance from the Second, and discovered a regiment lying down between the two,
                    somewhat to their rear. My right had run over part of this regiment in the
                    charge, and I am informed that previously my left had done the same thing for
                    another regiment, which was lying down and in its way. While my regiment was
                    engaged in action to the front I ascertained that the regiment lying down
                    between mine and the Second Regt. was the Thirty-eighth Georgia. Upon asking for
                    its colonel, I was informed that all of its field officers were wounded, and
                    that Capt. Lawton, assistant adjutant-general and chief of Brig.-Gen. Lawton's
                    staff, was controlling it. I asked him why his regiment was lying down; he
                    replied that it had no ammunition. I inquired if he had bayonets, and whether he
                    would fill up the space between me and the Second Regt. in the charge. He
                    replied that he would, and I take pleasure in stating that upon my giving the
                    order to charge he moved up in fine style and assisted in holding the hill
                    during the night.</p>
                <p>The whole line in this last and successful charge obliqued to the right and the
                    right of my regiment swept the road, in which it captured two Parrott pieces in
                    battery, which, from their heated condition, evidently had been used very freely
                    and with terrible effect upon our forces. The enemy retired slowly and sullenly,
                    and, to the best of my knowledge, did not abandon the pieces and their position
                    until our line had approached to within 75 yards of his.</p>
                <p>Not stopping at the top of the hill, I moved forward to a fence some 50 yards to
                    the front, and placed the regiment behind it, nearly in line with the balance of
                    the brigade. While there a battery of ours on our left fired a discharge of
                    canister, which enfiladed my entire line, but, providentially, hurt no one. I
                    speak it to the praise of my regiment that while this discharge cut all around
                    them it showed no symptoms of alarm, but remained steady and firm until one of
                    the privates gave notice to the battery that we were friends.</p>
                <p>Under orders I afterward moved farther forward, and subsequently withdrew with
                    the whole to the front. I immediately called for Company L to man the two pieces
                    captured, but ascertained that Capt. Burke, First Lieut. Swoope, and 9 men were
                    wounded, leaving only 1 officer and 9 men unhurt. I ordered him to take command
                    of one of the pieces and load it with canister; but he ascertained that the
                    enemy had used every charge but two, one of which was found in the limberbox,
                    the other reversed in one of the guns. I reported these facts to Gen. Winder.</p>
                <p>My men got but little repose, as we had every reason to believe that the enemy
                    intend to attack us during the night.</p>
                <p>I found several wounded North Carolinians near the top of the hill, from which I
                    inferred that the hill had been in our possession and retaken by the enemy prior
                    to our coming forward. I afterward ascertained that my inference was correct.</p>
                <p>I sent out details as early as practicable to take care of my wounded and to bury
                    the dead.</p>
                <p>I cannot undertake to mention the conduct of all the officers; all did their
                    duty. Capt. William H. Randolph was killed by my side urging his men on to the
                    charge. A braver officer never poured out his blood for his country. Capt.'s
                    Fletcher and Burke were wounded and disabled while in the fearless discharge of
                    their duty. Lieut.'s Swoope, Keiser, and Brown, and others were also wounded in
                    the midst of the fight, while the officers who were so fortunate as to escape
                    unhurt did everything that brave men could do, and were foremost in the strife.
                    Lieut. McKenney, after fighting bravely through the battle, was wounded by the
                    accidental discharge of a musket. Lieut. Col. J. H. S. Funk again proved himself
                    efficient, cool, and brave, doing all that an officer could do toward the
                    achievement which blessed our brigade with a glorious triumph. Capt. Roberts,
                    acting major, managed the left of the regiment in a highly creditable manner,
                    and behaved with intrepidity and daring throughout the entire engagement.</p>
                <p>While I feel unable to do justice to the officers, I find it impossible to give
                    too much praise to the non-commissioned officers and privates, who, without the
                    hope of praise or the incentives of promotion, behaved like heroes under the
                    most in the full enjoyment of that liberty for which they have so cheerfully and
                    nobly struggled.</p>
                <p>I feel it but right to mention Mr. S. H. Bell and Mr. William J. Hunter, citizens
                    of Augusta County, for their prompt and humane efforts in attending to and
                    removing the wounded and burying the dead.</p>
                <p>The list of casualties,* hereto appended, is, thanks to a protecting Providence,
                    small, owing to the interposition of the darkness of night and the overshooting
                    of the enemy.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, July 1, by order of Gen. Winder, I had placed my regiment in the
                    woods in rear of the battle-field. I had scarcely gotten into position before a
                    Parrott shell mortally wounded Capt. Fletcher. This gallant young officer had on
                    many occasions proved himself so brave as to be the idol of his company and of
                    the entire regiment. His last words on the field were words of encouragement to
                    his men.</p>
                <p>Gen. Winder ordered me to move back some distance and out of the range of the
                    guns. I had hardly executed the order before another shell exploded in the line,
                    killing 1 and wounding 4 privates. The brigade was then moved still farther
                    back. I obtained permission of Gen. Winder to go to the rear to look after my
                    wounded, and while there was informed that the brigade was moving to the front.
                    With difficulty I reached the head of my regiment just as it filed to the right
                    into the woods. The blockaded-up condition of the road compelled the regiment to
                    move in single file, which scattered it very much. Having received no orders, I
                    followed the Second Regt. across a corn field until I arrived at a woods and
                    found it posted in a ravine, which seemed to be providentially placed in our way
                    as a breastwork against the terrific shower of shell and grape. I soon after met
                    with Col. Botts, who informed me that he had lost the balance of the brigade.
                    After remaining in this perilous situation, in which our men were unable to do
                    any good and were in very great danger and finding it impossible to join the
                    rest of the brigade, Col. Botts and I, on consultation, determined to fall back
                    to the road, which we succeeded in doing with but a few wounded. I gathered the
                    scattered men of the brigade, assisted by Col. Botts, and moved along the road
                    until I received orders to halt and rest.</p>
                <p>It is a great source of regret to me and my whole regiment that we were unable to
                    be with our old companies, and where we could have rendered them some
                    assistance. As it was, we were almost as much exposed.</p>
