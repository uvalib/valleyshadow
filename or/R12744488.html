<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel Kenneth Murchison reports to the Assistant Adjutant for his
                    brigade on the role his men played in the Gettysburg campaign. Murchison reports
                    sending prisoners from Winchester to Richmond via Staunton during late June
                    skirmishing around the Union controlled town of Winchester.</p>

<p>Capt. J. M. Adams,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Hoke's
                        Brigade.</p>
<p>Near Rapidan Station,</p>
<p>August 5, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>Agreeably to instructions, I have the honor to report briefly the operations of
                    this regiment during the late campaign.</p>
<p>Leaving Fredericksburg on Monday, June 4, after a succession of marches we
                    reached the vicinity of Winchester on 13th instant, where the regiment was
                    thrown in line of battle with the brigade. During the two days' engagement
                    around that town, which consisted mostly of skirmishing, the regiment took no
                    active part.</p>
<p>The enemy having evacuated on the night of June 14, and losing many prisoners,
                    the regiment was detailed on the 18th to guard 2,000 prisoners to Richmond, via
                    Staunton. With as little delay as practicable, the regiment returned to
                    Winchester on July 3, when, in conjunction with a Virginia regiment, it was
                    ordered to guard an ordnance train to the army, then in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Reaching Williamsport, Md., on the 5th, I was ordered by Gen. Imboden to take
                    position, and repel any attack that might be made on the wagon train of the
                    army, which had arrived there, but could not cross, owing to the high stage of
                    the river.</p>
<p>On Monday July 6, the enemy advanced on Williamsport, by the Hagerstown and
                    Boonsborough roads, with cavalry and artillery. Our infantry force being small,
                    four companies of my regiment were sent to support two batteries of artillery at
                    different points. With the remainder I deployed, so as to check any advance of
                    the enemy on the Boonsborough road. Several detachments of soldiers returning to
                    their commands were placed under my command, and acted with the regiment. After
                    a brisk engagement of two hours, night coming on, the enemy withdrew.</p>
<p>My loss in this engagement was 17 men wounded, of whom 2 have since died;
                    besides, a number of those attached to my command were killed and wounded.</p>
<p>On Tuesday July 7, I was ordered by Gen. Lee to cross to the south bank of the
                    Potomac, to guard a wagon train and hold the heights. Remaining there until the
                    11th, I was relieved, and joined the brigade same day near Hagerstown.</p>
<p>With the army, the regiment again recrossed the Potomac on the morning of July
                    14. Marching almost continually, the regiment reached this point on the 3d
                    instant, where it remains to this date.</p>
<p>It is not deemed necessary to give a detailed account of marches, as it is
                    familiar to the brigade commander, in whose report it is supposed to appear.</p>
<p>Justice to the officers and men under my command requires that I should say that
                    they have withstood the long marches and hardships incident thereto with a
                    firmness worthy of the cause in which they are engaged.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully,</p>
<p> K. M. MURCHISON,<br> Col., Comdg.</p>
