<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Staunton, VA, served as a Confederate supply center during the first months of
                    war. In this May, 1861, letter, General Robert E. Lee notifies Major F. M.
                    Boykin of orders to send rifles from Staunton to Virginia volunteers.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Maj. F. M. BOYKIN, Grafton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 13, 1861.</p>
<p>MAJOR:</p>
<p>Your letter of May 10 has been received. On the 11th instant I wrote to inform
                    you that four hundred rifles were ordered to be sent to the care of Maj. Goff,
                    Virginia volunteers, at Beverly, Randolph County, subject to the directions of
                    Col. George A. Porterfield. Six hundred rifles, in addition to the four hundred
                    of which you were already notified, have been ordered to be sent from Staunton
                    to the care of Maj. Goff, Virginia volunteers, at Beverly, which will be subject
                    to Col. Porterfield's orders. I regret to hear of the difficulties mentioned in
                    your letter of mustering troops at and in the vicinity of Grafton, but hope that
                    by perseverance you will overcome them. Maj. Goff has been directed to muster
                    troops in Randolph and adjacent counties, and it is hoped he will be enabled to
                    obtain a sufficient number for the purpose mentioned in your letter, as it is
                    deemed unadvisable to send troops from the east for the present.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
