<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In April, 1862, General Thomas J. Jackson commanded Confederate forces in the Shenandoah
     Valley. In this dispatch, he expresses his hope to General Richard Ewell that Union General
     Nathaniel P. Banks be prevented from advancing on Staunton, VA.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. R. S. EWELL,<br> Cmdg. Potomac District:</p>
<p>NEAR MOUNT JACKSON,</p>
<p>April 14, 1862</p>
<p>MY DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>Your dispatch of yesterday, with accompanying papers, has been received. I am much obliged
     for the news. Unless you have instructions upon the subject requiring you to fall back I am of
     the opinion that you had better not do so, and especially not toward Madison Court-House, as
     the enemy may hear of it and suspect that you are re-enforcing me. On the 8th instant Gen.
     Johnston wrote to me" "Should you" (fall back much farther, he" (meaning you)" should come to
     the Rapidan." The general does not state why he desires you to go to the Rapidan, but it may be
     for the purpose of deceiving the enemy with regard to ultimate destination, to be more distant
     from the enemy during the movement, and also to be in a more forcible position for re-enforcing
     some other points, should it be necessary. My own opinion is that Banks will not follow me up
     the Blue Ridge; but should he do so, you will have time enough to join me before he reaches the
     top of the mountain, as he will be retarded in his march. I wish he would pursue, and let us
     with our united forces meet him at the mountain. It would not be safe for me to join you on the
     Sperryville road, as an advance of Banks would place him in my rear. My desire is, as far as
     practicable, to hold the valley, and if I fall back from New Market toward Madison Court-House
     I hope that Banks will be deterred from advancing much farther toward Staunton by the
     apprehension of my returning to New Market and thus getting in his rear. I will try and have
     the absentees from the Tenth Virginia Regt. attended to, but apprehend that it will only be
     partially successful, as it is difficult to get hold of those who try to keep concealed.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours,</p>
<p>T. J. JACKSON.</p>
