<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Thomas Neill reports to General Halleck on the October, 1864,
                    situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Neill reports that Union cavalry remain in
                    undisputed possession of the Valley, and that no Confederate units larger than
                    disorganized bands can be found in Staunton or elsewhere. He also mentions the
                    large herds of livestock being driven in by Union cavalry.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>MARTINSBURG, W. VA.,</p>
<p>October 3, 1864.<br> (Received 1 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Wilson, who is to take command of all of Sherman's cavalry, has just reached
                    here, forty-six hours from Sheridan, who was in Harrisonburg. Our cavalry is in
                    undisputed possession of the Valley, destroying all mills and grain in the
                    Valley, and driving in immense herds of cattle and sheep. Most of the enemy's
                    force is at Mechum's Station, covering Charlottesville, on the railroad, about
                    twelve miles east of Waynesborough and twenty-five miles west of Staunton. No
                    enemy at Staunton or elsewhere in the Valley, except in small disorganized
                    bands.</p>
