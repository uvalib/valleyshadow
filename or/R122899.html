<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel J. W. Allen passes on intelligence on May, 1861, Union
                    movements to General Joseph E. Johnston. Allen estimates Federal troop strengths
                    in the Chambersburg area and discusses their departure from the town.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS FIRST INFANTRY,</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. JOHNSTON:</p>
<p>Camp Johnston, Va.,</p>
<p>May 31, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report the following information, just obtained:</p>
<p>The Federal troops concentrated at Chambersburg number thirteen thousand. The
                    advance guard, of three thousand, left there at 1 p.m. for Hagerstown, where
                    they will encamp to-night, from which force vedettes are to be thrown into
                    Williamsport. Two companies are said to have been sent towards the river above
                    (point not known), supposed to be at a ford. From the accompanying map you will
                    see our position. The ford northwest of camp is susceptible of good defense. The
                    one opposite Williamsport can be protected without difficulty by the enemy, if
                    they have artillery.</p>
<p>The communication in pencil is from a perfectly reliable source. I would wish
                    positive instructions, and, if to make a stand, re-enforcements. My line of
                    defense is too extended for my present force. Owing to disaffection in Capt.
                    White's cavalry, they are not as efficient as they should be, and incompetent to
                    guard the river.</p>
<p>Your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>J.W. ALLEN,<br> Col., First Infantry.</p>
