<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Jones reports to Robert E. Lee on August, 1863,
                    movements in West Virginia and the Valley. Jones reports that Federal troops
                    might be headed toward Staunton and suggests that Lee might have to send
                    reinforcements to that place.</p>

<p>General R. E. LEE,<br> Commanding, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sweet Springs,</p>
<p>August 21, 1863.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>The enemy, 800 strong, was at Monterey yesterday. Another column reported coming
                    from Franklin by McDowell, supposed to be going to Staunton. Colonel Jackson has
                    fallen back from Huntersville to Back Creek to get in their rear, if they go to
                    Staunton. I have ordered a regiment of infantry to Little Levels, and four
                    companies of cavalry to Marling's Bottom, the latter to scout toward Beverly and
                    Monterey, and harass the enemy if opportunity offers. You can send troops to
                    Staunton, if they are needed, sooner than I can. Can you send Colonel Wharton's
                    command?</p>
<p>I saw your family at the "Warm" yesterday. All are well as usual.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Major-General.</p>
