                <p>Confederate Colonel William B. Taliaferro writes C. L. Stevenson in November,
                    1861, to discuss troop movements in western Virginia, including the return of
                    some to Staunton. Taliaferro also discusses supplies drawn from Staunton, and

                <p>I received your communication of yesterday at 2.30 p. m. to-day. I had, as
                    intimated in my communication of last evening, halted the four regiments at this
                    point, and as the climate here is much milder than at Monterey will await here
                    the instructions of the commanding general. I inclose the order of Gen. Jackson,
                    commanding this line, assigning Col. Johnson to the command of the troops at
                    Alleghany and Crab Bottom, and assigning me to the command at Monterey and Fork
                    of Waters. Since that time I was ordered to take command of the troops en route
                    for Staunton and rejoin my command as limited to those regiments. Gen. Jackson
                    preceded this command to Staunton, and may have gone on to Richmond, but I have
                    forwarded, after opening, all official communications directed to the commanding
                    officer of the line to Col. Barton, his adjutant-general at Staunton. I have
                    received no orders to assume command of the Monterey Line, and I believe it is
                    an undetermined point whether Col. Johnson or myself is that ranking officer.
                    All difficulty and embarrassment on that score was avoided by the assignment
                    made by Gen. Jackson's order. Your communication is addressed to the commanding
                    officer on the Monterey Line, and the senior officer would certainly have been
                    Col. Johnson reached Staunton and gone forward. As it is I will address a
                    communication to Col. Johnson, informing him of the commanding general's
                    instructions to hold Col. Scott's regiment in readiness to march with camp
                    equipage and ammunition, and issue an order to Col. Goode to the same effect. I
                    will cause the regiments here to be supplied with camp equipage and ammunition
                    if it can be procured at Monterey; otherwise I will send to Staunton for it. I
                    know there are no extra percussion caps at Monterey and no ammunition for
                    rifles, as I have drawn requisitions since the 1st of August which have not yet
                    been filled. I will cause the quartermaster and commissary to make reports of
                    the amount of clothing, &amp;c., and commissary stores at Alleghany and
                    Monterey, and forward as soon as possible. We have for the troops here very
                    ample transportation, more than sufficient, but most of the wagons and teams are
                    pressed, and the quartermaster at Staunton is urgently pressing their return to
                    that point. There is no transportation for any other troops besides these four
                    regiments. The roads are so bad and the ice renders the tents so heavy that
                    double the ordinary transportation is required. I have retained the pressed
                    teams to aid the transportation to Staunton, and ask the instructions of the
                    general commanding as to whether I shall longer detain them. Should they be
                    retained any time, the transportation of supplies must to that extent be stopped
                    from Staunton, and should they go on there will be not sufficient transportation
                    for the troops. The diseases incident to the terrible exposure to which the men
                    have been subjected has greatly reduced the strength of the command. A number of
                    men from the command on this line left Camp Alleghany at the first movement of
                    the troops. Gen. Jackson sent forward an officer with a detachment of cavalry to
                    arrest them. Some of them have been sent back. I have forwarded to Staunton the
                    names of all those who have left since I assumed the command of the regiments to
                    Col. Barton, acting assistant adjutant-general, and requested him to arrest them
                    and have them imprisoned until we should reach that place, or returned to their
                    regiments should our march be arrested. I have adopted measures which I hope
                    will correct this disgrace in future, and I shall use every exertion to increase
                    the discipline of the command, but the number of field officers is entirely
                    inadequate. Col. Ramsey, First Georgia, is absent on leave. Col. Rust is
                    attending the session of Congress; Col. Scott, the convention; Col. Fulkerson is
                    in arrest; Lieut.-Col. Clarke is in arrest and has tendered his resignation;
                    Lieut.-Col. Hubard is absent sick, as is Lieut.-Col. Taliaferro. Maj. Jones is
                    on leave, so the regiment is (rest illegible)</p>
