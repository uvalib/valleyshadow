<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Colonel Franklin Stratton reports on his May, 1865, expedition to
                    Charlottesville and Staunton. He discusses his arrival in Staunton, Union
                    General Isaac Duval's efforts to parole Confederates, and the progress of
                    confiscation of Confederate government property. Stratton also discusses the
                    presence of robbers and bandits in the Valley.</p>

<p>Col. ED. W. SMITH,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Department of Virginia.</p>
<p>Charlottesville, Va.,</p>
<p>May 14, 1865.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to make the following report of my expedition from Richmond to
                    Staunton, and thence to this place, under instructions received from department
                    headquarters on the 5th instant:</p>
<p>I left Richmond on the morning of the 6th instant with the entire effective
                    strength of my regiment, consisting of 500 men, accompanied by fifty-five
                    wagons. Marching via Louisa Court-House, Charlottesville, Rockfish Gap, and
                    Waynesborough, I arrived near Staunton on the evening of the 10th of May.
                    Learning there that Gen. Rosser had that morning left for Lexington, I did not
                    enter town until the next day. I found Brig. Gen. I. H. Duval stationed there
                    with one brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry, being a portion of his
                    division--the Fourth Provisional Division of the Army of the Shenandoah. Gen.
                    Duval had arrived there two days previous to my arrival, and had already paroled
                    a large part of Rosser's men and taken possession of the trivial amount of rebel
                    government stores found there. Gen. Duval therefore directed me to return to
                    Charlottesville, in accordance with my instructions. A copy of his order is
                    inclosed. I therefore, after resting my horses one day, left Staunton on the
                    13th, and returned to this place to-day. Gen. Rosser, up to the time of my
                    departure, had made no visible preparation for paroling the remainder of his
                    men, nor was their any tangible evidence of his intention to turn over any rebel
                    government property whatever. After several interviews with him, I ascertained
                    that the men of his command were entirely dispersed, and would only come in in
                    small detachments, or singly, to be paroled. This would occupy, perhaps, several
                    weeks, and as my supplies would permit me to remain but three or four days, it
                    seemed proper that Gen. Duval should complete the business he had commenced.</p>
<p>Gen. Rosser stated, or rather admitted, that about nine pieces of artillery were
                    concealed somewhere about Staunton and four pieces at Lexington. These, too, I
                    left for Gen. Duval to find and dispose of. About eight pieces of artillery are
                    said by Gen. Rosser to be at Pittsylvania Court-House. I have information of
                    there being considerable rebel property concealed about Charlottesville, but
                    have not yet had time to find it. This comprises small-arms buried or concealed
                    in buildings and quartermaster and commissary stores in the hands of citizens in
                    various localities.</p>
<p>Not many disorders have come to my notice through the country, but there is much
                    need of a military post at this place to preserve order and protect the citizens
                    from small bands of marauders and robbers infesting various localities between
                    here and the Blue Ridge. The large number of negroes here will require for some
                    time the interposition of military authority to adjust differences in regard to
                    labor, property, and personal rights. I have maintained the strictest discipline
                    and order in my own command during the march, and permitted no injury whatever
                    to the property of citizens. The railroad is now open Keswick's Station, about
                    seven miles from here, and will be opened within two or three days to the
                    Rivanna River, some two miles distant. Supplies for troops at this point could,
                    therefore, be furnished over this route.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>FRANKLIN A. STRATTON,<br> Lieut. Col. Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry,
                        Cmdg. Regt.</p>
