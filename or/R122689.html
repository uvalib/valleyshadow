<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General George Cadwalader writes to Fitz-John Porter, stationed at
                    Chambersburg, in June, 1861. Cadwalader replies to Porter's order that he send a
                    detachment of his men to Cumberland. Cadwalader insists that it would be
                    impossible to do so.</p>

<p>Maj. F. J. PORTER, Asst. Adjt. Gen., Chambersburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>WILLIAMSPORT, MD.,</p>
<p>June 15, 1861.</p>
<p>Maj.:</p>
<p>Yours of this date is received. We are endeavoring to obtain reliable information
                    as to Harper's Ferry and the other side. There may be a deep-laid plot to
                    deceive us. To reach Cumberland would require three marches, and would weaken us
                    too much to make such a detachment as you propose. The moment we have reliable
                    information you shall hear from me; probably too late for Cumberland. The whole
                    affair is to me a riddle. Our command is exhausted, and could not make any march
                    before morning.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours.</p>
<p>GEO. CADWALADER,<br> Brevet Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
