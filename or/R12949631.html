<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon writes Robert E. Lee concerning
                    munitions for the army. Seddon informs Lee that 3,000 arms are available at
                    Staunton, an important Confederate supply center.</p>

<p>Gen. R. E. LEE,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>August 9, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I am pleased to be able to relieve you from the anxiety manifested in your letter
                    of the 7th instant, in relation to the due supply of arms for your army. I am
                    informed by the Chief of Ordnance that are at Staunton already, subject to your
                    order, 3,000 arms; that he can command here, subject to your requisition, from
                    5,000 to 7,000 more, and that he does not apprehend any difficulty in meeting
                    the larger number (10,000) which you expect to require within a month.</p>
<p>I am using all means at the command of the department to increase both the
                    manufacture and import of arms, and I am always pleased to receive announcements
                    of anticipated deficiencies, that they may be used to stimulate efforts on the
                    part of officers and agents, and assist me in providing for coming need.</p>
<p>Very truly, yours,</p>
<p>J. A. SEDDON,<br> Secretary of War.</p>
