<p>May 7, 1865.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I respectfully furnish the following report of the operations of the cavalry
                    during the past campaigns:</p>
<p>The command consisted of the First and Third Divisions of Cavalry, each division
                    accompanied by one section of artillery (3-inch rifled guns). A pontoon train
                    with a company of engineers, under command of Capt. Folwell, also accompanied
                    the expedition. The command marched with five days' rations and thirty pounds of
                    forage on the horses, and fifteen days' rations of sugar, coffee, and salt in
                    wagons. Each man carried on his horse seventy-five rounds of ammunition, while
                    10 rounds per man were carried in wagons. The entire train of the command,
                    including twelve ambulances and two medical wagons (all that marched with the
                    expedition), was seventy-five wagons. One pack-mule was allowed to each squadron
                    in the command, and two to each regimental headquarters. The command was placed
                    in readiness to march on short notice, yet still the state of preparation was so
                    complete that during the long and arduous marches not the smallest delay for
                    inconvenience resulted from neglect in this respect. The pontoon train, which
                    reported to the undersigned the night before the march, was provided with but
                    poor teams, which, in consequence of the bad condition of the roads and the
                    heaviness of the pontoon wagons, frequently failed on the route. These teams
                    were replaced by others collected in the country through which the march was
                    conducted.</p>
<p>February 27, 1865, the command marched from cantonment near Winchester, Va.,
                    camping at Woodstock. The bridge over Cedar Creek having been carried away by
                    the winter freshest, the fording was deep, but attended with but little
                    difficulty. From Woodstock a force of 500 men was sent in advance to hold the
                    bridge at Edenburg during the night.</p>
<p>February 28, the command marched at 6 a.m., and arrived at Mount Jackson at 10.30
                    a.m., where the bridge over the North Fork of the Shenandoah had been destroyed.
                    The stream being too deep to cross wagons by the ford, which was also unsafe for
                    the passage of mounted men, the pontoon bridge was thrown across, and the
                    command, with the exception of Pennington's brigade, which forded the stream,
                    passed safely over. One man and several horses were drowned in fording this
                    stream. The command camped at Lacey's Spring. Capehart's brigade, of the Third
                    Division, was moved to the front at 3 a.m. on the morning of March 1, to occupy
                    Harrisonburg. The main body moved at 6 a.m., reaching Harrisonburg at 10 a.m.
                    Capehart's brigade was ordered to move rapidly to Mount Crawford, and secure the
                    bridge over North River at that point. The enemy, under Rosser, on the approach
                    of this brigade, attempted to burn the bridge, but were quickly driven away by
                    Capehart's men, who forded the stream above and below, flanking the enemy's
                    rifle-pits. This command, under Rosser, was dispersed, captured, or killed. A
                    number of wagons were taken and destroyed by the advance. The command camped at
                    Middle River, the bridge over which was also secured by a rapid advance. Stagg's
                    brigade was ordered to move forward and destroy the railroad bridge on
                    Christian's Creek. This brigade occupied Staunton the same night.</p>
<p>March 2, the command arriving at Staunton, a force was detached from the First
                    Division to go to Swoope's Station, where it was reported the enemy had stored
                    supplies of war. This expedition found immense quantities of commissary,
                    quartermaster's, and ordnance stores, which it destroyed. The main column, the
                    Third Division in advance, moved toward Waynesborough, where the enemy was
                    found, strongly posted behind barricades and rifle-pits. Gen. Custer, after
                    engaging the enemy's artillery, with his own for a short time, moved three
                    regiments, under directions of Col. Whitaker, first Connecticut, to the left
                    flank and rear of the enemy, and routed him, with the loss of but 3 or 4 men to
                    our command, capturing over 1,000 prisoners, the enemy's artillery and wagon
                    train, containing all the wardrobe, papers, &amp; C., of the officers of
                    Early's depleted army. This event opened the roads for unresisted advance on the
                    James River and all the roads and means of supply north of Richmond. All the
                    captures which could not be carried away were destroyed. The prisoners and some
                    few pieces of artillery were ordered back to Winchester, under a mounted guard
                    of about 1,500 mounted and dismounted men, under Col. Thompson, First New
                    Hampshire Cavalry.</p>
<p>March 3, the Third Division marched at 6 a.m. for Charlottesville. Gen. Devin was
                    ordered to move in its rear with two brigades of his command, leaving one to
                    guard the wagon train, which, on account of the fearful condition of the roads,
                    was unable to make the marches effected by the cavalry. The column, as it
                    marched, destroyed all Confederate Government property on its route, as well as
                    the railroad bridges, depots, &amp;c., between Staunton and Charlottesville.
                    This latter place was entered without opposition by the Third Division, which
                    immediately set to work to destroy the railroad bridge over the Rivanna River.
                    Col. Randol, of Pennington's brigade, was sent the same day to destroy the
                    railroad bridges on the Lynchburg railroad, over the North and South Forks of
                    the Hardware River. The state of the roads from Staunton to Charlottesville
                    defies description. Heavy rains, which fell during the march, rendered the
                    stiff, yellow clay of that section of country soft and almost impassable. Great
                    injury resulted to the horses of the command from marching over these roads. The
                    disease called the hoof-rot was generated by the mud in this march. Quite a
                    large number of horses were destroyed subsequently by this disease. The trains
                    did not arrive at Charlottesville until the 4th of March. The greatest praise is
                    due to Capt. W. H. Brown, chief quartermaster of this command, and his able
                    assistants, for the energy and perseverance with which they worked in getting
                    the train over the road. During the march from Staunton, and until the column
                    reached the White House, they worked night and day, using every exertion and
                    means which a settled determination to succeed could provoke or human ingenuity
                    invent. At no time during the march, under the most trying circumstances, was
                    there the slightest disposition to fail in this most responsible duty of moving
                    the train. The command remained at Charlottesville until the morning of the 6th
                    of March. During the term of its stay at this place the command was fitted up as
                    well as possible. An abundance of forage was found in the country, and the
                    animals well supplied. The best of discipline was maintained. Scarcely an
                    instance of excess of any kind was brought to the notice of the general
                    commanding.</p>
<p>March 6, the command marched in two columns--the First Division, accompanied by
                    these headquarters, to Scottsville, on the James, and the Third Division, with
                    wagon trains, along the Lynchburg railroad toward Lynchburg. This division was
                    accompanied by the major-general commanding. It destroyed the railroad bridges
                    and culverts to Buffalo River, joining the First Division at New Market on the
                    8th. The First Division arrived at Scottsville on the 6th instant at 3 p.m. The
                    work of destruction on the canal was commenced at once, and continued by the
                    Reserve Brigade, which remained at Scottsville, during the night to await the
                    arrival of Col. Maxwell, First Michigan Cavalry, who was detached with a light
                    force to move down the Rivanna River, as far as Palmyra, to destroy bridges,
                    mills, manufactories, and rebel Government establishments. The First and Second
                    Brigades of the First Division were marched to Howardsville. The work of
                    destruction on the canal was prosecuted with great vigor. All locks from
                    Goochland to Duguidsville were destroyed during the time the command operated in
                    this country; also immense quantities of rebel Government stores, tobacco,
                    cotton, and subsistence stores were issued to the command or destroyed. The
                    officers and men of the First Division worked with great energy, marching all
                    day over the worst possible roads, and working early and late for the complete
                    accomplishment of the object of the expedition. Great credit is due Gen. Devin
                    and his energetic brigade commanders for their untiring zeal in carrying out the
                    orders given them at this time. Besides the locks, the aqueduct over the mouth
                    of the The River was destroyed, and the canal cut down and injured for miles.</p>
<p>On the 10th of March the command moved to Columbia. The idea of crossing the
                    James River and pushing still farther south was abandoned, for the reason that
                    the enemy had destroyed the bridges on the James River, thus rendering the
                    crossing impracticable, and the fact that, owing to the bad condition of the
                    roads and the reduced condition of the teams and animals of the command, it was
                    not thought feasible to pursue that route. Col. Fitzhugh's brigade was detached
                    on the night of the 8th of March to precede the command to Columbia, and thence
                    send a force down the river as far as Goochland. His command made an elegant
                    march to the point designated, fully accomplishing the objects for which it had
                    been sent out. During the 11th of March the command remained at Columbia,
                    resting and awaiting the arrival of the wagon trains. Reports were furnished at
                    that time of the amount of property destroyed, captured, &amp; C.</p>
<p>On the 12th of March the march toward the Virginia Central Railroad was resumed.
                    The two divisions marched on different roads, the Third Division having orders
                    to occupy the railroad in the neighborhood of Frederick's Hall Station by night.
                    This was done by Gen. Custer, who detached a brigade for the purpose. The fords
                    on the South Anna River were very bad, but after some repairing the command was
                    crossed without trouble, and reached the Central railroad, at Tolersville, on
                    the 13th of March. Here the First Division commenced the work of destruction on
                    the railroad, while the Third Division prosecuted the same work at Frederick's
                    Hall Station and beyond. Quite a number of miles of track were effectually
                    destroyed.</p>
<p>March 14, the command marched south for the purpose of destroying the bridges
                    over the South Anna and Little Rivers. Gen. Custer directed his march over
                    Ground Squirrel bridge, while Gen. Devin moved directly along the railroad to
                    the South Anna. The bridges were taken possession of and destroyed after a brisk
                    skirmish with the guards at the bridge, in which the Fifth U. S. Cavalry did
                    splendid service. Three pieces of artillery and a number of prisoners were
                    captured. The Third Division pushed south as far as Ashland, while the First
                    Division, after completely destroying the bridges, crossed the river with a view
                    to moving to Hanover Court-House. As it soon became apparent that the enemy in
                    considerable force (Pickett's division and part of Longstreet's corps) were
                    moving to intercept us on our march to the army of the Potomac, the command
                    recrossed the South Anna and moved on the north bank of the Pamunkey to White
                    House Landing. This point was reached on the 18th of March. Here ample supplies
                    were found for the command, and the time was busily occupied in refitting.</p>
<p>On the 25th of March the command resumed the march to the Army of the Potomac,
                    which it joined on the 27th of March.</p>
<p>Thus was completed a campaign which, for brilliancy of conception and perfect
                    success in execution, has never been equaled in the operations of cavalry in
                    this or any other country. The results attest the importance of the services
                    performed. The remnant of Early's famous Army of the Valley, which, less than a
                    year before, had enviroded the capital of the country, was captured or
                    dispersed, his artillery, trains, correspondence, and baggage in our hands. Two
                    railroads and one canal, immense arteries of supply for the rebel Army of
                    Northern Virginia, were completely disabled, and millions of dollars' worth of
                    rebel property, contraband of war, was destroyed or used for the command. The
                    rapidity of our march over roads rendered almost impassable by heavy rains,
                    which rendered the crossing of each petty creek a work of great labor and time,
                    was truly marvelous, and led the enemy completely astray as to our movements.
                    Over 350 miles were marched by the main body of the command, some parts of which
                    made over 500 miles. Over 2,000 prisoners were taken, 18 pieces of artillery, a
                    large number of arms, and many stand of colors. These are some of the
                    substantial fruits of the expedition, which, while it inflicted immense damage
                    on the Army of Northern Virginia, introduced for the first time to many of the
                    responsible people of Virginia the stern realities of the wicked war they
                    themselves had sought.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
