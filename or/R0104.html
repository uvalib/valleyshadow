<p>Capt. J. D. McFARLAND, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 8, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR</p>
<p>In compliance with Special Orders, No. 209, from army headquarters, I have the
					honor to transmit the following report representing the casualties, fights, and
					marches of this regiment. The date of this regiment joining the Army of the
					Potomac commences with the fourth epoch; we are, therefore, unable to render my
					account of the first, second, and third epochs:</p>
<p>FOURTH EPOCH.</p>
<p>June 1.--Our regiment crossed the Pamunkey River and arrived at the Army of the
					Potomac, and were attached to the Second Brigade, First Division, Fifth Corps,
					and took up a position behind breast-works.</p>
<p>June 2.--We changed position several times during the afternoon and evening, the
					enemy shelling us, from which we had 1 officer (Lieut. Waters) killed.</p>
<p>June 3.--We were engaged with the enemy all day at Cold Harbor; our casualties
					were: Killed, 7; wounded, 47; among the latter being Col. Boyd, Capt. Phillips,
					Lieut. Doyle, and Lieut. Clarke. We remained there until night; we then moved to
					the left and occupied other breast-works until June 5. We then marched within
					half a mile of the Chickahominy, threw up breast-works, where we remained until
					June 12, when we marched to the Chickahominy.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>O. B. KNOWLES, Maj. Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry, Cmdg. Regt.</p>
