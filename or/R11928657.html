<p>Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,<br> Secretary of War, Richmond,
                        Va.:</p>
<p>Camp near Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p>October 8, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Since the army has remained in this position, all the wounded resulting from the
                    battles at Manassas that were sent west of the mountains, and those that were
                    able to be transported from the battle-fields in Maryland, and such as had been
                    injured in the smaller conflicts on the line of the Potomac, have been sent from
                    Winchester to Staunton. The medical director reports that the whole number is
                    about 4,500. He also states that about an equal number of sick from this army
                    are now accumulated in Winchester, and they are principally, if not altogether,
                    the conscripts and recruits that have joined since we have been stationary. They
                    are afflicted with measles, camp fever, &amp;c. The medical director thinks
                    that all the conscripts we have received are thus afflicted, so that, instead of
                    being an advantage to us, they are an element of weakness, a burden. I think,
                    therefore, that it would be better that the conscripts be assembled in camps of
                    instructions, so that they may pass through these investable diseases, and
                    become a little inured to camp life. I recommend, therefore, that, except such
                    as can be collected from these border counties, and which can only be controlled
                    by the presence of the army, no more conscripts be sent up for the present. The
                    sick that have been captured and paroled by the enemy at Leesburg, Middleburg,
                    Aldie, and Shepherdstown are principally composed of stragglers who have
                    congregated at these places for repose and refreshment. From all these points
                    all the wounded and sick were transported before they were exposed to capture,
                    except such as could not bear transportation, and had to be left fate, and the
                    result is that we have to exchange prisoners of war to release men who have done
                    us no service.</p>
<p>I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
