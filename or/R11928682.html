<p>Col. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg. First Regt. Virginia
                        Partisan Rangers:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 26, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 24th has been received. I am glad you keep in view the great
                    object before you, viz, the destruction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. I am
                    aware that the enemy's is greatly superior to yours, but I hope that, by the
                    exercise of prudence with boldness, you will be able to mislead him, and strike
                    at some vulnerable point, and thus inflict great damage. I regret to learn that
                    your men are so badly clad, and approved the requisition presented by Capt.
                    Imboden upon the quartermaster at Staunton for 400 suits. This army, I regret to
                    state, is in a similar condition to your own, and, though possibly in a warmer
                    climate at present, is without the shelter which your woods and mountains
                    furnish.</p>
<p>I am much pleased at the result of your operations in collecting cattle, and
                    desire that you will continue them as long as they can be advantageously
                    pursued. I hope you will be able to carry out your plan against the Cheat River
                    bridge and trestle work. Their destruction would tie up the railroad for the
                    winter.</p>
<p>I join you in the apprehension that the enemy's forces in the northwest will
                    prevent Gen. Loring from accomplishing more than to distract attention from you
                    and relieve you of a part of his force.</p>
<p>I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
