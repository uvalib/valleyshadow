<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin forwards a September, 1862, telegram to
                    Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. In the telegram, Colonel A. K. McClure writes
                    from Chambersburg to discuss preparations to meet Lee's advance into
                Maryland.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG,</p>
<p>September 8, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can rely on the following dispatch, just received by me, which I repeat to
                    you:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, September 7-11.30 p. m.<br> Governor CURTIN:</p>
<p>Telegraph operator at Hagerstown reports he is reliably informed that 5,000 rebel
                    troops are marching on Hagerstown. He was about to leave, but has agreed to stay
                    until he hears further. The train has been ordered away, and will be here
                    shortly. I am going out to post the remnant of Murphy's regiment on picket duty
                    on leading avenues approaching town. If any movement is to be made to defend the
                    valley, no time should be lost. There is not a soldier in Hagerstown, and they
                    have no pickets. This may magnify reports greatly, but the rebels are doubtless
                    advised that Hagerstown is entirely undefended, and will pretty certainly move
                    on it. I will return in an hour or two, and if anything important transpires
                    will advise you.<br> A. K. McCLURE.</p>
<p>I have other dispatches from Col. McClure, received earlier this evening, which
                    corroborate one above repeated. He and others who have been sent there to
                    procure information have no doubt that the rebels are in large force at and in
                    Frederick. I suggest that the battery returned here from York, by your order, be
                    sent forward, together with the troops we have at this point, and that an
                    officer be sent at once to take command of the line of the State. We could at
                    least hold the rebels in check until the forces which you have now in motion
                    reach the Upper Potomac, which must soon become the theater of active
                    hostilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. G. CURTIN.</p>
