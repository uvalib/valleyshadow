<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union cavalry Major Daniel Darling reports on a November, 1864, reconnaissance in
                    the Valley. He mentions having in custody a man who came in from Staunton who
                    might have useful information.</p>

<p>Capt. C. H. SAFFORD,<br> Acting Assistant
                        Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 7, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>In obedience to orders I made a reconnaissance to Edenburg, with the Seventh
                    Regt. and 100 men of the Sixth Michigan Cavalry. We passed unmolested up the
                    pike till we struck the enemy's picket line beyond the creek that crosses the
                    pike this side of Edenburg. Their outer vedettes were driven in upon their main
                    line, together with some dismounted men. A few shots were fired and we withdrew,
                    having found their line quite strong, and posted, as nearly as we could learn
                    from citizens, about where it has been for the last ten days. Citizens also
                    report the enemy's infantry at New Market and Forestville. Drums were distinctly
                    heard in direction of Forestville. I send you a man whom I picked up at
                    Woodstock; he is a stranger there, and came in yesterday from Staunton. Thinking
                    he might give some valuable information I brought him along. The command left
                    camp at 8 a.m., being detained two hours by the detail from the Sixth Michigan
                    Cavalry. Arrived in camp at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>All of which is very respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. H. DARLING,<br> Maj., Cmdg.</p>
