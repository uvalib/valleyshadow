<p>Capt. WILLIAM M. BOONE,<br> Assistant
                        Adjutant-General.</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 18, 1863.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report all quiet here. Rumors of fighting at Harrisonburg or
                    Staunton; also that our infantry force is advancing on Winchester, on the other
                    side of the North Mountain.</p>
<p>Our cavalry have been beyond Woodstock to-day. Cannot learn of any enemy in our
                    immediate vicinity. Imboden is said to be between Harrisonburg and New Market;
                    his advance outposts at Edenburg. The river very high and unfordable at Front
                    Royal. Forage train and your dispatch have arrived. I have no idea of deviating
                    unless forced to do so by the contingency mentioned in my instructions as to be
                    specially guarded against. Shall go to Woodstock to-morrow and follow my
                    instructions in the order. Men healthy and in good spirits.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>GEO. D. WELLS,<br> Colonel, Commanding.</p>
