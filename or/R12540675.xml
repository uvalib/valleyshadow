                </opener>
                <p>I received yesterday your letter of the 14th instant and the papers accompanying
                    it.</p>
                <p>The proposed plan of operations on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad seems
                    practicable, and, if carried out with energy and dash, there are good grounds
                    for hoping that it may be brilliantly successful. To work successfully at the
                    destruction of the railroad bridge and trestle-work (iron) over and rear Cheat
                    River, the road should be obstructed to the west as well as east of Cheat River.</p>
                <p>You speak in your letter to Gen. Lee of the destruction of the bridge and
                    trestle-work, which you say are of wood, "at Rowlesburg." No such place is laid
                    down on any map that I have; but I presume from the connection in which you
                    mention it, that they are to the west of and near Cheat River Bridge. If so, and
                    they are destroyed, as well as the other bridges you mentioned, the cavalry
                    force, aided by my engineer and his men, will have a fair opportunity of working
                    to destroy the extensive Cheat River bridge and trestle, provided you can whip
                    or even fully engage the attention of the enemy at Beverly and Buckhanon.</p>
                <p>The day before I received your letter, I received one from Gen. Lee, mentioning
                    confidentially your expedition, and asking if I could contribute two infantry
                    regiments for the expedition. I replied, suggesting to him that he could take
                    two regiments which had been ordered back to this department, but had not
                    started from Eastern Virginia, and let you have the two you particularly
                    desire-the Twenty-fifth and Thirty-first. I hope the arrangement I suggested
                    will be made, and you procure the requisite force to carry out the plan as
                    proposed.</p>
                <p>I regret very much that I was not sooner informed of the proposed plan, as I
                    would then have deferred an expedition (a small one) which I have started to the
                    Kanawha. It would thus have served to fix the attention of the enemy in the
                    Kanawha Valley whilst you would be carrying out your plan.</p>
                <p>If you start on the expedition, I will, I think, be able to engage the enemy's
                    attention in the Kanawha Valley long enough to prevent him from interfering with
                    you. I had intended to undertake an expedition between the middle and end of
                    April to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and for other purposes. I
                    cannot, however, start it so soon as you say you can. I will very gladly
                    contribute all in my power to your success.</p>
                <p>My department is designated by the War Department as the "Trans Alleghany, or
                    Department of Western Virginia, and embraces the northwest as well as the
                    southwest. If your command is designed to act in Western Virginia, it should
                    report to me, and be subject to my orders. Otherwise, as you see in this case,
                    it will be difficult to co-operate in a way to secure all the results that might
                    be obtained from the judicious and proper employment of our troops.</p>
                <p>My engineer officer is ready to join you with his small party when you need him.</p>
