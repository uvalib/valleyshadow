<p> Hon. E. M. STANTON:</p>
<p>MIDDLETOWN, VA.,</p>
<p>June 19, 1862-</p>
<p></p>
<p>I inspected our lines to-day. Gen. Banks' division opposite Front Royal, and my
                    division opposite Strasburg, behind Cedar Creek. Gen. Fremont's troops will
                    encamp at Woodstock. Gen. Shields is at Front Royal. The enemy's pickets were 2
                    miles this side of Luray last night. Our lines will be perfectly established and
                    in good condition to-morrow. Two prisoners were just brought before me-R. H.
                    Wade and H. D. Didier. Was produced a certificate from the British consul at
                    Richmond, and brought Didier with him from Richmond to Staunton, from which
                    place they made their way through the mountains on horseback. Wade says Jackson
                    received two re-enforcements, 3,000 men, on the 9th, who left the cars at
                    Mechum's River, east of Charlottesville, and marched to Brown's Gap, southeast
                    of Port Republic. On Saturday and Sunday last these two men were at Staunton.
                    During the two days about 12,000 troops arrived from Richmond, via Lynchburg and
                    Charlottesville. On Saturday trains with soldiers arrived, and on Sunday five
                    trains. The troops consisted of infantry, cavalry, and about twenty pieces of
                    artillery. These troops were marched off on Sunday and Monday in the direction
                    of Harrisonburg. They were a part of the forces at Richmond, where Wade says
                    there were 120,000 troops, under the command of Gen. Lee, as Gen. Johnson was
                    wounded in the shoulder. Provisions are plenty at Richmond, but the whole city
                    is filled with sick and wounded.</p>
<p>Didier says, "I left Savannah on 1st of June. There were 20,000 troops under Gen.
                    Lawton at Savannah, including those in camp of instruction."</p>
