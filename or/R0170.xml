                <p>In compliance with circular of the 11th, Second Division headquarters, I report
                    the part taken by this brigade on the 5th, 6th and 7th instant.</p>
                <p>February 5, the brigade was formed at its old camp, and marched at 7 a.m. down
                    the Vaughan road, where we halted for the Third Division, Second Army Corps, to
                    pass. The Nineteenth Massachusetts, Lieut.-Col. Rice, was advanced as
                    skirmishers in front of a brigade of the Third Division. The balance of the
                    brigade moved on the Vaughan road, and changed direction to the right through
                    the woods, arriving at or near Hatcher's Run, crossed over Wild Cat Run, and
                    formed line of battle, facing the woods and westward as follows: The One hundred
                    and eighty-fourth Pennsylvania on left; Thirty-sixth Wisconsin, One hundred and
                    fifty-second New York, Fifty-ninth New York the Seventh Michigan, and First
                    Minnesota were thrown out as skirmishers to the left and front with their left
                    resting on Hatcher's Run. The Nineteenth Massachusetts connected with the First
                    Minnesota, picketing to the Nineteenth Maine, who advanced and carried the
                    enemy's works on Hatcher's Run. Along the base of Hatcher's Run the Twentieth
                    Massachusetts was sent, by order of Gen. Smyth, to support a brigade of the
                    Third Division. They were relieved after the engagement on Sunday, February 5.</p>
                <p>February 6 and 7, no material change of troops.</p>
                <p>I have the honor to report that during the engagement of Sunday, the 5th, on our
                    right, and Mounday, the 6th, on our left the conduct of officers and men was
                    more than could be expected; their coolness and contentment and patient waiting
                    attracted the attention of myself and staff; and I can safely say, had an
                    opportunity offered itself, they would have done credit to the general
                    commanding the division. I wish to mention for brevet promotion, for gallant and
                    fearless discharge of duty, and for general attention thereto, Lieut. Col.
                    George W. La Point, commanding Seventh Michigan Volunteers, and Maj. M. Van
                    Sickle, of the same regiment; also Capt. Frank Houston, commanding First
                    Minnesota Battalion; also Lieut. W. H. Tibbitts, Nineteenth Massachusetts, and
                    First Lieut. and Actg. Adjt. J. F. Aytoun, Nineteenth Massachusetts and Maj.
                    John Kelliher, Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers for gallant and meritorious
                    conduct on picket-line. I cannot close this report without mentioning with
                    credit the officers of my staff; always ready, prompt, and each showed the
                    disposition of the soldier, by obeying strictly their orders and delivering them
                    under fire; and I do therefore ask for a brevet for Capt. Will Gilder, assistant
                    adjutant-general; Capt. A. B. Holmes, acting brigade-inspector; Capt. Thomas
                    Huggins, temporary aide-de-camp; and Second Lieut. William H. Tripp, personal
                    aide.</p>
                <p>Herewith I subjoin the reports of the regimental commanders.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I am, major, yours, respectfully,</salute>
