<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During June and early July, 1861, General Robert S. Garnett commanded the Confederate forces
     defending what is now West Virginia. In this dispatch, Garnett reports to Assistant Adjutant
     George Deas on the situation in his sector. Garnett reports having to rely solely upon Staunton
     to supply his operations.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. GEORGE DEAS,<br> Asst. Adjt. and Insp. Gen., C. S. Army,
      Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>Camp at Laurel Hill, Va.,</p>
<p>June 25, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I reached Huttonsville on the 14th instant. I found there twenty-three companies of infantry,
     mostly mustered into service, but in a miserable condition as to arms, clothing, equipments,
     instruction, and discipline. Twenty of these companies were organized into two regiments, the
     one under Lieut.-Col. Jackson and the other under Lieut.-Col. Heck. Though wholly incapable, in
     my judgment, of rendering anything like efficient service, I deemed it of such importance to
     possess myself of the two turnpike passes over the Rich and Laurel Mountains, before they
     should be seized by the enemy, that I left Huttonsville on the evening of the 15th with these
     two regiments and Capt. Rice's battery, and, by marching them a greater portion of the night,
     reached the two passes early in the afternoon of the following day, Col. Heck's regiment and a
     section of artillery occupying the Buckhannon Pass, and Col. Jackson, with the remaining
     section, taking up their position here.</p>
<p>I regard these two passes as the gates to the northwestern country, and, had they been
     occupied by the enemy, my command would have been effectually paralyzed or shut up in the Cheat
     River Valley. I think it was a great mistake on the part of the enemy not to have remained here
     after driving Col. Porterfield's command over it. I have caused all the country road leading
     from the northwestern country, which cross this range of mountains between the foot of Cheat
     Mountain and Saint George, the county seat Tucker County, to be blocked up by cutting large
     trees across them. I have done this to prevent the enemy from getting into rear and cutting off
     my supplies, which, so far, I have been obliged to obtain chiefly from Staunton.</p>
<p>By sending out heavy escort I am now endeavoring to collect grain and cattle, both from the
     direction of Philippi and Buckhannon. I have made Beverly for the present my principal depot. I
     propose in a few days to send the three small companies left at Huttonsville, six miles farther
     south, to the foot of Cheat Mountain, where, in a strong position, which I shall improve, I
     shall establish them, and deposit two days' supplies for my entire command.</p>
<p>The road from Saint George to Cheat River Bridge, on the railroad, is a country road, and
     scarcely practicable for wheels. My last information, which is, of course, not very reliable,
     is that the enemy have blocked up this road from the Cheat Bridge to where it is crossed by the
     Northwestern turnpike, which leads by Evansville to Grafton. If this proves to be true, it will
     increase my difficulties in getting on this railroad very much. Should they have done the same
     thing on all the roads crossing the railroad from the south, they will have put the railroad, I
     fear, beyond the reach of my present force. This force I consider more than sufficient to hold
     these two passes, but not sufficient to hold railroad, if I should get an opportunity of
     seizing it at any particular point; for I must have an adequate force in each of the passes to
     secure them for our use. My best chance of getting at the railroad seems at present to be by
     the Morgantown road, a road which leads from Yeager's (see map) to Evansville. When once at
     Evansville, which is on the Northwestern turnpike, I should threaten Grafton (twelve miles
     distant) and Cheat Bridge (fourteen miles distant), at both of which points they now have a
     force which they would be compelled to keep in this position, and thus enable me to get at the
     road at Independence, five miles from Evansville, destroy it there, and then upon the force at
     Cheat Bridge (by marching on the railroad) before it could be re-enforced from Grafton. The
     objection to this operation is that it enables the enemy at Philippi to throw himself upon my
     rear. If, however, I had sufficient force to hold this post securely, my remaining force could
     regain it from Cheat Bridge, by way of Saint George, with a little work on that road; the roads
     from Philippi leading over the Laurel Mountain into that road, four in number, having, as I
     have already stated, been blocked up by me. My moving force (say three thousand), however, will
     not be sufficient, I fear, for this operation.</p>
<p>The various accounts which I get of the enemy's strength (none positive or even reliable)
     present him as having from four to seven thousand at Philippi, with from six to ten pieces of
     artillery, and that he is entrenched on the hill behind the town, about three thousand at
     Grafton,three or four thousand at Clarksburg, and about two thousand at Cheat Bridge. I have
     been, so far, wholly unable to get anything like accurate or reliable information as to the
     numbers, movements, or intentions of the enemy, and begin to believe it almost an impossible
     thing. The Union men are greatly in the ascendancy here, and are much more zealous and active
     their cause than the secessionists. The enemy are kept fully advised of our movements, even to
     the strength or our scouts and pickets, by the country people, while we are compelled to grope
     in the dark as much as if we were invading a foreign and hostile country.</p>
<p>The Georgia regiment reached me yesterday. I hear nothing definite about the two remaining
     companies of the Twentieth Regiment, and the four remaining companies of Col. Fulkerson's.
     There has elapsed scarcely time for me to hear of the result of my application for two
     additional companies of cavalry. They are greatly needed here. The maps give very incorrect
     impressions as to the number of roads in this region of country.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing of the medical stores for my command, nor of other requisitions made on
     the Ordnance and Quartermaster's Departments. I hope that they may be urged to fill them as
     speedily as possible. Many of my men are without blankets or tents. The nights are frequently
     cold and we have frequent rains.</p>
<p>I shall have the defenses of this place complete in a week. The Buckhannon Pass in naturally
     much stronger, and the regiment there will be able to hold five times their number in check for
     a sufficient time to admit of being re-enforced, if they will stand to their work.</p>
<p>At Philippi the enemy occupy the heights beyond the town, in the direction of Grafton. They
     have mined the bridge and thrown abatis in the ford. It is further said that they have blocked
     up the road on this side of Philippi. Until I can get some additional cavalry I shall not have
     adequate means of determining to what extent these reports are true.</p>
<p>This communication is rather lengthy, I fear, for the general to read, but as I do not
     propose to trouble him often, I have deemed it best to report fully the condition of things
     under my command.</p>
<p>Two companies of infantry are being organized in Beverly, under Col. Porterfield, whom I have
     assigned temporarily to the command of that place. Capt. Rice's company is also ordered to from
     part of his command, after turning over his battery to Capt. Anderson. Accessions to my command
     come in very slowly.</p>
<p>No periodical muster rolls for June 30 have yet arrived, nor any other blank forms. The
     general's order, in relation to the court of inquiry, had already been anticipated. The
     proceedings will be forwarded in a day or two. I was aware of the road by Stribling Springs,
     but it is impossible to cut off all communication with the enemy. The mass of the country
     people is against us.</p>
<p>I have already addressed several communications to Gen. Cooper, and asked for instructions as
     to the proper person to address. Be pleased to inform me on this point.</p>
<p>At the end of this month I shall send a return of my force. I am pushing the instruction of
     the men with all possible activity.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> R. S. GARNETT,<br> Brig.-Gen., Provisional Army, Commanding.</p>
