<p> Gen. HUMPHREYS:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 4, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A deserter from the Sixty-first Virginia Regiment, Mahone's old brigade, of
                    Mahone's division, came into the lines of Gen. Mott's brigade, of Gen. Birney's
                    division, about 5 o'clock this a. m. He states that he had just come out on his
                    post as a sharpshooter and left his brigade in the breast-works; that his
                    division came into position at this point night before last, having returned
                    from an expedition down the railroad. Wilcox's division had been occupying the
                    place vacated by Mahone's division, and they moved down to the right again. It
                    was rumored in camp last night that Ewell was going into Maryland; that he had
                    with him his own corps and the detached forces that have been lately operating
                    in the Valley; that he had loaded his trains with hard bread an had left his
                    baggage at Staunton. Rumors have been afloat for a day or two past that he had
                    taken Arlington Heights and was about to capture the city of Washington. Rations
                    were cut down on the last issue a quarter of a pound on meal, said to be only
                    temporary. Sugar and coffee are issued irregularly. The division stationed on
                    the right of the rebel lines (which is now Wilcox's division) sends a force of
                    at least a brigade to a point on the Weldon railroad known as the Six-Mile
                    House. This force is regularly sent our and relieved. Informant states that
                    Mahone's division is completely tired out and relieved. Informant states that
                    Mahone's division is completely tired out in marching backward and forward down
                    the railroad, and that Wilcox's division is now performing the same duty.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>GEORGE H. SHARPE,<br> Col., &amp;c.</p>
