<p><b>Summary:<br></b>On May 8, 1862, Confederate troops under General Thomas J. Jackson attacked and
                    defeated Union forces under Robert Milroy at McDowell. In this letter, Union
                    General Nathaniel P. Banks, possibly unaware of these developments, reports to
                    Secretary of War Edwin Stanton on Jackson's movements. He speculates Jackson
                    might be headed south to Staunton.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>NEW MARKET,</p>
<p>May 9, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch received. Gen. Fremont's opinions as to the position of Jackson are
                    correct. He has not been in front of Gen. McDowell unless within two or three
                    days past. Ewell's division has been at Elk Run, between blue Ridge and
                    Shenandoah, on the road from Harrisonburg to Stanardsville, until now. Our
                    scouts report the camp-fires as seen yesterday. He has four brigades--12,700
                    men--and four batteries, of four guns. Jackson was at Port Republic, 6 miles
                    above; Ewell on Shenandoah when my command left Harrisonburg. He is thought to
                    have moved south toward Staunton or possibly toward Richmond. If Gen. Fremont
                    reports him with Edward Johnson against Milroy he is most likely correct. Such
                    movement would accord with all our information up to this day. Johnson has about
                    3,000, Jackson 8,000 men, making with Ewell over 20,000 men. They are not more
                    than 20 miles distant from each other unless Jackson has moved south recently.
                    They will concentrate against any small force left in the valley. there are no
                    troops at Gordonsville, Madison, or Culpeper unless arrived there recently.
                    Ewell's division was the last that left Manassas, the Rappahannock, Culpeper,
                    and Madison. I have reported these facts from day to day to the Department.
                    Hundreds of fugitives come through these places into our lines because there are
                    no troops there.</p>
