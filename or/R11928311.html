<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin reports to President Lincoln on details of
                    the September, 1862, Antietam campaign. He mentions organizing militia at

<p></p>
<p>The PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>September 16, 1862</p>
<p>Capt. Palmer telegraphs me from Hagerstown as follows:</p>
<p>I rode to Gen. McClellan's headquarters at Keedysville at 12 o'clock last night,
                    and have just returned, leaving there at noon. The general believes that
                    Harper's Ferry surrendered yesterday morning, and that Jackson re-enforced Lee
                    at Sharpsburg last night. The enemy have a strong position on the west bank of
                    the Antietam Creek, opposite Sharpsburg. McClellan's army lies on east bank,
                    within shooting distance, but under excellent cover. The battle will begin this
                    afternoon. Hooker was moving to open the ball at about noon. Rebels appear
                    encouraged at arrival of their re-enforcements. Gen. McClellan at first thought
                    he would send a large force of Pleasonton's cavalry, with artillery, to this
                    point--which is Jones' Cross-Roads, on Sharpsburg pike--but finally concluded
                    not to send them so far off; but he ordered down the Harper's Ferry cavalry,
                    1,300 in number, to support my 300, and desires all the force that can be sent
                    from Cumberland Valley to come here immediately. Please push this matter.</p>
<p>We have no infantry or artillery sufficiently well organized to march into
                    Maryland to support McClellan, but a force of ten or fifteen good regiments,
                    with some artillery, thrown on the flank and rear of the enemy by to-morrow
                    night might be of immense service. If Gen. Wool can forward that number from
                    Baltimore to-night and to-morrow night. We are busy organizing our militia at
                    Chambersburg, and in a few days will have a respectable reserve for checking
                    invasions. What can be done? Please advise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. G. CURTIN,<br> Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>
