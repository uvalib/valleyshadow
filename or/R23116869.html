<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Paroled Confederate prisoner F. M. Imboden writes from Staunton in May, 1862, to
                    General Henry Wise. Imboden asks Wise to arrange a prisoner exchange so Imboden
                    can return to service.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Gen. H. A. WISE.</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>May 8, 1862.</p>
<p>DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>Inclosed I send you a letter written by my brother to the President asking my
                    exchange if it can be effected. If you will present it to him upon some early
                    visit and use your influence with him to effect this exchange I will be very
                    greatly obliged to you. An exchange just now would be most gratifying to me as
                    it would enable me to go into the service at once in the mountains. I fear the
                    prospect for an exchange of the prisoners of your legion in a body is very poor,
                    but the President is, I understand, granting individual exchanges in some few
                    cases. When the rolls were made up at Roanoke I was greatly at a loss the
                    circumstances that found me there to know how to report myself, but was advised
                    by Col. Anderson and others to be enrolled as a volunteer aide, which would I
                    think entitle me to an exchange as a private. I hope this conclusion meets with
                    your approbation.</p>
<p>The rangers I think have nearly all re-enlisted or been scattered about by the
                    fall of New Orleans, where they were quartered, so that they cannot again be
                    organized. In the court-martial of Capt. McLean I don't think my testimony could
                    be of any importance and telegraphed Gen. Winder to that effect, and hope my
                    absence will not interfere with the trial.</p>
<p>Hoping you will effect my release and add to the obligations imposed by many
                    former kindness,</p>
<p>I remain, truly, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. M. IMBODEN.</p>
