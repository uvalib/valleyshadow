<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Benjamin Franklin Kelley suggests plans for movements on Staunton
                    in this November, 1862, letter to Adjutant General Bascom.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Maj. BASCOM,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Charleston, W.
                        Va.:</p>
<p>CUMBERLAND,</p>
<p>November 24, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Will the general pardon me for making a suggestion? It is this: If he intends
                    Milroy to move from Beverly toward Staunton, and occupy the country in the head
                    of this valley, at Monterey and other points, would it not be advisable for him
                    to move with his command up the Potomac Valley, through Petersburg and Franklin,
                    to Monterey? The road is good all the way, following up the bank of the South
                    Branch. If Pendleton and Highland should be occupied by our forces, it will give
                    peace and quietness to all the counties lying adjacent, west and north. His
                    troops can be supplied from New Creek Station by a better road and less distance
                    than from Webster or Clarksburg; and, moreover, if he should be assailed there
                    by a superior force, he can fall back on me, or I can go to his support.</p>
<p></p>
<p> B. F. KELLEY,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
