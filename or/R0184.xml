                <p>I have the honor to report that this division marched from camp on Sunday
                    morning, 5th instant. Resistance was offered by a detachment of rebels (who had
                    destroyed the bridge) at the crossing of the Rowanty (Hatcher's Run). The place
                    was quickly carried by the Third Brigade, and a portion of the defenders
                    captured. The division proceeded and took up a position on the Quaker road.
                    Marched that night on the Vaughan road to the crossing of Hatcher's Run. The
                    First Brigade was sent out next morning along the road to support the cavalry.
                    Later I received an order to support the Third Division in a reconnaissance to
                    Dabney's Mill. I sent an order to withdraw the First Brigade in time for it to
                    take its place in the column, but the enemy having advanced along the Vaughan
                    road, that brigade became briskly engaged to my left and could not be withdrawn.
                    Having received notice from Gen. Crawford that his left was hard pressed, I was
                    pushing forward rapidly with two brigades, marching in two lines by a flank in
                    the thick underbrush ascending a ridge, when a quantity of our cavalry, riding
                    rapidly, came on to my ranks suddenly. A portion of my troops were swept away,
                    but I pushed rapidly on with what I had, soon engaged the enemy, and quickly
                    retook the mill site, which I held, re-enforced by three regiments of the First
                    Division, till the troops on my right were pressed back by overwhelming numbers.
                    My troops then fell back to the open ground and were subsequently withdrawn to
                    the position held previous. I refer you to the reports of the brigade commanders
                    for further particulars of their operations. Those officers-Brevet Brig.-Gen.
                    Winthrop, Brevet Brig.-Gen. Gwyn, and Col. Bowerman, Eighth [Fourth] Maryland
                    Volunteers-seconded me with zeal and energy. Gen. Winthrop handsomely repulsed
                    the enemy's attack on the Vaughan road. I must bear testimony in this connection
                    to the zeal, intelligence, and good conduct of my staff-Bvt. Col. C. E. LaMotte,
                    Fourth Delaware Volunteers, acting assistant inspector-general; Bvt. Maj. W. W.
                    Swan, Seventeenth U. S. Infantry, acting assistant adjutant-general; First
                    Lieut. R. P. Warren, One hundred and forty-sixth New York Volunteers,
                    aide-de-camp; First Lieut. John J. Diehl, Fifteenth New York Heavy Artillery,
                    aide-de-camp.</p>
                <p>The courage and fidelity of my mounted messengers under trying circumstances
                    entitles them to be named in this report. They are: Henry Bonnet, Company D,
                    Fifteenth New York Heavy Artillery, standard-bearer and acting corporal; John T.
                    Thomson, Company I, Eighth Maryland Volunteers; William H. Yingling, Company I,
                    Eighth Maryland Volunteers; John T. Bratt, Company H, Eighth Maryland
                    Volunteers; Munroe Fowler, Company H, Eighth Maryland Volunteers; John T.
                    Mackison, Company H, Eighth Maryland Volunteers, severely wounded.</p>
                <p>Tabular and nominal lists of casualties will be forwarded as soon as completed.</p>
                <p>Brevet Brig.-Gen. Pearson, commanding the re-enforcements from the First
                    Division, bore himself with gallantry.</p>
