<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In the first week of May, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson gathered
                    troops at Staunton, Virginia, from which to launch an offensive in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. In this dispatch, Lee, directing Confederate forces from
                    Richmond, writes Jackson at Staunton on his concentration of troops.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Maj. Gen. THOMAS J. JACKSON,<br> Cmdg., Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 8, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 5th instant, reporting your presence at Staunton and the
                    movements of the troops en route to that place, has been received. I have not
                    seen Capt. Imboden. If I can find him I will urge him to join you with such men
                    as he can at once, as you desired. From the retrograde movement of the enemy
                    down the valley, and their apparent intention to leave it, it is presumed that
                    Gen. Banks contemplates a move in the direction of Fredericksburg, for the
                    purpose of forming a junction with the column of Gen. McDowell in front of that
                    city. Should it be ascertained that this is his intention there will be no
                    necessity for retaining the division of Gen. Ewell at Swift Run Gap, and I have
                    already so advised Gen. Ewell by telegraph on the 6th and again by letter
                    to-day, at the same time suggesting to him the practicability of striking Banks
                    a blow while en route to Fredericksburg. With this view it was recommended that
                    he move the bulk of his command to Gordonsville or the line of the
                    Rappahannock,leaving a sufficient force to watch the pass through Swift Run Gap.
                    Moreover, in this latter position he would be enabled the more readily to
                    en-enforce Gen. Anderson, who is this side of Fredericksburg, if necessary; of
                    course the above course would only be pursued when it was positively ascertained
                    that the enemy intended leaving the valley. Gen. Ewell states in his letter of
                    the 6th instant that he will not leave his position at Swift Run Gap until the
                    enemy have entirely left the valley or until he has orders to that effect from
                    you.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
