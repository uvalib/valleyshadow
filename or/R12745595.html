<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch writes to General Smith in July, 1863, concerning the
                    pursuit of Lee's army from Gettysburg. Couch asks Smith to leave notice of his
                    location in Chambersburg, so supplies can be sent to his men.</p>

<p>Gen. Smith, Shippensburg:</p>
<p>Harrisburg,</p>
<p>July 7, 1863 </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have ordered shoes to go. Can't tell when they will reach you. Try to have
                    directions left with operator at Chambersburg of your position.</p>
<p>Boyd has been at Waynesborough to-day. He has some wagons. Gen. Knipe says he
                    will report by letter to Gen. Meade. He must not do that, but remain with you,
                    by my orders.</p>
<p>I sent you dispatch as regards your retiring in certain contingencies. Let me
                    know if you want beef-cattle.</p>
<p>I shall throw troops down the Valley. There will be heavy fighting at
                    Williamsport. Lee has no bridges; so said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
