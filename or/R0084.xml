                <p>I have the honor to submit the following brief report of the operations of this

                    reconnaissance to Nottoway River in search of Brig.-Gen. Wilson's command. 2d,
                    marched to Prince George Court-House and encamped. 3d, remained in camp. 4th,

                <p>The entire distance marched by this command during the past two months is about
                    700 miles, exclusive of the distance traveled after forage, going to and
                    returning from picket duty and in scouting. This brigade has participated in
                    eleven battles and has lost heavily in killed and wounded. I cannot speak in
                    terms that would be exaggerated of the conduct of the officers and men of this
                    command; the unflinching courage displayed under fire, and the cheerfulness with
                    which every toil and privation was endured and submitted to, entitle the
                    officers and men of this command to be ranked among the best soldiers of this or
                    any other army.</p>
                <p> I have to regret the loss of the following officers killed in action and who
                    have since died of wounds received, whose names deserve to be written high up on
                    the scroll of fame: William Harris, lieutenant, First Maine Cavalry: George W.
                    Bartlett, chaplain, First Maine Cavalry; O. A. Ellis, captain, First Maine
                    Cavalry; Walstein Phillips, captain, First Maine Cavalry; F. J. Dungan,
                    lieutenant, Second Pennsylvania Cavalry; John Kline, captain, Thirteenth
                    Pennsylvania Cavalry; F. W. Bowen, lieutenant, Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry,
                    killed; Lieut. Col. S. Boothby, Maj. J. P. Cilley, First Maine Cavalry, died of
                    wounds;<ref n="1" target="note1">[1]</ref> Col. George H. Covode, Fourth
                    Pennsylvania, mortally wounded at the head of his regiment at Saint Mary's
                    Church; since dead. Col. C. H. Smith, First Maine Cavalry, was wounded in the
                    thigh, but refused to leave the field and retained command of his regiment until
                    the close of the action. Col. P. Huey, Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, was
                    captured. </p>
                <p>To the officers of my staff--Capt. H. M. Hughes, assistant inspector-general;
                    Lieut. John B. Maitland, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieut. R. J. Phipps,
                    acting ordnance officer; Lieut. Heald, provost-marshal, and Lieut.'s Mattson and
                    Cutler --I am indebted for most valuable assistance in carrying orders and
                    keeping me advised of the operations along a line too extended for personal
                    supervision. Lieut. John B. Maitland has been performing the duties of acting
                    assistant adjutant-general since February, 1863, and deserves and should obtain
                    promotion as assistant adjutant-general of volunteers, not only for his ability,
                    but for gallantry in action.</p>

                    already been furnished.</p>
