<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In January, 1863, the Army of the Potomac again went in motion toward the
                    Rappahannock River line. Robert E. Lee reports to Jefferson Davis on these
                    developments. He suggests moving some troops from Staunton to meet the
                threat.</p>

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> President of the
                        Confederate States:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 23, 1863.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>Appearances now indicate that the enemy intend to advance. They seem to be moving
                    to the line of the Rappahannock. They have shown themselves opposite Port Royal.
                    Our scouts also report the preparation of bridges on Mr. I Seddon's farm, to
                    which point they are conveying their pontoons and artillery. In addition to the
                    force reported near the mouth of the Rapidan, consisting of cavalry, with twelve
                    pieces of artillery, marching up the White Ridge road. No infantry was seen.
                    This last named force may be intended to join hands with Gen. Milroy, in the
                    Shenandoah Valley, who has abandoned Moorefield and the South Branch of the
                    Potomac, and has his advance at Front Royal.</p>
<p>Lieut. Smith, of the "Black Horse Cavalry," also reports that the portion of the
                    Federal Army near Alexandria, presumed to be Gen. Slocum's command, crossed the
                    Wolf Run Shoals on the 19th, and resumed its march on the 20th in the direction
                    of Dumfries or Fredericksburg, moving as rapidly as possible, with a large train
                    of wagons.</p>
<p>It looks as if they intended to concentrate all their forces, and make a vigorous
                    effort to drive us from our position. The storm of yesterday and the day before
                    will prove unfavorable for their advance, as the roads have become heavy and the
                    streams swollen. It will also operate unfavorable to our rapid concentration to
                    oppose them at the point they may select.</p>
<p>I have requested Gen. Cooper to direct all men and officers belonging to this
                    army now in Richmond without authority, to return to their posts. I have also
                    directed Gen. W. E. Jones, should Gen. Milroy cross the Blue Ridge, to follow
                    with his whole force and unite with Gen. Hampton.</p>
<p>If there are any available troops about Staunton or Richmond, it will be well to
                    advance them toward this line.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient servant.</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
