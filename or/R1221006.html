<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General William W. Loring reports to Confederate Assistant Adjutant General
                    George Deas on the July, 1861, strategic situation in western Virginia. Staunton
                    served as an important arrival point for Confederates sent to the front early in
                    the war as evidenced by Loring's reports of various regiments entering the
                town.</p>

<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS,<br> Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the
                        Forces, Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>Monterey, Va.,</p>
<p>July 28, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the troops
                    on this line since my arrival:</p>
<p>We occupy (with one regiment of infantry and two pieces of artillery, with two
                    regiments of infantry at the base of the mountain) the pass in the Alleghany
                    Mountains in front of this place. The enemy, with about the same force, hold the
                    strong pass in the Cheat Mountain, distant from our position about eighteen
                    miles. From the best information which we can obtain, they are at several points
                    between the Cheat Pass and Beverly, distant about twenty-three miles. Before my
                    arrival Gen. Jackson had marched a force to occupy the passes on the
                    Huntersville and Huttonsville turnpike.</p>
<p>On yesterday Col. Lee's regiment of North Carolina volunteers was at the base of
                    Elk Mountain, eleven miles in advance of Huntersville, and will soon be in
                    position at the Elk Mountain Pass. The Bath Cavalry were still farther advanced,
                    at the Big Spring, twenty-eight miles from Huntersville.</p>
<p>Col. Gilham, with two regiments, on yesterday at Huntersville will join Col. Lee
                    as soon as he can get necessary supplies, which were en route for him from the
                    depot recently established at Millborough.</p>
<p>About two hundred and fifty of the Pocahontas militia have been mustered into
                    service. Eighty of them are now organized as spies and guides, and are watching
                    closely all of the mountain roads, passes, and paths in the direction of the
                    enemy. Capt. Marye's battery probably arrived at Huntersville to-day, and join
                    Col. Lee without delay.</p>
<p>The re-enforcements arrive very slowly. Two of the Tennessee regiments arrived at
                    Staunton on yesterday, and the third was expected to reach there to-day. Nothing
                    has been heard of Gens. Floyd's and Wise's brigades, or of the two Georgia
                    regiments of infantry, or the Georgia battery.</p>
<p>The very strong pass in the Cheat Mountain cannot be turned near by; but, as soon
                    as I can concentrate the forces, will advance upon the enemy from the other
                    quarter.</p>
<p>There is said to be a strong position in advance of the Alleghany Pass, at
                    Yeager's, near the crossing of the Greenbrier River. A reconnaissance is being
                    made to-day, with a view of advancing upon it.</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that the forces of the enemy have been reduced recently,
                    and I will move against him as soon as it will be proper to do so.</p>
<p>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
