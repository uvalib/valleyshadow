<p>Maj. WILLIAM RUSSELL, Jr.,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Camp Averell, Va.,</p>
<p>March 12, 1865.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that on the 9th of March I received a detail from
                    headquarters Second Cavalry Division, Middle Military Division, to take charge
                    of a detail of 530 men--430 from First Brigade, Second Cavalry Division, and 100
                    Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry. Pursuant to instructions from Gen. Torbert I
                    proceeded with my command to Woodstock and bivouacked. Took up the line of march
                    at 6 a.m. and reached Edenburg at 8 a.m. Crossed the bridge and moved to within
                    three miles of Mount Jackson, found no enemy in force, and learned there was
                    none this side of Staunton, where Gen. Rosser's command was assembling. I
                    returned by the Back road, picked up ten prisoners and three deserters, viz:
                    William B. Crawford, Company B, Second Foreign Battalion; William D. Stout,
                    clerk in hospital at Staunton, and J. H. Slasher, hospital steward, general
                    hospital, Harrisonburg. They all report Gen. Sheridan will cross the James
                    River, and on his way to join Gen. Grant's army. There was quite a number of
                    rumors, both regarding Gen. Sheridan and Gen. Sherman, to the effect that Gen.
                    Sheridan had been repulsed at Gordonsville, losing 1,500 prisoners, and again,
                    that was contradicted, and asserted that Gen. Sheridan had captured two railroad
                    trains, one having on board 500 paroled prisoners, which he released--the other
                    had 1,800 exchanged prisoners. The trains were burned; also, nearly all the
                    bridges on the Virginia Central Railroad from Charlottesville to Lynchburg.
                    Putting all information and rumors together, I judged that Gen. Sheridan crossed
                    the James River at Scottsville and was going, when last heard from in the
                    direction of Burkeville. It was rumored that Gen. Sherman had been defeated,
                    losing 20,000 prisoners--however, the rebels themselves did not credit the
                    report, but hoped it was true. On my return I bivouacked at Strasburg the night
                    of the 11th of March. Marched the next morning and reached Winchester about 1
                    p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>I have no casualties to report. Two horses were wounded at Edenburg by some party
                    who fired on the rear guard. Two men who fell out of the column to get a horse
                    shod were picked up by the rebels, their arms and horses taken from them, and
                    then released. I left one wounded rebel on the road. One of my men was wounded
                    accidentally.</p>
<p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>CHAS. G. OTIS,<br> Maj., Cmdg. Twenty-first New York Cavalry.</p>
