<p>Maj.-Gen. McCLELLAN:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C.,</p>
<p>October 7, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cox's division must go west at once. Couch's (Peck's) division is at Yorktown and
                    Suffolk. The Manassas Gap road can be repaired in a few days. The Leesburg road
                    is much more injured. Your army can reach the former in less time than would be
                    required to repair the latter. The troops to be sent you will be partly new and
                    partly old-mostly new.</p>
<p>Our scouts report the enemy in force at Mount Jackson, Sperryville, and
                    Warrenton, his artillery and heavy baggage moving to Staunton.</p>
<p>McAlester can be sent in Comstock's place, but must go at once.</p>
<p>The Governor of New York wishes a list of officers, non-commissioned officers,
                    and privates, to fill vacancies. He will also call in a few days for officers to
                    take charge of drafted men, to fill old regiments. Have lists made of those who
                    can be spared for that purpose. Gen. Seymour has leave.</p>
<p></p>
