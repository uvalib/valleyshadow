<p>Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>May 13, 1862</p>
<p>DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>I have been in conference several hours with the not succeeded in procuring much
					information, yet I conclude to send you a courier and give such information as
					they furnished.</p>
<p>There is ten day's rations now in Richmond for about 70,000 men. He proposes to
					send off at once to Burkeville Junction, Southside and Danville roads, and
					Ashland, on Fredericksburg road, a part of this supply. He has at Lynchburg,
					5,000,000 of rations that can be placed at any point on either side of James
					River south and west of Richmond as fast as cars can take it. He expects to get
					10,000 head of cattle from the valley division within our reach very soon. In
					fine, he says that there is no trouble about feeding your army for ninety days,
					if you will indicate where your line will be south and west of Richmond in case
					we should be forced to give up the city.</p>
<p>Col. Northrop don't know anything about the supply about Staunton. Ewell and
					Jackson are supplied from the country about them. In addition to your army, he
					says 20,000 rations are issued here. The army south of James River does not draw
					from her, and will not at present, provided they saved the supply at Norfolk.</p>
<p>Col. Northrop insists, if you can reoccupy Northern Virginia and the Potomac
					about Loudoun, that 100,000 men can be supplied from that country. This I doubt.</p>
<p>I am to talk with the flour and bacon merchants to-night, and will be able to
					give you better data to-morrow. I will follow the thing up, although I find Col.
					Northrop very much disinclined to give information; he seems to consider it his
					patent article.</p>
<p>The gunboats (five) were at City Point at 11 a. m. to-day, making soundings and
					surveying.</p>
<p>In haste, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. H. COLE,<br> Maj., C. S. P. A.</p>
