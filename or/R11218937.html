<p><b>Summary:<br></b>By August, 1862, actions in the Shenandoah Valley had quieted. In this letter,
                    Confederate Provost Marshall, W. Skeer, writes to the Secretary of War
                    concerning replacement of a burned bridge on the Cow Pasture River. Loss of the
                    bridge disrupted all rail traffic on the Virginia Central west of Staunton.</p>

<p>SECRETARY OF WAR:</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 20, 1862. (Received August 25, 1862.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>On May 18 last the Yankees burned the bridge across the Cow Pasture River, since
                    which time trains have ceased to run on the Virginia Central Railroad west of
                    Staunton. As the attorney of the company I have urged the rebuilding of the
                    bridge at once, but the company declines, not knowing what the fortunes of war
                    may be or how soon the bridge, if built, may be destroyed again. The Yankees
                    have fallen back from Meadow Bluff beyond the Sewells, and the Government must
                    drive them beyond the Kanawha Salt-Works, as it is indispensable to us to have
                    the salt; and, if so, the very sinews of our strength, the very arteries of the
                    existence of our army when it moves from Monroe to Greenbrier, on the Kanawha
                    road, is the Central Railroad, for the Government has just completed and put in
                    good order the road from River Depot to Lewisburg; the Yankees have from
                    Lewisburg to Gauley. I have seen the engineer of the Central, who says that a
                    good temporary bridge can be put up in one month, and I write to advise that you
                    order it at once. If you think the advice is of a doubtful character, then, with
                    the maps of the State before you, I am content for you to decide it.</p>
<p>I am, truly,</p>
<p>W. SKEER,<br> Provost-Marshal of Alleghany and Cmdg. Post at Covington.</p>
