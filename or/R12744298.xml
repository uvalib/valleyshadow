                <p>In this July 4, 1863, dispatch, Robert E. Lee reports to Jefferson Davis on the
                    battle of Gettysburg. He discusses both the lead-up to the battle and its
                    results. He mentions that portions of his army passed through Chambersburg on
                    the way to Gettysburg.</p>

                <p>After the rear of the army had crossed the Potomac, the leading corps, under Gen.
                    Ewell, pushed on to Carlisle and York, passing through Chambersburg. The other
                    two corps closed up at the latter place, and soon afterward intelligence was
                    received that the army of Gen. Hooker was advancing. Our whole force was
                    directed to concentrate at Gettysburg, and the corps of Gen.'s Ewell and A. P.
                    Hill reached that place on the 1st July, the former advancing from Carlisle and
                    the latter from Chambersburg. The two leading divisions of these corps, upon
                    reaching the vicinity of Gettysburg, found the enemy, and attacked him, driving
                    him from the town, which was occupied by our troops. The enemy's loss was heavy,
                    including more than 4,000 prisoners. He took up a strong position in rear of the
                    town, which he immediately began to fortify, and where his re-enforcements
                    joined him.</p>
                <p>On the 2d July, Longstreet's corps, with the exception of one division, having
                    arrived, we attempted to dislodge the enemy, and, though we gained some ground,
                    we were unable to get possession of his position. The next day, the third
                    division of Gen. Longstreet having come up, a more extensive attack was made.
                    The works on the enemy's extreme right and left were taken, but his numbers were
                    so great and his position so commanding, that our troops were compelled to
                    relinquish their advantage and retire.</p>
                <p>It is believed that the enemy suffered severely in these operations, but our own
                    loss has not been light.</p>
                <p>Gen. Barksdale is killed. Gen.'s Garnett and Armistead are missing, and it is
                    feared that the former is killed and the latter wounded and a prisoner. Gen.'s
                    Pender and Trimble are wounded in the leg, Gen. Hood in the arm, and Gen. Heth
                    slightly in the head. Gen. Kemper, it is feared, is mortally wounded. Our losses
                    embrace many other valuable officers and men.</p>
                <p>Gen. Wade Hampton was severely wounded in a different action in which the cavalry
                    was engaged yesterday.</p>
