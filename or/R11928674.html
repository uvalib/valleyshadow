<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee writes to H. M. Bell, quartermaster at Staunton, concerning
                    October, 1862, production of clothing and leather goods in Staunton, VA, for the
                    army.</p>

<p>Maj. H. M. BELL, Acting Quartermaster. Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 21, 1862.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 19th, inclosing copy of note from Maj. F. A. Briscoe, has been
                    received. Maj. Briscoe misunderstood the orders of Col. Corley. They referred
                    only to such articles as were not required at Staunton. All the cloth that you
                    can manufacture into clothing at Staunton for the army I desire you shall
                    retain, and that you will use every effort to obtain cloth in Northern and
                    Northwestern Virginia for that purpose. I have directed Col. Imboden, in his
                    operations in Hardy and Hampshire Counties, to collect all the leather that can
                    be obtained in those counties and forward it toward Staunton. The difficulty
                    with him is to obtain transportation, but I hope he will be able to transport it
                    beyond the reach of the enemy, so that you may be able to secure it. Col. Corley
                    has corrected the misapprehension of Maj. Briscoe in reference to the forwarding
                    of stores, &amp;c., from Staunton to Richmond.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
