<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General George Meade writes to General in Chief Henry Halleck to report
                    rumors about General Averell's raid into West Virginia and the Shenandoah
                    Valley. Meade tells Halleck that he has heard that Averell entered the important
                    rail center of Staunton, burned the depot, and damaged the railroad.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK:</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 21, 1863--1 p. m.<br> (Received 2 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Scouts just in, state it was reported at Orange Court-House that Averell had been
                    into Staunton, burning the depot and doing other damage to the railroad, and
                    that he had beaten Imboden and Jenkins. On receipt of this intelligence,
                    Fitzhugh Lee's and Wickham's brigades of cavalry, with seven batteries of
                    artillery, were sent to Albemarle County; they were traced as far as Stony
                    Point, and are believed to have gone to Staunton. No other movements of troops
                    reported; rebel soldiers said it was expected Longstreet would return to Lee's
                    army.</p>
