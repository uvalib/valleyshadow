<p>Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.</p>
<p>Cold Harbor, Va.,</p>
<p>June 9, 1864--noon. (Received 1.30 p.m., 10th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I subjoin a communication just send in from Col. Sharpe, deputy
                    provost-marshal-general, to chief of staff, Army of the Potomac: Among prisoners
                    sent in during the night we have a German refugee from Richmond, a man of weak
                    intellect and not intelligent. His statements, as far as they go, are made with
                    apparent truth and simplicity. He left Richmond on the Brook pike Monday
                    morning, passing Yellow Tavern, thence out, say 15 miles, from Richmond, when he
                    bent his course to the right and came into our cavalry. His statements regarding
                    the condition of the city, absence of troops there, closing of departments and
                    stores, location of the reserve supplies of pork and flour, influx of citizens
                    from the part of the State north of Richmond, of the capture of Staunton, and
                    death of the general commanding there, failure of provisions during time
                    Petersburg and Danville road was lately held or cut by us, are substantially the
                    same as information received from refugee a few days ago, and reported with that
                    received yesterday concerning Hunter. This man in passing up the Brook pike
                    passed no troops after leaving the immediate defenses of Richmond. We have also
                    3 men from Ransom's (North Carolina) brigade (lately belonging to Beauregard's
                    command), who have come to our lines with the avowed purpose of availing
                    themselves of the President's proclamation. One of them is a sergeant, and a man
                    of considerable intelligence. Ransom's brigade came from the Bluff on the 4th
                    instant, passed to the right of Bridge, on the Chickahominy. On arriving there
                    it relieved the Richmond City battalion, which was understood to return within
                    the line of the city defenses. Ransom's brigade consists of five regiments,
                    which has not seen hard service since it left Lee's army in January, 1863, and
                    averages 450 to 500 men to the regiment. Sergeant estimates the brigade at
                    3,000. He knows of Hoke's division (formerly Whiting's) having joined Lee before
                    his brigade left Beauregard. He says it was understood when Ransom left that but
                    one division, of three or four brigades (he does not know which), was left in
                    front of Gen. Butler. He heard his officers generally talk about it, and express
                    themselves to that effect. It is a division known as Bushrod Johnson's. Below
                    position now occupied by Ransom's brigade he says there is nothing but cavalry.
                    Fitzhugh Lee's division is represented to be about 2,500 strong. What above
                    Ransom's he cannot tell. Says during time Butler occupied railroad there was
                    failure of meat in the issues to troops, and great scarcity of flour.</p>
<p>Principal facts stated above are confirmed by various other evidence, and are
                    most probably correct.</p>
