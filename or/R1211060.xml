                <p>I have received your letter of the 10th instant. The disposition of the troops
                    that you stated appears to be judicious, and, as the enemy cannot attack all
                    points at one time, from many of the points mentioned the troops could be
                    concentrated upon where an assault should be made. As regards Wilmington, troops
                    from South Carolina could be thrown there upon an emergency, and recalled to
                    their position when no longer required. But I have been in hopes that North
                    Carolina would turn out all the troops within her borders at this time, and
                    which could operate to such advantage on her frontier. I think that if you will
                    write to Gen. Martin, he will make an effort to have this done.</p>
                <p>I wrote to the honorable Secretary of War some days since that the Confederate
                    troops in Western Virginia could, I thought, be drawn to Staunton, whence they
                    could be used in the vicinity of Richmond, if not wanted in the Shenandoah
                    Valley. I have heard of Milory's retiring in the direction of the Baltimore and
                    Ohio Railroad, of the troops that had been at New Creek moving down to
                    Martinsburg, and of Slocum's division left Harper's Ferry for Washington. Our
                    scouts reported yesterday some transports having arrived at Aquia Creek,
                    probably with these troops. I have had no confirmation of the report that Cox's
                    division had left the Kanawha Valley. I am glad that you have ascertained that
                    the force in the vicinity of Suffolk is not so large as formerly reported. You
                    will have heard that the enemy succeeded last evening in occupying
                    Fredericksburg. We hold the hills around the town; I shall try and do them all
                    the damage in our power when they move forward. I believe Gen. Burnside's whole
                    army is at this point.</p>
