<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General William Loring writes from Staunton to Adjutant General
                    Samuel Cooper in December, 1861, to discuss the movement of troops, sick men,
                    and supplies. He asks that the Virginia Central Railroad furnish cars for his
                    project.</p>

<p>HDQRS. NORTHWESTERN ARMY,</p>
<p>Gen. S. COOPER, Adjutant-Gen., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>December 9, 1861.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I am moving the sick, supplies, &amp;c., as rapidly as possible to the rear,
                    and will in a few days commence the movement of troops on the Millborough line.
                    I respectfully ask that the Central Railroad from Millborough here be directed
                    to furnish an engine, eight cars, and two flats, to facilitate at once the
                    movement of munitions, &amp;c. We are in great need of them. The necessity
                    for the rapid movement of the command from here requires the use of the rail
                    through to Strasburg. I am unable to say to-day precisely when; it is probable
                    about the 16th of the month. I write in order to know whether we shall be
                    furnished or not.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
