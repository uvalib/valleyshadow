<p>August 15, 1862</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Before the brigade became engaged in the battle of Cedar Run, on Saturday, the
                    9th, Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder was mortally wounded, whereupon the command
                    devolved on me. In obedience to your order, therefore, I have the honor to
                    submit the following report of the part taken by the First Brigade in the battle
                    of Cedar Run, Culpeper County, on the 9th instant:</p>
<p>The following regiments constitute the brigade: The Fifth, Second, Fourth,
                    Thirty-third, and Twenty-seventh Virginia, commanded on this occasion as
                    follows: The Fifth by Maj. Williams, the Second by Lieut. Col. Lawson Botts, the
                    Fourth by Lieut. Col. R.D. Gardner, the Thirty-third by Lieut. Col. Edwin G.
                    Lee, and the Twenty-seventh by Capt. Charles L. Haynes. Capts. Carpenter's and
                    Poague's batteries are attached.</p>
<p>The brigade bivouacked on the night of the 8th in Madison County on the road
                    leading to Culpeper Court-House and about 1 mile from Madison Mills, on the
                    Rapidan River.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th the brigade took up the line of march in the direction
                    of Culpeper Court-House. The march was frequently interrupted from causes
                    unknown to me at the time, and at 3.15 p.m. the brigade was halted in the woods
                    a short distance to the left of the road. At this time cannonading was going on
                    in front. Here several Parrott guns from Capts. Poague's and Carpenter's
                    batteries were ordered to the front; these were posted in the road so as to
                    enfilade the enemy's batteries then engaging our batteries on the right. Gen.
                    Winder was in front, directing with great ability and judgment the movements of
                    the batteries. These batteries in a short time succeeded in driving the enemy's
                    guns from their chosen position, after which Capts. Poague and Carpenter were
                    directed to take position in a corn field on the right of the road, when they
                    opened a rapid fire upon the enemy's guns and soon silenced several of them.
                    Shortly after this Gen. Winder was mortally wounded and borne from the field,
                    the brigade still resting where it was halted at 3.15 o'clock.</p>
<p>A little after 1 p.m. I was ordered to put the brigade in line of battle
                    perpendicular to the road and move forward, the line having been arranged in the
                    following order, viz: Twenty-seventh on the right, the Thirty-third on the left
                    of the Twenty-seventh, Fifth left of the Thirty-third Second left of the Fifth,
                    and the Fourth left of the Second. I moved forward through the woods, but in a
                    few minutes I was ordered to put the brigade in column of regiments, which order
                    was executed promptly; but before advancing the column I was ordered to deploy
                    the column and advance in line of battle, letting the right rest about 100 yards
                    from the road. The line of battle being thus re-established, I moved forward
                    through the woods under a heavy fire of spherical case and canister shot from
                    the enemy's guns. Arriving at a fence that partly inclosed an open field I
                    halted the brigade and sent Capt. John H. Fulton, acting aide, to inform Gen.
                    Taliaferro of my position and to receive his order. Capt. Fulton returned,
                    stating that the general directed me to move on. I put the brigade in motion and
                    rode some 200 yards in advance in order to gain the top of the hill, from which
                    I supposed I could have a good view. Arriving at the top of the hill I observed
                    the enemy about 300 yards distant advancing in line of battle, when I
                    immediately rode back to the brigade, which had advanced to within 400 yards of
                    the enemy and in view of each other. This brigade then opened fire upon the
                    enemy, and having discharged several volleys, which seemed to confuse him, I
                    immediately ordered the brigade to charge, which order was promptly executed and
                    with fine effect, the enemy falling back in great confusion, leaving many of his
                    dead and wounded upon the field. Arriving at the woods in his retreat the enemy
                    attempted to reform his line, which I determined to prevent by following him up;
                    but at this moment I was informed that the enemy had turned the left of the
                    Second Brigade (would I supposed, until that moment, rested on the right of the
                    First Brigade), whereupon I immediately directed a change of front, which was
                    done as promptly as it could be under the circumstances, which enabled me to
                    engage this flank movement of the enemy; but Gen. Branch's brigade coming up at
                    this moment (his line being perpendicular to the road while the line of the
                    First Brigade was parallel), Gen. Branch opened a vigorous fire upon the enemy,
                    which soon succeeded in driving him from his position. He was here compelled to
                    pass through a large grain field in his retreat, which exposed his broken
                    columns to a deadly cross-fire from Branch's and this brigade.</p>
<p>About sundown Gen. Pender's (I think it was) brigade appeared on the extreme left
                    of the open field I first entered. He continued his march by the flank until his
                    right reached the northeast corner of the field, when I sent Capt. Fulton to
                    inform him that the enemy were in the woods to his right. He then continued his
                    march for some distance, and then put his brigade in line of battle, his right
                    resting on the left of the First Brigade, and then the whole line advanced in
                    the direction of the main road. Very shortly after this connection was formed a
                    short but very vigorous contest ensued, which succeeded in completely routing
                    the enemy. It is proper here to state that the enemy engaged in the woods at
                    this point is the same column whose reformation of line I attempted to prevent
                    when informed that the left flank of the Second Brigade had been turned. Here
                    the enemy's loss was very heavy. This brigade pursued the now retreating foe
                    until after dark, when I was ordered to halt and rest for the night.</p>
<p>The conduct of the troops in this brigade was, indeed, splendid. Men never
                    behaved better in battle. Regimental commanders were conspicuous for their
                    gallantry, and company officers deserve great praise, not only for their
                    gallantry, but for their successful efforts in keeping their companies together;
                    indeed, when the brigade the brigade was halted for the night nearly all were
                    present.</p>
<p>The brigade captured three stand of colors, one of which was improperly taken
                    from a private of the ---th Regiment by a commissioned officer, of some other
                    command. Two stand of colors were taken by the Fifth Regiment.</p>
<p>For individual acts of gallantry I refer you to the reports of regimental and
                    battery commanders herewith presented.</p>
<p>Upon assuming command, Capt. John H. Fulton, of the Fourth Regiment, and Maj.
                    Holliday, of the Thirty-third Regiment, kindly consented to act as aides in
                    connection with Lieut. Garnett, of Gen. Winder's staff, and to these gentlemen I
                    am much indebted for their valuable services. Capt. Fulton was conspicuous in
                    the fight, transmitting every order with great promptness and dispatch. Maj.
                    Holliday, a gallant and brave man, while in the execution of an order, was
                    severely wounded in the right arm, rendering amputation necessary. He was
                    wounded early in the engagement. Lieut. Garnett was active in the field, and his
                    gallantry was conspicuous. With the aid these gentlemen rendered me upon the
                    field my new position as brigade commander was relieved of much embarrassment.</p>
<p>Capts. Carpenter and Poague are deserving of especial notice for the great
                    service they rendered with their batteries. Capt. Carpenter was wounded by a
                    Minie ball in the head, though I think not severely.</p>
<p>The casualties in the brigade were 10 killed and 51 wounded. This includes Gen.
                    Winder, and in his death the brigade was deprived of his great services, the
                    army of an able and accomplished officer, the country of a good citizen, and
                    society of an ornament. I attribute so few casualties to the fact that the
                    brigade charged at the proper time. For a list of casualties see reports of
                    regimental and battery commanders.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> CHS. A. RONALD, <br> Col., Commanding First Brigade. </p>
