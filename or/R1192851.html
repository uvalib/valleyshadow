<p>Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,<br> Secretary of War, Richmond,
                        Va</p>
<p>HDQRS. ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,</p>
<p>October 14, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>The expedition, under Gen. Stuart, to Pennsylvania, which crossed the Potomac on
                    the evening of the 9th instant at McCoy's Ford, above Williamsport, will reach
                    their camp to-day. They proceed through Mercersburg to Chambersburg, where they
                    obtained from the United States store-houses such supplies as needed, but were
                    unable to destroy the railroad bridge over the Conococheague in consequence of
                    it being of iron. The shops, &amp;c., of company were, however, destroyed.
                    Thence he proceeded to Emmittsburg, through Liberty, New Market, Hyattstown,
                    Barnesville, to White's Ford, below the mouth of the Monocacy, making a complete
                    circuit of the enemy's position. On approaching the Potomac he was opposed by
                    the enemy's cavalry, under Gen. Stoneman, but drove them back, and put to flight
                    the infantry stationed on the bluff at White's Ford to guard the passage.</p>
<p>His expedition was eminently successful, and accomplished without other loss than
                    the wounding of 1 man. He obtained many remounts for his cavalry, and deserves
                    much credit for his prudence and enterprise.</p>
<p>From the information he was able to obtain, I am inclined to believe that Gen.
                    McClellan has detached no part of his army eastward, but, on the contrary, has
                    been receiving re-enforcements. His main army is posted west of the Blue Ridge
                    range, and stretches from Hagerstown to Rockville, the center resting at
                    Harper's Ferry, with detachments guarding the river. They have a large force
                    repairing the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and I should judge from all I can learn
                    that the operation of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Harper's Ferry west
                    is viewed by them as an object of great importance, and that efforts will be
                    made to repair it. I am breaking up the Harper's Ferry and Winchester Railroad
                    to increase the obstacles to their advance up the Shenandoah Valley. The iron
                    would be very useful to the roads farther south, and the flat iron might be used
                    for Government purposes, but I have no means of sending it away.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
