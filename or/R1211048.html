<p>Col. J. GORGAS,<br> Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 5, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have written to the Secretary of War, urging upon him the advantages of
                    improving our field artillery, and have recommended, as being in my opinion the
                    best guns for the purpose, the 12-pounder Napoleon, the 10-pounder Parrott, and
                    the approved 3-inch rifle. I have also recommended, should metal be wanted for
                    the Napoleon guns, that our bronze 6-pounder smooth-bores and even our bronze
                    12-pounder howitzers, if necessary, should be recast. This would much simplify
                    our field ammunition, save horses, and place our batteries more nearly on an
                    equality with those of the enemy.</p>
<p>By taking the guns sent back to Staunton by me when in the valley, to commence
                    upon, Napoleons could be substituted for the 6-pounder now in service, and their
                    metal in turn be used. In this way the batteries in service could be kept up,
                    and their improvement gradually be made. I desire immediately, for a particular
                    purpose, four Napoleon guns, which I request that you will send me as soon as
                    possible. I believe that but few of those manufactured in Richmond have been
                    issued to this army, and nearly all that it possesses have been captured from
                    the enemy. Some heavier and longer range guns, namely, some 20 and 30 pounder
                    Parrotts, should be manufactured and placed on siege carriages.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
