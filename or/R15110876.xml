                <p>Early in the war, Staunton, VA, served as an important rendezvous point for newly
                    recruited Confederate regiments. In this May, 1861, letter, Confederate General
                    John Echols writes to Robert E. Lee informing him of recruiting efforts in the
                    Shenandoah Valley, and his orders to send all new troops to Staunton for
                    training.</p>

                <p>I received at noon to-day your order authorizing me to call for two regiments of
                    infantry and rifle volunteer companies. The order was received by me at my home
                    in Monroe County, and I have ordered out one infantry company from Monroe
                    County, two rifle companies from this county, and three companies from Allegheny
                    County, which will reach Staunton on the 15th instant. I have also dispatched
                    orders to the colonels of regiments in the counties of Pendleton, Bath,
                    Highland, and Pocahontas, instructing them to order any volunteer infantry or
                    rifle companies in their county to report to me at Staunton on the 15th. I shall
                    reach Staunton on that day with the troops from Greenbrier, Monroe, and
                    Allegheny, that being the earliest day upon which I can get transportation. As
                    soon as I reach Staunton I will order out a sufficient number of additional
                    companies from Augusta and Rockbridge to make up the two regiments. I would
                    suggest the propriety of having drill officers in Staunton to instruct these
                    troops, many of whom are entirely raw. I have instructed some of the companies
                    of mountain men to bring with them their country rifles. Upon my arrival in
                    Staunton I will report to you the number of troops reported and mustered into
                    service, their arms, condition, &amp;c.</p>
