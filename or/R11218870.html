<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this April, 1862, letter, Confederate Assistant Adjutant General W. H. Taylor
                    suggests that General Henry Heth move his troops to Staunton to reinforce
                    operations in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Brig. Gen. HENRY HETH,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Lewisburg, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>April 27, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>From the reports which have reached him Gen. Lee is led to believe that nearly
                    all of the Federal Army has retired from your front, and indeed from Western
                    Virginia. He directs me to request you to make an early report of the state of
                    affairs in your department, giving, as nearly as you can, the force and position
                    of the enemy opposed to you, your own strength, and your views as to whether it
                    would not be expedient and more desirable to move a part or the whole of your
                    army toward Staunton, for the purpose of re-enforcing the army operating in the
                    valley. Of course it would not do to leave the Virginia Central and Virginia and
                    Tennessee Railroads entirely unprotected, but if the enemy is as weak and quiet
                    in the Kanawha as he is represented, a sufficient guard could be detailed from
                    your command to protect the roads, and still leave a force which would
                    materially strengthen the Army of the Valley, and with other re-enforcements
                    enable it perhaps to act on the offensive. On the 16th instant instructions were
                    sent to Col. W. E. Peters, Forty-fifth Virginia Regiment, to collect his
                    regiment and repair to Knoxville for duty under Gen. Kirby Smith. This was done
                    under the impression that the Forty-fifth Regt. constituted a part of the Floyd
                    Brigade, all of which it was understood had been furloughed. By a letter
                    received from Col. Peters this morning it is ascertained that he is on duty with
                    his regiment under your command, and he has been instructed to continue in the
                    position assigned him by you until further orders.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. H. TAYLOR,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
