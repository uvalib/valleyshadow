<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Christopher Auger reports to General Charles Morgan in April, 1865,
                    on information gathered from a deserter from Staunton. The Confederate deserter
                    gave Auger information on troop movements around Staunton.</p>

<p>Gen. MORGAN,<br> Hdqrs. Middle Military Division,
                        Winchester:</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.,</p>
<p>April 2, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rebel deserter is now here. He says he left Staunton, to-morrow will be a
                    week. There were but two companies there. He afterward saw a courier who told
                    him that Pickett's division was on its way to Staunton from Lynchburg. He
                    reports Rosser as having gone to Lee with his own and McCausland's divisions of
                    cavalry, and that Lomax, with Imboden's and Jackson's brigades, were to reoccupy
                    the Valley with what there is left of Early's infantry. He states the men are
                    through the Valley now collecting all men on leave. He is a young Irish boy,
                    apparently not very intelligent. It is only from the courier that he knows
                    anything of Pickett's division. His report does not impress me as being very
                    important. He brought his horse and equipments.</p>
