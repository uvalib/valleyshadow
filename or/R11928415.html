<p>Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN:</p>
<p></p>
<p>OCTOBER 12, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>President Garrett asks us to furnish timber to reconstruct the Harper's Ferry
                    Bridge. I will order an examination to determine what timber we have that can be
                    spared, and will place it at his disposal. The rebels are taking up the rails on
                    the railroad between Bristoe and Warrenton, and are carrying them off with two
                    engines captured from us. I reported this fact last night, and orders have been
                    given to send out troops to occupy the road, and we will commence to-morrow
                    morning to reconstruct it. Appearances would indicate a disposition on the part
                    of the rebels to abandon the Orange and Alexandria Railroad south of Manassas,
                    and complete the connection between Staunton and Winchester or Mount Jackson by
                    using the rails taken up on the other roads, for that purpose. The
                    reconstruction of the Harper's Ferry Bridge will require some time, as the
                    remains of the old structure will be very difficult of removal, chiefly of
                    wrought iron, strongly riveted together Trestles may be swept away at any time
                    by freshest. It would seem to be necessary to construct a wagon bridge for
                    present use, and unload stores on the opposite side of the river.</p>
