                <p>Union General Darius Couch, commanding the department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, writes Assistant Adjutant Edward D. Townsend in January, 1864,
                    regarding militia troops mustered to help defend Pennsylvania during the
                    Gettysburg campaign. Couch discusses which units refused to be subsequently
                    mustered into Federal service.</p>

                <p>I have the honor to report the following in reference to your letter of the 27th
                    instant, directing me to furnish, for the information of the Secretary of War,
                    what troops called out by the Governor of the State during the recent invasion
                    refused to be mustered into the United States service. The Gray Reserves, a
                    Philadelphia regiment, refused to be mustered either for six months or for the
                    existing emergency; they were afterward mustered into State service as the
                    Thirty-second Regt. Militia. The City Troop--a horse company from
                    Philadelphia--reported for service; demanded no pay; would not be mustered. This
                    company scouted at or beyond Gettysburg. Capt. Spear's company of policemen, of
                    Philadelphia, as well as Col. Mann's company, from the same place, were to the
                    best of my knowledge not mustered. Am under the impression that they were never
                    asked to be, either in State or United States service.</p>
                <p>From the 15th to the 26th of June, the latter being the date of the Governor's
                    proclamation calling out the militia for State service, some thousands of those
                    assembled at different rendezvous must have returned to their homes. They were
                    unorganized masses. A hundred excuses were given by those who returned. It is
                    somewhat singular, or would seem so to one not present in the State at that
                    time, that there was a general impression among the militia that, if sworn into
                    the United States service, they would be retained for any length of time. Lying,
                    disloyal people were the authors of this mischief.</p>
                <p>This letter should have been written sooner, but I was unable to do so.</p>
