<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Franz Sigel forwards U. S. Army Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas
                    intelligence gathered on March, 1864, Confederate actions in the Shenandoah
                    Valley. Sigel's sources report that Confederate troops were collecting forage
                    near Staunton in preparation for a raid into West Virginia. Troops in the
                    Staunton area moved west for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. L. THOMAS,<br> Adjt. Gen. of the Army, War
                        Dept., Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Cumberland, Md.</p>
<p>March 23, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Col. Wilkinson, commanding at Clarksburg and Bulltown, reports as follows:</p>
<p>John L. Keyvey, a deserter from Lanahan's battalion, of Fifteenth Virginia
                    (rebel) Cavalry, in which he served as ordnance sergeant, makes the following
                    statements:</p>
<p>"I think that John Righter is now in the northwest part of Harrison County
                    recruiting for the rebel army. He has about 80 men and recruiting. He crosses,
                    as a general thing, the railroad at Long Run Station, then goes by Bulltown
                    salt-works, thence through the glades to Lewisburg. He has orders to remain
                    there until the raid of Early, Jackson, Imboden, Rosser, Fitzhugh Lee, and
                    Jenkins, which is to start as soon as the roads are fit. Their destination is
                    Wheeling. They will make a feint on Beverly, while the main force, which will be
                    18,000 to 20,000, with five batteries, will march on the Northwestern turnpike.
                    They will be all mounted except Early's division, which consists of three
                    brigades of infantry. They are collecting forage at Staunton; they get it from
                    Botetourt County. I am satisfied that they will attempt the raid as soon as the
                    roads will permit. Early is to command the whole."</p>
<p>Col. Moor, commanding at Beverly, reports:</p>
<p>My scouts returned, and report that Gen.'s Echols, Jenkins, Jackson, and Rosser
                    will move on Beverly by the 1st of next month. Letters, deserters, and refugees
                    corroborate the above statement.</p>
<p>Gen. Averell, commanding cavalry at Martinsburg, reports 22d:</p>
<p>Two deserters just in report that McNeill, with 500 men, started from near
                    Staunton for the South Branch Valley about three days ago. No force in the
                    Shenandoah Valley except Imboden and three Georgia regiments. Pickets at
                    Woodstock.</p>
<p>No information of special importance from the Kanawha Valley.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. SIGEL,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
