<p>Your telegram to Gen. Ripley, saying, "If you can possibly do it, force some

                    to us, near Sharpsburg, Md.," was received between 10 and 11 o'clock last night,
                    and 2,500 rounds of this ammunition was ordered, with the least practicable

                    reach Hagerstown by noon to-day.</p>
