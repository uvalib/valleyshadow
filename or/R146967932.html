<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Wesley Merritt's Assistant Adjutant J. Spreadbury issues orders
                    from Staunton, Virginia, concerning care for the horses during a March, 1865,
                    cavalry expedition in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>March 2, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main object at this time is to preserve the horses of the command. Every
                    exertion must be made to do this. Division commanders are reminded that it is
                    impossible, under the circumstances, to issue elaborate orders to cover all
                    exigencies. Officers must use their best judgment and energies in conducting the
                    movement of the column. Every exertion must be made to procure forage for our
                    horses. This matter is paramount to every other. Officers will take unusual care
                    to prevent men from abusing their horses by galloping and trotting them when
                    unnecessary. Cmdg. officers who conduct the march of a column will move slowly,
                    accommodating the march to the character of the roads. The strength of the
                    horses of the command, as well as that of the animals of the supply train, in
                    which all have an interest, must be husbanded. It is thought that all officers
                    and men feel and will take a proper interest in these matters.</p>
<p>By command Brevet Maj.-Gen. Merritt:</p>
<p>J. SPREADBURY,<br> Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
