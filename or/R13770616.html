<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Colonel J. M. Schoonmaker writes from occupied Staunton to Captain Will
                    Rumsey on Confederate positions during the June, 1864, fighting in the
                    Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p>Capt. WILL RUMSEY,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>June 9, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>Maj. Capehart has just returned from a support to my pickets and a reconnaissance
                    as far as Fishersville. Reports having seen a very strong line of vedettes on
                    this side of the town, 200 yards in advance of it; the enemy throwing up
                    intrenchments of some light strength on the opposite side of town. He states
                    that the country is very rough and the creek thinly wooded on each side where
                    the pickets are being placed. I fear they will be very much exposed, and we will
                    lose them by detail. Would it not be better to withdraw the picket one mile this
                    side of the creek and patrol to it?</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. M. SCHOONMAKER,<br> Col., Cmdg.</p>
