<p>Maj.-Gen. HUMPHREYS,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 26, 1864</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Among prisoners just brought in we have a deserter from the Twenty-sixth Virginia
                    Battalion, Echols' brigade; left his command day before yesterday a.m. in camp
                    at Hanover Court-House, where they had just arrived from Hanover Junction.
                    Belongs to Breckinridge's force. Says they left the valley about the 18th, took
                    cars at Staunton about the 20th, and got off at Hanover Junction. Three brigades
                    in Breckinridge's command, Wharton's, Imboden's, and Echols'. Two batteries and
                    one regiment of his brigade which has always been with Sam. Jones at Greenbrier.
                    Thinks his brigade is about 1,000 strong, the other two about the same.
                    Breckinridge is there personally. Don't know whether anything is left in the
                    valley or not.</p>
<p>We have also prisoners taken day before yesterday on the skirmish line from
                    Ewell's corps, which they say is on the right of Longstreet, Rodes' division
                    being on the extreme right of their line; on that part they have two lines of
                    battle. A South Carolina man returning from furlough left Richmond on Monday in
                    a long train filled with men returning to different regiments, but no organized
                    commands. Before he left Columbia, S. C., about a week ago, Aiken's brigade of
                    cavalry was ordered to Richmond; one-half being sent forward with their horses
                    and the others given ten days' furlough to get horses and to report mounted at
                    Richmond.</p>
