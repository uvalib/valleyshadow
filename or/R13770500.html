<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Grant writes General in Chief Henry Halleck with May, 1864, plans for an
                    advance in the Valley led by General David Hunter. Grant hopes that Hunter can
                    attack Staunton and disrupt the supplies flowing to Lee on the railroad from
                    that town.</p>

<p> Maj.-Gen. HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>NEAR SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE,</p>
<p>May 20, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In regard to the operations it is better for Gen. Hunter to engage in, with the
                    disposable force at his command, I am a little in doubt. It is evident that he
                    can move south, covering the road he has to guard, with a larger force than he
                    can spare to be removed to re-enforce armies elsewhere. Then, too, under the
                    instructions of Gen. Sigel, Crook was to get through to the Virginia and
                    Tennessee Railroad, cut New River bridge, and move eastward to Lynchburg, if he
                    could; if not, to Fincastle, Staunton, and down the Shenandoah Valley. Sigel was
                    to collect what force he could spare from the railroad, and move up the Valley
                    with a supply train to meet him. The enemy are evidently relying for supplies
                    greatly on such as are brought over the branch road running through Staunton. On
                    the whole, therefore, I think it would be better for Gen. Hunter to move in that
                    direction; reach Staunton and Gordonsville, or Charlottesville, if he does not
                    meet too much opposition. If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own he will
                    be doing good service.</p>
