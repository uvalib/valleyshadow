<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Henry Lockwood reports to General Darius Couch, commanding at
                    Chambersburg, on the position of Confederate forces in the Valley in August,
                    1863.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Received 10 a. m.<br> Maj.-Gen. Couch, Chambersburg:</p>
<p>Harper's Ferry, W. Va.,</p>
<p>August 1, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kelley proposes to leave the Valley to-day or to-morrow. His departure for his
                    proper department will leave the Valley unoccupied, excepting by this garrison.
                    I submit to you if the forces at Sharpsburg should not be at Martinsburg.
                    Guerrillas are known to be in the Valley and in Loudoun County. White and Mosby
                    were at Leesburg yesterday, several hundred strong, threatening the Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad in Frederick County. There seems to be a want of co-operation
                    on our part, which enables this contemptible body of irregulars to exist,
                    notwithstanding the presence on our part of four times their force. Last night I
                    was summoned to the aid of Capt. Means, at Point of Rocks, by these forces. I am
                    confident that proper active co-operation only is required to bring them to
                    grief. Cavalry is much needed at Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>HENRY H. LOCKWOOD,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
