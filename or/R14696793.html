<p>WAYNESBOROUGH, VA.,</p>
<p>March 2, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A force to consist of one regiment from each brigade, the regiments to average
                    not less than 150 men, will move to the rear, via Staunton, to-morrow morning
                    early, with the prisoners and captures. The commanding officer of the Third
                    Division will detail a field officer, not lower in rank than a
                    lieutenant-colonel, to command this force. One of the best officers in the
                    division will be selected for this important duty. He will be ordered to report
                    to these headquarters, for special instructions, at 4 a. m. to-morrow. The
                    dismounted men of the commands will be out of the column and accompany the force
                    detailed above. Each division commander will detail a staff officer to attend to
                    the organization of the force from his command, and to see that it is properly
                    started on the march.</p>
<p>By command of Brevet Maj.-Gen. Merritt:</p>
<p>J. SPREADBURY,<br> Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
