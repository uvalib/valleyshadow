<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General John Imboden, commanding at Staunton, to
                    congratulate him on some recent successes. He also discusses November, 1863,
                    Union movements in western and northern Virginia.</p>

<p>Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg. Valley District, Staunton,
                        Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 25, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have been much gratified by the result of your recent operations, Maj. White's
                    and Capt. McNeill's.</p>
<p>The reports have been forwarded to the War Department, and I beg to tender to you
                    and to the officers and men of each command my high appreciation of their
                    services. Similar success will always attend like efforts. It is only by
                    constant watchfulness and labor that the invasion of the enemy can be prevented.</p>
<p>It is important that you impress upon you scouts the necessity of giving you
                    correct information. I think the strength of the enemy's column is always
                    greatly exaggerated. I need only refer to the number of Averell's troops and the
                    expedition said to have advanced up the Kanawha in this last expedition. Proper
                    dispositions cannot be made to repel these attacks unless the number of the
                    enemy be correctly stated.</p>
<p>From the reports of scouts, I think it probable that the army of Gen. Meade is
                    about to advance from the Rappahannock. Whether it will attempt to cross the
                    Rapidan, there is nothing now to indicate. In the event of its advance, I have
                    thought you might give material aid by sending a force east of the Blue Ridge to
                    aid Maj. Mosby to break up the railroad north of the Rappahannock and interrupt
                    its communications. Maj. Gilmor's battalion could at least operate
                    advantageously in that way. I will telegraph you if an advance of Gen. Meade is
                    made.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
