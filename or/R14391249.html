<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT:</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG,</p>
<p>October 1, 1864--10 a. m.<br> (Received 3d.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have ordered Gen. Wilson to report to Sherman. He is the best man for the
                    position. I have devastated the Valley from Staunton down to Mount Crawford, and
                    will continue. The destruction of mills, grain, forage, foundries, &amp;c.,
                    is very great. The cavalry report to me that they have collected 3,000 head of
                    cattle and sheep between Staunton and Mount Crawford. The difficulty of
                    transporting this army through the mountain passes onto the railroad at
                    Charlottesville is such that I regard at as impracticable, with my present means
                    of transportation. The rebels have given up the Valley, excepting Waynesborough,
                    which has been occupied by them since my cavalry was there. I think that the
                    best policy will be to let the burning of the crops of the Valley be the end of
                    this campaign, and let some of this army go somewhere else.</p>
<p></p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
