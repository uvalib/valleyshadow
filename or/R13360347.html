<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Army of the Potomac commander George G. Meade reports to General in Chief Henry
                    Halleck on the disposition of forces in the Shenandoah Valley in January, 1864.
                    Meade reports that Confederates under Early advanced down the Valley to raid the
                    Baltimore and Ohio Railroad while maintaining a line of retreat to Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK, Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p>Near Brandy Station, Va.,</p>
<p>January 5, 1864--1 p. m.<br> (Received 2 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our scouts have returned from the valley, and reported that Early's command,
                    consisting of five brigades of infantry, estimated at 7,000, together with
                    Lee's, Rosser's, Imboden's, and Jenkins' cavalry, and some artillery, passed
                    down the valley about Friday last with the intention of making a raid on the
                    Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but the main body moved from Woodstock over to
                    Moorefield, intending to attack and cut the railroad at New Creek; that a
                    detachment of infantry --Thomas' (Georgia) brigade--and some cavalry were sent
                    through Strasburg to threaten Martinsburg, as a diversion. This intelligence is
                    deemed reliable, and seems to be confirmed by the movements reported by Gen.
                    Kelley.</p>
<p>The cavalry sent to Front Royal returned yesterday evening completely exhausted,
                    and reported the roads passed over impassable for any trains. At present, with
                    snow on the ground, the only passable road open to a detachment from this army,
                    viz, the Culpeper and Sperryville pike, is not practicable, from the balling of
                    the snow in the animal's hoofs. I hold the balance of the Sixth Corps, about
                    10,000 men, a division of cavalry, about 4,000, and some artillery, with a
                    bridge train, in readiness for any movement you may order; but I am still of the
                    opinion that the operations against Early, to be effective, should be from the
                    railroad and defensive, and the character of the season and roads, together with
                    the difficulty of procuring supplies, after exhausting those carried with them,
                    will rendered nugatory any effort made from this army to cut off Early's
                    retreat, as he has a road via Franklin to withdraw to Staunton, in addition to
                    the one through Woodstock. Again, to re-enforce Kelley, if necessary, from this
                    army would require a smaller detachment than an independent movement into the
                    valley, thus weakening me proportionately less. Defensive movements also would
                    have roads, and the troops be more readily supplied. Under existing
                    circumstances, I shall await your orders before making any movement.</p>
