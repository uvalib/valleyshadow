                <p>Union General Dan Butterfield forwards an April, 1863, report of a Union
                    informant to General Samuel Heintzelman. The informant came to Union lines after
                    having been in Staunton. He reports on the strength and locations of various
                    Confederate forces.</p>

                <p>The following dispatch has just been received:</p>
                <p>WARRENTON JUNCTION, April 26, 1863.</p>
                <p>Gen. WILLIAMS:</p>
                <p>A man by the name of George W. Lake, a resident of Maine, and townsman of Col.
                    Sawtelle, quartermaster, and a very intelligent and apparently a very reliable
                    gentleman, has just arrived within our lines from Staunton, via Harrisonburg,
                    New Market, and Thornton's Gap. He reports that on Tuesday, the 21st instant,
                    Jones was at Harrisonburg, and Imboden not far off. Their whole force about
                    6,000, mostly cavalry. They had just been issued ten days' rations, and it was
                    understood that they were intending to turn Milroy, and destroy possibly the
                    railroad bridge on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at the mouth of South Branch
                    of the Potomac and Cacapon Rivers, which has heretofore been done by Imboden.
                    The people of the country are expecting an advance of Hooker's army on
                    Gordonsville, via Culpeper, and it was rumored that pontoon bridges had been
                    thrown across the river for that purpose. He estimates the Confederate army at
                    600,000 strong, and, from what he has heard, should judge that we had a large
                    force in front of us at Fredericksburg.</p>
                <p>Hill had 50,000 in North Carolina when Mr. Lake left there, six weeks ago; from
                    50,000 to 60,000 at Charleston during the recent engagement. Two iron-clads at
                    Wilmington, N. C., one at least completed by this time, built to run the
                    blockade, which is run with great regularity. Danville Railroad not completed
                    yet.</p>
                <p>GEORGE STONEMAN,</p>
                <p>Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Cavalry Corps.</p>
                <p>To which the following answer has been sent:</p>
                <p>That we have much more reliable information than this man has furnished. We know
                    the strength of the enemy in front, and he is looking for us to advance in this
                    vicinity. Jones has an irregular force of not to exceed 3,000. His intentions we
                    know nothing of.<lb/> JOSEPH HOOKER.</p>
                <p>The foregoing is sent for you information.</p>
