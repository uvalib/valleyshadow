<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch writes from Chambersburg to General William Smith
                    concerning movements against Confederates retreating from Pennsylvania after the
                    battle of Gettysburg in July, 1863. He also announces he has sent a shipment of
                    shoes.</p>

<p>Gen. William F. Smith:</p>
<p>Chambersburg,</p>
<p>July 11, 1863.</p>
<p>Dear Gen.:</p>
<p>Your dispatch received, and I think that I will move down under Dana, and
                    probably go along with, what troops we can move. Unless Meade desires us to join
                    him, nothing could be better than do as you suggest; and, in my opinion, we can
                    help more by remaining in an attitude to fall upon the enemy at the proper
                    moment than doing anything else.</p>
<p>I dread the effect on the Army of the Potomac, if our men should conclude not to
                    fight in Maryland or break on the field; I think, however, that a good many of
                    the Pennsylvania troops would do well. Potter went through to Meade last night
                    with certain propositions, and I hope to hear shortly. It appears that your
                    movement through by Pine Grove was the very best thing you could have done.</p>
<p>If you hear anything, please keep me advised. The shoes have gone forward.</p>
<p>Truly,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
