                <p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this
                    division in the action of the 13th instant, near Fredericksburg:</p>
                <p>Being posted at first in the second line, I did not have any immediate use for
                    the batteries of the division, and therefore, after placing them under the
                    charge of Capt. Latimer, as stated, I requested Col. Crutchfield, chief of
                    artillery for the corps, to make such use of them as the emergencies of the day
                    might require. In a short time he detached two batteries to a position on the
                    left of Gen. [A. P.] Hill's line; these were Capt. Latimer's own battery and
                    Capt. [William D.] Brown's battery, both being under charge of Capt. Latimer,
                    who accompanied them. These batteries did not operate in my view, but I am
                    informed that they did excellent service, Capt. Latimer having repulsed the
                    enemy with canister after a regiment of infantry sent to support him had
                    retired. Capt. D'Aquin's and Capt. Garber's batteries were also detached to the
                    right of the railroad, and placed under charge of Gen. Stuart's chief of
                    artillery, Maj. Pelham, and likewise did excellent service, as I am informed.
                    Late in the evening, Capt. [J. McD.] Carrington, with his battery, relieved the
                    two which had been sent to the left under Capt. Latimer, and next morning did
                    good service.</p>
                <p>The reports of brigade commanders and also of Capt. Latimer, acting chief of
                    artillery, are herewith submitted. A list of killed, wounded, and missing has
                    been heretofore forwarded, from which it will be seen that the total killed was
                    102; wounded, 726; missing, 105. Most of the wounded are but slightly injured,
                    and about 50 of the missing, being entirely from Lawton's brigade, fell into the
                    hands of the enemy, the greater part being, in all probability, wounded.</p>
