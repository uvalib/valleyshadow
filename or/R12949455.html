<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this November, 1863, dispatch, Union General Darius Couch, commanding the
                    Department of the Susquehanna at Chambersburg, writes General Franz Sigel
                    concerning draft resisters in the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania. Couch
                    discusses the problem of state versus military jurisdiction over detained
                    resisters, and the possibility of charging them with a crime.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. FRANZ SIGEL,<br> Cmdg. Lehigh District:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>November 14, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I telegraphed you this morning that Capt. Roach, deputy provost-marshal, should
                    furnish the charges against those men arrested in Hazelton region. I so told him
                    the morning of the day we met at Reading.</p>
<p>He was informed that the United States could not try men for offenses that were
                    exclusively State ones. But if any of the party, or all, had conspired to resist
                    the draft, or harbored deserters, or-resisted the military forces in the
                    execution of their lawful duty regarding the draft, undoubtedly they could be
                    tried by military courts.</p>
<p>The subject is one of exceeding delicacy. The State is utterly powerless in the
                    execution of her laws in the mining region, and we must be very cautious about
                    substituting military law for civil. However, the loyal, good people in that
                    region are desirous of having martial law declared, and would bless you if you
                    would hang 100 men a day for a week. One thing is clear, that these men who have
                    been arrested against whom no charges can be preferred, should not at present be
                    set at liberty.</p>
<p>Have you examined the acts of Congress, Articles of War, &amp;c., in
                    reference to your powers as to appointing a military commission? I confess to
                    you that I am not able to decide, nor have been able to get an opinion on the
                    subject. Gen. Cadwalader some time since ordered a general court-martial, but
                    his authority came directly from the War Department. If we meet at Gettysburg,
                    as I think we shall, perhaps more light can be gathered on the subject.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
