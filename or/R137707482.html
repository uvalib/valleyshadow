<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General John Imboden writes Adjutant General Samuel Cooper to request
                    guns and horses from Staunton to help him stop a May, 1864, Union advance.</p>

<p>Gen. S. COOPER:</p>
<p>NEW MARKET,</p>
<p>May 26, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Signal corps reported Sigel advancing in force from Strasburg at 1 p. m., and at
                    6 p. m. his column was at Maurertown, advancing. Citizens report that he has
                    issued eight days' rations. He has a pontoon train along. I have a reserve
                    battery at Staunton ready for the field, except horses. Capt. Turk,
                    quartermaster there, refuses even to lend me horses for a few days, unless you
                    order it. It is important for me to have this additional battery. The horses are
                    in the stables at Staunton. Can I have them a few days? Am preparing for the
                    best fight my means afford, and will keep you advised.</p>
