<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel John Burbridge writes General Sterling Price in June, 1863,
                    with news of Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania. He reports that Chambersburg is in
                    Confederate hands.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. STERLING PRICE,<br> Cmdg. Frontier, at
                        Jacksonport, Ark.:</p>
<p>Camp at Russell's Ferry</p>
<p>June 22, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have just received a dispatch from Col. Kitchen, who saw the Saint Louis
                    Republican of the 16th. Lee has invaded Pennsylvania with a force estimated at
                    90,000. Chambersburg, Pa., and Hagerstown, Md., are in our possession. Lincoln
                    calls for 100,000 militia to repel the invasion. Federals are moving their
                    supplies from Aquia Creek to Alexandria, and have changed their base of
                    operations. A battle is daily expected there. No change in matters at Vicksburg.
                    Rebel privateers are making sad havoc with Federal shipping on the Atlantic. My
                    scouts report but few Federals at Rolla and Ironton. All the regular troops have
                    been sent to Vicksburg. I have given strict orders to all my outposts to allow
                    no one, under any circumstances, to pass north. I will use every precaution to
                    prevent the movement of our army at Jacksonport from being known by the enemy.
                    If an advance is made in this direction, I will harass and impede his progress
                    as much as possible. I have built a good bridge across Black River at this
                    point, and my wagons are now crossing upon it. If I should be ordered to leave
                    this point, I think it should be sent to Jacksonport.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. Q. BURBRIDGE,<br> Col., Cmdg. Outposts.</p>
