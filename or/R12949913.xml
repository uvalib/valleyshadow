                <p>By the middle of the war, food and other necessary supplies became increasingly
                    scarce in the Confederacy. The Shenandoah Valley attracted attention from Union
                    and Confederate armies, and civilian speculators alike, because of its rich
                    farmland. In Confederate Special Orders Number 78, General John Imboden forbids
                    the sale of supplies to locations outside the Valley in hopes of combating
                    speculators in competition with army procuring agents.</p>

                <p>It having been reported to the general commanding that the officers and agents of
                    the subsistence department of this district are unable to procure the supplies
                    imperatively required for the army by purchase, because speculators are in the
                    market paying higher prices than those fixed by the government commissioners,
                    and sending such supplies out of the district to be sold again, it is ordered
                    that the commissaries of subsistence at New Market, Harrisonburg, Staunton, and
                    Lexington, and those on duty with the command in subsistence found in the use of
                    the army, all the necessaries of subsistence found in the hands of speculators,
                    or which have been sold to speculators, though not delivered, to be sent out of
                    the district, and by the term "speculator" is meant any one who buys to sell
                    again; and any one in this military district making alleged purchases for
                    private consumption, or for the use of the poor, or soldiers' families in other
                    districts, for the use of railroad employees or government contractors, will not
                    be permitted to remove supplies from this district, excepting by special orders
                    from these headquarters, or from the War Department, and the commissary officers
                    and agents named in this order will see that no purchases are carried into
                    effect by the contracting parties. This order is not intended to apply to
                    necessaries in the hands of producers in transit to market, which have not been
                    sold, or engaged to be sold, before or on their arrival at market.</p>
