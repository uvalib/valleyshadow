<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this October, 1864, dispatch, Union General Darius Couch amends his August,
                    1864, report on the burning of Chambersburg. He casts doubt on his previous
                    assertion that Confederate General Bradley Johnson was in the town during the
                    burning.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK, U. S. Army,<br> Chief of Staff,
                        Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>October 14, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inform you that in my report of the burning of Chambersburg,
                    Pa., dated Harrisburg, August 8, 1864., I stated "It is certain that both
                    Brig.-Gen.'s McCausland and Bradley Johnson were present." Upon subsequent and
                    fuller investigation, I think there is a doubt about the latter officer being in
                    the town, he having remained with the main body of the rebels force at the fair
                    grounds just outside.</p>
<p>I respectfully request that this statement may be appended to the report above
                    alluded to.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Department.</p>
