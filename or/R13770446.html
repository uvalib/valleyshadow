<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In May, 1864, Union General Franz Sigel planned an advance up the Shenandoah
                    Valley to threaten Staunton. In this dispatch, Sigel sends the U. S. Army
                    Adjutant Confederate telegrams captured at Woodstock that reveal the strength of
                    the Confederate force at Staunton.</p>

<p>ADJUTANT-GEN. U. S. ARMY:</p>
<p>NEAR WOODSTOCK, VA.,</p>
<p>May 13, 1864--5 p. m.<br> (Received 12 m. 14th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following dispatches were found with many others in telegraph papers by Mr.
                    McCaine, cipher operator at Woodstock, after we enter the town. It shows that
                    Breckinridge is at Staunton, and has sent 4,000 men there. Capt. Davis now
                    commands Gilmor's battalion, and is in our front:</p>
<p>LA FAYETTE STATION, May 5, 1864--4 p. m.<br> Brig.-Gen. IMBODEN:</p>
<p>Can't make out your dispatch in cipher of this date. I have 4,000 men en route
                    for Jackson River Depot to take cars. I --. (Here the dispatch stops.)</p>
<p>STAUNTON, May 10, 1864.<br> Capt. DAVIS:</p>
<p>Try and find out real force of enemy, and proportion of infantry, artillery, and
                    cavalry. There is a report of a column of cavalry at Madison Court-House, moving
                    toward Charlottesville. Can this be part of Sigel's force? I want to know at
                    earliest moment any movement toward Grant. Communicate often with me.<br>
                    BRECKINRIDGE.</p>
<p>My principal object in advancing up the Shenandoah Valley was to threaten
                    Staunton, to divide the forces of Breckinridge, and to assist by these means
                    Gen. Crook, whose object is to destroy New River bridge. I have no later news
                    from him than to the 6th instant, when he entered Princeton. My forces are
                    insufficient for offensive operations in this country, where the enemy is
                    continuously on my flank and rear. My intention, therefore, is not to advance
                    farther than this place with my main force, but have sent out strong parties in
                    every direction. Skirmishing is going on every day. If Breckinridge should
                    advance against us I will resist him at some convenient position. My cavalry is
                    at Mount Jackson to-day.</p>
