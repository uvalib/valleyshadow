<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin forwards General-in-Chief Henry Halleck a
                    telegram from Chambersburg discussing the movements of Jeb Stuart's Confederate
                    Cavalry during his October, 1862, raid into Pennsylvania and Maryland.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>October 13, 1862</p>
<p>The following just received, in answer to dispatch just sent
                    you:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, October 13, 1862.<br> Governor CURTIN:</p>
<p>We had Junkin's rumors, with thousands of others, but they are entirely
                    unfounded. To approach Concord they must cross at London, 10 miles west from
                    here, on the pike, and we have word from there hourly. Concord is at the head of
                    Path Valley, and to enter it they must go by Mercersburg and London, and cross
                    Cove Mountain at London and Fannettsburg, and we could not be without the
                    information. It is entirely unfounded, and results from exaggerated rumors of
                    their cavalry being at Saint Thomas on Friday night. About 60 rebel cavalry are
                    just reported by one of our officers to be in the neighborhood of Fayetteville,
                    6 miles east, on the pike. They seem to have been scattered and retreating. We
                    are amply prepared for them, and every one appearing will be fired at. Col.
                    Grant is here with two Vermont regiments of artillery (infantry).<br> A. K.
                    McCLURE.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. G. CURTIN,<br> Governor.</p>
