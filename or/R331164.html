<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, writes General in Chief Henry Halleck in December, 1863,
                    concerning the situation in the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania. Couch
                    reports that everything is working smoothly since trouble makers have been
                    driven off or arrested by General Franz Sigel.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,</p>
<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief, Washington,
                        D. C.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>December 10, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I respectfully state that I recently met at Reading, Pa., a committee of the coal
                    men of Lehigh Valley. Everything is working excellently in that district, some
                    of the worst characters having been arrested by Gen. Sigel; others have fled
                    from that region, and the operators are again getting their mines under proper
                    control. So soon as the other two anthracite districts, viz, Schuylkill and
                    Wyoming, agree to certain propositions the bad characters will be cleared out of
                    the country. The supply of coal increased with less number of miners, and
                    matters will probably resume the quiet of before the war.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
