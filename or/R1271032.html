<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee writes Colonel G. C. Wharton concerning the July, 1863,
                    situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Lee reports ordering sick and wounded
                    soldiers from Winchester to Staunton. He also discusses his desire for Imboden
                    to move north from Staunton.</p>

<p>Col. G. C. Wharton,<br> Comdg. Brigade, &amp;c.:</p>
<p>One mile South of Winchester,</p>
<p>July 21, 1863.</p>
<p>Col.:</p>
<p>The movement of the enemy east of the Blue Ridge obliges me to march this army
                    across the mountains to meet him.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell and his corps will probably be in Winchester or its vicinity to-morrow
                    evening, to follow the route of the army the next day.</p>
<p>I have directed the removal of all the sick and wounded that can bear
                    transportation from Winchester and its vicinity to Harrisonburg and Staunton,
                    and am led to believe that it will be accomplished by to-morrow evening. Still,
                    some unforeseen delay may occur, and I wish you would go to Winchester
                    to-morrow, and remain there until the arrival of Gen. Ewell, and ascertain in
                    consultation with him whether the presence of your troops in that place for a
                    few days would be necessary or advantageous.</p>
<p>I intend to leave Gen. Imboden's troops in the Valley, and have written to him to
                    hasten down from Staunton as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Col. Imboden with his cavalry is now in the vicinity of Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>Should the enemy wish to repossess himself of Winchester, a small force there
                    would be unavailing. Not knowing whether any additional troops of Gen. Sam.
                    Jones' command have joined you, or whether Gen. Jones himself is coming to the
                    Valley, I leave it discretionary with you, after consultation with Gen. Ewell,
                    to occupy Winchester with your forces, or to retire to Strasburg, or some point
                    higher up, to guard the Upper Valley, until the movements of Gen. Sam. Jones are
                    ascertained.</p>
<p>I shall write to Gen. Imboden to take command in the Valley until the arrival of
                    Gen. Jones.</p>
<p>Col. Imboden will be directed by Gen. Ewell to report to you until the arrival of
                    Gen. Imboden.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
