<p>Hon. L. P. WALKER,<br> Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>LYNCHBURG,</p>
<p>July 24, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report to you that in obedience to orders from Governor
                    Harris I arrived in this city to-day. One of my regiments (Col. Hatton's) has
                    gone forward to Staunton. Col. Maney will go up to-morrow or soon as
                    transportation can be furnished; Col. Forbes' regiment, Capt. Hart's rifle
                    company, and Capt. Alexander's cavalry company are still behind. We expect them
                    forwarded here in a day or so. This, with Capt. Rutledge's artillery company of
                    six guns, 6-pounders, now at Knoxville, will constitute my command. Capt.
                    Rutledge will come forward as soon as he is fully equipped. I am without orders
                    from headquarters as to what I am to do or under whose command I am to be
                    placed. I have received no commission; to all of which I desire to call your
                    attention. Connected with my command I ordered, and they are now at Bristol,
                    Tenn., a baggage and ammunition train of some seventy-five or eighty wagons and
                    teams of two mules each, with wagons and wagon-master. What am I to do with
                    them? Shall I cause them to be brought forward, or let them remain at Bristol
                    for further orders? I take pleasure in saying to you that my command is well
                    drilled, armed, and equipped, and composed of the best material of the State. I
                    do not hesitate to say that they will render good service whenever opportunity
                    offers. We have some 300,000 rounds of ammunition with us, and will soon receive
                    some 400,000 more. What shall I do with it? It should be in striking distance of
                    the command. This will be handed to you by Col. Maney, who will explain to you
                    other matters connected with the command.</p>
<p>I am, yours, respectfully,</p>
<p>S. R. ANDERSON,<br> Brig.-Gen. of the Provisional Army, C. S.</p>
