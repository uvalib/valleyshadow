<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During the Civil War, Confederate armies often suffered shoe shortages. In this
                    November, 1862, letter, Robert E. Lee writes Adjutant and Inspector General
                    Cooper to discuss the detail of men from the army to work as shoemakers in
                    Confederate cities. Lee mentions Staunton as one of the cities in need of
                    shoemakers.</p>

<p>Gen. S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.,
                        Richmond, VA.:</p>
<p>Camp near Culpeper Court-House,</p>
<p>November 15, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I inclose herewith a copy of Special Orders, No. 243, from these headquarters.</p>
<p>From Paragraphs VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII, you will see that the number
                    of men required from this army have been detailed to work as shoemakers, and
                    ordered to report to the Quartermaster's Department for duty at the several
                    points in this department specified in the circular of the Quartermaster-Gen.
                    One hundred men were required for Richmond. Ninety are detail from Lieut.-Gen.
                    Longstreet's corps, and the remaining 10 will come from the command under Maj.
                    Gen. G. W. Smith, double that number of applications having been received from
                    the Quartermaster's Department and from individuals for the detail of men in his
                    command, and it is presumed he can supply the 10 wanted to complete the number
                    for Richmond. For Petersburg, Danville, Lynchburg, and Staunton the number asked
                    for have been detailed. In addition to these, you will receive from the same
                    order that 12 men, who were applied for by Maj. F. W. Dillard, assistant
                    quartermaster at Columbus, Ga., have been ordered to report to him at that place
                    for the same duty. I herewith return Maj. Dillard's letters, as they contain the
                    names of several men not in this army. I also return, disapproved, one or two
                    applications of the same character received from your office, and refer you to
                    the endorsements thereon for the reasons of the disapproval. I hope that this
                    large detail will be sufficient to supply the wants of the Quartermaster's
                    Department, for I cannot recommend that any more be made from this army, which
                    is already so reduced by details of various characters as seriously to impair
                    its efficiency.</p>
<p>I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
