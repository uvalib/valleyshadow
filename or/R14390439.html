<p>October 5, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this
                    division during the campaign in the Valley:</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to premise that from the fact that subordinate
                    commanders have not as yet forwarded reports that accounts of the events which
                    happened early in the campaign cannot be given in such detail as I could wish.</p>
<p>On the 9th of August, when I assumed command of the division, it was encamped
                    near Halltown, from which point it marched on the following morning at 5 o'clock
                    via Charlestown and Barryville. After skirmishing with a small brigade of the
                    enemy's cavalry, which was routed, the division encamped near the Winchester and
                    Millwod pike. The following morning the First Brigade was ordered toward
                    Winchester, near which place the enemy was found in considerable force holding a
                    defile on the pike near the town, while his trains and army were passing toward
                    Strasburg. The brigade had a sharp fight with the enemy's infantry, artillery
                    being used freely by the enemy, but I am glad to say the loss of the brigade was
                    not large. It was then determined to move on the Front Royal pike, and the
                    division, in three columns--the First Brigade on the right, the Reserve Brigade
                    in the center, and the Second Brigade on the left-marched in that direction.
                    Near White Post Gen. (then Col.) Devin came upon a large force of the enemy
                    strongly posted on a ridge, with temporary breast-works of rails for protection.
                    A sharp fight ensued, in which the enemy was finally beaten and driven from the
                    field, which gave us possession of the Front Royal pike. About 3 o'clock in the
                    afternoon two brigades (the Reserve and Second) marched out toward Newtown. The
                    enemy's infantry was encountered about two miles from that town, and a battle
                    fought by the Reserve and the Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry of the Second
                    Brigade. The enemy were strong in numbers and position, and it was found
                    impossible to dislodge them before dark, which closed the fighting. I regret to
                    say the loss on this occasion was severe to the brigade. Among the wounded was
                    Maj. Scott, First New York Dragoons, an officer distinguished for gallant
                    conduct on several previous occasions.</p>
<p>On the 12th of August the march was resumed without opposition from the enemy,
                    who was not come up with until reaching Middletown, when his rear guard crossed
                    Cedar Creek, and on being pursued by part of the division commenced a desultory
                    skirmish which was discontinued on our part on the arrival of the infantry. The
                    next day a reconnaissance was made by the Reserve Brigade to Strasburg, near
                    which two the enemy was found posted on Fisher's Hill. The brigade joined the
                    division, which remained in camp, picketing on Cedar Creek, until the 13th of
                    August, when the Second Brigade was ordered to Cedar Springs on the Front Royal
                    pike. The following day the remainder of the division moved to join the Second
                    Brigade, the Reserve Brigade going into camp near Nineveh. The First Brigade was
                    ordered into camp on the left of the Front Royal pike opposite the camp of the
                    Second Brigade. About 2 p. m. (16th) the enemy drove in the pickets of the
                    Second Brigade and skirmishing commenced, which preceded the battle of
                    Cedarville. The enemy attacked with two brigades of cavalry (Lomax's and
                    Wickham's), supported by Kershaw's division of infantry. The pickets of the
                    Second Brigade were driven by the violence of the attack to the reserve, which
                    fought the enemy, though they were greatly outnumbered, contesting the ground
                    with him foot by foot, until Col. Devin marched his brigade to the field. The
                    First Brigade was immediately posted on a position to the front of its camp. The
                    enemy's cavalry charged and were gallantly met by three regiments of the Second
                    Brigade, which routed him in confusion. A brigade of infantry was then
                    discovered to be moving on the opposite bank of the river toward our left flank.
                    One regiment of the First Brigade was dismounted and thrown forward to a hill
                    near the river-bank to meet this movement, while the rest of the brigade moved
                    (mounted) to an eligible position near the right of the hill to act in concert
                    with the dismounted men. The enemy advanced boldly, wading the river, and were
                    allowed to approach within short carbine range, when a murderous volley was
                    poured into their solid ranks, while the whole command charged. The enemy were
                    thrown into the wildest confusion. They had met a resistance which they little
                    expected; they were driven pell-mell into the river, losing a great number in
                    killed and wounded, nearly 300 prisoners, and 2 stand of colors. Re-enforcements
                    were hurried up by the rebels, but they came too late to retrieve the disaster
                    of the day. They cautiously remained on the south bank of the river, and the
                    fight degenerated into an artillery duel, the enemy using vigorously a heavy
                    battery had given us much trouble by its wicked fire during the battle. Our loss
                    was small--sixty in killed and wounded more than covered our entire
                    casualties--while the punishment, &amp;c., inflicted on the enemy could not
                    have been far short of 600 in killed, wounded, and prisoners. Col. Devin, who
                    acquitted himself with conspicuous skill and gallantry, was painfully wounded in
                    the foot, though he kept the field to the end of the battle. Great credit is due
                    Gen. Custer for the masterly manner in which he handled his command. All honor
                    to the brave officers and men who won this battle, which cost the enemy so
                    dearly. The Reserve Brigade, which was ordered up during the engagement, but
                    which did not arrive in time to take part, resumed its camp for the night, as
                    did the other brigades of the division.</p>
<p>On the 17th the division marched at 8 a. m. in compliance with orders, destroying
                    the grain and forage, and driving off in the Valley from Cedar Creek to
                    Berryville. This duty, not among the most agreeable assigned to soldiers, was
                    thoroughly though delicately done; no private property, save that mentioned,
                    being injured; nor family masted by any soldier in the command to my knowledge.
                    During the 18th, 19th, and 20th of August the command remained in the vicinity
                    of Berryville. In this interval several attacks were made by parties of
                    guerrillas on the pickets and foraging parties of the First Brigade, in which
                    several men were killed. The Third Brigade, Col. Lowell commanding, joined the
                    division while it was encamped at Berryville. It was assigned to the duty of
                    watching the enemy on the Winchester pike. (I would here remark that although
                    this brigade constituted part of the division, that I am unable to give any
                    account of the most of the early part of the campaign, until it was broken up,
                    and its regiments assigned to the other brigades of the division.) On the 21st
                    the Third Brigade was attacked and Col. Lowell was sent orders to fall back on
                    the command at Berryville, the division having orders to march to Charlestown.
                    After leaving Berryville the enemy annoyed the rear guard but little, the force
                    that followed being small. August 22, marched to Shepherdstown via Duffield's
                    Station. On the 23d and 24th remained in camp, picketing, &amp;c. August 25,
                    a reconnaissance was made, in conjunction with the Third Division, toward
                    Leetown. Near Kearneysville the enemy's infantry (Breckinridge's corps) was met,
                    and after a sharp skirmish the two divisions fell back toward Shepherdstown. At
                    this latter place the rear guard was forced from its position by the enemy well
                    toward Shepherdston, but was in its turn threatened in its rear by a force of
                    the enemy which had marched across the country and struck us in the flank. The
                    Second Brigade was immediately ordered to engage this force violently, in order
                    to give the First Brigade a chance to retire across the Potomac. The attack was
                    made with marked impetuosity by the Second Brigade, and I am glad to say had the
                    desired effect, as Gen. Custer retired across the river without molestation.
                    During the day the loss to the enemy, as we have since learned, was very heavy.
                    The first attack made on his columns, which were marching toward Williamsport,
                    was so heavy as to throw him into the greatest confusion, and though it was no
                    part of the plan to fight his infantry, subsequent developments have proven that
                    the two divisions did much toward defeating for a time Breckinridge's entire
                    corps of infantry. During the day a splendid mounted charge was made by the
                    Second Brigade, while the First Brigade did noble service on foot. August 28,
                    marched to Leetown, at which point the enemy's cavalry, under Lomax, was engaged
                    by the Reserve Brigade and driven toward Smithfield. At this later place the
                    enemy made a decided stand, when the division was disposed for battle, the First
                    Brigade moving to the right flank and the Reserve Brigade attacking in front,
                    Second Brigade being held as reserve. In the attack the First U. S. Cavalry
                    distinguished itself in a splendid charge against double its number of the
                    enemy, repelling his column back in confusion. Lieut. Hoyer, of the First, a
                    gallant and promising young officer, fell mortally wounded while leading his
                    squadron in the charge. The enemy were finally driven across the Opequon to
                    Bunker Hill, and the division encamped near Smithfield. The next day the brigade
                    was ordered on reconnaissance to Bunker Hill, to discover if possible the
                    whereabouts of the enemy's infantry. Two divisions of his force (infantry) were
                    met on their way to attack us. The brigade was withdrawn to the right bank of
                    the Opequon, and the entire division, after a stubborn resistance, fell back
                    toward Charlestown, about two miles. The enemy did not advance far, but in his
                    turn retired to the left bank of the Opequon. August 30, marched to Berryville,
                    and on the 31st and 1st of September remained in camp.</p>
<p>September 2, marched to Bullskin Run at daybreak, and at 7 p. m. marched again to
                    Berryville. September 3, marched, via White Post, to Front Royal and Winchester
                    pike, and on the 4th returned to Berryville, where the right of the enemy's
                    infantry line was found to rest. This was avoided with but little skirmishing by
                    a movement to our right. On the 5th of September the division moved to the right
                    of the infantry then facing the enemy, and picketed, reconnoitered, &amp;c.,
                    until the night of the 18th. At 2 a. m. on the 19th it marched to the Opequon
                    and took part in the battle fought on that creek, a report of which is given
                    separately. September 20, led the pursuit of the enemy to Strasburg, found him
                    in force on Fisher's Hill. September 21, marched to Front Royal by way of
                    Buckton Ford, and thence, on the 22d, with the Third Division, up Luray Valley
                    to Milford, where the enemy was found strongly posted. The division was but
                    slightly engaged. Capt. Emmons, assistant adjutant-general of the Reserve
                    Brigade, was dangerously wounded during the day by one of the enemy's
                    sharpshooters. It having been decided impracticable to carry the position of the
                    enemy without great loss of life, it was decided to withdraw both divisions.
                    This was done at dark, and the command on the following day returned to Front
                    Royal. Near this town the advance of the Reserve Brigade encountered a body of
                    guerrillas, under a Capt. Chapman, who were in the act of capturing an ambulance
                    train of our wounded. The gang was quickly dispersed, with a loss of eighteen
                    killed. Lieut. McMaster, of the Second U. S. Cavalry, was mortally wounded in
                    this affair, being shot after he was taken prisoner and robbed. The night of the
                    same day the command marched to Milford, and after crossing Overall's Run (where
                    the rebels had destroyed the bridge) by a ford, bivouacked until daylight on the
                    24th. The march was then resumed, when Wickham's cavalry was met near Luary and
                    routed by the First and Reserve Brigades, with the loss of nearly 100 prisoners
                    and one battle-flag belonging to the Sixth Virginia Cavalry. September 25,
                    crossed the mountains to New Market, where, after halting, feeding, &amp;c.,
                    the division moved on to Harrisonburg. September 26, m the Reserve Brigade was
                    detached and marched with the Third Division to Staunton, Waynesborough,
                    &amp;c.; the remaining portion of the division moved on to Port Republic,
                    the Second Brigade in the advance, driving the enemy's cavalry before it across
                    Middle River into Brown's Gap, where the enemy's army was found in force. It was
                    also discovered that Kershaw's division, which had come from Gordonsville, was
                    joining Early through Swift Run Gap. The artillery of the division was placed in
                    an advantageous position and shelled Kershaw's trains with great effect. An
                    attack was ordered on the trains at the same time, but it was found that they
                    were too strongly guarded to be taken, and the attack had no other effect than
                    to scare the enemy mightily. In the afternoon the enemy's infantry made an
                    attack on the skirmish line of the Second Brigade, driving the right of it from
                    a dense chaparral into which it had been pushed forward. A very heavy and
                    accurate artillery fire and a display of mounted squadrons in the open field
                    deterred the enemy from a farther advance. Maj. Scott, First New York Dragoons,
                    was wounded (the third time during the campaign) in this affair. September 27,
                    the Second Division, in position near Weyer's Cave, was driven from that place
                    by a combined attack of cavalry, artillery, and infantry. This division fell
                    back from its position to the right of Port Republic, sending its wagon trains
                    to the First Division. The enemy, instead of advancing to our front, threatened
                    our right and communications by moving in the direction of Cross Keys. To
                    preserve these the command fell back to Cross Keys and took up position for
                    battle. The enemy did not accept the offer, but moved from Brown's Gap the same
                    night to Waynesbourough, where he came in contact with the command of the chief
                    of cavalry at that place. September 28, as soon as it was discovered the enemy
                    were withdrawing from Port Republic, which was done, and the rear guard of the
                    enemy driven toward Waynesborough. September 29, from army headquarters, marched
                    across the country, destroying mills and forage and driving off cattle. This
                    work was completely done throughout the Valley from within a few miles from
                    Waynesborough and Staunton to Mount Crawford.</p>
<p>September 30 and October 1, remained in camp near Mount Crawford. On the 2d of
                    October the enemy advanced and skirmishing took place along my entire line,
                    lasting all day. October 3 and 4, remained in camp near Mount Crawford, from
                    which place the division moved, on the 5th, to Cross Keys and vicinity. October
                    6, moved to Harrisonburg and thence on Middle road to Timberville, destroying
                    forage, grain, &amp;c., and driving off cattle across the entire valley.
                    October 7, marched at 8 a. m., continuing the work of destruction, joining the
                    pike near Edenburg, where the division camped. October 8, moved as rear guard to
                    the army and fought the enemy near Tom's Creek (as reported in separate report
                    of the battle of the 9th). October 9, fought the battle Tom's Creek (report
                    made). October 10, camped near Tom's Run. October 11, marched to Cedar Creek and
                    camped on the left of the infantry at Bowman's Ford, where we remained during
                    the 12th. October 13, the enemy shelled the infantry camps, and the division was
                    moved to the right of the infantry line, where it remained during the 14th. On
                    the 15th the division marched at dark to Front Royal, starting on an expedition
                    which, for reasons, was afterward abandoned. October 16, returned to camp on the
                    right of the infantry, where we remained during the 17th and 18th. October 19
                    and 20--accounts of the operations of these dates are given in special reports
                    of the battle of Middletown.</p>
