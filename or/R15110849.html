<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Representatives of the northern counties of Virginia write Robert E. Lee
                    concerning the military situation in April, 1861. They mention a large Union
                    buildup of forces at Chambersburg, express fear for their counties and the
                    Shenandoah Valley, and request reinforcements to deal with the threat.</p>

<p>Gen. LEE:</p>
<p>Richmond,</p>
<p>April 27, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>Will you permit us to ask your attention to a state of things which we regard as
                    of great and urgent moment to our part of the State-the northern portion of the
                    Valley of Shenandoah? A large camp of Northern troops is now concentration at
                    Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, just against and very near that part of our
                    border. The papers inform us that one or more brigades are now there, and
                    several others marching to join them. The object stated is to invade Virginia
                    upon the first indication of movement on the part of our force. From the
                    position chosen and the rich and defenseless character of our northern Valley
                    counties, we believe that first blow will fall upon our people. We are entirely
                    without cannon, although appropriated to us by act of assembly, and urgently
                    claimed by some of us for months past. Artillery companies at Winchester are
                    ready to service and use them.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>ROB. Y. CONRAD,<br>
                        <br> JAS. MARSHALL,<br> Frederick County.<br>
                        <br> EDMUND PENDLETON,<br> Berkeley County.<br>
                        <br> HUGH M. NELSON,<br> Clarke County.<br>
                        <br> ALFRED M. BARBOR,<br> Jefferson County.</p>
