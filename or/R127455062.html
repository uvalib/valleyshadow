<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this July 3, 1863, dispatch, Department of the Susquehanna commander Darius
                    Couch attempts to set cavalry in motion to harass the Army of Northern
                    Virginia's rear areas during the battle of Gettysburg. He mentions Federal
                    cavalry and Confederate forces in the Chambersburg area.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Col. Pierce,<br> Bloody Run, or elsewhere:</p>
<p>Harrisburg,</p>
<p>July 3, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Move on with your whole force to the passes near McConnellsburg, and as near
                    Chambersburg and Mercersburg as possible.</p>
<p>My cavalry were near Chambersburg yesterday, and so were the rebels. Make every
                    exertion to harass, and show of force. I think Meade will whip them to-morrow,
                    and we must help him every way. Push on at all hazards.</p>
<p>Send this dispatch. Notify me where you are.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
