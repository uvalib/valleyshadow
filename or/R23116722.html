<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Major M. G. Harman, commanding at Staunton, writes in September, 1861, that he will have
          to send new prisoners of war on to Richmond, since the Staunton jail was already
          overcrowded.</p>

<p>September 14, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>By order of Gen. Loring four prisoners of war were sent to this post to be placed in the
          Staunton jail. Upon inquiry I found the jail so much crowded with prisoners of war and
          others as to make it advisable especially in view of our limited ground not to add to
          their number. I therefore found it in my opinion best to take the responsibility of
          sending them on to Richmond to be disposed of under your own order, and to that end have
          this day sent them under charge of Capt. Otey, who has two artillery companies started
          thence through Richmond to Yorktown under orders.</p>
<p>Hoping that my disposition of them may meet with your approbation, I remain, with
            much consideration, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>M. G. HARMAN,<br> Maj., Cmdg.</p>
