                <p>In this June, 1863, address, Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin calls on the
                    people of Pennsylvania to raise militia for the defense of the state against
                    Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Curtin expresses his frustration with
                    the people's haggling over terms of service, asks them to trust the government,
                    close down their businesses, and join the militia. He points out that the
                    situation is particularly urgent with Confederate forces six mile outside
                    Chambersburg and threatening the state capital at Harrisburg.</p>

                <p>For nearly a week past it has been publicly known that the rebels, in force, were
                    about to enter Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>On the 12th instant, an urgent call was made on the people to raise a
                    Departmental Army Corps for the defense of the State. Yesterday, under the
                    proclamation of the President, the militia was called out. To-day a new and
                    pressing exhortation has been given to furnish men.</p>
                <p>Philadelphia has not responded. Meanwhile the enemy is 6 miles this side of
                    Chambersburg, and advancing rapidly. Our capital is threatened, and we may be
                    disgraced by its fall, while the men who should be driving these outlaws from
                    our soil are quarreling about the possible term of service for six months. It
                    never was intended to keep them beyond the continuance of the emergency. You all
                    know this by what happened when the militia was called out last autumn. You then
                    trusted your Government, and were not deceived. Trust it again now. I will
                    accept men without reference to the six months. If you do not wish to bear the
                    ignominy of shrinking from the defense of your State, come forward at once,
                    close your places of business, and apply your heads to the work. Come in such
                    organizations as you can form. Gen. Couch has appointed Lieut.-Col. Ruff to
                    superintend your organization. Report to him immediately.</p>

                        the defense of the State, and have called out the militia for that purpose.
                        The time of service will only be while the danger to the State is imminent.
                        Send forward companies as soon as possible.</seg>
