<p>JOHN BRANNON, Esq.</p>
<p>STAUNTON,</p>
<p>August 7, 1861.</p>
<p>MY DEAR FRIEND:</p>
<p>I have been arrested and brought here by the order of Col. Jackson or Governor
                    Jackson, charged with having conducted the Federal troops to the top of Rich
                    Mountain, which charge is false and I can prove it false by the whole army then
                    stationed at Camp Garnett or Rich Mountain. I can prove also that I was with the
                    army off and all the time it was there, working for the army day and night. My
                    family and I never left the army until the word retreat was given and then came
                    down to Baker's and there got Baker's carriage, hitched my horse to it and
                    brought Capt. William Ervin off. He had three of his ribs broken from a fall he
                    received in camp and was brought out to Baker's on Monday before the battle. I
                    carried him home within a few miles of the Warm Springs. I then went on to the
                    Springs to see my daughter and children, at which place I was arrested on Friday
                    following and brought to this place and turned loose on parole. I do not know
                    the meaning of it, but am still under arrest.</p>
<p>I have written to Col. Jackson about it and asked of him to give me a hearing or
                    a trial and I would prove to him and the whole world that I was innocent, and
                    that when I did that I wanted to be honorably acquitted and also full
                    satisfaction of those who perpetrated such unfounded falsehood; that I should
                    not be satisfied until that was done. They know well that I was a witness to a
                    great deal of their mismanagement and bad conduct as it respects that battle,
                    and afterward the miserable retreat of Scott's riflemen and the situation it
                    placed Garnett's army in, and think by playing this trick on me they will get
                    clear of it. Let me get this arrest settled up and I'll let them know that I
                    will let the world hear of it.</p>
<p>My loss is great by the Federal troops and more than I shall ever recover, but
                    that I care nothing about so we can our independence. They can have all, so that
                    I can say I am once more a free man. Please attend to this. I have written to
                    Governor Letcher and you will see him in person if you please. Mr. Morrall will
                    say a few words in this case.</p>
<p>I remain, yours, with the greatest regard and respect,</p>
<p>DR. WASHINGTON HILLEARY.</p>
