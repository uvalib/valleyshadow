<p>Maj. JOHN S. SCHULTZE,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>August 9, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report relating to the late invasion by the rebels in
                    Chambersburg, Pa., on the morning of the 30th of July, 1864. Being on detached
                    duty at headquarters of the department at that place, and unavoidably detained
                    there, I was present both on the entree and departure of their force in and out
                    of town, and was both an eye-witness and observator of the following, which came
                    under my immediate observation:</p>
<p>The rebels entered the town with a force of (I do not think over) 500 mounted
                    men, under the command of Gen.'s McCausland and Bradley T. Johnson, the main
                    body being encamped on the fair grounds, about one and a half miles out of town,
                    on the Pittsburg pike. Before entering the rebels fired two shells in the town.
                    They then entered by almost every alley and by-street by small squads prior to
                    the advance of the main body, which came up directly in the rear. On arriving
                    into town, Gen. McCausland informed me personally that if I had any
                    self-interest at stake it would be well for me to listen to the order he would
                    read and get the municipal authorities together to hold a meeting and comply
                    with their desires. The order itself was handed me, which I read myself, the
                    purport of which was as follows:</p>
<p>That in retaliation of the depredations committed by Maj.-Gen. Hunter, of the U.
                    S. forces, during his recent raid, it is ordered that the citizens of
                    Chambersburg pay to the Confederate States by Gen. McCausland the sum of
                    $100,000 in gold; or in lieu thereof $500,000 in greenbacks or national currency
                    was required to ransom the town, otherwise the town would be laid in ashes
                    within three hours.</p>
<p>The order was signed by Gen. Early. After reading the order I started to find the
                    town council. Meeting one of them I informed him of the facts, when he told me
                    that the citizens would not pay them 5 cents. I returned and met Gen. Bradley T.
                    Johnson on the portico of the Franklin Hotel. The rebels were by this time
                    dismounted and breaking in the doors of stores and houses, and had already
                    commenced plundering. When they entered it was 5.30 a. m., from which time I was
                    in company with both Gen.'s McCausland and Johnson (being in citizen's dress
                    they did not know me). Gen. McCausland was appealed to by Johnson to relent or
                    at least give the citizens more time, but he was determined. At 9 o'clock
                    McCausland ordered the town burnt. In a few moments the commissary store-house
                    was in flames, during which time McCausland and Gilmor were riding through town
                    notifying the citizens, pointing to the flames, that he intended to carry his
                    threat into execution. He returned to the Franklin Hotel and had a consultation
                    with Gen. Bradley T. Johnson, during which I overheard McCausland say that Gen.
                    Averell was only four miles out of town with a force of 2,000 cavalry, and that
                    he would now burn the town and return the way they came. In a few moments the
                    court-house and town-hall were in flames, when simultaneously on the right and
                    left sides of the main street was in one mass of flames; but little time elapsed
                    when the houses on both sides of the by-streets were in the same condition. I
                    repaired to the hotel and found a party of rebels ransacking the trunks of the
                    boarders, and donning the clothes contained therein. In my trunk was my uniform,
                    other clothes, and letters, &amp;c., by which they learned that I was
                    connected with the headquarters of the department. They immediately took me
                    prisoner, when they confined me in a tin store adjoining the hotel, where they
                    dressed themselves in my clothes, destroying the emblems of the U. S. service. I
                    was thus confined until the houses on both sides the one in which I was
                    imprisoned were in flames, when I escaped through a window to the rear of the
                    building. At this time (about 12 m.) the rebels were mounted and on their
                    return, leaving only a small number as stragglers and pickets. When they left
                    nearly two-thirds of their party were in a state of intoxication, hardly capable
                    of sitting on their horses. I remained in Chambersburg until midnight of
                    Saturday, when I walked to Shippensburg, arriving in Harrisburg on Monday.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> WILL. S. KOCHERSPERGER,<br> Sergeant, Company L, Twentieth Regt. Penn.
                        Cavalry, Indorsement<br> Clerk at Hdqrs. Dept. of the Susquehanna.</p>
