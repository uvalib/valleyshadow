<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>November 1, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I. That the interests of the Government and the welfare of the department may be
                    maintained, it is ordered that all refugees, deserters from the rebel lines, and
                    citizens of States in rebellion, who are now within this department, or may
                    enter it before the 8th day of November instant, shall report to the nearest
                    district or town provost-marshall, that they may be registered, their residence
                    and description recorded, and to receive proper certificates and passes. Persons
                    belonging to any of the classes hereinbefore mentioned found within the limits
                    of this department, on or after the date named, without authority, or who by
                    pillaging, counseling outbreak, destruction of life or property, or in any
                    manner acting as enemies of the Government, will be regarded as spies, and
                    subjected to summary punishment.</p>
<p>II. In view of the approaching election, deserters from the army and the draft
                    may return to their homes, and every effort must be made to arrest and hold them
                    to the service they owe their Government.</p>
<p>III. Military commanders, district provost-marshals, their deputies and
                    assistants, within this department, will be held responsible for the faithful
                    execution of this order, and will adopt such measure as will best secure the
                    desired object.</p>
<p>IV. All law-abiding citizens are earnestly requested to act in junction with the
                    proper authorities, and to aid them, if necessary, in the instructions herein
                    set forth.</p>
<p>By command of Maj.-Gen. Couch:</p>
<p>JNO. S. SHULTZE,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
