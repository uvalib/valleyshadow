                <p>The following statement was made at this office this p. m. by Charles Rian,
                    arrested by Col. Farnsworth, cavalry, and sent to these headquarters by Gen.
                    Porter, to wit:</p>
                <p>Charles Rian states that he is seventeen years old; born in Iowa City; left there
                    with his parents at the age of three of four years; moved to Albany, where his
                    father was engaged in the hide business, having a branch in Montreal. States he
                    left Albany with his mother at the age of five years and went to New Orleans;
                    remained there with John Brewster (an uncle); attended school (his mother in the
                    meantime was going to and from New York, Albany, and different other places in
                    the North) where informant remained four years, and went to Saint Mary's Parish,
                    about 150 miles, on the Gulf of Mexico, where he met his mother (this was in the
                    hot season); remained with her and an uncle, Henry Brewster, about six weeks, or
                    rather mouths, and thence to Bayou La Fourche, leaving his mother, where he
                    remained about two years; remained with friends sporting around. In the mean
                    time his farther had sold out his interest in Albany and Montreal and taken up
                    his residence in Baltimore, his mother still remaining at his uncle's at Saint
                    Mary's Parish. Informant went to Baltimore and met his father; remained a month
                    or two, and thence to New Orleans with his uncle, John Brewster; remained two or
                    three years, going to Dolbear's Commercial Institute, until the war broke out.
                    Left New Orleans soon after the battle of New Orleans, when he went to
                    Baltimore; remained with his father two weeks or so (his mother still remaining
                    at Saint Mary's); thence to Brooklyn, N. Y., where he remained in and about the
                    city with A. C. Alexander (no relation), a commission merchant, also with Lamin
                    Alexander (same business and place), and with other parties whose names
                    informant does not remember, leaving, 1st of March or thereabout, last; went to
                    Baltimore; remained a day or two with his father, who is in the commission
                    business, store 212 Levee; does not know what street, but his place of business
                    is on the river; boards at a private house; the street and number he does not
                    remember. Informant left the city and joined the First Maryland between
                    Winchester and Harper's Ferry on the 18th of March last; joined Company E, Capt.
                    Bass, Col. Kelley commanding; they were in a brigade commanded by a man with a
                    German name; heard it, but does not now remember it. States Company E was
                    detailed as scouts about three weeks after he joined it, and that informant was
                    in the battle of Winchester and Front Royal; was taken prisoner and conveyed to
                    Lynchburg, where he was confined about two weeks or so, when he made his escape
                    through the assistance of some young ladies who had called twice at the prison,
                    evincing a great deal of friendship. While there one day one them (does not know
                    their names) said to informant, "Why do you not escape?" Informant answered,
                    "How can I? When the young lady said she would engage the sentinel while he a
                    slipped out (this was in the evening). She did so, and he did slip, out went to
                    Richmond; walked up the railroad, reaching the above city on the evening of the
                    18th instant, he thinks; he was four days on the way, arriving there in the
                    evening; left the same night for Ashland. Having been to Richmond about four
                    years since (which fact, he had forgotten previously to state), was somewhat, a
                    very little, acquainted with the city; found a map at the library in the
                    capitol, which he examined and left for Ashland over the county road in the
                    night; had no trouble in leaving the city or on the road until he reached
                    Ashland, and then was not molested; was in the camp of the Fourth Virginia
                    Cavalry, perhaps two miles from Ashland, in the direction of Richmond; saw the
                    Jeff. Davis Legion from Mississippi, who were encamped directly opposite the
                    Fourth Virginia Cavalry, informant passed directly along the road between the
                    two encampments.</p>
                <p>The following informant has not stated to any one before, and being informed that
                    Gen. McClellan would see this statement, states as follows: States after passing
                    the above cavalry he went directly to Ashland, got upon the cars at Ashland, and
                    went down to the burnt bridge, crossed over, and got upon the train and went to
                    Gordonsville; there he saw two or three brigades of Jackson's immediate brigade;
                    one of them was Gen. Taylor's; the other two he does not remember, and in
                    returning saw troops stationed at Louisa Court-House, and coming up to
                    Frederick's Hall (next station) all of Maj.-Gen. Whiting's troops, four brigades
                    (Gen. Hood's was one), Gen. Whiting's old brigade (does not know who commands
                    it) and another, a Georgia brigade, and the fourth does not know. These are
                    Jackson's re-enforcements, and from what he could glean they came from Richmond
                    to Lynchburg and to Charlottesville, thence to Staunton, where they remained
                    until Jackson's army fell back to Charlottesville; then these re-enforcements
                    stationed at Staunton came up to Gordonsville on the cars. Ewell's command
                    arrived at Gordonsville before Jackson's, and in the meantime this division (the
                    re-enforcements) of Whiting's came up to Frederick's Hall, where informant saw
                    them, remaining a whole day; heard officers and also privates say, "Wish to Gold
                    it was the 28th;" does not know what they meant, unless they intended to attack
                    us in the rear upon that day, and having heard of Stuart's operations concluded
                    it was done to ascertain the situation of our forces. States he also heard a
                    lieutenant say (while informant was at Frederick's Hall) that it was the
                    intention of Johnston to make the attack in front on that day and for Jackson to
                    co-operate simultaneously in the rear. Informant thinks it was on the evening of
                    the 21st instant (the evening of the day he heard the above remark) that he left
                    last-named place (Frederick's Hall) and walked to Ashland, forty-odd miles, and
                    from Ashland informant came a circuitous route, consuming a day and a half, and
                    reached our lines or pickets on the Central Railroad, about four miles form the
                    camp of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry, by whom miles, was arrested. States after
                    leaving Ashland passed through a forest about two miles, and in coming into the
                    Telegraph road encountered a rebel picket within a few yards, who fired upon
                    him, when he ran one way and the picket another. Informant then pursued his
                    course down the Telegraph road, striking a small stream (heard the name, but
                    does not remember) running in rather an easterly direction. Informant inquired
                    of a farmer (who was a magistrate) just after he left Ashland what course he
                    must take to carry him in the vicinity of the Yankee pickets, using the term
                    Yankee and representing that he was a scout for the Confederacy in order to
                    convince the old fellow that he, informant, was all right. The old man marked
                    out the course informant must take in order to reach the nearest Union picket
                    without exposure. Informant followed the small steam (previously mentioned)
                    about three miles, until he struck the Central Railroad, and followed down the
                    railroad about three miles, and it being dark went to a house at left of the
                    railroad, asked to stay all night, was told he could not, and then inquired how
                    far the Union pickets were; the man then asked him who he (informant) was and
                    informant stated he was a Confederate scout; the man then told him (which
                    afterward turned out to be true) just where our pickets were. Informant then
                    left, took his direction, and got into the country road; went down about half a
                    mile (it was dark and stormy), and while walking along brought up against a
                    rope, which nearly threw him down, or nearly so; instantaneously informant heard
                    the rustling of bushes and the click of a gun, when informant immediately
                    prostrated himself and crawled off; going back some distance came to a haystack,
                    where he secreted himself until morning, and in the morning early he crossed
                    over to the Central Railroad; going down a short distance saw some cavalry, and
                    not knowing if they were Union or Confederates, got into the bushes hastily and
                    walked for a mile or more, thence back upon the railroad; walking a short
                    distance saw some cavalry within sight on the right-hand side; coming nearer saw
                    they wore our uniform; boldly stepping up told them who he was, and they
                    conducted him to a major commanding two regiments, which proved to be a portion
                    of the Eighth Illinois Cavalry. States he was detained and asked a thousand and
                    one questions, then sent to the colonel's headquarters (does not remember his
                    name), where he was again questioned and well treated, and then sent to the
                    provost-marshal of some division, and from there to these headquarters. This all
                    happened on the 24th.</p>
                <p>Informant states that he had our inform on when he arrived at Lynchburg; traded
                    off the coast for the one he has on; sold the pantaloons to procure money to
                    travel on; does yet remember exactly what he received for them, but thinks is
                    was $2 or $3. The pantaloons he purchased in Lynchburg; does not remember what
                    he gave for them; has no west; does not remember where he got the hat (straw)
                    that he has, but does not know if he traded for it or picked it up; knows he
                    obtained it between Richmond and Ashland, as it bothered him when he came to get
                    in the woods. States he wore our regular blue cap until he got the straw hat.
                    Informant has in his possession a 75-cent Lynchburg shinplaster. States he never
                    studied military tactics, but has frequently looked over Gilham's and Hardee's.
                    States the reason that he is so well posted as to generals, brigades, division,
                    etc., he is in the habit of making a memorandum of anything that would interest
                    him. States he has a very good memory, and would make any memorandum that he
                    wished to on a slip of paper retain it a few days until impressed upon his mind,
                    then cast the paper away. States his father, Stephen Rian (as previously
                    stated), was in Baltimore when he left; has not heard form him since that time,
                    and if not in Baltimore may have gone to New Orleans, or Saint Mary's where his
                    mother was when he last heard from her by letter directed to him at Harper's
                    Ferry or some place in Virginia. States his mother's name ere she was married
                    was Mary Brewster, and that Henry Brewster, with whom she was staying in Saint
                    Mary's Parish, is a brother of his mother's, so also John Brewster. States he
                    has a host of relatives living in the North and South also, but is unable to
                    give their names, or where they reside; could if the was home (Saint Mary's
                    Parish) by looking over old files of letters. States he is acquainted with two
                    young men in Baltimore; one of their names is Frank Maes; does not remember the
                    other one's name: "is not a very good hand to remember names," unless his
                    attention is particularly called to it, unless it might be some person of height
                    standing. States he does no know how many Union prisoners were confined at
                    Lynchburg, except that there were forty confined where he was. States the battle
                    of Front Royal was on the 23d of May, if he remembers right. States he never
                    heard of Johnston's being wounded. States he has not heard anything more than
                    there was a fight between our forces and the rebels near Richmond; did not hear
                    the exact place where it occurred. States coming here in the way he has there is
                    no doubt in his mind that he is looked upon with suspicion, but he considers he
                    is as good a Union boy as ever shouldered a musket. States that is passing
                    through the cavalry camps near Ashland (previously mentioned) he learned through
                    as passing remark from some one (it was dusk or dark) the Gen. Jackson was at or
                    near Gordonsville, and his curiosity being excited, and he being determined to
                    come within the lines of the Union army, determined to obtain all the
                    information in his power that would aid Gen. McClellan, thereby took the steps
                    he did, and went to Gordonsville, as previously stated. States while in camp,
                    after he joined the First Maryland, he took occasion to study the map and make
                    himself as familiar as possible with the country, its roads, &amp;c., and
                    their company being selected as a scouting one, he took more paints to inform
                    himself in order to be perfectly familiar with the country. States he does not
                    know from whom their company received their orders, and that the captain was not
                    always with them, that the company was mostly made up of Baltimoreans, that they
                    scouted around to obtain information of the enemy, and some of them even went so
                    far as to enter the lines of the enemy, but he never did; some of them even more
                    of a sharpshooter, and he is not sure that the name of the colonel (as given by
                    him) is correct, or that the company was really known as belonging to the
                    regiment. Informant states that while he was with the company (which was but a
                    short time) they never drilled with the regiment.</p>
                <p>I would most respectfully state that this young man is one of the most important
                    persons that it has been my privilege to examine, being highly educated, shrewd,
                    and thoroughly posted upon the names of all thoroughly posted. He has evinced
                    great anxiety since he has come here to have an interview with Maj.-Gen.
                    McClellan, saying his only object in acting as he has since he left the prisons
                    at Lynchburg being to acquire information for the purpose of bringing it to the
                    major-general commanding. Various inconsistencies and contradictions will be
                    observed in the detail of his personal history, though his statement in regard
                    to the military movements of the rebels all appear consistent, and even after a
                    rigid examination he still adheres with great particularity to that portion of
                    his statement. My own impression is that he has been sent within our lines for
                    the purpose of conveying to us the precise information which he has thus
                    conveyed. On searching his person I find the following memorandum concealed in
                    his drawers:</p>
                <p>Baker.<lb/> STELTON:<lb/> Say to him that Doct. Lumpkins is well in Richmond.</p>
                <p>The above memorandum is written on a printed sheet, apparently of a pamphlet of a
                    highly rebellious character. In explanation of how he came in possession of this
                    memorandum he states that this was handed to him by the lady who aided him to
                    escape from the prison in Lynchburg, to be handed by him to a person in the
                    suburbs of Lynchburg, which would make him (Rian) known to this person, who
                    would aid him, but that he (Rian) did not so call. I would respectfully,
                    however, call your attention to the fact that this prisoner Rian was taken by
                    the Eighth Illinois Cavalry, on the Virginia Central Railroad, within about one
                    or two miles of the house of Doctor Lumpkins, who, you will find by reference to
                    my map, resides on the Mechanicsville turnpike, at a point on that road fifteen
                    miles from Ashland. Doctor Lumpkins has been an active rebel, and fled to
                    Richmond upon the approach of our army, and I would respectfully suggest that it
                    is more than probable that his intention was to go to Lumpkins for the purpose
                    of conveying information to the rebels within our lines, or receiving
                    information from persons at Lumpkins' or connected with Lumpkins' family, and
                    conveying the same to the enemy. I would respectfully suggest that the
                    information conveyed by Rian is or may be of such a character as to require
                    immediate attention, and in conclusion I would respectfully recommend that the
                    prisoners Rian be held in close confinement as a spy until the future shall
                    develop the truth or falsity of his statement.</p>
                <p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>
