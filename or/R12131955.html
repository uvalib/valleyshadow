<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General in Chief Henry Halleck replies to Robert Schenck concerning a reported
                    January, 1863, Confederate advance on Winchester from Staunton. Halleck reports
                    Ambrose Burnside's opinion that the Confederate advance is only a false
                alarm.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. SCHENCK, Baltimore:</p>
<p>Washington,</p>
<p>January 7, 1863</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Burnside does not attach any credit to the telegrams of Gen. Milroy in
                    regard to enemy's movements. Gen. Milroy has cried "wolf" so often that he may
                    not be believed when the wolf really comes. As I have already stated to you, I
                    do not think it safe to keep Gen. Milroy at Winchester with any large force.</p>
<p>The country between the Kanawha Valley and Staunton, if I am correctly informed,
                    is such that a military force cannot operate there in the winter season. Gen.
                    Cox has sent two regiments from the Kanawha to Gen. Kelley, and as soon as the
                    snow is a little deeper I shall direct him to send more. He is of opinion that
                    the forces at Staunton are to move against him. I do not believe it; but will
                    permit him to retain his forces, at least for a short time. If matters turn out
                    satisfactorily in Kentucky, the whole of Gen. Cox's forces may be added to your
                    command.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>H. W. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief.</p>
