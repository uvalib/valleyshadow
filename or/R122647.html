<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson writes Colonel Edward D. Townsend in May, 1861,
                    concerning the outfitting and deploying of new regiments. He mentions several
                    regiments located, in varying states of readiness, at Chambersburg.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> A. A. G., Headquarters of the
                        Army, Washington City:</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pa.,  </p>
<p>May 23 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>In compliance with verbal intimation from the Gen.-in-Chief, I present for his
                    information in tabular form the locations of the regiments now in this
                    department; the condition of their equipment, accouterments, clothing,
                    &amp;c., and the probable time they can be put in motion, fully equipped.
                    The probable time is based on the accompanying statement from the commander of
                    Frankford Arsenal, to which I respectfully refer. I also call attention to the
                    offer herewith of the quartermaster-general of this State. With his aid six
                    regiments can be thrown into the field as rapidly as the accouterments can be
                    distributed, say Monday. Without his assistance (accepted by telegraph through
                    me) the term of service of some of the regiments will expire before they are
                    equipped, or they will be provided at so distant a day that new shoes and other
                    clothing will have to be issued, unless accouterments are provided outside of
                    this department. Col. Hale offers some four thousand sets. I am anxious to
                    forward the views of the Gen.-in-Chief and to execute his designs, and will be
                    much gratified to have the means of putting in the field regiments well drilled
                    and desirous of seeing service. If desirable, they can be sent forward without
                    accouterments,but without them the men lack confidence in each other and inflict
                    severe injuries.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
