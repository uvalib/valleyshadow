<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During July, 1861, fighting in western Virginia, Staunton served as an
                    important Confederate base of supply and reinforcement. In this letter,
                    Confederate General Henry R. Jackson writes Michael G. Harman, quartermaster at
                    Staunton, concerning reinforcements for the front.</p>

<p>Maj. M. G. HARMAN, Quartermaster, Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p> Monterey, Va.,</p>
<p>July 23, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>Yours of yesterday has just been placed in my hands (about 7 a. m.), and it will
                    consequently be impossible for me to get the courier back to you by 10 o'clock
                    this morning.</p>
<p>I must still continue to press upon you the importance of sending troops, with
                    supplies and ammunition, as rapidly as possible, by the way of Millborough, to
                    the Huttonsville turnpike. As I have already written and telegraphed to yourself
                    and to headquarters, this point is equidistant from Huntersville and the
                    Millborough Station, and the road thither is a common country road and very
                    rough. Until further notice do not send any more troops to this point.</p>
<p>I do not think that Capt. Marye's artillery will be in any danger whatsoever
                    between Millborough and Huntersville. Col. Lee's command will be on the road in
                    advance of him, and between himself and the enemy. At Huntersville he will see
                    Capt. Cole, with whom he can confer as to any danger beyond that point. I cannot
                    weaken Col. Lee's command, already quite too small for the end to be
                    accomplished, in order to guard against the possibility of danger, and I have no
                    cavalry with me fit to be sent to the Warm Springs who are not upon necessary
                    and arduous duty.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, yours,</p>
<p>H. R. JACKSON.</p>
