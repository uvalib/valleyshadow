<p> P. H. WATSON, Esq.,<br> Assistant Secretary of War:</p>
<p></p>
<p>April 10, 1863.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>Mr. G. S. Smith, whom you sent down to me, has made his report, and his
                    explanations are consistent, and appear satisfactory. I have sent him to Gen.
                    Hooker's headquarters, and submitted his case to that officer. He gives some
                    points of information that seem to be important for you to know:</p>
<p>1. The rebel force on the Rappahannock has not been diminished. Two divisions of
                    Longstreet's troops have returned to Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>2. The rebels are fortifying the fords of the Rapidan, and intend to fight on
                    that stream and at Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>3. There are no works or troops on the railroad from Culpeper to within 3 mile of
                    Richmond. All the heights around Richmond are fortified. He saw three of these
                    works, viz: One on the Williamsburg road, with ten heavy guns mounted-very
                    formidable; one on Murray Hill, with eight heavy guns and two light
                    ones-mounted; one between Murray Hill and the river, with three light guns.</p>
<p>4.*** The Merrimac No. 2 and one gunboat are at Fort Darling. Two new iron-clads
                    now building, on model of Merrimac No. 2; no iron on yet; one planked, the other
                    not quite. The iron appears to be ready. No troops to be seen near Richmond,
                    except in the fortifications.</p>
<p>5.*** The bread riots in Richmond were gotten up by Union men, of whom there are
                    as many as ever. There is much suffering among the citizens in the South, but
                    the soldiers are well supplied and are in good heart and spirits. Everybody has
                    been conscripted. The troops have 22 ounces per day of flour, one-fourth pound
                    of meat, with some sugar and rice occasionally. The rebel officers at Culpeper
                    appear to think it is not the intention to hold that country if pressed, but to
                    fight on the Rapidan and at Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>6.*** The blockade-runners ship their goods by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to
                    Long Creek Station, and from thence pass down the Valley through Brock's Gap to
                    Staunton.</p>
<p>7.*** There is a brigade of cavalry near Winchester, under Jones. White's
                    battalion is between Jones and Culpeper. Cobb's Cavalry Legion is near Madison,
                    at Wolftown.</p>
<p>8.*** The rebels are seizing all the able-bodied negroes north of the
                    Rappahannock and taking them south.</p>
<p>Please acknowledge the receipt of this.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. PLEASONTON,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
