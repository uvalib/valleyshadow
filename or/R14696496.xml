                <p>Your dispatch of to-day received. I feel very certain of being able to break the
                    Central railroad and the canal as soon as the weather will permit. At present we
                    have twelve inches of snow on the ground, and have had snow on the ground since
                    the 10th of last December, with extremely cold weather. All the late expeditions
                    to break up guerrilla bands have had many men frost-bitten. The following is my
                    latest information as to the movements of the enemy; this information I have had
                    through different scourges for the last ten days: Two divisions of the troops
                    from the Valley were encamped on the road from Petersburg to Richmond; the other
                    division was in the trenches, having taken the place of a division sent south,
                    said to be Kershaw's. Wharton's division, from 3,000 to 4,000 strong, was on the
                    railroad, near Fisherville, between Staunton and Waynesborough. Lomax's cavalry
                    moved from the east side of the Blue Ridge to the Valley, and thence to Warm
                    Springs, scattered through the numerous little valleys in the vicinity of
                    Harrisonburg. Rosser sent Wickham's brigade to the east side of Blue Ridge; his
                    own (Rosser's) brigade was six miles west of Staunton. Payne's brigade was near
                    Lexington. Two horse batteries were disbanded and pieces sent to Waynesborough
                    or Richmond. There was considerable artillery in the upper Valley in the
                    vicinity of Lynchburg. This artillery belonged to the infantry division sent by
                    Early to Richmond, as these divisions I know did not take their batteries with
                    them. It has been reported to me within a day or two that one brigade of
                    Wharton's division had left for Dublin Station; probably it went to Richmond.
                    The foregoing information was obtained from a man that I sent to Richmond; also
                    from my scouts sent to Staunton. Since then I have sent down to burn the bridge
                    at Lynchburg. There has been the report here, and it has undoubtedly reached the
                    rebels, that there was to be a big cavalry raid sent out from this point. This
                    report was brought here from Washington, where it originated. It may have caused
                    this movement of artillery by the rebels.</p>
