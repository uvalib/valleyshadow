<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General August Moor reports on a February, 1863, expedition to Pocahontas
                    County to capture supplies and Confederate recruiting parties. He mentions a
                    plan by Confederate General John Imboden to invade Union counties with regiments
                    from Staunton, VA.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Buckhannon, Va.,</p>
<p>February 17, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that on the 10th instant I started an expedition from
                    Beverly, consisting of 60 cavalry and 75 infantry, commanded by Capt. Chatham T.
                    Ewing, Second Regiments Virginia Volunteer Infantry, to capture rebel recruiting
                    parties and stores in Pocahontas Country.</p>
<p>Capt. Ewing was instructed to proceed with the mounted men that night to the
                    summit of Cheat Mountain, the infantry to go as far as Huttonsville; that
                    mounted men to proceed to Greenback the next day, and the infantry to follow as
                    a reserve to Greenbier River, and there to await the return of the mounted men.</p>
<p>Capt. Ewing, minding instructions, succeeded in surprising everything. He secured
                    13 prisoners from the Thirty-first and Third Virginia (rebel) regiments, 152
                    head of cattle, 15 horses and mules, and a large number of arms, which he had to
                    destroy for want of transportation, without any loss or accident on our side.</p>
<p>Capt. Ewing deserves praise for his perseverance. He put a damper on the rebel
                    rejoicing over the disgraceful conduct of Maj. Henry C. Flesher.</p>
<p>I also received reliable information that, as soon as the condition of the roads
                    permit, two more regiments from Staunton will join Imboden, to invade loyal
                    counties of West Virginia, and take all the horses out, after driving in our
                    outposts; therefore I ought to have more cavalry and one battery in the brigade,
                    in time to be ready to meet any force at any place along my front. The
                    uncertainty as to what forces really belong to my command is a great
                    embarrassment to me. I hope soon to be relieved of it.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. MOOR,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
