<p>ADJUTANT-GEN. U. S. ARMY</p>
<p>Harper's Ferry</p>
<p>August 8, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department
                    since my last, of date June 8, forwarded from Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont, I marched on Staunton (June 6)
                    and occupied the town without opposition, the enemy, with the shattered remnant
                    of his army, having retreated to Waynesborough and Rockfish Gap, in the Blue
                    Ridge, ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued. At
                    Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores, consisting of shoes,
                    saddles, harness, and clothing, 3 cannon and about 1,000 stand of small-arms,
                    also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and
                    equipments. I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for
                    several miles east and west of the town, burning all the depot buildings, shops,
                    and warehouses belonging to the road. About 500 prisoners (for the most part
                    wounded and invalids) fell into our hands here.</p>
<p>On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Gen.'s Crook and Averell, about
                    10,000 men, with two batteries. This command, returning from a successful raid
                    on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton, had
                    struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this
                    road as they marched to the point of junction, making in all a total destruction
                    of the road for a distance of fifty miles. From this point I sent back by way of
                    Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons, prisoners, and refugees, guarded by
                    800 men whose term of enlistment had expired, the whole under the command of
                    Col. A. Moor, of the Twenty-eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry.</p>
<p>Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on
                    the 10th toward Lexington, moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly
                    parallel. The infantry division under Gen. Crook, and the cavalry division under
                    Gen. Averell, moving on the right-hand road, were opposed by McCausland, with
                    about 2,000 mounted men and a battery.</p>
<p>He was easily driven, however, and on the 11th took refuge in the town of
                    Lexington, behind the North River, a tributary of the James. Gen.'s Crook and
                    Averell arriving about midday on the 11th, found the bridge across this stream
                    burnt, and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery. The infantry
                    division under Gen. Sullivan, which moved on the road to the left, and which I
                    accompanied in person, had met with no enemy thus far, but at the sound of
                    Crook's guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town. I
                    found the enemy's sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the
                    opposite cliffs and in some store-houses at the bridge, and also occupying the
                    buildings of the Virginia Military Institute, which stood near the river. Their
                    artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town, and on some heights
                    just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery
                    (thirty guns). This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of Gen. McCausland to defend
                    an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself
                    behind the private dwellings of women and children, might have brought
                    justifiable destruction upon the whole town, but as this was not rendered
                    imperative by any military necessity, I preferred to spare private property and
                    an unarmed population. Instead of crushing the place with my artillery, I sent
                    Gen. Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance, and
                    fall upon the enemy's flank and rear. Before this movement was completed, the
                    enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan. The
                    battalion of Cadets, about 250 muskets, took part in the defense and retired by
                    the Balcony Falls road toward Lynchburg. I was told that Col. Smith, principal
                    of the Institute, and commanding the Cadets, protested against the attempted
                    defense as entirely futile, purposeless, and unnecessarily exposing the town and
                    its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction. In occupying this place a
                    few prisoners were taken, 5 pieces of cannon, with numerous caissons and gun
                    carriages, some small-arms, and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and
                    were destroyed; 6 barges laden with commissary stores, artillery ammunition, and
                    6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the
                    town. A number of extensive iron-works in the vicinity were burned.</p>
<p>On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings
                    connected with it. I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from
                    John Letcher, lately Governor of Virginia, inciting the population of the
                    country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops, and ascertaining that
                    after having advised his fellow-citizens to this course the ex-Governor had
                    himself ignominiously taken to flight, I ordered his property to be burned under
                    my order, published May 24, against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful
                    and uncivilized warfare. Having had information that a train of 200 wagons,
                    loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry, was en route
                    following our march, I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake
                    us. I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffie, from whom I had not
                    definitely heard for two days.</p>
<p>While awaiting news from Duffie, on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan
                    with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and, if possible, secure the
                    bridge over the James River at that place. Before starting Gen. Averell detached
                    a party of 200 picked men, with orders to ride around Lynchburg, cutting the
                    railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 13th Gen. Duffie arrived and made a report of his
                    operations in person. On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with
                    the other columns. A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesborough drove the
                    enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running
                    southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge. Driving a small force from
                    White's Gap, Gen. Duffie crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and
                    Lynchburg railroad, menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court-House,
                    and breaking the road at Arrington Station. He was followed from Waynesborough
                    by a large mounted force under Imboden, who, however, never hazarded a general
                    attack, and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the
                    movements of our troops. In addition to the damage done to the railroad, Gen.
                    Duffie captured 100 prisoners, about 500 horses, and destroyed large quantities
                    of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden's train. He returned by Tye
                    River Gap, without serious loss.</p>
<p>On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in
                    command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap, while from prisoners and others we
                    had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from
                    Richmond, and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court-House. At
                    the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy
                    in or near Lynchburg.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command to-ward Buchanan, and on
                    arriving there found it occupied by Averell. He had driven McCausland sharply
                    from the place, capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with
                    stores, but had not succeeded in saving the bridge. As there was a convenient
                    and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its
                    loss. In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the
                    inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge, but
                    McCausland, with his characteristic recklessness, persisted in the needless
                    destruction, involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration. The
                    farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly
                    efforts of our troops, who extinguished the flames.</p>
<p>On the 15th I moved from Buchanan, crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter
                    road. This road was blockade by felled trees, and our advance feebly contested
                    by some light parties of the enemy. It was, however, easily cleared, and on the
                    evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty, the country town of
                    Bedford, on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, twenty-four miles from
                    Lynchburg. At this point the detachment of picked men (200), which had been sent
                    out by Gen. Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg, reported,
                    having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss. Moving
                    eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the
                    Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court-House, tearing up the track for a
                    short distance. Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below
                    Lynchburg, destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance, and burning
                    two trains at Concordia Station; from thence making a circuit within a few miles
                    of Lynchburg they turned westward, meeting the advance of the main army at
                    Liberty. Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain
                    any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy. Through rebel channels
                    we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and
                    Grant. Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court-House,
                    while others said that he was already in Lynchburg. Negro refugees just from the
                    town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and
                    militia, and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their
                    movable property by every available route. At the same time, from other sources
                    equally worthy of respect, we were assured that all the rebel forces of West
                    Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge, and that Ewell's corps of
                    veteran troops, 20,000 strong, had already re-enforced them.</p>
<p>To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately. Early on
                    the 16th Gen. Duffie moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road, sending a
                    strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report
                    which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point. Gen. Crook's
                    division of infantry moved by the railroad, destroying it effectually as they
                    marched. Gen. Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike, followed by
                    Sullivan's infantry, the reserve artillery, and the baggage train. Gen. Averell
                    continued to drive McCausland before him, but in the afternoon reported that the
                    enemy had been re-enforced, and was becoming stubborn. Encamped at night near
                    the Bedford turnpike, seven miles east of Liberty, my cavalry advanced near the
                    Great Otter River. From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons
                    which had overtaken us at Lexington. Col. Putnam, with his regiment of Ohio
                    100-days' volunteers, was detailed to guard it, and the train put under the
                    direction of Capt. McCann, assistant quartermaster. This train was accompanied
                    by a large number of loyal refugees, both whites and negroes, and the route
                    proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle, Sweet Springs,
                    Lewisburg, and Charleston, Kanawha. During the night received information from
                    Gen. Averell that he had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had
                    driven him, but that he had evidently been re-enforced and was becoming
                    aggressive.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move, but
                    the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River, owing to the
                    difficulty in crossing the artillery, and in consequence we did not overtake the
                    enemy until 4 o'clock in the afternoon. At that hour Averell's advance came upon
                    the enemy, strongly posted and intrenched at Diamond Hill, five miles from
                    Lynchburg. He immediately attacked, and a sharp contest ensued. Crook's infantry
                    arriving at the same time, made a brilliant advance upon the enemy, drove him
                    from his works back upon the town, killing and wounding a number and capturing
                    70 men and 1 gun. It being too late to follow up this success, we encamped upon
                    the battle-field. The best information to be obtained at this point of the
                    enemy's forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore
                    operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg, under
                    the command of Gen. Breckinridge. This force was variously estimated at from
                    10,000 to 15,000 men, well supplied with artillery, and protected by strong
                    works.</p>
<p>During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without
                    intermission, while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the
                    arrival of large bodies of troops in the town yet up to the morning of the 18th.
                    I had no positive information as to whether Gen. Lee had detached any
                    considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg. To settle the question on this
                    morning, I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll-gate on the Bedford road,
                    two miles from the town, and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy
                    behind their works. This skirmishing with musketry, occasionally assisted by the
                    artillery, was kept up during the whole of the forenoon. Their works consisted
                    of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles
                    apart, flanked on either side by rifle-pits protected by abatis. On these lines
                    the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them.
                    I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road
                    ready to move to the right or left as required, the artillery in commanding
                    positions, and Averell's cavalry division in reserve. Duffie was ordered to
                    attack resolutely on the Forestville road, our extreme left, while Averell sent
                    two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court-House road on
                    our extreme right. This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade.
                    Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines, hoping to find a weak interval through
                    which I might push with my infantry, passing between the main redoubts, which
                    appeared too strong for a direct assault. While the guns were sounding on the
                    two flanks, the enemy, no doubt, supposing my center weakened by too great
                    extension of my lines, and hoping to cut us in two, suddenly advanced in great
                    force from his works, and commenced a most determined attack on my position on
                    the Bedford turnpike. Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as
                    almost to amount to a surprise, yet it was promptly and gallantly met by
                    Sullivan's division, which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to
                    get his troops up. After a fierce contest of half an hour's duration, the
                    enemy's direct attack was repulsed, but he persistently renewed the fight,
                    making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main
                    body and Duffie's division. In this effort he was completely foiled, and at the
                    end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in
                    disorder and with heavy loss. In the eagerness of pursuit, one regiment (One
                    hundred and sixteenth Ohio) entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy,
                    but being unsupported, fell back with trifling loss. Our whole loss in this
                    action was comparatively light. The infantry behaved with the greatest
                    steadiness, and the artillery, which materially assisted in repelling the
                    attack, was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency. This affair closed
                    about 2 p. m. From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a
                    portion of Ewell's corps was engaged in the action, and that the whole corps,
                    20,000 strong, under the command of Lieut.-Gen. Early, was either already in
                    Lynchburg or near at hand. The detachment sent by Gen. Averell to operate on our
                    right had returned, reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel
                    cavalry in that quarter, while Duffie, although holding his position, sent word
                    that he was pressed by a superior force. It had now become sufficiently evident
                    that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical
                    strength of mine, and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact
                    that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well
                    contested battle. I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to
                    retire by the Bedford turnpike, and made preparations to withdraw the army as
                    soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the
                    enemy. Meanwhile, as there still remained five hours of daylight, they were
                    ordered to maintain a firm front, and with skirmishers to press the enemy's
                    lines at all points. I have since learned that Early's whole force was up in
                    time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon (18th)-an attack which
                    under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered
                    cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge, and deceived by the firm
                    attitude of my command, he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose,
                    expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning. As soon as it
                    became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force, leaving a line of pickets close
                    to the enemy, with orders to remain until 12 'clock (midnight), and then follow
                    the main body. This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or
                    material, excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by
                    mistake.</p>
<p>We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty, and the
                    following day, 19th, at our leisure, moved toward Buford's Gap, occupying the
                    town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy, who in all
                    probability had not suspected the movement until daylight. About 4 p. m. the
                    rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy's advance of cavalry and
                    mounted men and driven, after a spirited action, through the town and back on my
                    main body. The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile
                    west of Liberty, but no attack was made.</p>
<p>About midnight we resumed our march and next morning, 20th, entered Buford's Gap.
                    Gen. Duffie, who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the
                    Blue Ridge, found it disputed by a small body of the enemy, which he swept out
                    of his way with little difficulty. The march was continued to Bonsack's Station,
                    on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, destroying bridges, water-tanks, and
                    depot buildings on that road as we moved. The enemy coming up to our rear guard
                    on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration, but was easily
                    repulsed.</p>
<p>During the night our march was continued to Salem, destroying all the bridges,
                    contents, and depot buildings on the railroad. We arrived at Salem about sunrise
                    on the 21st. About 9 a. m. the enemy made a demonstration against our rear
                    guard. While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and
                    reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road, and through some
                    inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery. While our
                    attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy's
                    cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries,
                    spiking the guns, disabling the carriages, and carrying off the horses. They
                    were presently driven off by our cavalry, losing some 30 men, killed, wounded,
                    and prisoners, and the guns were recaptured. Owing to the loss of horses and the
                    breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers
                    and caissons, after burning all their carriages. From Salem the enemy's cavalry
                    followed us to Catawba Valley, where we rested that night.</p>
<p>On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled, and from
                    that date the army pursued its course unmolested. On the night of the 22d we
                    rested at New Castle. At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating
                    his forces at Salem. Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large
                    force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs. Cavalry
                    reconnaissances toward Fincastle, Covington, and Sweet Springs failed to
                    discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report.</p>
<p>On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs. On account of the
                    difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many
                    horses on this march. At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train
                    and convoy under Col. Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas, led by one
                    Thurmond, and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken
                    the road to Beverly. From this point it was suggested that we should move
                    northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac, a
                    route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah. By
                    this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New
                    Creek and Cumberland. It was objected that by this road the troops would find it
                    impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the
                    enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg. In favor of the route via
                    Lewisburg to Charleston, Kanawha, it was urged that the road was clear and
                    practicable, and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the
                    way of supplies, yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River. As
                    the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the
                    Kanawha route was decided upon, and messengers immediately sent forward to have
                    supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops.</p>
<p>On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs. From
                    this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going
                    toward Beverly, and assist Col. Putnam in its defense if necessary.</p>
<p>On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff.
                    I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had
                    become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas, and had, with baggage and
                    supplies, fallen back to Gauley Bridge.</p>
<p>On the 27th, between Meadow Bluff and Gauley, met the supply train with 70,000
                    rations for the troops; they arrived in good time to prevent suffering, and
                    their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers. Halted for the night near Gauley
                    Bridge. Remained here on the 28th and 29th, allowing time for stragglers to come
                    up and to refresh and organize the command.</p>
<p>Arrived at Charleston, Kanawha, on the 30th June, and remained until July 3,
                    reorganizing and refitting the troops, and gathering up steamers to transport
                    the army by water to Parkersburg. Feeling assured that the enemy would take
                    advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the
                    Valley, every nerve was strained to hasten their movement. But the obstacles
                    were for a time insurmountable. After their recent fatigues neither men nor
                    animals were in any condition for a farther march, and the excessive heat of the
                    weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army. Transportation
                    by water, if practicable, would save time, and rest the men and horses. Yet, on
                    account of the long drought, the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be
                    impassable to the smallest boats; nevertheless, all the light-draught boats that
                    could be found were seized and the troops embarked.</p>
<p>Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4, I received information that
                    the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley, had driven Sigel out of
                    Martinsburg, and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several
                    points west. The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward
                    with the utmost diligence and zeal, yet the difficulties were even greater than
                    at first appeared. The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched
                    around; at other points the boats could not pass, even when thus lightened, and
                    small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points,
                    where they were in their turn obliged to stop. In this way the troops got in
                    slowly, but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to
                    march by land. The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land
                    route. At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the
                    transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland.</p>
<p>On the night of 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning
                    of the 9th at 10 a. m. Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was
                    in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy.
                    Imboden's attempts on the railroad at Sir John's and at South Branch and
                    Patterson's Creek had been repulsed, and Sullivan, occupying Hedgesville with
                    infantry and cavalry, reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry.</p>
<p>Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops, who
                    continued to arrive slowly from the West.</p>
<p>On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, reaching Martinsburg
                    about midday. At this place Gen. Sigel reported in person with a detailed
                    account of his operations and the military situation. Reached Harper's Ferry on
                    horseback the same night.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. HUNTER,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
