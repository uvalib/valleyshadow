<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton commanded the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the
                    Potomac which included the 17th Pa. Cavalry. Pleasonton provides a list of
                    casualties.</p>

<p>Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 29, 1863</p>
<p>GENERAL</p>
<p>I shall order General Merritt to re-enforce General Gregg with one of his
                    brigades. This will secure the road from Ely's Ford to the plank road, and
                    Gregg's command ought to be able to protect that. Indeed, that whole road is so
                    wooded that cavalry cannot act to any advantage upon it.</p>
<p>General Custer has just reported that Fitz. Lee's division of cavalry is in his
                    front; that the enemy has his scouts in Culpeper, and that this afternoon his
                    signal officer read a dispatch from Clark's Mountain stating, "There is nothing
                    but cavalry on the other side of the river." This was read from a house near
                    Morton's Ford.</p>
<p>After sending a brigade from Merritt to Gregg, his force alone will not be
                    adequate to protect the trains on the other side of the river. Custer and
                    Merritt together will make about 4,000 men, the number Fitz. Lee has, and should
                    Custer be removed from the fords to this side of the river, the enemy's cavalry
                    can attack any weak point of our trains to advantage. With the present
                    information I would recommend that General Custer remain where he is, as the
                    best position he can occupy, to cover the trains and give timely notice of any
                    danger to them. Gregg with three brigades should be able to cover the
                    communication on this side against cavalry, and if infantry is sent against him
                    it will be necessary to send him some also.</p>
<p>Please inform me if this explanation meets the views of the general.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>A. PLEASONTON, Major-General.</p>
