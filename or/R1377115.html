<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General in Chief Henry Halleck writes Ulysses S. Grant to discuss the July,
                    1864, situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Halleck mentions that Confederate
                    Generals Early, Breckinridge, and Jackson, along with Mosby's guerrillas, were
                    on the move from Staunton.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> City Point, Va.:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON</p>
<p>July 3, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Sigel reports that Early, Breckinridge, and Jackson, with Mosby's
                    guerrillas, are said to be moving from Staunton down the Shenandoah Valley. I
                    ordered Gen. Hunter up to the line of the railroad, but he has replied to none
                    of my telegrams, and has made no report of his operations or present condition.
                    Sigel has been ordered to telegraph directly to him, to inform him of the
                    condition of affairs, and to ask for instructions. It is possible that Hunter is
                    marching by Beverly and Moorefield or Romney, which would account for his not
                    answering dispatches. The three principal officers on the line of the road are
                    Sigel, Stahel, and Max Weber. You can, therefore, judge what probability there
                    is of a good defense if the enemy should attack the line in force.</p>
