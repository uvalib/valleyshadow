<p><b>Summary:<br></b>George Eyster, Provost Marshal for the Sixteenth District of Pennsylvania, writes
                    from Chambersburg in June, 1863, to the Provost Marshal General concerning
                    opposition to the draft in Bedford County. Eyster reports that resisters burned
                    the sawmill of one enroller in that county, but that he will only use force if
                    absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Col. J. B. FRY,<br> Provost-Marshall-Gen., Washington,
                        D. C.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg,</p>
<p>June 8, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that on the 5th instant I received information
                    (telegram No. 1) that Henry Ickes, the enroller for the sub-district No. 38, the
                    township of Saint Clair, in Bedford County, had met with resistance; that his
                    saw-mill was burnt and himself effectually intimated from the further
                    prosecution of his work. To give you all the information in my power, I inclose
                    a copy (No. 2) of Mr. Ickes' letter to me. This gentleman I cannot but believe
                    acted judiciously in the discharge of his duties. He is an elderly person, has
                    been or is a justice of the peace, and was recommended to me by several of the
                    best citizens of Bedrod. The spirit of opposition with which he has been met is
                    but the outcropping of that which well-informed persons apprised me a month ago
                    existed in that neighborhood. In order to ascertain the real condition of
                    things, I dispatched D. A. Wertz, esq., to Bedford on Saturday morning with
                    instructions to obtain the names of the guilty parties, with proofs, and consult
                    with Messrs. King, Russell, Cessna, and Washabaugh, and gentlemen of
                    intelligence and distinction. As will be seen by Mr. Wertz's telegram to me (No.
                    3) of this date, resistance to the enrollment has manifested itself in Napier
                    Township, in addition to Saint Clair, and the enroller damaged by the
                    destruction of his property. The copies of telegrams (Nos. 4 and 5) inclosed
                    will inform you of my proposed action in this emergency. I will add that I shall
                    resort to force only when in my judgment it shall become necessary.</p>
<p>The enrollment is in rapid progress over the district, and I see at present
                    nothing to prevent its completion by the 20th instant. Possibly a few
                    sub-districts may not send in complete lists before the 25th.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>GEORGE EYSTER,<br> Provost-Marshal Sixteenth District of Pennsylvania.</p>
