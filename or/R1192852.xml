                <p>Confederate Cavalry General J. E. B. Stuart reports on his October, 1862, raid
                    into Pennsylvania and Maryland. He discusses the capture of Chambersburg
                    including the surrender of the town by prominent local citizens, the capture of
                    arms and supplies, and the destruction of railroad and storage buildings.</p>

                <p>I have the honor to report that, on the 9th instant, in compliance with
                    instructions from the commanding general Army of Northern Virginia, I proceeded
                    on an expedition into Pennsylvania with a cavalry force of 1,800 and four pieces
                    of horse artillery, under command of Brig.-Gen. Hampton and Cols. W. H. F. Lee
                    and Jones. This force rendezvoused at Darkesville at 12 m., and marched thence
                    to the vicinity of Hedgesville, where it encamped for the night.</p>
                <p>At daylight next morning, October 10, I crossed the Potomac at McCoy's(between
                    Williamsport and Hancock) with some little opposition, capturing two or there
                    horses of enemy's pickets. We were told here by citizens that a large force had
                    encamped the night before at Clear Spring, and were supposed to be en route to
                    Cumberland. We proceeded northward until we reached the turnpike leading from
                    Hagerstown to Hancock (known as the National road). Here a signal station on the
                    mountain and most of the party, with their flags and apparatus, were surprised
                    and captured, and also 8 or 10 prisoners of war, from whom, as well as from
                    citizens, I found that the large force alluded to had crossed but an hour ahead
                    of me toward Cumberland, and consisted of six regiments of Ohio troops and two
                    batteries, under Gen. Cox, and were en route via Cumberland for the Kanawha. I
                    sent back this intelligence at once to the commanding general. Striking directly
                    across the National road, I proceeded in the direction of Mercersburg, Pa.,
                    which point was reached about 12m. I was extremely anxious to reach Hagerstown,
                    where large supplies were stored, but was satisfied, from reliable information,
                    the notice the enemy had of my approach and the proximity of his forces would
                    enable him to prevent my capturing it. I therefore turned toward Chambersburg. I
                    did not reach this point until after dark, in a rain. I did not deem it safe to
                    defer the attack until morning, nor was it proper to attack a place full of
                    women and children without summoning it first to surrender. I accordingly sent
                    in a flag of truce, and found no military or civil authority in the place, but
                    some prominent citizens who met the officer were notified that the place would
                    be occupied, and if any resistance were made, the place would be shelled in
                    three minutes. Brig, Gen. Wade Hampton's command, being in advance, took
                    possession of the place, and I appointed him miliary governor of the city. No
                    incident occurred during the night, during which it rained continuously. The
                    officials all fled the town on our approach, and no one could be found who would
                    admit that he held office in the place. About 275 sick and wounded in hospital
                    were paroled. During the day a large number of horses of citizens were seized
                    and brought along. The wires were cut, and railroad obstructed, and Col. Jones'
                    command was sent up the railroad toward Harrisburg to destroy a trestle-work a
                    few miles off. He, however, reported that it was constructed of iron, and he
                    could not destroy it.</p>
                <p>Next morning it was ascertained that a large number of small-arms and munitions
                    of war were stored about the railroad buildings, all of which that could not be
                    easily brought away were destroyed, consisting of about 5,000 new muskets,
                    pistols, sabers, ammunition; also a large assortment of army clothing. The
                    extensive machine-shops and depot buildings of the railroad and several trains
                    of loaded cars were entirely destroyed. From Chambersburg, I decided, after
                    mature consideration, to strike for the vicinity of Leesburg as the best route
                    of return, particularly as Cox's command would have rendered the direction of
                    Cumberland, full of mountain gorges, particularly hazardous. The route selected
                    was through an open country. Of course I left nothing undone to prevent the
                    inhabitants from detecting my real route and object. I started directly toward
                    Gettysburg, but, having passed the Blue Ridge, turned back toward Hagerstown for
                    6 or 8 miles, and then crossed to Maryland, by Emmittsburg, where, as we passed,
                    we were hailed by the inhabitants with the most enthusiastic demonstrations of
                    joy. A scouting party of 150 lancers had just passed toward Gettysburg, and I
                    regretted exceedingly that my march did not admit of the delay necessary to
                    catch them. Taking the road toward Frederick, we intercepted dispatches from
                    Col. Rush (lancers) to the commander of the scout, which satisfied me that our
                    whereabouts was still a problem to the enemy. Before reaching Frederick I
                    crossed the Monocacy, continued the march through the night, via Liberty, New
                    Market, Monrovia, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, where we cut the telegraph
                    wires and obstructed the railroad. We reached, at daylight, Hyattstown, on
                    McClellan's line of wagon communication with Washington, but we found only a few
                    wagons to capture, and pushed on to Barnesville, which we found just vacated by
                    a company of the enemy's cavalry. We had here corroborated what we had heard
                    before, that Stoneman had between 4,000 and 5,000 troops about Poolesville and
                    guarding the river fords. I started directly for Poolesville, but, instead of
                    marching upon that point, avoided it by a march through the woods, leaving it 2
                    or 3 miles to my left, and getting into the road from Poolesville to the mouth
                    of the Monocacy. Guarding well my flanks and rear, I pushed boldly forward,
                    meeting the head of the enemy's column going toward Poolesville. I ordered the
                    charge, which was responded to in handsome style by the advance squadron
                    (Irving's), of Lee's brigade, which drove back the enemy's cavalry upon the
                    column of infantry advancing to occupy the crest from which the cavalry were
                    driven. Quick as thought, Lee's sharpshooters sprung to the ground, and,
                    engaging the infantry skirmishers, held them in check until the artillery in
                    advance came up, which, under the gallant Pelham, drove back the enemy's force
                    to his batteries beyond the Monocacy, between which and our solitary gun quite a
                    spirited fire continued for some time. This answered, in confection with the
                    high crest occupied by our piece, to screen entirely my real movement quickly to
                    the left, making a bold and rapid strike for White's Ford, to force my way
                    across before the enemy at Poolesville and Monocacy could be aware of my design.
                    Although delayed somewhat by about 200 infantry strongly posted in the cliffs
                    over the ford, yet they yielded to the moral effect of a few shells before
                    engaging our sharpshooters, and the crossing of the canal (now dry) and river
                    was effected with all the precision of passing a defile on drill, a section of
                    artillery being sent with the advance, and placed in position on the Loudoun
                    side, another piece on the Maryland height, while Pelham continued to occupy the
                    attention of the enemy with the other, withdrawing from position to position
                    until his piece was ordered to cross. The enemy was marching from Poolesville,
                    in the mean time, but came up in line of battle on the Maryland bank only to
                    receive a thundering salutation, with evident effect, from our guns on this
                    side.</p>
                <p>I lost not a man killed on the expedition, and only a few slight wounds.The
                    enemy's loss is not known, but Pelham's one gun compelled the enemy's battery to
                    change it position three times. The remainder of the march was destitute of
                    interest. The conduct of the command and their behavior toward the inhabitants
                    is worthy of the highest praise; a few individual cases only were exceptions in
                    this particular.</p>
                <p>Brig.-Gen. Hampton and Col.'s Lee, Jones, Wickham, and Butler, and the officers
                    and men under their command, are entitled to my lasting gratitude for their
                    coolness in danger and cheerful obedience to orders. Unoffending persons were
                    treated with civility, and the inhabitants were generous in proffers of
                    provisions on the march. We seized and brought over a large number of horses,
                    the property of citizens of the United States. The valuable information obtained
                    in this reconnaissance as to the distribution of the enemy's force communicated
                    orally to the commanding general, and need not be here repeated. A number of
                    public functionaries and prominent citizens were taken captives and brought over
                    as hostages for our own unoffending citizens, whom the enemy has form from their
                    homes and confined in dungeons in the North. One or two of my men lost their
                    way, and are probably in the hands of the enemy.</p>
                <p>The results of this expedition, in a moral and political point of view, can
                    hardly be estimated, and the consternation among property holders in
                    Pennsylvania beggars description.</p>
                <p>I am specially indebted to Capt. B. S. White (C. S. Cavalry) and to Messrs. Hugh
                    Logan and Harbaugh, whose skillful guidance was of immense service to me. My
                    staff are entitled to my thanks for untiring energy in the discharge of their
                    duties.</p>
                <p>I inclose a map to appear in Atlas of the expedition, drawn by Capt. William W.
                    Blackford, to accompany this report: also a copy of orders enforced during the
                    march.</p>
                <p>Believing that the hand of God was clearly manifested in the signal deliverance
                    of my command from danger, and the crowning success attending it, I ascribe to
                    Him the praise, the honor, and the glory.</p>
