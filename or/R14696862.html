<p>Brevet Brig.-Gen. FORSYTH,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>HOWARDSVILLE, VA.,</p>
<p>March 6, 1865.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I arrived at Scottsville without opposition at 3 p.m. Sent a force to destroy the
                    aqueduct over Hardware River. Captured two loaded canal-boats at Scottsville,
                    one with shell and other with stores. Cotton factory and mill destroyed. I left
                    Gen. Gibbs at Scottsville, with orders to move here to-night, in case Col.
                    Maxwell and the force sent to Hardware Aqueduct get in, otherwise to come here
                    early in the morning. It is now 10.15 p.m. Gen. Devin, just in, reports leaving
                    his artillery a few miles back under guard of a regiment. The roads have been
                    very heavy, but not so bad as between Staunton and Waynesborough. The report is
                    that Johnston is moving to Lynchburg with Beauregard's army; that Petersburg was
                    evacuated day before yesterday; that the bridge over the James above is guarded,
                    with the intention to burn it if we advance there. I expected to meet your
                    communication parties here to-night when I got here. I will send a force at 2
                    o'clock in the morning to secure the bridge over the James, unless I hear
                    something from you to countermand the order. There is no doubt, I think, of the
                    evacuation of Petersburg. A great deal of loot has gone up the canal. I have
                    destroyed all locks on the canal from Scottsville to here. It's slow work
                    destroying the canal. A boat-load of stores was captured at this place
                    (Howardsville). I saw fires in direction of party sent along the Rivanna. Seemed
                    to be in direction of Palmyra. Gibbs had orders to destroy canal as much as
                    possible. No enemy in sight, save 150 reported in rear. Have not troubled us
                    any. Will await orders here.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. MERRITT,<br> Brevet Maj.-Gen.</p>
