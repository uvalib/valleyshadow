<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William Averell writes General Benjamin F. Kelley on January, 1864,
                    scouting reports from the Shenandoah Valley. Averell mentions that Confederates
                    captured parts of his force and moved them through Staunton.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. B. F. KELLEY,<br> Cmdg. Department of the
                        Cumberland:</p>
<p>Martinsburg,</p>
<p>January 1, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My own scouts have returned from Winchester and report nothing in the place
                    except scouting party of 40 rebels up to dark last night, but that Sixty-second
                    Virginia Infantry, Eighteenth Virginia Cavalry, White's battalion, and one or
                    two companies of Gilmor's battalion were in the vicinity of Winchester. The
                    rebels reported my force in the mountains unable to escape; that 1,200 of my
                    command which had been captured passed through Staunton yesterday. I think it is
                    proper that I should assume command of the entire force at this place. I will
                    endeavor to have no more stampedes. Col. Rodgers' command can, however, make
                    their returns to their proper division commander. If this meets your
                    approbation, please direct it. I still think the permanent infantry force should
                    be increased at this point. As soon as I get my command in order I will clean
                    out Winchester, if the rebels attempt to occupy it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
