<p> Gen. BRECKINRIDGE:</p>
<p>CHARLOTTESVILLE,</p>
<p>June 16, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me know what the railroad agents can and will do. Everything depends upon
                    promptness, energy, and dispatch. See that agents use all these, and if they
                    fail take the most summary measures and impress everything that is necessary in
                    the way of men or means to insure the object. I have authority to direct your
                    movements, and I will take the responsibility of what you may find it necessary
                    to do. I will hold all railroad agents and employees responsible with their
                    lives for hearty co-operation with us. Be certain that Hunter's main force is
                    east of the mountains else the most important part of the duty assigned me will
                    be thwarted. I will communicate with you when the first train goes down. Keep in
                    constant communication with telegraph office, as I will also do. I can hear of
                    no enemy about Staunton. Hampton has defeated and driven back Sheridan's
                    cavalry. Is there any enemy's cavalry north of Lynchburg?</p>
<p></p>
<p>J. A. EARLY,<br> Lieut.-Gen.</p>
