<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General John D. Imboden, commanding at Staunton, concerning
                    the July, 1863, situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Lee gives Imboden command of
                    the whole Valley region.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. Imboden,<br> Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>One mile south of Winchester,</p>
<p>July 21, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I am obliged to withdraw the army east of the Blue Ridge. A portion of Gen. Sam.
                    Jones' troops, under Col. Wharton, have reached the Valley, but Gen. Jones
                    himself has not arrived, and circumstances may prevent his coming altogether. In
                    his absence, I desire you to take command of the Valley District, and so dispose
                    of your troops as to operate to the best advantage, covering from the
                    depredations of the enemy, giving protection to the inhabitants, and damaging
                    the enemy all in your power.</p>
<p>The forces of Gen.'s Mulligan, Kelley, and Averell were said to be in the
                    neighborhood of Cherry Run and Back Creek, and Gen. Ewell with his corps moved
                    down last evening to attack them this morning, but they escaped from him during
                    the night.</p>
<p>It has been reported by scouts that all the troops have been withdrawn from
                    Northwestern Virginia, leaving only a small guard at Grafton and New Creek, the
                    rest being in the vicinity of Cherry Run. If this is true, this is a fine
                    opportunity of damaging the road and destroying the workshops at Piedmont, which
                    I hope you will take advantage of.</p>
<p>I desire Col. Wharton to remain in command of all of Gen. Jones' troops that are
                    here or may arrive, until the arrival of Gen. Jones himself.</p>
<p>I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
