<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In March, 1863, Confederate General John Imboden planned an expedition to destroy
                    the Cheat River bridge. In this letter, Confederate General Samuel Jones writes
                    Imboden, commanding at Staunton, concerning preparations for the expedition.
                    Jones promises to send engineers to Staunton to aid Imboden's plans.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>March 19, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I received to-day a letter, of the 16th instant, from Brig. Gen. W. E. Jones,
                    informing me that he would exert himself to have everything in readiness for the
                    movement of Capt. McNeill on the 22d instant, and requesting me to send my
                    engineer and his party to that place.</p>
<p>From your letter of the 14th instant, it seems that your proposed expedition
                    embraces that of McNeill. Surely there cannot be in contemplation two
                    expeditions, starting and for the same points, and about the same time, under
                    separate and independent commanders. I take it for granted that the entire
                    expedition is to be under your direction, and shall order Lieut. Hart, of
                    Engineers, on his arrival at Staunton with his party, to report to you. But I am
                    afraid there is some misapprehension between you, W. E. Jones, and McNeill. I
                    earnestly recommend that you communicate with both of the officers, and act in
                    concert; otherwise some confusion may arise, leading inevitably to failure.</p>
<p>If I knew exactly when you would move, I might in all probability be able to aid
                    you at Beverly with a good regiment of infantry, but I cannot withdraw it from
                    its present post and send it by way of Staunton to you.</p>
<p>You need, I think, apprehend no interruption from the enemy's troops in the
                    Kanawha Valley. I think I shall be able to fix their attention on this side of
                    the river.</p>
<p>I regret that I did not know sooner of your proposed expedition. I might then
                    have aided you more effectually than I can now. Keep me informed of your
                    movements, and I will give you all the aid I can.</p>
<p>Have you heard from Gen. Lee in regard to the two regiments you desire since I
                    wrote him in regard to them?</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
