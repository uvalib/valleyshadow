<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Nathaniel P. Banks reports on April, 1862, advances in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. He mentions bridges burned near Staunton.</p>

<p>Hon. E.M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>NEW MARKET,</p>
<p>April 26, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing important to-day. Our advance is secure. It is now at Harrisonburg--two
                    brigades, 600 cavalry, and two batteries. Road to mountains well guarded.
                    Bridges on Staunton all burned. I shall co-operate with Fremont with great
                    pleasure; suggested it to him two days since. I am deeply gratified with the
                    approval of the Department. Our difficulties have been very great or our
                    operations would have been more satisfactory. Jackson's force is between the
                    Shenandoah, east of mountains, and Stanardsville, somewhat increased.</p>
<p></p>
<p>N.P. BANKS,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
