<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief, Washington:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 29, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the 25th instant I sent you a dispatch requesting you to decide what steps
					should be taken to guard the line of the Potomac when this army leaves here. To
					this I received your reply that I had been intrusted by the President with
					defeating and driving away the rebel army; that you had given me no orders
					heretofore, did not give me any then, &amp; c. Under these circumstances, I
					have only to make such arrangements for guarding this extended line as the means
					at my disposal will permit, at the same time keeping in view the supreme
					necessity of maintaining the moving army in adequate force to meet the rebel
					army before us.</p>
<p>The dispositions I have ordered are as follows, viz: Ten thousand men to be left
					at Harper's Ferry; one brigade of infantry in front of Sharpsburg; Kenly's
					brigade of infantry at Williamsport; Kelley's brigade, including Col. Campbell's
					Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania Infantry, at Cumberland, and between that point and
					Hancock. I have also left four small cavalry regiments to patrol and watch the
					river and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Cumberland down to Harper's
					Ferry.</p>
<p>I do not regard this force as sufficient to cover securely this great extent of
					line, but I do not feel justified in detaching any more troops from my moving
					columns. I would therefore recommend that some new regiments of infantry and
					cavalry be sent to strengthen the forces left by me. There should be a brigade
					of infantry and section of artillery in the vicinity of Cherry Run, another
					brigade at Hancock, and additional brigade at Williamsport, one regiment at
					Hagerstown, and one at Chambersburg, with a section of artillery at each place
					if possible. This is on the supposition that the enemy retain a considerable
					cavalry force west of the Blue Ridge. If they go east of it, the occupation of
					the points named in my dispatch of the 25th instant will obviate the necessity
					of keeping many of these troops on the river.</p>
<p>There are now several hundred of our wounded, including Gen. Richardson, in the
					vicinity of Sharpsburg, that cannot possibly be moved at present.</p>
<p>I repeat that I do not look upon the forces I have been able to leave from this
					army as sufficient to prevent cavalry raids into Maryland and Pennsylvania, as
					cavalry is the only description of troops adequate to this service, and I am, as
					you are aware, deficient in this arm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
