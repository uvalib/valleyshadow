<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Benjamin F. Kelley writes cavalry General William Averell with

<p>Brigadier-General AVERELL,<br> At Petersburg:</p>
<p>NEW CREEK, W. VA.,</p>
<p>August 14, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Your note of the 12th received last night. You will receive with this an order
                    for an expedition to Huntersville and Lewisburg. General Scammon is apprehensive
                    that there is some force at Lewisburg which contemplates a movement on his
                    outposts. I think it good policy, therefore, to dispose of that before we make
                    any movement on Staunton. You will, therefore, as promptly as possible, carry
                    out the orders sent to-day. I have ordered Colonel Mulligan to post one company
                    at Burlington, one at Williamsport, and to move with the balance of the First
                    Brigade, and occupy Moorefield and Petersburg.</p>
<p>After you have accomplished the objects of this expedition, and you have rested
                    and recruited your men and horses at Beverly, at which point I will cause ample
                    supplies to be sent, you can then move back to Monterey, and from that point
                    operate against Staunton or Imboden, as may be deemed best. Moor has not yet
                    reported Jackson's location, but we know it is near Huntersville, probably
                    somewhere about the Little Levels. Dr. Scoules and party report that Colonel
                    Dunn was reported at or near Crab Bottom, with a regiment of infantry. I think
                    it doubtful.</p>
<p>The assistant quartermaster informs me he sent you ten kegs of horse-shoes, which
                    will arrive to-day; will send horse-shoe nails by the next train, and that he
                    has ordered clothing for you from Wheeling, which he reports to arrive to-night.</p>
<p>Move as soon as you possibly can. It is impossible to furnish Ewing with horses
                    to mount his men for this expedition. You will move early in the morning and
                    late at night, and rest your men and horses in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>The law library at Lewisburg was purchased for the western part of the State, and
                    of course rightfully belongs to the new State of West Virginia. Our judges need
                    it very much.</p>
<p>Please advise me by messenger when you move, so I can advise Moor and Scammon. I
                    will, if possible, cause Scammon to communicate with you at Lewisburg. I may be
                    compelled to go to Harper's Ferry to-morrow. If I do, however, any communication
                    will reach me through Captain Melvin, who will be either here or at Cumberland.
                    With promptness and energy, I have no doubt of your entire success.</p>
<p>I am, general, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>B. F. KELLEY,<br> Brigadier-General.</p>
