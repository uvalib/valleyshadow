<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In April, 1864, the Army of the Potomac under Meade, and overseen by Grant,
                    prepared to invade Virginia and advance on Richmond. In this letter, Robert E.
                    Lee writes General John C. Breckinridge to inform him of these developments, as
                    well as his suspicions that Union General Averell might launch a raid on
                    railroads around Staunton in conjunction with Meade's advance.</p>

<p>Gen. J. C. BRECKINRIDGE, Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>April 19, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I learned yesterday from a scout, whom I had sent to the valley, that Gen.
                    Averell, on this day week, left Martinsburg with all the cavalry which could be
                    spared from that region, and moved up the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. I think
                    it probable, when the weather permits, or about the time when their proposed
                    combined movement against Richmond takes place, that he will make another attack
                    upon our western railroad at or beyond Staunton, from some point west of North
                    Mountain. I see now no indication of an advance up the valley. There is only a
                    garrison at Martinsburg, and no force, it is said, at Harper's Ferry. Such an
                    advance has been industriously hinted abroad, an examination of the Potomac and
                    Winchester Railroad made, but I believe it was done to deceive. I would
                    recommend that Col. Jackson keep his scouts toward Beverly, &amp;c., on the
                    alert, that you may receive early information of any preparations or movements,
                    that you may be ready to meet an advance if made. Gen. Meade's army is reported
                    ready to advance. His sick, invalids, sutlers, &amp;c., have been sent back
                    to Washington, his troops rationed, and only waiting for the roads to become
                    passable. Should an advance be made west of the Blue Ridge, I hope, with the aid
                    of Gen. Imboden, you will drive the assailants beyond the Potomac.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
