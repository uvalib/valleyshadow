<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this September, 1864, dispatch, Union Colonel W. Hoffman writes General Albin
                    Schoepf concerning prisoner exchanges and treatment of Pennsylvania
                    citizen-captives held by the Confederacy. Hoffman's interest was prompted by a
                    letter from Chambersburg from ex-prisoner James Hamilton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. A. SCHOEPF, Cmdg. Fort Delaware, Del.:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C.,</p>
<p>September 20, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The Secretary of War directs that the twenty-six citizen-prisoners recently sent
                    from this city to Fort Delaware as hostages for a like number of citizens of
                    Pennsylvania now in confinement in Salisbury, N. C., shall be treated and fed as
                    far as practicable in the same manner that the prisoners are for whom they are
                    hostages.</p>
<p>I inclose herewith a letter received from Mr. James Hamilton, late a prisoner at
                    Salisbury, giving an account of the food and treatment he received while there,
                    and I respectfully request you will make the treatment of the hostages referred
                    to correspond with this in all particulars as far as practicable.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. HOFFMAN,<br> Col. Third Infantry and Commissary-Gen. of Prisoners.</p>
