<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General William Loring writes General John Floyd in July, 1861, with
                    orders for movements in western Virginia. Loring also mentions regiments
                    expected at Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HDQRS. NORTHWESTERN VIRGINIA,</p>
<p>Gen. JOHN B. FLOYD:</p>
<p>Huntersville, Va.,</p>
<p>July 31, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I conversed yesterday with Maj. Byrd, who carried an express from an officer of
                    this command to Gen. Wise. He informs me that he saw the command at Gauley
                    Bridge, about sixty miles from Lewisburg, and thinks it was the intention to
                    give battle. Will you be kind enough to put yourself into communication with
                    Gen. Wise, and if you have information to justify it, join him at once. As soon
                    as I received the information expecting two regiments at Staunton I sent word
                    for them to go to Millborough; others will be there to join this command. They
                    will be there some days and may be stopped if necessary. The enemy are on Cheat
                    Mountain, with a considerable force at its base and along the road to Beverly.
                    We are slowly concentrating here of the want of transportation and supplies. If
                    the enemy is not pressing in the direction of Wise, and the different commands
                    can join me, I think we can give the enemy a decided blow in the vicinity of
                    Cheat Mountain and also strike the column sent in the direction of Wise. I beg
                    that you will give me the earliest information of the movements of both Gen.
                    Wise and yourself. It is desirable, of course, that the information contained
                    herein be not public.</p>
<p>With respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Cmdg. Northwestern Army.</p>
