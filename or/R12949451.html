<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this November, 1863, dispatch, Union General Darius Couch, commanding the
                    Department of the Susquehanna at Chambersburg, reports to Assistant Adjutant
                    Edward D. Townsend on draft disturbances in the anthracite coal region of
                    Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>November 13, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inform you, for the information of the War Department, that I
                    have just returned from the disaffected mining region of Hazelton and vicinity,
                    having during the visit met and conversed with several of the coal operators and
                    others interested in the affairs of that region.</p>
<p>Some of the collieries were stopped last week for the avowed purpose of
                    compelling the Gen. Government to relieve the mining regions from the operations
                    of the draft. However, the prompt arrival of troops, ordered by Maj.-Gen. Sigel,
                    resorted matters to their previous status. The mines are in operation, but the
                    loyal people there live in a state of terror, several brutal murders having been
                    committed within a few weeks.</p>
<p>The operators whom I saw proposed this, that if they could be assured of the
                    protection of the Gen. Government until the work was accomplished, they would
                    discharge the bad characters and employ new men, having eventually a body of men
                    that could be controlled. It is supposed that it would take three months to
                    carry out these desired reforms. If commenced, the troops must not be withdrawn
                    until the work is thoroughly done, otherwise two-thirds of the anthracite region
                    would stop sending coal to market.</p>
<p>I respectfully urge upon the Department to consider the propositions, and
                    recommend that I be instructed to give the guaranties asked for by the operators
                    and proceed to the work with the troops under my command.</p>
<p>I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br>
                    </p>
