<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Maj. M.G. HARMAN, Commanding at Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>June 7, 1861.</p>
<p>MAJOR:</p>
<p>Your letter of June 6 has been received, and I desire to express my approbation
                    of your conduct in forwarding re-enforcements of men and supplies of arms,
                    ammunition, provisions, and clothing to Col. Porterfield, at Beverly.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. R.S. Garnett has been appointed to the command of the troops at
                    Beverly and in that region, and will proceed there at once. All the troops that
                    can be spared from this point will be forwarded as fast as practicable to Gen.
                    Garnett, and it is hoped that these, in addition to the forces now there and
                    those which can be hereafter raised in that region, will form an adequate forces
                    for the protection of the north-western part of the State.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R.E. LEE,<br> Gen., Commanding.</p>
