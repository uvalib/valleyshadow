<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union staff officer R. B. Marcy mentions the strength of the Confederate cavalry
                    units that took Chambersburg in October, 1862, in this dispatch to General
                    George Crook.</p>

<p>Gen. GEORGE CROOK,<br> Cmdg. Division, Hancock, Md.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>OCTOBER 11, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch of 8 a. m. received. The rebels, supposed to consist of four
                    regiments of cavalry and four guns, about 2,000 men, were at Chambersburg last
                    night, but have not been heard from this morning. The general commanding directs
                    that you remain in your present position until further orders, keeping your
                    scouts well out on all the roads, and holding your command ready to go to any
                    point where you may think there is a probability of encountering the enemy. Gen.
                    Averell, who is above you, will probably come down the river to-day with four
                    regiments of cavalry for the purpose of pursuing the rebels, and it is hoped
                    they may not escape without punishment. Communicate often.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. B. MARCY,<br> Chief of Staff.</p>
