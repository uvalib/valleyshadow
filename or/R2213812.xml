                <p>I will say to you that I am held as a prisoner in this place. I was taken near
                    Petersburg, Hardy County, Va. I live in Preston County, Va., and was on my way
                    to Moorefield, Hardy County, on business and I had to go some thirty-five miles
                    out of my way to get there in order to get around the Yankee camps, and then was
                    taken by the Rockbridge Cavalry and brought here. I am charged with being a
                    Union man, and I am not, and can prove that I have taken strong grounds in favor
                    of the Confederacy, and was taken prisoner by the Yankee. This I can prove by
                    the best of men in Tucker and Preston Counties if I could get any word to them.
                    But I am cut off from any communication with them and I ask of you my release,
                    for I am kept on the streets at work and digging graves Sundays as well as any
                    other day. They have also taken a fine horse and saddle from me. I was taken on
                    the 22d August, and I am at this time 130 or 140 miles from home, with the
                    Yankees between me and my home. Therefore I can't get any assistance from
                    there-not as much as a change of clothes. I ask your honor for my release, and
                    also for my horse or his value. I understand that I am to be moved up to
                    Staunton to-morrow; but as to this I cannot say whether they will or not. Sir, I
                    am a Virginian, and am proud to say that I have always been loyal to my native
                    State, and am still willing to remain so.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Your humble servant,</salute>

                        some few that curse me, and say they will shoot me before I leave the guard
