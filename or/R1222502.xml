                <p>Early in the war, prisoners taken in battle were routinely paroled on condition
                    that they would return home and never again take up arms. In this July, 1861,
                    letter, Union general George B. McClellan asks the commander of forces in the
                    Staunton area to arrange for parole of Confederates taken prisoner during
                    battles in West Virginia.</p>

                </opener>
                <p>I have to-day received orders from the Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. Army
                    respecting the disposition to be made of the prisoners of war now in my hands.
                    These orders are substantially that the non-commissioned officers and privates
                    shall be permitted to return to their homes, provided they willingly subscribe
                    an oath or affirmation bringing them not to bear arms or serve in any military
                    capacity against the United States until released from this obligation according
                    to the ordinary usages of war; the officers to be permitted to return to their
                    homes upon giving a similar parole of honor. From this privilege are excepted,
                    however, such officers as may have recently left the United States service with
                    the intention of taking arms against the United States. Such officers will for
                    the present be sent to Fort McHenry, where they will, without doubt, be kindly
                    treated.</p>
                <p>There are at Beverly some thirty-three officers, five surgeons, and about six
                    hundred non-commissioned officers and privates. There are others at Laurel Hill,
                    &amp;c., the numbers of whom I do not yet accurately know. With the wounded
                    the number will probably amount to at least eight hundred men, besides officers.</p>
                <p>It is my desire to arrange with you for the return to their homes of such of
                    these as may accept the terms offered them. I would be glad to know what
                    transportation, &amp;c., you can provide for them, and at what point I may
                    expect it. If no other arrangement will be convenient to you, I will provide
                    wagons and tents, as well as cooking utensils, for the party, with the
                    understanding that the proper authorities shall undertake to return them to me.
                    The wagons and tents will probably be of those captured at Camp Garnett. Please
                    inform me how many days' rations it will be necessary to furnish to the party. I
                    will be glad also to arrange for the return of the wounded as soon as their
                    condition will permit it. In the mean time, their friends may rest assured that
                    every attention will be paid to them.</p>
                <p>You will, ere this, no doubt, be informed of the unhappy fate of Gen. Garnett,
                    who fell while acting the part of a gallant soldier. His remains are now at
                    Grafton, preserved in ice, where they will await the instructions of his
                    relatives, should they desire to remove them to his home.</p>
                <p>While I am determined to play my part in this unhappy contest to the utmost of my
                    energy and ability, permit me to assure you of my desire to do all in my power
                    to alleviate its miseries, and to confine its effects to those who constitute
                    the organized armies and meet in battle. It is my intention to cause the persons
                    and property of private citizens to be respected, and to render the condition of
                    prisoners and wounded as little oppressive and miserable as possible. I trust
                    that I shall be met in the same spirit, and this contest shall remain free from
                    the usual horrible features of civil war.</p>
                <p>I send this by Lieut. R. G. Lipford, of the Forty-fourth Regiment Virginia
                    Volunteers, who chances to be the captured officer most convenient. I have not
                    yet taken his final parole, but have given him a special one for the purpose of
                    conveying this letter and bringing back an immediate reply. Upon his return he
                    will be accorded the same parole as the others. For obvious reasons I request
                    that your reply be transmitted by Lieut. Lipford.</p>
                <p>I will proceed, with as little delay as possible, to the release of the
                    prisoners, and, if ready to forward before your reply reaches me, will take it
                    for granted that you accede to my proposals in regard to the return of the
                    property sent with them.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
