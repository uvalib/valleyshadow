                <p>In the absence of more competent officers, I have the honor to submit the
                    following note of the operations of Winder's brigade between September 1 and 19,
                    1862:</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 15th the garrison surrendered, to the delight of the
                    soldiers and the disgust of Jackson's division, marched back to their encampment
                    of the night previous, to cook rations and prepare for the march to join Gen.
                    Longstreet's corps, near Sharpsburg, Md. This march was begun at 2 a. m.
                    September 16, crossing the Potomac at Botler's Mill, below Shepherdstown, thence
                    along the tow-path to the main road to Sharpsburg. On reaching the vicinity of
                    Sharpsburg, the division was halted in a grove to the left, where it remained
                    until 3 p. m., whence we were moved 2 1/2 miles northwest of the town, forming
                    line of battle in an open closer field to the left of and perpendicular to the
                    Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike, in extension of Gen. hood's line, who had
                    occupied the extreme left until our approach. The disposition of the brigades of
                    the division was as follows: Winder's and Jones' brigades occupying the front
                    line, under command of Col. A. J. Grigsby; Taliaferro's and Starke's brigades in
                    the edge of the woods, 100 yards in rear, under command of Brig.-Gen. Starke;
                    the whole commanded by Brig. Gen. J. R. Jones. Two companies were thrown
                    forward, as skirmishers, about 100 yards, and Poague's battery of two parrotts
                    and one Napoleon gun, put in position upon a knoll between the line of
                    skirmishers and front line, supported by both. In a few one of the enemy's
                    batteries, some 500 yards in front, opened fire upon a battery of ours to the
                    right of the brigade, but was silenced in twenty minutes by Poague's
                    well-directed and rapid fire. Shortly after, a number of batteries, about
                    one-fourth of a mile distant, opened upon our lines, and continued firing for
                    some time after dark. The display was grand and comparatively harmless, except
                    to the stragglers in far rear. Throughout the night a desultory fire was kept up
                    by the skirmishers on both sided. At early dawn of the morning of September 17,
                    the terrible struggle began in earnest, and the direction of their fire
                    indicated plainly the design of the enemy to turn our left flank. Their heaviest
                    field pieces were brought to bear upon us with wonderful rapidity and fearful
                    precision, front and enfilading fires. Their infantry, advancing, compelled
                    Raine's howitzers and Poague's Napoleon, under command of Lieut. Brown, to
                    withdraw to our rear, and soon our skirmishers became hotly engaged.</p>
                <p>About 6 a. m. the advance column of the enemy approached our front, and the front
                    line (Winder's and Jones' brigades), which had been ordered to lie down for
                    concealment and protection, rose at the command of their intrepid leader and
                    poured in a staggering voley, which stopped his advance. For three-quarters of
                    an hour the front line, numbering less than 400 men, maintained the unequal
                    contest, holding their ground and going good work. Heavy re-enforcements
                    advancing to the enemy's support, the front line was ordered to retire to the
                    edge of the wood above indicated, where, in conjunction with the reserve brigade
                    of the division, it remained for half an hour exposed to a terrific storm, of
                    grape, canister, and shell. At the end of this time, our line advanced into the
                    open field and encountered the enemy upon the ground which we had previously
                    held. The firing was fierce and incessant, the enemy standing firm for a time.
                    Unable to withstand the resolute valor of our troops, he retired in considerable
                    disorder.</p>
                <p>It was during this severe contest that the chivalrous Starke, who had succeeded
                    to the command of the division, in consequence of Gen. Jones being disabled,
                    fell, while cheering his men in the discharge of their duty. The command fell to
                    no unworthy successor in the dauntless Grigsby, who took the reins with a
                    fearless spirit and held them with a firm hand, the command of the brigade
                    devolving upon Lieut.-Col. Gardner, Fourth Virginia. The heavy losses sustained,
                    the confusion unavoidably arising from the change of commanders, and the
                    protracted nature of the contest, rendered necessary the withdrawal of our weary
                    troops to the wood from which they had advanced. Here the efforts of our active
                    leader, assisted by regimental and company officers, availed to restore order
                    and reform the commands. Gen. Early coming up with his brigade at this juncture,
                    we formed upon his right and advanced again into, the open field for a short
                    distance, when we were transferred to his left, forming a diagonal line, the
                    left occupying a hollow in the edge of a wood, maintaining a desultory firing
                    throughout the whole time. From this position, the division, in line with
                    Early's brigade, retired 100 yards to a barn and stack-yard and along a ledge of
                    rocks, where we held a large force of of the enemy in check for upward of an
                    hour, inflicting heavy loss upon him, with little damage to ourselves. The long
                    looked for re-enforcements coming to our aid at this point, the enemy was
                    handsomely charged and driven in confusion for a half mile, leaving scores of
                    killed, wounded, and prisoners in our hands.</p>
                <p>Returning to the barn above referred to, about the middle of the day the brigade
                    was relieved and ordered to a grove to supply themselves with ammunition and
                    provisions, by this time entirely exhausted. Here we remained until 5 p. m.,
                    when we marched to the support of a battery on a hill in rear of our late line.
                    Night put an end to one of the most sanguinary conflicts which history will have
                    to record, and the tired soldiers sank to rest.</p>
                <p>The brigade went into the fight with about 250 muskets, and nobly sustained the
                    reputation of heroism and devotion accorded to it by the country.</p>
                <p>When the extraordinary march from the Rappahannock to Sharpsburg, with its
                    attendant circumstances, its sleepless nights and harassing marches, its bloody
                    battles and heavy losses, in all of which the "Old Stonewall" bore a conspicuous
                    part, is carefully considered, the melancholy decrease in number will not appear
                    surprising.</p>
                <p>The regiments of the brigade were commanded, respectively, by Lieut.-Col.
                    Gardner, Fourth Virginia; Maj. H. J. Williams, Fifth Virginia; Capt. Frank C.
                    Wilson, Twenty-seventh Virginia, and Capt. Golladay, and afterward Adjutant
                    Walton, Thirty-third Virginia, the Second (Capt. Colston) being on detached duty
                    at Martinsburg.</p>
                <p>It is impossible, from the length of time which has elapsed, even of it were
                    appropriate for me, to mention the individual acts of gallantry which marked the
                    progress of the fight.</p>
                <p>Lieut. James M. Garnett, brigade ordnance officer and acting aide-de-camp, and
                    Orderlies Cox and Stickley, the latter of whom was severely wounded early in the
                    day, rendered indispensable services to Col. Grigsby throughout the whole trying
                    time. The full list of casualties, as found in the reports of the regimental and
                    battery commanders, accompanies this report.</p>
