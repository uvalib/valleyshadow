<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Adjutant and Inspector General Cooper writes John D. Imboden via
                    Staunton on December, 1862, plans to reorganize Imboden's partisans as a regular
                    force. Imboden is authorized to recruit in western Virginia.</p>

<p>Col. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> First Virginia Partisan
                        Rangers,<br> Camp Hood, Hardy County, W. Va., via Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>December 23, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Under the various orders which from time to time have been given yourself and
                    others relative to the raising and organizing of troops in Western Virginia,
                    much confusion and difficulty have arisen, and with the view of harmonizing
                    these difficulties, and rendering the branch of the service with which you have
                    been connected still more effective, the Secretary of War directs me to invite
                    your co-operation in an endeavor to change your entire present organization from
                    partisan rangers to a regular command for the war. You will be intrusted with
                    the reorganization of the whole force in the section of country in which you are
                    now engaged, and authorized to fill up the old companies and regiments with
                    conscripts, and to recruit all the men you can from counties within the enemy's
                    lines and also from non-conscripts. From the energy and zeal you have displayed
                    in the service, the Department has no hesitation in committing to you this
                    important undertaking, and it is hoped, in view of the public interests, that
                    you will at once signify your willingness to make the desired change and engage
                    in the new duties proposed. Should you do this, all former orders for the
                    organization of troops in the disputed country will be withdrawn. Of course, it
                    is understood that the consent of the men now enrolled as partisan rangers must
                    be obtained before the desired change can be undertaken, and this consent it
                    will be necessary for you to secure as a preliminary step in the matter.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,&amp;c.,</p>
<p>S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.</p>
