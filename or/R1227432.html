<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General in Chief Winfield Scott writes George B. McClellan, commanding forces in
                    West Virginia during July, 1861, regarding plans to advance on Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Gen. McCLELLAN,<br> Beverly, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 18, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your suggestions in respect to Staunton would be admirable, like your other
                    conceptions and acts, with support. McDowell yesterday drove the enemy beyond
                    Fairfax Court-House. He will attack the entrenched camp at the Manassas Junction
                    to-day. Beaten there, the enemy may retreat both upon Richmond and the
                    Shenandoah Valley, where Patterson is doing nothing. He will lose eighteen
                    regiments by discharges in about a week. I may re-enforce him in that time
                    sufficiently to enable you, with him, to bag Johnston in that valley if the
                    latter has not been permitted to send his principal force to Beauregard. If you
                    come to Staunton, and McDowell's victory at the Junction be complete, he may,
                    with Patterson, give you a hand about Winchester. I will telegraph you again
                    to-day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WINFIELD SCOTT.</p>
