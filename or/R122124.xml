                    <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Having been notified that several hundred rebel troops were quartered at Romney,
                    Hampshire County, Virginia, drilling there, impressing Union men, and in other
                    ways oppressing loyal citizens, I determined to disperse them, if possible. For
                    that purpose I left Cumberland at 10 o'clock on the night of the 12th instant,
                    with eight companies, in all about five hundred men, and by railway went to New
                    Creek Station, twenty-one miles distant.</p>
                <p>A little after 4 o'clock I started my men across the mountains, twenty-three
                    miles off, intending to reach the town by 6 o'clock in the morning. The road was
                    very fatiguing and rough, leading along high bluffs, and narrow passes, which
                    required great caution in passing, so much so, indeed, that with the utmost
                    industry I did not get near Romney until about 8 o'clock. In a pass a mile and a
                    half this side the town my advance guard was fired upon by a mounted picket of
                    the enemy, who dashed ahead and alarmed the rebels. In fact, I afterwards
                    learned that they had notice of my coming full an hour before my arrival.</p>
                <p>In approaching the place it was necessary for me to cross a bridge over the South
                    Branch of the Potomac. A reconnaissance satisfied me that the passage of the
                    bridge would be the chief obstacle in my way, although I could distinctly see
                    the enemy drawn up on the bluff, which is the town site, supporting a battery of
                    two guns, planted so as to sweep the road completely. I directed my advance
                    guard to cross the bridge on the run, leap down an embankment at the farther
                    entrance, and observe the windows of a large brick house not farther off than
                    seventy-five yards. Their appearance was the signal for an assault. A warm fire
                    opened from the house, which the guard returned, with no other loss than the
                    wounding of a sergeant. The firing continued several minutes. I led a second
                    company across the bridge, and by following up a ravine got them into a position
                    that soon drove the enemy from the house and into a mountain to its rear.</p>
                <p>My attention was then turned to the battery on the hill. Instead of following the
                    road, as the rebels expected, I pushed five companies in skirmishing order, and
                    at double-quick time, up a hill to the right, intending to get around the left
                    flank of the enemy, and cut off their retreat. Hardly had my companies deployed
                    and started forward, and got within rifle range, before the rebels limbered up
                    and put off over the bluff in hottest haste. Between their position and that of
                    my men was a deep precipitous gorge, the crossing of which occupied about ten
                    minutes. When the opposite ridge was gained we discovered the rebels
                    indiscriminately blent, with a mass of women and children, flying as for life
                    from the town. Having no horse, pursuit of the cannoneers was impossible. They
                    went off under whip and spur. After that I quietly marched into the place, and
                    took possession of the empty houses and a legion of negroes, who alone seemed
                    unscarred by our presence. After searching the town for arms, camp equipage,
                    &amp;c., I returned to Cumberland by the same road, reaching camp at 11
                    o'clock at night. My return was forced, owing to the fact that there was not a
                    mile on the road that did not offer half a dozen positions for the ruin or rout
                    of my regiment by a much smaller force.</p>
                <p>The loss of the rebels we have not been able to accurately ascertain. A citizens
                    of Romney admitted two killed. My own surgeon dressed the wound of one man. A
                    number of tents were taken. Quite a number of rifles were destroyed, and, among
                    others, I have a Maj. Isaac Vandever prisoner, a gentleman who, from accounts,
                    has been very active in exciting rebellion, organizing troops, and impressing
                    loyal citizens. I have also an excellent assortment of surgical stores, which,
                    with the tents, I have taken the liberty to convert.</p>
                <p>My regiment behaved admirably, attacking coolly and in excellent order. Where all
                    behaved gallantly, I cannot single out officers for praise. Sufficient to say
                    they conducted themselves like veterans, and in such a manner as to entitle them
                    to your confidence in any field.</p>
                <p>I beg to call your attention to the length of our march-eighty-seven miles in
                    all, forty-six of which was on foot, over a continuous succession of mountains,
                    made in twenty-four hours, without rest, and varied by a brisk engagement--made,
                    too, without leaving a man behind, and what is more, my men are ready to repeat
                    it to-morrow.</p>
                <p>I have already received your approval of my enterprise, for which I am very much
                    obliged. One good result has come of it: the loyal men in that region have taken
                    heart. Very shortly I think you will hear of another Union company from that
                    district. Moreover, it has brought home to the insolent "chivalry" a wholesome
                    respect for Northern prowess.</p>
                <closer>
