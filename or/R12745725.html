<p>Gen. H. H. Lockwood,<br> Comdg. Maryland Heights:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 19, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am directed by the commanding general to inform you that he will to-day leave
                    the line of the Potomac, and that yourself and command will then fall under the
                    orders of Maj. Gen. D. N. Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna,
                    headquarters at Chambersburg, Pa., to whom you will look for further
                    instructions.</p>
<p>The Potomac is picketed from Williamsport to Sharpsburg by Col. McReynolds,
                    commanding (late Milroy). Gen. Kelley guards the river north of Williamsport,
                    and a portion of his troops have crossed at Cherry Run. Col. Franklin has six
                    regiments of militia; one at Williamsport, and the other near Hagerstown. Col.
                    Brisbane has a force of 2,000 men in the vicinity of Hagerstown. Col. Wynkoop's
                    cavalry was at Falling Waters last night. Gen. W. F. Smith's headquarters are at
                    Greencastle. Rebel pickets were opposite Williamsport last night. The surplus
                    stores that may remain at Berlin will be sent to Sandy Hook for the use of your
                    command.</p>
<p></p>
<p>S. WILLIAMS,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
