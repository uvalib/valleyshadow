<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes Jefferson Davis in May, 1864, concerning possible Union
                    advances on the Peninsula and toward Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> President
                        Confederate States:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 3, 1864.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>I think that the late movement of Gen. Burnside to the Rappahannock was owing to
                    a change in the plans of the enemy. Previous to that, great preparations has
                    been made to transport troops by water, and I know of no force for which they
                    were intended except that of Gen. Burnside. In addition to the impressment of
                    the steamers about Baltimore, which has already been reported, I send you an
                    extract from the Philadelphia Inquirer, from which you will see that the boats
                    on the Hudson were also chartered. The character of these boats shows that they
                    were not intended for a distant expedition. I also inclose a report from one of
                    our most intelligent and trustworthy scouts, which I think indicates correctly
                    what the enemy would desire to accomplish. Reports from Gen.'s Breckinridge and
                    Imboden confirm the intelligence of the return of the force lately threatening
                    us in Western Virginia. It may be that they now intend to move up the valley
                    toward Staunton.</p>
<p>In collecting troops to operate in the Peninsula or south of the James, the enemy
                    will no doubt draw from the Southern coast. Indeed, the removal of troops from
                    Florida and Port Royal began as early as April 13 and 17, as you will see be an
                    extract from a Northern paper published in the Dispatch of yesterday. A letter
                    from Port Royal, of the latter date, states that a large force would leave next
                    day for Fortress Monroe, and one from Jacksonville, dated April 17, speaks of
                    troops leaving Florida. It may be that some of these may have been since
                    diverted by the events in North Carolina, but the time of their withdrawal
                    indicates that they were not originally intended for that State, and I have no
                    doubt they were to form part of the army of Gen. Smith at Fortress Monroe. The
                    officers commanding in North Carolina will be able to ascertain whether any
                    part, of this force has come to that department, but I think, taking all the
                    information together, that we should rather look to see them operating against
                    Richmond, and make our preparations accordingly.</p>
<p>I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
