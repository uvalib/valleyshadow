<p>Maj. G. PEYTON,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>Camp near Sutherland's Depot, Va.,</p>
<p>March 4, 1865.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>In obedience to instructions from division headquarters I have the honor of
                    making the following report of the operations of this command from the 13th of
                    June, 1864, to the 1st of January, 1865:</p>
<p>On the night of the 12th of June this brigade being encamped near Cold Harbor, it
                    received orders from Maj.-general Rodes to be in readiness to move at day dawn
                    the next morning, when we took up a line of march in direction of Louisa
                    Court-House and marched to North Garden Depot, on the Orange an Alexandria
                    Railroad, and there took the train for Lynchburg, Va. The march to the
                    above-named place was very rapid and quite severe, as the weather was very warm.
                    The marching was at the rate of twenty-five miles per day, but the men arose
                    very cheerful. We arrived at Lynchburg just before night and moved out on the
                    road on the right of the Fair Grounds, and after forming a line of battle went
                    into bivouac. During the night received orders to move to the left of our line
                    at 2 a. m. I believe it was the intention to make an attack on the enemy at
                    daylight. This brigade moved right in front and was the leading brigade of the
                    division. When daylight came we found the enemy had left his works and was
                    moving toward Liberty. This was on the morning of the 20th of June. We were soon
                    ordered to follow the enemy, which we did, taking the old turnpike. We marched
                    very rapidly, but overtook but very few of their stragglers. We marched about
                    twenty-five miles. Next morning at daylight we took up the pursuit and came up
                    with the rear of the enemy at Buford's Gap, when our skirmishers had some little
                    skirmishing which lasted until dark. Next morning we moved on (the enemy having
                    evacuated the gap during the night) in the direction of Salem. The enemy were
                    destroying the railroad as they were moving, but you could see from the things
                    thrown away that they were completely routed. That afternoon we came to a gap in
                    the mountains and found the enemy had gotten through, but not before our cavalry
                    had given therm quite a severe blow. We remained in camp the next day resting
                    and cooking rations, both of which the men needed very much intend.</p>
<p>Next day we moved in the direction of Staunton, passing through Lexington and
                    several small villages. At Lexington the brigade passed by the grave of that
                    noble old here Lieut.-Gen. Jackson at reverse arms and has uncovered. Stopped
                    near Staunton a few days and then moved down the pike in the direction of
                    Winchester, and passed on through very rapidly. Reached Harper's Ferry early on
                    the morning of the 4th of July, and was met by only a small body of
                    sharpshooters, which were soon driven in, the sharpshooters only being engaged,
                    and they soon took Bolivar Heights. Next morning the Forty-third North Carolina
                    Regt. was sent in the village of Harper's Ferry to relieve one of Battle's
                    regiments, then on picket duty. After getting in the village it was quite
                    dangerous relieving the troops then on duty. This regiment lost several men
                    while relieving Battle's by the fire of the sharpshooters in the Maryland
                    Heights. About night the Thirty-second North Carolina Regt. was ordered in the
                    town to assist in doing garrison duty and to help load the wagons with the
                    quartermaster's and commissary supplies that we captured, balance of the brigade
                    being near the Bolivar Heights in reserve. Next morning the brigade was relieved
                    by Lewis' brigade and moved in direction of Shepherdstown. Crossed the Potomac,
                    leaving Shepherdstown to our left, and camped near Sharpsburg, Md. Next morning
                    moved down Pleasant Valley and had some little skirmishing for a day or two, and
                    then moved in the direction of Frederick City without meeting with any
                    opposition. The brigade, except the sharpshooters, was not engaged in the
                    Monocacy fight, being held in reserve. Next day we took up line of march toward
                    Washington City, and arrived at Silver Springs on the 11th. This brigade being
                    the front infantry brigade in the army, sharpshooters were thrown out
                    immediately and the brigade formed line of battle, left extending on the road
                    known as Seventh Street road. After remaining there about two hours were ordered
                    to the front to support the sharpshooters.</p>
<p>The next morning the fifty-third North Carolina Regt. was ordered down to the
                    line of sharpshooters to support them in case of an attack. All that day the
                    enemy were firing their artillery, which did this brigade some little damage,
                    wounding some 5 or 6 men of the sharpshooters. Kept up a continuous firing all
                    day, and just before night (the enemy having been re-enforced) began to fire at
                    our skirmish line very heavily, and then began trying to set the houses near our
                    lines on fire, which they succeeded in doing, and then made an attempt on our
                    line. They were driven back in our immediate front, but succeeded in driving the
                    troops on our right back, which compelled the troops of this brigade, or rather
                    the Fifty-third North Carolina Regt. and the sharpshooters, to fall back (the
                    Thirty-second North Carolina Regiment and the Forty-fifth North Carolina Regt.
                    were deployed as skirmishers and ordered to the front. They went up beautifully,
                    and the men of the Fifty-third North Carolina Troops and the sharpshooters
                    joined in, and they soon established their line again on the right of the road,
                    but the troops on the left could not succeed in going quite as far as their
                    original line. The troops fought remarkably well indeed, being under very heavy
                    artillery fire, and we had none replying, and besides, the enemy had decidedly
                    the advantage in position, but our men went up cheerfully and confidently. We
                    were ordered to fall back that night about 1 o'clock, and moved off in the
                    direction of Rockville. Marched all night that night and until about 3 the next
                    day, when were rested a few hours and then moved on very slowly, only going a
                    few miles during the night, reaching the Potomac at White's Crossing, in a few
                    miles of Leesburg, and remaining there one day.</p>
<p>One the morning of the 16th we took up line of march and moved in direction of
                    Snicker's Gap. Some time during the day the enemy attacked our wagon train and
                    captured a few wagons. This brigade was soon ordered back, but the enemy had
                    been driven back before we arrived. We then moved on and crossed the mountains
                    that night. Next day we crossed the Shenandoah and moved in direction of
                    Charlestown and went into camp for a few days. About 12 o'clock of the 19th we
                    were ordered to move out in the direction of the ferry again. After marching a
                    few miles we left the road and moved direct toward the river. The enemy having
                    driven the pickets back and succeeded in crossing, we were soon formed in line
                    of battle. This being the second brigade from the right, moved froward. We soon
                    struck the enemy and had quite a severe fight, but we soon drove them back,
                    although we were fighting a very superior force of infantry and at a great
                    disadvantage, the enemy having several pieces of artillery playing on us no the
                    other side of the river, and we had none at all in position. Our men fought
                    desperately and were driving the enemy beautifully toward the river. Some of the
                    troops of this brigade were within thirty steps of the enemy's colors when the
                    troops on the right were ordered back and left our right so much exposed that we
                    had to be swung back. In doing this the gallant Col. W. A. Owens, of the
                    Fifty-third North Carolina Regiment, then commanding brigade, was mortally
                    wounded. Col. Owens was as gallant an officer as his State has in the service.
                    Our service lost much in the fall of this officer. He had just returned from
                    home that day, having been wounded on the 12th of May.</p>
<p>I think I can safely say that if the troops on our right had held their position
                    a half hour longer we would have captured a large number of prisoners. They were
                    retreating as rapidly as they could, and from what was seen afterward they must
                    have taken or drowned, as the river was quite deep in their rear. The brigade
                    suffered very severely in this fight. The Forty-fifth North Carolina Regt. was
                    not in this fight, it being on picket duty at another ford at the time the fight
                    was going on. The officers and men behaved as well as troops could. Next day we
                    remained in camp near the battle-field, and that night moved off in direction of
                    Millwood, and that night moved of in direction of Millwood, and rested at that
                    place for a few hours, when we again moved off in direction of Newtown, and then
                    down toward Winchester to support Ramseur's division, which had been engaged
                    that day. Next day we fell back slowly to Fisher's Hill, where we remained a few
                    days, and then threw up a line of entrenchments. On the morning of the 24th we
                    again moved down the Valley. At Kernstown we formed a line of battle and threw
                    out the sharpshooters. They soon moved forward, and, some other troops coming up
                    on the flank of the enemy, soon routed them, and we chased them to Winchester,
                    where they made another stand. This brigade, with the balance of the division,
                    was double-quicked around on the right flank to try to cut off some cavalry. The
                    enemy, seeing the movement, soon began to retreat again in great confusion. We
                    followed them as rapidly as we could, but could scarcely keep in sight. They
                    destroyed a good many wagons, caissons, &amp;c., and threw away everything
                    that could impede them. Although this was one of the rear brigades when the
                    retreat commenced, it was when it ended in front of everything else except the
                    cavalry, and a good part of the time up with that. Next morning we moved on down
                    toward Bunker Hill and toward Martinsburg, where we tore up the Baltimore and
                    Ohio Railroad. We then moved up and down the turnpike form Bunker Hill and the
                    Potomac.</p>
<p>On the 5th of August we crossed the Potomac at Williamsport and marched towards
                    Boonsborough, and went in camp. Next day recrossed the river and moved up the
                    Valley. We then moved up and down the Valley for some days, one day running the
                    enemy and the next falling back. On the 17th some of the troops had a fight at
                    Winchester. This brigade was not engaged. On the 21st we moved in the direction
                    of Charlestown. We struck the enemy near Charlestown. Our sharpshooters were
                    sent to the front, and they had quite a severe fight and were being driven back
                    when the Forty-third North Carolina Regt. was ordered out to their support, and
                    they soon checked the enemy. This regiment and the sharpshooters suffered a good
                    deal. That night the enemy fell back and we followed them through Charlestown
                    and formed line of battle just beyond the town, and remained there until the
                    25th, when we were relieved by a brigade of Kershaw's division, and moved toward
                    Shepherdstown. Had considerable skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry, but
                    amounting to almost nothing, they falling back faster than we could follow. The
                    next day we marched back and camped near Leetown, and next moved back to Bunker
                    Hill, where we remained several days. Then we moved down the Valley and back
                    again several times, when we were ordered to Berryville to support Gen.
                    Anderson.</p>
<p>Next day we moved back and attacked the enemy's cavalry near Stephenson's
                    Station. We drove them back very rapidly and in great confusion, but the brigade
                    lost several men. We then remained near Bunker Hill several days, moving first
                    one way and then the other, having several skirmishes with the enemy's cavalry
                    and driving them back on all these occasions.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th of September we received marching orders and we moved
                    up to Stephensons' Station, formed line of battle, and waited further orders.
                    After remaining there from a half to one hour received orders to move toward
                    Winchester. This was the first brigade of the division. When we arrived in four
                    miles of Winchester we found both Gordon's and Ramseur's divisions fighting. We
                    faced to the front and moved forward. Just as we met our cavalry falling back
                    and the brigade went in with a yell, and had only gone a short distance when we
                    gaining ground to the right, and at once time moved to the right by the flank,
                    trying to make connection with Ramseur's division. The brigade moved in fine
                    order and without any hesitation for some distance through an open field beyond
                    any other troops. If the balance of the troops had pushed forward like this
                    brigade we would have driven the enemy from the field. Finally, we were ordered
                    back and took position on a hill in line with he balance of the troops on the
                    left that given way. It fell back in good order beyond Winchester and that night
                    moved toward Fisher's Hill. During this day's hard fighting the brigade acted as
                    well as men could, particularly while holding the hill they had fallen back to.
                    They were suffering very severely from artillery and musketry fire.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th of September the brigade, with the balance of the
                    army, reached Fisher's Hill and formed a line of battle on the left of the army.
                    Remained there until the morning of the 22d, when the enemy moved up in our
                    front and soon threw out their sharpshooters and moved forward their line of
                    battle. The sharpshooters of this brigade were warmly engaged for some time, and
                    finally charged by heavy force of cavalry, but very handsomely repulsed them.
                    The battle soon became general, but after a short time our cavalry gave way on
                    the left, being flanked by a heavy force of infantry, and fell back in
                    confusion. The Forty-fifth and Thirty-second North Carolina Regiments and Second
                    North Carolina Battalion were moved rapidly to the left to their support, and
                    for some time fought successfully the whole force of the enemy, and did not
                    retire until nearly surrounded and being fired at in front, flank, and rear. The
                    Forty-fifth North Carolina Troops acted very gallantly on this occasion. This
                    part of the brigade suffered very heavily from this fire. At this time the whole
                    army had given way and were falling back very rapidly. It retreated toward Mount
                    Jackson and camped near this place, forming line of battle on the right of the
                    army, right resting on the Shenandoah River. On the next morning the enemy made
                    its appearance, and soon engaged our sharpshooters, which lasted until night. At
                    night we fell back to Rude's Hill, and formed line of battle on right of the
                    army. In the morning fell back in line, the enemy pursuing vigorously. This
                    brigade, with our whole army, fell back in good order, under a very heavy
                    artillery and often musketry fire for more than twelve miles. Both officers and
                    men acted well. The brigade left the turnpike, taking the left toward Port
                    Republic, reaching there the following day, and then moved up toward Brown's
                    Gap, camping several days, and then moving out and up to Waynesborough. Camped
                    there for several days, and then moved down toward New Hope, and after camping
                    here for a few days moved down the Valley toward Harrisonburg. The enemy had
                    fallen back, and the brigade went into camp at New Market for some days, and
                    then moved down the Valley to Fisher's Hill and camped from several days.</p>
<p>On the night of the 16th of October this brigade was mounted behind Rosser's
                    cavalry and moved on the right flanks and rear of the enemy, surprising and
                    capturing a picket of thirty men. The men then had a very hard march back to
                    camp, reaching there late in the evening. On the evening of the 18th of October
                    the brigade was ordered to move at sunset, and with the balance of the army left
                    camp, crossing the turnpike and moving down the Shenandoah River toward Front
                    Royal. It was quite a long and tiresome march, often climbing in one rank around
                    the brow of mountain. It was also quite cold, and when the men halted to rest
                    they suffered much, having forded the river an not able on account of the
                    proximity of the enemy to have fires. At daylight we crossed the Shenandoah
                    River and moved rapidly to the right of the army, forming in line, and soon
                    struck the enemy and drove them rapidly for some time, when we were halted and
                    remained for some time under ave heavy artillery fire, losing many men from it,
                    our right flank being exposed. The Thirty-second North Carolina Regt. was
                    deployed as sharpshooters, and going to the left moved forward in line with the
                    brigade. The Forty-fifth and Forty-third North Carolina Regiments were also
                    detached to support other troops on the left. The brigade then moved forward
                    under heavy fire, the Third-second as a line of sharpshooters following the
                    enemy through Middletown. The enemy made a stand on a very high and temporarily
                    fortified hill, and the Fifty-third North Carolina troops and Second North
                    Carolina Battalion were ordered to charge them, which they did with a yell,
                    driving them back for some distance, but being unsupported on either flank, soon
                    had to retire, the enemy moving on both flanks. In falling back they lost
                    heavily in good men.</p>
<p>In this charge both offices and men acted very handsomely, and fell back
                    stubbornly, resisting the overwhelming numbers of the enemy. Lieut. Murray,
                    Company A, Fifth third North Carolina Troops, then acting adjutant of this
                    regiment, acted with distinguished gallantry. These two regiments, with the
                    balance of the brigade, were soon reformed and moved forward again, but the
                    enemy had fallen back. The brigade followed. In this charge these two regiments
                    lost many good and gallant men. The whole army soon halted, formed line, and
                    then moved forward for about half a mile, halting for a short time; then moved
                    forward again, the enemy still falling back, and after passing beyond Middletown
                    for some distance the whole army was halted, and remained inactive for several
                    hours. During this time the enemy had rallied his army and brought up fresh
                    troops. At about 3.30 p. m. moved forward. Soon our sharpshooters became
                    engaged, and then their line in front of this brigade moved forward in a charge.
                    The brigadier-general commanding this brigade ordered a counter charge, which
                    the men readily obeyed with a yell, and met the enemy and drove them in great
                    confusion from the field. Soon the troops on the left fell back a short
                    distance, and we were ordered to fall back and form on the, which we did. The
                    troops on the extreme left had given way in much confusion, and soon orders
                    reached us to fall back; and after crossing the creek we found the enemy were
                    between us and Strasburg on the turnpike. The brigade with much of the army,
                    turned to the left, crossing the river twice below the town, and reaching the
                    turnpike again at Fisher's Hill about 10 p. m. We were then ordered to move
                    toward New Market, but soon camped near the pike a part of the night, leaving
                    before day toward New Market, which we reached the same day. Remained there in
                    camp reorganizing and drilling for some weeks. Then moved to the rear of New
                    Market to new cam, remaining there for several weeks.</p>
<p>On 22d of November the enemy's cavalry in heavy force moved up as high as Mount
                    Jackson, driving in our cavalry. We moved down to Rude's Hill with the balance
                    of the army, formed line of battle, and threw out our sharpshooters, which, with
                    the line, drove the enemy back rapidly in the direction of Mount Jackson. Our
                    sharpshooters followed them for several miles, but could not overtake them. We
                    returned to camp, remaining there until the 14th of December, when we took up a
                    line of march for Staunton, Va., which we reached on the evening of the 15th,
                    and then took the train for Richmond, arriving there on the night of the 16th;
                    then came to Dunlop's Station and went into winter quarters on Swift Creek, near
                    the turnpike, where the brigade has since been stationed.</p>
<p>I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. G. COWAND,<br> Col., Cmdg. Brigade.</p>
