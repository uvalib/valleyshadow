<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee writes from Chambersburg to General Richard Ewell in June,
                    1863, with instructions for moving his troops during the Army of Northern
                    Virginia's invasion of Pennsylvania.</p>
<hr width="75%">

<p>Lieut. Gen. R. S. Ewell,<br> Comdg. Corps:</p>
<p>Chambersburg,</p>
<p>June 28, 1863</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I wrote you last night, stating that Gen. Hooker was reported to have crossed the
                    Potomac, and is advancing by way of Middletown, the head of his column being at
                    that point in Frederick County. I directed you in that letter to move your
                    forces to this point. If you have not already progressed on the road, and if you
                    have no good reason against it, I desire you to move in the direction of
                    Gettysburg, via Heidlersburg, where you will have turnpike most of the way, and
                    you can thus join your other divisions to Early's, which is east of the
                    mountains. I think it preferable to keep on the east side of the mountains. When
                    you come to Heidlersburg, you can either move directly on Gettysburg or turn
                    down to Cashtown. Your trains and heavy artillery you can send, if you think
                    proper, on the road to Chambersburg. But if the roads which your troops take are
                    good, they had better follow you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
