<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, responds to Union Provost Marshal-General James B. Fry in August,
                    1863, concerning efforts to enforce the draft in the Pennsylvania mining
                    regions. Couch outlines his plans to use troops to enforce enrollment, and
                    comments on the lawlessness of the miners.</p>

<p>Col. J. B. FRY:</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 5, 1863.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I received your telegram to-day reference to enrollment in the mining district.
                    My intention has been to keep a reserve force of three regiments and a battery
                    or more at Reading in order to re-enforce at any point where more troops might
                    be required. But the Governor of the State seems to be of the opinion that he
                    has no authority for retaining the militia to enforce the draft. I think,
                    however, that he will keep seven Philadelphia regiments for their full terms of
                    three months. If the drafted men are taken from their homes at the same time
                    both in Philadelphia and the coal regions seven regiments will be small enough
                    force to sustain the laws. You may be assured that sending troops to Pottsville
                    and Scranton has had a good effect. My idea is to have a sufficient number of
                    troops at either the above places to enforce the draft without bloodshed. The
                    ignorant miners have no fear of God, the State authority, or the devil. The
                    Democratic leaders have not the power of burnt flax over them for good. A strong
                    military power under the Gen. Government alone keeps matters quiet. I shall
                    endeavor to at least maintain the present force there.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
