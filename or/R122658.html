<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June, 1861, Union General Robert Patterson, commanding the Department of
                    Pennsylvania, prepared to advance on Confederate-held Harper's Ferry. Patterson
                    discusses his plans to gather his forces at Chambersburg before moving. He also
                    mentions the locations and status of some of his regiments.</p>

<p>HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-Gen., U. S. Army:</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pa., </p>
<p>June 1, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to state, for the information of the Gen.-in-Chief, in reply to
                    his telegram of this date, calling for a report of my intended operations, that,
                    though looking to Cumberland, my plans have been mainly directed to turning
                    Harper's Ferry, throwing across the river near Williamsport ample force (with
                    support following and threatening Shepherdstown) to push on and occupy
                    Martinsburg, if I do not find the enemy too strong and moving to cut my line of
                    march. His attitude and strength will then determine the course to be pursued,
                    either to move direct upon him through Shepherdstown or to cut off his retreat
                    along the Winchester Railroad and to harass his rear. I wish to place such a
                    force on the Virginia shore as can hold every inch of ground gained, and,
                    however slowly, to advance securely, after Harper's Ferry falls, upon
                    Winchester.</p>
<p>The effective force now in Chambersburg is five companies of cavalry(four regular
                    and one volunteer) and six infantry regiments, and four not accoutered. At York
                    and Lancaster two regiments each, not accoutered. These will be at once
                    collected in Chambersburg. A regiment at New Castle and one at Baltimore will
                    soon follow. The troops in New York Harbor are ordered on.</p>
<p>I shall to-morrow evening be in Chambersburg, and shall lose no time to complete
                    arrangements and sent forward the command, as indicated in my letter to
                    Maj.-Gen. Keim, a copy of which is inclosed. All the troops are anxious to be on
                    the move and to see their foe-a desire which shall soon be gratified. I will
                    inform you when I shall move in time to permit the Gen.-in-Chief to make the
                    demonstration indicated.</p>
<p>I am much gratified to know the Gen.-in-Chief will provide some artillery.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
