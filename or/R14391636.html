<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, writes Colonel James
                    Forsyth in November, 1864, concerning the possibility of a raid by Confederate
                    guerrillas into southern Pennsylvania. Couch states that the large number of
                    Confederate spies captured have convinced him that such a raid is planned. He
                    reports that he is raising home guards in Franklin County to help defend the
                    richly-supplied farms between Hagerstown and Shippensburg.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. JAMES W. FORSYTH,<br> Chief of Staff, Mid.
                        Mil. Division, Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>November 16, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to state that, from the information in my possession, together
                    with the number of spies recently arrested, and the fact that there are many
                    persons who are undoubtedly spies in this valley and the adjacent country, but
                    cannot be taken, I am of the opinion that a raid is intended into this valley by
                    guerrillas. I have some 350 men-infantry, mounted men, and artillery-scattered
                    as pickets and for protection. Six companies of home guards are being organized
                    in this county, and perhaps the number will be increased to ten or twenty. If
                    the people carry this out as they should, I doubt if a guerrilla party will
                    attempt to enter the State, but at this time there is no great protection for
                    the well-filled barns between Hagerstown and Shippensburg.</p>
<p>I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Department.</p>
