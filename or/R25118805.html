<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon writes John Baldwin at Staunton in
                    January, 1863, concerning the death of a prisoner in Richmond.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Hon. JOHN B. BALDWIN, Staunton, Va.</p>
<p>Richmond,</p>
<p>January 5, 1863.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inclose to you a copy of the report of S. S. Baxter, esq.,
                    who was charged with the investigation anew of the case of Samuel Simmons. It
                    appears from this report and the accompanying certificates that Simmons was
                    received at the C. S. Military Prison in this city on the evening of the 7th of
                    September last, was transferred to the hospital on the 12th and died there on
                    the 18th or 19th of the same month. The seeming loss of all trace of this
                    unfortunate man while in the custody of the military authorities presented a
                    case sufficiently startling to arouse the anxious attention of the Department.
                    The illness of Mr. Simmons unhappily occurring so speedily after he was brought
                    to Richmond issuing in his death in the brief space of six days doubtless
                    prevented his case being the subject of examination while fresh in the memory of
                    those in whose custody he had been placed. Changes in the officers at the
                    prisons, the large number of prisoners of war as well as others in confinement
                    there and the clerical error in the name as explained by Mr. Baxter account for
                    the difficulty which has existed in tracing him. While sparing no effort to
                    guard the interests of the Confederacy in the life struggle in which we are
                    engaged it is my earnest desire and purpose that the personal rights of the
                    citizen shall be as jealously observed as in time of peace so far as is
                    consistent with the safety of the State.</p>
<p>Respectfully, yours,</p>
<p>JAMES A. SEDDON,<br> Secretary of War.</p>
