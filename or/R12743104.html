<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In July, 1863, after the battle of Gettysburg, the Lincoln administration put
                    pressure on General George G. Meade to move the Army of the Potomac into
                    Virginia to pursue Lee. In this letter, Meade reports to General in Chief
                    Halleck on his preparations to move. He says some scouts place the main body of
                    Confederate forces in Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. Halleck,<br> Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 28, 1863--3 p. m. (Received 7.35 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am making every effort to prepare this army for an advance. The principal
                    difficulties encountered are the passage of the Rappahannock (at present
                    unfordable, but which will probably be bridged to-night), also the want of
                    animals for the batteries and cavalry, to supply which the quartermaster's
                    department is doing everything possible. The recent marches in the mountain
                    passes and the excessive heat of the weather caused a great loss of animals and
                    the exhaustion of many others. A large proportion of the animals require
                    shoeing. It is also necessary to accumulate subsistence stores to load the
                    trains before starting. I am in hopes to commence the movement to-morrow, when I
                    shall first throw over a cavalry force to feel for the enemy, and cross the
                    infantry as fast as possible. My plan is to advance on the railroad to Culpeper
                    and as far beyond as the enemy's position will permit, to detach sufficient
                    force to hold and guard the railroad from Manassas Junction, and thus test the
                    question which has been raised of the capacity of the Orange and Alexandria
                    Railroad to supply the army and the practicability of maintaining open such a
                    long line of communication.</p>
<p>No reliable intelligence of the position of the enemy has been obtained. He
                    pickets the Rappahannock from Fredericksburg to Rappahannock Station. These
                    pickets, however, seem to be mere "lookouts," to warn him of my approach. Some
                    camps can be seen at Pony Mountain, near Culpeper, and in the vicinity of Cedar
                    Mountain.</p>
<p>Contradictory reports from citizens and scouts place the main body, some at
                    Gordonsville, others say at Staunton and Charlottesville, and some assert the
                    retreat has been extended to Richmond. My own expectation is that he will be
                    found behind the line of the Rapidan, which, from all I can learn, presents a
                    favorable line of defense, most of the fords being commanded by the southern
                    bank, where his artillery can be used to advantage. If I can hold the railroad
                    without too great a weakening of my force, and it proves to have the capacity to
                    afford all the supplies needed, I shall advance until the enemy is encountered
                    or definite information obtained of his movements.</p>
<p>By holding the road, I do not refer to the force necessary to prevent the
                    injuries caused by guerrillas, but against large bodies of cavalry or other
                    forces placed on my flank and rear for the purpose of destroying my
                    communications.</p>
<p></p>
