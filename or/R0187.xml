                <p>In compliance with instructions from headquarters Second Cavalry Division, I have
                    the honor to make the following report of operations of this brigade in the
                    engagements of the 5th, 6th, and 7th instant:</p>
                <p>The brigade (with the exception of the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, who were ordered to
                    report to Gen. Warren at 6 a.m., 5th instant) left its present camp at 3 a.m.,
                    5th instant; marched, via Gary's Church and Reams' Station, to Dinwiddie
                    Court-House, where we remained about one hour; then returned to the Rowanty,
                    where we bivouacked.</p>
                <p>At 1 a.m., 6th instant, orders were received to march, when in company with the
                    division the brigade marched, via Monk's Neck bridge, to the Vaughan road and
                    joined the infantry near Hatcher's Run, where the brigade was formed on the west
                    side of the run. Here the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, which accompanied the infantry on
                    the advance, rejoined the brigade, participated in the engagement on the 6th
                    instant, with but slight loss. The Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry was ordered
                    to report half to Gen. Crawford and half to a staff officer of Gen. Meade.</p>
                <p>At 1 p.m., 7th instant, the brigade returned to Weldon railroad, where it
                    remained during the night, and on the morning of 8th instant returned to camp.</p>
                <p>I have the honor to mention the following-named enlisted men as having displayed
                    marked bravery on the advance to Hatcher's Run while with the infantry: Sergt.
                    Michael Eck, Company L, Sixth Ohio Cavalry; Corpl. Harley B. Scribner, Company
                    L, Sixth Ohio Cavalry; Private William W. Porter, Company L, Sixth Ohio Cavalry;
                    Corpl. W. Emerson Dunlap, Company K, Sixth Ohio Cavalry.</p>
