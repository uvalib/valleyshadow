<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Phillip Sheridan writes to General Grant in October, 1864, to discuss the
                    possibility of a move on Staunton or Charlottesville. Sheridan reports on

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT:</p>
<p>HARRISONBURG,</p>
<p>October 1, 1864--9.30 p. m.<br> (Received 3d.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>A dispatch just received from Gen. Halleck, in which you expect me to reach
                    Staunton or Charlottesville. I have been to Staunton and Waynesborough with the
                    cavalry; destroyed the iron bridge on South River at Waynesborough, throwing it
                    into the river; also the bridge over Christian's Creek, and the railroad from
                    Staunton to Waynesborough. My judgment is that it would be best to terminate
                    this campaign by the destruction of the crops, &amp;c., in this valley, and
                    the transfer of the troops to the army operating against Richmond. If the Orange
                    and Alexandria Railroad is opened, it will take an army corps to protect it. If
                    the Front Royal road is opened, it will take as many troops to protect it, as
                    there is no enemy in the Valley to operate against. Early is, without doubt,
                    fortifying at Charlottesville, holding Rockfish Gap. It is no easy matter to
                    pass these mountain gaps and attack Charlottesville, hauling supplies through
                    difficult passes, fourteen miles in length, and with a line of communication
                    from 135 to 145 miles in length, without the organization of supply trains,
                    ordnance trains, and all the appointments of an army making a permanent advance.
                    At present we are organized for a raid up the Valley, with no trains except the
                    corps trains. All the regimental wagons had to be used as supply wagons to
                    subsist us as far as this place, and can't do it at that. I am ready and willing
                    to cross the Blue Ridge, but know from present indications that the enemy will
                    strongly fortify at Charlottesville and Gordonsville of a largely superior force
                    to keep open the line of communication. With my present means, I cannot
                    accumulate supplies enough to carry me through to the Orange and Alexandria
                    Railroad.</p>
