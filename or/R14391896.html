<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During the fall of 1864, Confederate General Jubal Early met several defeats in
                    the Shenandoah Valley at the hands of Phil Sheridan's Federals. In this October
                    letter, Virginia Governor William Smith writes Robert E. Lee to attempt to get
                    Early removed from command. Smith asserts that the sentiment of Valley citizens,
                    including a prominent resident of Staunton, ran strongly against Early.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Gen. R. E. LEE:</p>
<p>Richmond,</p>
<p>October 12, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of the 10th of October, in reply to mine of the
                    7th (6th). I had always regarded the summer campaign confided to Gen. Early as
                    presenting that finest opportunity for a great and brilliant success which had
                    fallen to the lot of any of our generals. Up to this time I have regarded it
                    from its commencement to this hour as a most disastrous failure. You are
                    pleased, however, to say: "As far as I have been able to judge at this distance,
                    he has conducted the military operations in the Valley well." Although this is a
                    somewhat restricted commendation, yet I take it as your purpose to comprehend in
                    it the whole campaign; of course you are much more competent to judge than
                    myself, yet, highly as I appreciate the ripeness of your judgment, I am still
                    unconvinced. Believing that Early's campaign was a great disaster, I sought an
                    interview with you that I might freely converse with you upon the peril which
                    his reverses had brought upon a large portion, if not the whole of the State. I
                    informed you that I did so as Governor of the State. You were pleased to express
                    a willingness to change the commander of the Valley army if a successor could be
                    agreed upon in Richmond, and in speaking of the propriety of a successor to Gen.
                    Early, you said that public sentiment had to be consulted, and that, if that
                    sentiment called for a change it ought to be made whether Early was to blame or
                    not. For reasons which I have stated and for the further rear on that I was not
                    well advised, I did not press this view in our conversation. Hearing from a
                    variety of sources, however, that there was much dissatisfaction among people in
                    the Valley, and in the army also, at the management of Gen. Early, I deemed it
                    my duty and in strict accordance with the principle you stated to apprise you of
                    what I considered to be the general sentiment, and, to be more precise therein,
                    gave you extracts from the letter of a highly intelligent gentleman and officer
                    in reference to the state of public opinion in the army. About the time of
                    writing you I had a conversation with one of the most intelligent citizens of
                    the Valley, residing in the midst of Gen. Early's operations, who gave me a
                    sketch of the popular judgment as to his military conduct, and added that that
                    judgment called for a change in the commander of the Valley army. A high
                    official of the State government witnessed the fight at Winchester and expressed
                    similar opinions, and spoke feelingly of the fact that the army in it retreat
                    covered a space of five and twenty miles. It is well known and tacked about that
                    the army threw away its guns and the Secretary of War, as I understood him, had
                    to send arms to Staunton to replace them.</p>
<p>Now, general, after all this, after your concession that public sentiment should
                    decide the question of the commander, I respectfully ask how you were to learn
                    that sentiment? Certainly by communications from some quarter, and what quarter
                    more entitled to respect and appreciation than the Governor of Virginia? Why,
                    sir, since writing the above paragraph I met with a prominent citizens of
                    Staunton, who, after stating that Early had disappointed expectations, asked me
                    why I did not have him relived. I, of course, replied that that was not in my
                    power. Evidences of this description could be multiplied indefinitely. But it
                    seems that charges must be preferred against Gen. Early, and that you must have
                    the name of the accuser. I do not feel myself at liberty to give the names of
                    the officers referred to. But what are the charges-if they may be so
                    termed-stated in the letter from which I quoted? First, that "the army left
                    Waynesborough in the hardest, coldest, and bleakest storm of the season;"
                    secondly, that an impression prevails that he has no feeling for his men, and
                    that his presence awakens no enthusiasm; thirdly, that the army once believed he
                    was a safe commander, but believe so no longer; fourthly, that he was surprised
                    at Winchester and did not expect a general engagement; fifthly, that Gen. Early
                    has fought his army on every occasion in detail; sixty, that he has lost
                    twenty-five pieces of artillery in this campaign; seventy, that the good of the
                    country requires a change in the command of that army. I believe that not one of
                    these points or opinions, except that which alleges a surprise at Winchester,
                    constitutes a proper subject for court-martial. I cannot see how the public
                    service is to be promoted by such a court, and therefore shall certainly take no
                    step to reach such result. But as you seem to think that Gen. Early should be
                    apprised of the accusations against him, you are perfectly at liberty, if you so
                    regard my opinions of his military capacity, to furnish such extracts from my
                    letter as embrace them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I repeat, I am deeply impressed with the conviction that Gen.
                    Early is not competent to independent command; that the good of the service, by
                    which I am governed, requires that he should be relieved, and that such is the
                    general sentiment of the country through which he has been operating. I trust
                    that results will prove that I have done Gen. Early injustice, and that he will
                    adorn his name with the glory of redeeming our great Valley from a vandal foe.</p>
<p>I am, general, with the highest respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. SMITH.</p>
