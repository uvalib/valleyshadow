<p></p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>Fairfax Court-House</p>
<p>October 14, 1861</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit to the honorable Secretary of War a report of the
                    operations of the troops under my command, which terminated in the battle of
                    Manassas.</p>
<p>I reached Manassas about noon on the 20th, preceded by the Seventh and Eighth
                    Georgia Regiments and by Jackson's brigade, consisting of the Second, Fourth,
                    Fifth, Twenty-seventh, and Thirty-third Virginia Regiments. I was accompanied by
                    Gen. Bee, with the Fourth Alabama, the Second, and two companies of the Eleventh
                    Mississippi. The president of the railroad company had assured me that the
                    remaining troops should arrive during the day. I found Gen. Beauregard's
                    position too extensive, and the ground to o densely wooded and intricate, to be
                    learned in the brief time at my disposal and therefore determined to rely upon
                    his knowledge of it and of the enemy's positions. This I did readily from full
                    confidence in his capacity.</p>
<p>His troops were divided into eight brigades, occupying the defensive line of Bull
                    Run. Brig.-Gen. Ewell's was posted at the Union Mills Ford; Brig. Gen. D. R.
                    Jones' at McLean's Ford; Brig.-Gen. Longstreet's at Blackburn's Ford; Brig.-Gen.
                    Bonham's at Mitchell's Ford; Col. Cocke's at Ball's Ford, some three miles
                    above; and Col. Evans, with a regiment and battalion, formed the extreme left at
                    the stone bridge. The brigades of Brig.-Gen. Holmes and Col. Eearly were in
                    reserve in rear of the right. I regarded the arrival of the remainder of the
                    Army of the Shenandoah during the night as certain, and Patterson's junction
                    with the Grand Army on the 22d as probable.</p>
<p>During the evening it was determined, instead of remaining in the [1]defensive positions then occupied, to assume the
                    offensive and attack the enemy before such a junction. Gen. Beauregard proposed
                    a plan of battle, which I approved without hesitation. He drew up the necessary
                    order during the night, which was approved formally by me at 4.30 o'clock on the
                    morning of the 21st. The early movements of the enemy on that morning and the
                    non-arrival of the expected troops prevented its execution. Gen. Beauregard
                    afterwards proposed a modification of the abandoned plan, to attack with our
                    right while the left stood on the defensive. This, too, became impracticable,
                    and a battle ensued different in place and circumstances from any previous plan
                    on our side. </p>
<p>Soon after sunrise on the morning of the 21st a light cannonade was opened upon
                    Col. Evans' position. A similar demonstration was made against the center soon
                    after, and strong forces were observed in front of it and of the right. About 8
                    o'clock Gen. Beauregard and I placed ourselves on a commanding hill in rear of
                    Gen. Bonham's left. Near 9 o'clock the signal officer, Capt. Alexander, reported
                    that a large body of troops was crossing the valley of Bull Run some two miles
                    above the bridge. Gen. Bee, who had been placed near Col. Cocke's position, Col.
                    Hampton, with his Legion, and Col. Jackson, from a point near Gen. Bonham's
                    left, were ordered to hasten to the left flank. The signal officer soon called
                    our attention to a heavy cloud of dust to the northwest and about ten miles off,
                    such as the march of an army would raise. This excited apprehension of Gen.
                    Patterson's approach.</p>
<p>The enemy, under cover of a strong demonstration on our right, made a long detour
                    through the woods on his right, crossed Bull Run two miles above our left, and
                    threw himself upon the flank and rear of our position. This movement was
                    fortunately discovered by us in time to check its progress, and ultimately to
                    form a new line of battle nearly at right angles with the defensive line of Bull
                    Run.</p>
<p>On discovering that the enemy had crossed the stream above him, Col. Evans moved
                    to his left with eleven companies and two field-pieces to oppose his advance,
                    and disposed his little force under cover of the wood near the intersection of
                    the Warrenton turnpike and the Sudley road. Here he was attacked by the enemy in
                    immensely superior numbers, against which he maintained himself with skill and
                    unshrinking courage. Gen. Bee moving towards the enemy, guided by the firing,
                    had with a soldier's eye selected the position the Seventh and house, and formed
                    his troops upon it. They were the Seventh and Eighth Georgia, Fourth Alabama,
                    Second Mississippi, and two companies of the Eleventh Mississippi, with
                    Imboden's battery. Being compelled, however, to sustain Col. Evans, he crossed
                    the valley and formed on the right and somewhat in advance of his position. Here
                    the joint force, little exceeding five regiments, with six field pieces, held
                    the ground against about fifteen thousand United States troops for an hour,
                    until, finding themselves outflanked by the continually arriving troops, of the
                    enemy, they fell back to Gen. Bee's first position, upon the line of which
                    Jackson, just arriving, formed his brigade and Stanard's battery. Col. Hampton,
                    who had by this time advanced with his Legion as far as the turnpike, rendered
                    efficient service in maintaining the orderly character of the retreat from that
                    point; and here fell the gallant Lieut.-Col. Johnson, his second in command.</p>
<p>In the mean time I waited with Gen. Beauregard near the center the full
                    development of the enemy's designs. About 11 o'clock the violence of the firing
                    on the left indicated a battle, and the march of a large body of troops from the
                    enemy's center towards the conflict was shown by clouds of dust. I was thus
                    convinced that is great effort was to be made with his right. I stated that
                    conviction to Gen. Beauregard, and the absolutely necessity of immediately
                    strengthening our left as much as possible. Orders were accordingly at once sent
                    to Gen. Holmes and Col. Early to move with all speed to the sound of the firing,
                    and to Gen. Bonham to send up two of his regiments and a battery. Gen. Beuregard
                    and I then hurried at a rapid gallop to the scene of action, about four miles
                    off. On the way I directed my chief of artillery, Col. Pendleton, to follow with
                    his own and Alburtis' batteries.</p>
<p>We came not a moment too soon. The long contest against fivefold odds and heavy
                    losses, especially of field officers, had greatly discouraged the troops of Gen.
                    Bee and Col. Evans. Our presence with them under fire and some example had the
                    happiest effect on the spirit of the troops. Orders was soon restored and the
                    battle re-established, to which the firmness of Jackson's brigade greatly
                    contributed. Then, in a brief and rapid conference, Gen. Beauregard was assigned
                    to the command of the left, which, as the younger officer, he claimed, while I
                    returned to that of the whole field. The aspect of affairs was critical, but I
                    had full confidence in the skill and indomitable courage of Gen. Beauregard, the
                    high soldierly qualities of Gens. Bee and Jackson and Col. Evans, and the
                    devoted patriotism of their troops.</p>
<p>Orders were first dispatched to hasten the march of Gen. Holmes', Col. Early's,
                    and Gen. Bonham's regiments. Gen. Ewell was also directed to follow with all
                    speed. Many of the broken troops, fragments of companies, and individual
                    stragglers were reformed and brought into action with the aid of my staff and a
                    portion of Gen. Beauregard's. Col. (late Governor) Smith with his battalion and
                    Col. Hunton with his regiment were ordered up to re-enforce the right. I have
                    since learned that Gen. Beauregard had previously ordered them into the battle.
                    They belonged to his corps. Col. Smith's cheerful courage had a fine influence,
                    not only upon the spirit of his own men, but upon the stragglers of the troops
                    engaged. The largest body of these, equal to about four companies, having no
                    competent field officer, I placed under the command of one of my staff, Col. F.
                    J. Thomas, who fell while gallantly leading it against the enemy. These
                    re-enforcements were all sent to the right to re-establish more perfectly that
                    part of our line. Having attended to these pressing duties at the immediate
                    scene of conflict, my eye was next directed to Col. Cocke's brigade, the nearest
                    at hand. Hastening to his position, I desired him to lead his troops into
                    action. He informed me, however, that a large body of the enemy's troops beyond
                    the stream and below the bridge threatened us from that quarter. He was
                    therefore left in his position.</p>
<p>My headquarters were now established near the Lewis house. From this commanding
                    elevation my view embraced the position of the enemy beyond the stream and the
                    approaches to the stone bridge, a point of especial importance. I could also see
                    the advances of our troops far down the valley in the direction of Manassas, and
                    observe the progress of the action and the maneuvers of the enemy.</p>
<p>We had now sixteen guns and two hundred and sixty cavalry and a little above nine
                    regiments of the Army of the Shenandoah and six guns, and less than the strength
                    of three regiments of that of the Potomac, engaged with about thirty-five
                    thousand United States troops, among whom were full three thousand of the old
                    Regular Army. Yet this admirable artillery and brave infantry and cavalry lost
                    no foot of ground. For nearly three hours they maintained their position,
                    repelling five successive assaults by the heavy masses of the enemy, whose
                    numbers enabled him continually to bring up fresh troops as their preceding
                    columns were driven back. Col. Stuart contributed to one of these repulses by a
                    well-timed and vigorous charge on the enemy's right flank with two companies of
                    his cavalry.</p>
<p>The efficiency of our infantry and cavalry might have been expected from a
                    patriotic people accustomed like ours to the management of arms and horses, but
                    that of the artillery was little less than wonderful. They were opposed to
                    batteries far superior in the number, range, and equipment of their guns, with
                    educated officers and thoroughly instructed soldiers. We had but one educated
                    artillerist, Col. Pendleton, that model of a Christian soldier, yet they
                    exhibited as much superiority to the enemy in skill as in courage. Their fire
                    was superior both in rapidity and precision.</p>
<p>About 2 o'clock an officer of Gen. Beauregard's adjutant-general's office
                    galloped from Manassas to report to me that a United States army had reached the
                    line of Manassas Gap Railroad, was marching towards us, and then but three or
                    four miles from out left flank. The expected re-enforcements appeared soon
                    after. Col. Cocke was then desired to lead his brigade into action to support
                    the right of the troops engaged, which he did with alacrity and effect. Within a
                    half hour the two regiments of Gen. Bonham's brigade (Cash's and Kershaw's) came
                    up, and were directed against the enemy's right, which he seemed to be
                    strengthening. Fisher's North Carolina regiment was soon after sent in the same
                    direction. About 3 o'clock, while the enemy seemed to be striving to outflank
                    and drive back our left, and thus separate us from Manassas, Gen. E. K. Smith
                    arrived with three regiments of Elzey's brigade. He was instructed to attack the
                    right flank of the enemy, now exposed to us. Before the movement was completed
                    he fell, severely wounded. Col. Elzey, at once taking command, executed it with
                    great promptitude and vigor. Gen. Beauregard rapidly seized the opportunity thus
                    afforded him, and threw forward his whole line. The enemy was driven back from
                    the long contested hill, and victory was no longer doubtful.</p>
<p>He made yet another attempt to retrieve the day. He again extended his right with
                    a still wider sweep to turn our left. Just as he reformed to renew the battle
                    Col. Early's three regiments came upon the field. The enemy's new formation
                    exposed his right flank more even than the previous one. Col. Early was
                    therefore ordered to throw himself directly upon it, supported by Col. Stuart's
                    Cavalry and Beckham's battery. He executed this attack bravely and well, while a
                    simultaneous charge was made by Gen. Beauregard in front. The enemy was broken
                    by this combined attack. He lost all the artillery which he had advanced to the
                    scene of the conflict. He had no more fresh troops to rally on, and a general
                    rout ensued.</p>
<p>Instructions were instantly sent to Gen. Bonham to march by the quickest route to
                    the turnpike to intercept the fugitives, and to Gen. Longstreet to follow as
                    closely as possible upon the right. Their progress was checked by the enemy's
                    reserve and by night at Centreville. Schenck's brigade made a slight
                    demonstration towards Lewis' Ford, which was quickly checked by Holmes' brigade,
                    which had just arrived from the right. His artillery, under Capt. Walker, was
                    used with great skill. Col. Stuart pressed the pursuit on the enemy's principal
                    line of retreat, the Sudley road. Four companies of cavalry, under Col. Radford
                    and Lieut.-Col. Munford, which I had held in reserve, were ordered to cross the
                    stream at Ball's Ford to reach the turnpike, the line of retreat of the enemy's
                    left. Our cavalry found the roads encumbered with dead and wounded (many of whom
                    seemed to have been thrown from wagons), arms, accouterments, and clothing.</p>
<p>A report came to me from the right that a strong body of U. S. troops was
                    advancing upon Manassas. Gen. Holmes, who had just reached the field, and Gen.
                    Ewell, on his way to it, were ordered to meet this unexpected attack. They found
                    no foe, however.</p>
<p>Our victory was as complete as one gained by infantry and artillery can be. An
                    adequate force of cavalry would have made it decisive. It is due, under Almighty
                    God, to the skill and resolution of Gen. Beauregard, the admirable conduct of
                    Gens. Bee, E. K. Smith, and Jackson, and of Cols. (commanding brigades) Evans,
                    Cocke, Early, and Elzey, and the courage and unyielding firmness of our
                    patriotic volunteers. The admirable character of our troops is incontestably
                    proved by the result of this battle, especially when it is remembered that
                    little more than six thousand men of the Army of the Shenandoah with sixteen
                    guns, and lees than two thousand of that of the Potomac with six guns, for full
                    five hours successfully resisted thirty-five thousand U. S. troops with a
                    powerful artillery and superior force of regular cavalry. Our forces engaged
                    gradually increasing during the remainder of the contest, amounted to but--met
                    at the close of the battle. The brunt of this hard-fought engagement fell upon
                    the troops who held their ground so long with such heroic resolution. The
                    unfading honor which they won was dearly bought with the blood of many of our
                    best and bravest. Their loss was far heavier in proportion than that of the
                    troops coming later into action.</p>
<p>Every regiment and battery engaged performed its part well. The commanders of
                    brigades have been already mentioned. I refer you to Gen. Beauregard's report
                    for the names of the officers of the Army of the Potomac who distinguished
                    themselves most. I cannot enumerate all of the Army of the Shenandoah who
                    deserve distinction, and will confine myself to those of high rank: Cols. Bartow
                    and Fisher (killed); Jones (mortally wounded); Harper, J. F. Preston, Cummings,
                    Falkner, Gartrell, and Vaughan; J. E. B. Stuart, of the cavalry, and Pendleton,
                    of the artillery; Lieut.-Cols. Echols, Lightfoot, Lackland, G. H. Steuart, and
                    Gardner. The last-named gallant officer was severely wounded.</p>
<p>The loss of the Army of the Potomac was 108 killed, 510 wounded, and 12 missing.
                    That of the Army of the Shenandoah was 270 killed, 979 wounded, and 18 missing.
                    Total killed, 378; wounded, 1,489; missing, 30. That of the enemy could not be
                    ascertained. It must have been four or five thousand.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight pieces of artillery, about five thousand muskets, and nearly five
                    hundred thousand cartridges, a garrison flag, and ten colors were captured on
                    the field or in the pursuit. Besides these we captured sixty-four artillery
                    horses, with their harness, twenty-six wagons, and much camp equipage, clothing,
                    and other property abandoned in their flight.</p>
<p>The officers of my staff deserve high commendation for their efficient and
                    gallant services during the day and the campaign, and I beg leave to call the
                    attention of the Government to their merits. Maj. W. H. C. Whiting, chief
                    engineer, was invaluable to me for his signal ability in his profession and for
                    his indefatigable activity before and in the battle. Maj. McLean, chief
                    quartermaster, and Maj. Kearsley, chief commissary, conducted their respective
                    departments with skill and energy. Maj. Rhett, assistant adjutant-general, who
                    joined me only the day before, was of great service. I left him at Manassas, and
                    to his experience and energy I intrusted the care of ordering my troops to the
                    field of battle as they should arrive, and forwarding ammunition for the
                    artillery during the action. Capts. C. M. Fauntleroy, C. S. Navy, T. L. Preston,
                    assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut. J. B. Washington, aide-de-camp, conveyed
                    my orders bravely and well on this their first field, as did several gallant
                    gentlemen who volunteered their services--Col. Cole, of Florida; Maj. Deas, of
                    Alabama; Col. Duncan, of Kentucky. Lieut. Beverly Randolph, C. S. Army, aided
                    Col. F. J. Thomas in the command of the body of troops he led into action and
                    fought with gallantry. With these was my gallant friend Capt. Barfought with
                    gallantry. With these was my gallant friend Capt. Barlow Mason, who was mortally
                    wounded. I have already mentioned the brave death of my ordnance officer, Col.
                    F. J. Thomas. I was much indebted also to Cols. J. S. Preston, Manning, Miles,
                    and Chisolm, and Capt. Stevens, of the Engineer Corps, members of Gen.
                    Beauregard's staff, who kindly proffered their services and rendered efficient
                    and valuable aid at different times during the day. Col. G. W. Lay, of Gen.
                    Bonham's staff, delivered the instructions to the troops sent in pursuit and to
                    intercept the enemy, with much intelligence and courage.</p>
<p>It will be remarked that the three brigadier-generals of the Army of the
                    Shenandoah were all wounded. I have already mentioned the wound of Gen. Smith.
                    Gen. Jackson, though painfully wounded early in the day, commanded his brigade
                    until the close of the action. Gen. Bee, after great exposure at the
                    commencement of the engagement, was mortally wounded just as our re-enforcements
                    were coming up.</p>
<p>The apparent firmness of the U. S. troops at Centreville, who had not been
                    engaged, which checked our pursuit; the strong forces occupying the works near
                    Georgetown, Arlington, and Alexandria; the certainty, too, that Gen. Patterson,
                    if needed, would reach Washington with his army of thirty thousand men sooner
                    than we could, and the condition and inadequate means of the Army of advancing
                    against the capital. It is certain that the fresh troops within the works were
                    in number quite sufficient for their defense. If not, Gen. Patterson's army
                    would certainly re-enforce them soon enough.</p>
<p>This report will be presented to you by my aide-de-camp, Lieut. J. B. Washington,
                    by whom, and by Gen. Beauregard's aide, Lieut. Ferguson, the captured colors are
                    transmitted to the War Department.</p>
<p>Most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> J. E. JOHNSTON,<br> Gen. </p>
