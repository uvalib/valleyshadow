<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Bradley T. Johnson reports on the actions of his troops at
                    New Creek and Moorefield during August, 1864. Johnson also discusses the
                    behavior of the Confederate cavalry troops during the mid-summer raid north of
                    the Potomac into Maryland and Pennsylvania. In Johnson's opinion, the conduct of
                    the troops was very poor, and included thievery and drunkenness. He mentions the
                    burning of Chambersburg in which some soldiers engaged in extortion and
                    drinking, making, in his opinion, a chance for national vengeance turn into base
                    brigandage.</p>

<p>HDQRS. JOHNSON'S CAVALRY BRIGADE,</p>
<p>Lieut. Col. A. S. PENDLETON,<br> Assistant
                        Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p> Near Mount Jackson,</p>
<p>August 10, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>On the 4th August at daylight we moved on New Creek, this command in rear. On
                    arriving there I was ordered by Brig.-Gen. McCausland to occupy a hill on the
                    left with my whole command, post my artillery, and open on an inclosed work
                    which was in our front. I attempted the movement as directed, and found the
                    hills so precipitous that my men could hardly walk up, much less get the
                    artillery there, and after advancing my skirmishers close to the hill designated
                    found a block-house, a palisade work and abatis occupied by a few hundred of the
                    enemy. I could have carried the place with a loss very heavy for my force, but
                    finding that it would be impossible to get artillery there, and when occupied it
                    would be fully 1,200 yards from the inclosed work, and that that work was open
                    in rear and swept by a battery of six guns within short range, making it utterly
                    untenable after being carried by assault, and it being too late for more
                    extended operations, I determined, on consultation with Col. Peters, who was
                    nearest me, not to attack, I accordingly drew off, reported the facts, and was
                    ordered by Brig.-Gen. McCausland to cover his withdrawal, which I did. When his
                    advance reached New Creek I was two miles and one-half in his rear. The reason
                    of this was that I marched from beyond Romney, he from the mouth of Mill Creek,
                    making my march fully seven miles longer than his. When I reached the foot of
                    the mountain I found his column, or at least his ambulances, halted, and he
                    having taken a road twenty-five miles from Romney to New Creek, instead of one
                    eighteen miles, as he had led me to believe he would take, having changed the
                    route without informing me, other than the bare order to follow him. I, in the
                    absence of orders, inferred that he intended to break this long march by a halt
                    to graze. He had halted long enough for me to close an interval of seven miles.
                    I, therefore, also stopped, for precisely an hour from the time my rear got into
                    the field until my advance again started. If, as I understand the reports, there
                    were no men in the works at New Creek when he got there he ought to have taken
                    them at once without waiting for me. But he ordered me to place artillery in a
                    place utterly inaccessible for it, with only eleven rounds for two guns, which
                    fact I reported to him when he gave me the order, and without having
                    reconnoitered the position, he directed me to take it. If he had done so he
                    never could have given the order. It is now my deliberate judgment that the post
                    at New Creek can only be taken by assault of superior numbers, and that had I
                    occupied the position designated by Gen. McCausland it would have been
                    unavailing, inasmuch as the square work, the object of his attack, was perfectly
                    commanded by another work in rear, and also by a work on the Maryland side
                    mounted with heavy guns. It was, in fact, only the outpost of the position. The
                    capture of it would have cost many men, only to be driven out instantly with the
                    loss of more. Gen. McCausland, however, errs in thinking there were few men
                    there. It has since appeared by a report that Gen. Kelley was there with the
                    forces he had at Cumberland. I was an hour behind Gen. McCausland, and the delay
                    could not have affected the result. The enemy were there and disposed of their
                    men to meet attacks at each point so soon as threatened.</p>
<p>Thence we moved to Moorefield, reaching there Friday, August 5, and went into
                    camp, Gen. McCausland on the Moorefield side of the South Branch and this
                    command along the Romney road, the only place I could get grass, my outside
                    regiment four miles and a half from Moorefield, my nearest three-fourths of a
                    mile from Gen. McCausland, who was three miles from that town. The camp was
                    indicated by him, and I received orders, as I did during the expedition,
                    every-where and in every place, where to place my pickets. He designated three
                    roads--the Romney, Patterson's Creek, and Williamsport roads. They were
                    accordingly picketed as he ordered. He directed no scouts along my front and I
                    send none out. He being my commanding officer, having access to all means of
                    information, choosing his own camps, routes, and times of march, I consider it
                    was not my place to send scouts without his order.</p>
<p>At 2 a. m. Sunday, August 7, I received a verbal order by a courier from him,
                    informing me that Averell had passed through Romney the preceding evening with
                    three brigades of cavalry, and directing me to saddle up my command and send out
                    a scout on the Romney road. I instantly sent a courier to each regiment,
                    transmitting the order; it was promptly obeyed by each officer. I, at the same
                    time, sent a scout on the Romney road from the Eighth Virginia Cavalry. This was
                    the first, last, and only intimation I ever received from Gen. McCausland of the
                    proximity of the enemy, and the only order I ever received from him on the
                    subject. The order itself was calculated to assure me that there was no danger
                    of immediate attack. Had he thought it was imminent, he would doubtless have at
                    least ordered me to form and mount my command, if not to take a position to
                    resist attack. My camp was no place to fight in, being a level, with all
                    positions for artillery in favor of an approaching enemy, and had a fight been
                    anticipated I should doubtless have been withdrawn to the fine range of hills on
                    his (Gen. McCausland's) side of the river. About daylight a squadron in
                    Confederate uniform moved by the camp of the First Maryland straight to my
                    headquarters. This who were up and saw them supposed them to be a returning
                    scout or picket, and took no notice of them. They never fired a shot until they
                    reached McNeill's house, where my camp was. Soon after them came a body of
                    Federal cavalry, who rode at once through the camp of the First Maryland to that
                    of the Second Maryland and dispersed both, they being very small, reduced by
                    losses in battle and hard marching to an aggregate for both of not 130 men in
                    camp, the First having twenty-eight men on picket. Maj. Seeney, Thirty-sixth
                    Virginia Battalion, was rapidly pressed back to my headquarters, when Lieut.
                    McNulty, with two pieces of artillery, doubly charged with canister, sought to
                    stop the enemy, but his cannoneers were swept from their pieces by a charge in
                    flank. From the back door of my headquarters, they being around me, I galloped
                    to the Eighth Virginia Cavalry to get them to charge, passing around the front
                    of their column to get there. It was then too late; the Eighth were moving off
                    in good order, but neither their colonel nor myself could wheel them in time.
                    Col. Peters then had the Twenty-first Regt. well in hand, but was unable to
                    check the charge until he had passed beyond the river into Gen. McCausland's
                    camp, where he formed and stopped their crossing for some time, with a loss to
                    them, since ascertained, of 2 majors and 38 men. My object heretofore had been
                    to check them until I could pass the river, where I expected to find Brig.-Gen.
                    McCausland with his command well in hand, who would hold them while I got in
                    position by him, when I had no doubt of the result. Brig.-Gen. McCausland was
                    not there. He had slept in the town of Moorefield, three miles distant from his
                    camp, and did not leave there until between daylight and sunrise, and when he
                    did get on the ground his own command was scattered, some up the Winchester road
                    and some down the Moorefield road. I ordered up the Twenty-seventh Virginia
                    Battalion, Capt. Gibson, and with Col. Peters formed a line to stop their
                    farther advance, which he did for a short time, while I went to get him a
                    support. He was, however, forced back, and both himself and Capt. Gibson wounded
                    and taken prisoners. They were left at Moorefield. After this the enemy only
                    followed me, but made no other attack. Beyond Moorefield I got the command in
                    tolerable order, and Gen. McCausland directed me to hold a position while he
                    hurried on the Matthews' with the fragments of two regiments to join the rest of
                    his command, which had gone up the Winchester road, and which he had directed to
                    join him there. They did not do so, and the parts of regiments whose withdrawal
                    this command covered were the only organized parts of his brigade that I have
                    heard of getting off.</p>
<p>The way in which the enemy got in was this, as told by Private Callan, Company F,
                    First Maryland Cavalry, to his brother, my orderly, when both were
                    prisoners--the latter escaped: The scout from the Eighth having passed beyond
                    the picket on the Romney road, about 3 a. m. or very early that morning, every
                    man of it was captured by the enemy. Two men in gray uniform rode up to the two
                    sentinels on outpost, and being challenged replied "They were scouts from the
                    Eighth Virginia." After exchanging a word or two one rode back to pick up
                    something lost from his saddle, and immediately returned with twenty more who
                    captured the whole post. At the reserve they came up and said they were a relief
                    from the Eighth Virginia, and some of the men saying to those on picket, "Get
                    your horses, you are relieved." Thus scout, picket, and reserve were captured by
                    the enemy uniformed as Confederates, who then rode in my camp without giving any
                    alarm. A Yankee sergeant, captured by Capt. Emack, of my staff, told him that a
                    man who had been in camp to have a stolen horse restored had guided them to the
                    picket and my headquarters.</p>
<p>This great disaster would have at once been retrieved but for the insufficient
                    armament of the command. Besides the First and Second Maryland and a squadron of
                    the Eighth Virginia there was not a saber in the command. In that open country,
                    perfectly level, the only mode to fight charging cavalry was by charging, and
                    this the men were unable to do. The long Enfield musket once discharged could
                    not be reloaded, and lay helpless before the charging saber. With any equal
                    chance the enemy would at once have been driven back. The largest portion of the
                    command remained steady, and after passing Moorefield were held in hand with
                    ease. I reached the Valley with about 300 men missing (150 have come in),
                    leaving that number as my net loss killed, wounded, and missing.</p>
<p>I should have here stopped this narrative, but circumstances which have come to
                    my knowledge render it necessary for me, in justice to myself and this command,
                    to speak more plainly than I had intended to. Brig.-Gen. McCausland was in
                    command of the expedition. He selected his own camps, routes, and lines of
                    pickets. He always gave me orders when to camp, to march, and to picket, and I
                    always obeyed.</p>
<p>He had command of McNeill's company, a numerous and well-mounted body of scouts,
                    well acquainted with the country, and through them he ought to have had full
                    knowledge of the proximity of the enemy. If they were not accessible to him it
                    was his duty to order scouts to ascertain his whereabouts and not mine. If he
                    did know Averell was near and expected an attack, he gave me no notice of it
                    whatever, the mere order to saddle up being preparatory to a move, or a march,
                    and not a commanding officer's order to his subordinates to prepare for battle.
                    The only intimation or order of any kind whatever that I ever received from Gen.
                    McCausland on the subject was the verbal one by a courier. But he did not expect
                    an attack. In proof of this I refer to the fact that when the attack was made
                    Brig.-Gen. McCausland was asleep in the house of Mr. McMechen, three miles from
                    his camps or any of his command, and further, that some portion of his own
                    brigade was unsaddled and utterly unprepared. He never reached the scene of
                    action until after a portion of my command had passed the river. I suppose he
                    was not there when his own brigade became separated, one part taking the
                    Moorefield road and the other the Winchester grade. If he had been on the ground
                    anticipating an attack he would doubtless have had his command formed and made
                    fight, neither of which he did, for besides one charge by a light squadron near
                    the ford and a line of dismounted men above it I saw no fighting done by him
                    near the river. From these facts I infer that Brig.-Gen. McCausland, first, was
                    unprepared for an attack himself, and therefore could not expect me, his
                    subordinate, to be prepared; or, second, that anticipating attack he neglected
                    to give me due and timely notice, and neglected to put his troops in position to
                    repel it.</p>
<p>It is due to myself and the cause I serve to remark on the outrageous conduct of
                    the troops on this expedition. This duty I informed Gen. McCausland I should
                    perform during the expedition itself. Every crime in the catalogue of infamy has
                    been committed, I believe, except murder and rape. Highway robbery of watches
                    and pocket-books was of ordinary occurrence; the taking of breast-pins,
                    finger-rings, and earrings frequently happened. Pillage and sack of private
                    dwellings took place hourly. A soldier of an advance guard robbed of his gold
                    watch the Catholic clergyman of Hancock on his way from church on Sunday, July
                    31, in the publish steeds. Another of a rear guard nearly brained a private of
                    Company B, First Maryland Cavalry, for trying to prevent his sacking a woman's
                    trunk and stealing her clothes and jewels. A lieutenant at Hancock exacted and
                    received $1,000 in greenbacks of a citizen; a soldier packed up a woman's and a
                    child's clothing, which he had stolen in the presence of the highest official,
                    unrebuked. At Chambersburg, while the town was in flames, a quartermaster, aided
                    and directed by a field officer, exacted ransom of individuals for their houses,
                    holding the torch in terror over the house until it was paid. These ransoms
                    varied from $750 to $150, according to the size of the habitation. Thus the
                    grand spectacle of a national retaliation was reduced to a miserable huckstering
                    for greenbacks. After the order was given to burn the town of Chambersburg and
                    before, drunken soldiers paraded the streets in every possible disguise and
                    paraphernalia, pillaging and plundering and drunk. As the natural consequence,
                    lawlessness in Pennsylvania and Maryland reproduced itself in Virginia, and in
                    Hardy County, near Moorefield, a lieutenant knocked down and kicked an aged
                    woman who has two sons in the Confederate army, and after choking the sister
                    locked her in a stable and set fire to it. This was because the two women would
                    not give up horses he and his fellow thieves wished to steal. Pressing rapidly
                    along, marching day and night, in most instances criminals guilty of these acts
                    cannot be identified, but I believe a higher tone of morals and discipline may
                    be infused in any Confederate soldier which will restrain him form disgracing
                    himself and his countrymen by such deeds. Had there been less plunder there
                    would have been more fighting at Moorefield on Sunday, August 7. I tried, and
                    was seconded by almost every officer of my command, but in vain, to preserve the
                    discipline of this brigade, but it was impossible; not only the license afforded
                    was too great, but actual example gave them excuse and justification.</p>
<p>In view of the necessity that the public service demands of the investigation of
                    this whole matter, and that the responsibility for the Moorefield disaster be
