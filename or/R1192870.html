<p>Brig.-Gen. STONEMAN, Poolesvile, Md:<br> COMDG. OFFICER,
                        Frederick, Md.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 11, 1862</p>
<p>The following dispatch has just been received from Gen.
                    Franklin:</p>
<p>HAGERSTOWN, October 11, 1862--7.45 p. m.<br> Brig. Gen. R. B. MARCY:</p>
<p>A discharged officer, named Hamilton, late quartermaster of Bartlett's brigade,
                    was taken prisoner by Stuart last evening at Chambersburg, and paroled. He had,
                    he says, a long talk with Stuart, who told him that he had 3,000 cavalry. Would
                    be in Gettysburg at 12 to day, and would cross the Potomac at mouth of Monocacy.
                    If he found too large a force there, would go lower. Hamilton says there are
                    about 1,900 cavalry. That a force of 300 was absent when they were counted this
                    morning.<br> W. B. FRANKLIN,<br> Maj.-Gen.<br> P. S.--Stuart desired to be
                    remembered kindly to Gen. S Williams. This makes it look authentic.<br> W. B.
                    F.</p>
<p>The cavalry, as counted this morning, referred above, by a Mr. McClelland,
                    numbered about 1,644.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. D. RUGGLES,<br> Col., &amp;c.</p>
