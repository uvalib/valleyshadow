<p>L. P. WALKER:</p>
<p>RICHMOND,</p>
<p>April 29, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maj. Patton, Virginia army, one of Harney's escort from Harper's Ferry, states
                    that troops are being concentrated at Chambersburg, Pa., with a view, it is
                    believed, of occupying the Maryland Heights, which command Harper's Ferry. That
                    the force now there, estimated at 4,000, could not hold that point against 1,000
                    U. S. troops. There are too many militia generals issuing conflicting orders and
                    creating confusion. Harney left for Washington. Hicks recommends neutrality.
                    Many persons from Maryland taking refuge in Virginia with negroes. northern
                    troops reach Washington in transports via Potomac. A member of New York Seventh
                    Regt., at Governor Letcher's house, says many of that regiment refused to fight
                    the South. This regiment never in any fight with Baltimoreans. A man named Boyd
                    shot on the island at Washington by two men for expressing secession sentiments.
                    Ex-president Tyler says Maryland is calling loudly for help. Send all the troops
                    you can spare.</p>
