<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes Colonel H. B. Davidson at Staunton on January, 1863,
                    movements of the Union army. Lee orders Davidson and Imboden, also at Staunton,
                    to be ready to move to meet the enemy at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Col. H. B. DAVIDSON,<br> Cmdg. at Staunton, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 22, 1863.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>From present appearances, I inclined to believe that Gen. Burnside is
                    concentrating all the forces within his reach, with a view of advancing south of
                    the Rappahannock. The troops in the vicinity of Alexandria, presumed to be Gen.
                    Slocum's command, with long train of wagons, are all reported to be marching in
                    the direction of Dumfries or Fredericksburg. Gen. Milroy is reported to have
                    abandoned Moorefield, and to have advanced a portion of his troops to Front
                    Royal. It may be his intention to cross the Blue Ridge, and unite with Gen.
                    Burnside. In that event, I have directed Gen. W. E. Jones to throw his force
                    east of the mountains, and unite with this army. Should there be nothing to
                    detain the troops under your command, and those under Col. Imboden, at Staunton,
                    I desire that you will join Gen. Jones with all your available forces, should
                    you be called on. In the mean time make all preparations for your march, should
                    it be come necessary. Please let me know your available strength.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. Lee,<br> Gen.</p>
