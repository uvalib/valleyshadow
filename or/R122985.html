<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In mid-July, 1861, Union General George B. McClellan's victories over
                    Confederates under Robert Garnett drove Confederate troops from what is now West
                    Virginia. In this dispatch, Confederate General H. R. Jackson reports to
                    Assistant Adjutant George Deas on the retreat and his attempts to prevent
                    further Federal advances at Monterey, VA. Jackson mentions receiving supplies
                    from Staunton, which served as an important supply base during the campaign.</p>

<p>BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS,</p>
<p>Col. GEORGE DEAS,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen., C. S.
                        Army, Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>Camp at Monterey,</p>
<p>July 19, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Our present position in this village, the only one in the vicinage fit for a
                    depot of supplies, is exposed and wholly untenable, unless the routes
                    approaching it from the west be guarded at considerable distances; and I have
                    been restless in the consciousness that, were the enemy apprised of our real
                    condition, a comparatively small body of cavalry might make sad havoc among us
                    and at least destroy what they might not be able to hold. The trains bringing
                    supplies from Staunton are daily coming up, and as the wagons are needed below,
                    must be unloaded. The debris of Gen. Garnett's command are constantly pouring
                    in, and what of it is left in anything in a most forlorn condition. I fear that,
                    while they must be cared for, they will be almost useless for any military
                    purpose; yet, even under these circumstances, I have not felt authorized to beat
                    a further retreat, thus substituting distances for regiments against the enemy's
                    advance.</p>
<p>With a view mainly to guarding this point, hoping at the same time to relieve
                    somewhat the panic-stricken people of the county and to revive the spirit of
                    troops depressed by retreat, I am to-day making a forward movement, looking of
                    course to the protection of our rear. The Twelfth Georgia Regiment, under the
                    direction of Maj. Williams, of the Engineer Corps, who has joined this command,
                    with an artillery company three pieces strong, which I have organized from the
                    elements at hand, will take position to-day somewhere upon, or immediately
                    beyond, the Alleghany Ridge. I have also formed a composite command of the
                    Churchville Cavalry, the remnants of the Rockbrige Cavalry, and a company of
                    riflemen, made up from the militia, to which I have assigned Maj. Jones, of the
                    Forty-fourth Virginia Regiment of Volunteers, an officer who has inspired me
                    with great confidence. They will constitute an advance guard and will be thrown
                    along the turnpike road as near to the enemy as may be safe, to watch his
                    movements, to intercept marauding parties, and the riflemen, who are familiar
                    with the county, to annoy the enemy from the hills and bushes. This rifle corps,
                    some eighty strong, are the picked men of one hundred and eighty militia who
                    reported for duty; but who, on account of the state of their crops, were
                    exceedingly reluctant to leave home. I offered, upon condition that they would
                    make up this company well armed and provided for, to allow the others to go home
                    for the purpose of reaping the crops of all. This proposition was cheerfully
                    acceded to, and I am really in hopes that an efficient corps had been thus put
                    in the field.</p>
<p>Should this force be deemed sufficient to hold for the present the turnpike pass
                    in the Alleghany Mountains, our entire attention may be directed to the
                    Huttonsville and Huntersville road.</p>
<p>Unless some point can be held upon it with a view to resisting the advance of the
                    enemy, the entire country in that direction will be thrown open and our rear
                    protected alone by the distance over which his column must pass. The people in
                    that region, who are supposed generally to be loyal, are naturally alarmed and
                    calling for protection. I inclose herewith the copy of a note received late last
                    night from a gentleman of high character and great influence, as I understand;
                    relating to that subject.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to add that, with but two regiments which have not been
                    seriously demoralized by the disasters of the late conflicts with the enemy, the
                    force here is altogether too weak for the necessities of the time. Very
                    respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. R. JACKSON,<br> Brig.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
