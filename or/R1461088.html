<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Newton Curtis writes General Edward Ord in May, 1865, concerning the
                    surrender of Confederate forces. He mentions cavalry going to Staunton to accept
                    Confederate General Thomas Rosser's surrender, and also says that the Army of
                    the Potomac will march through the town.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. ORD,<br> Cmdg. Department of Virginia, Fort
                        Monroe:</p>
<p> Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 4, 1865.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Voris has gone with his regiment forty miles out on the Virginia Central
                    Railroad, with orders to extend his command to the mountains. The Eleventh
                    Pennsylvania Cavalry are under orders, by direction of Gen. Halleck, to march to
                    Staunton to receive the arms and public stores of Rosser's command, which are to
                    be collected and paroled there the 10th instant. The Army of the Potomac are to
                    march through the city at 9 a.m. to-morrow. I gave Col. Smith permission to
                    suspend the order for the execution of the colored soldier for committing rape.
                    An order from the War Department requires such cases to be submitted to the
                    President. No further orders having been received from Washington permitting the
                    ship to sail with paroled prisoners, I have directed all to wait here until a
                    final decision is given.</p>

<p>N. M. CURTIS,<br> Brig.-Gen. and Chief of Staff.</p>
