                    report on July, 1864, Confederate strengths and movements in the Shenandoah

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>July 10, 1864.<br> (Received 6 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>An old scout of great shrewdness telegraphs from Hagerstown as follows:</p>
<p>Gen. Tazewell, formerly adjutant-general to Stonewall Jackson, stated, probably
                    when in Hagerstown, that A. P. Hill was crossing river at Edwards Ferry,
                    intending to operate against Washington. Hill in chief command. Early's, Rodes',
                    and Breckinridge's commands are with his corps, and have 100 pieces of
                    artillery, Two Irish refugees arrived, via Staunton; were told that Hill's
                    forces were from Loudoun Valley. It is reported that the enemy have all gone
                    west of Harper's Ferry on both of the river. Refuges say only stragglers are in
                    Shenandoah Valley, and they report the force as higher than has been estimated,
                    to wit, 40,000. A Union officer (prisoner) escaped from Frederick yesterday,
                    reports that it was Early's division that passed through Frederick yesterday,
                    and Bradley Johnson on the road north. A large train of ambulance accompanied.</p>
