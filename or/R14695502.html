<p>Capt. E. M. BAKER,<br> Actg. Asst. Adjt. Gen., Cavalry,
                        Middle Military Division.</p>
<p>White House, Va.,</p>
<p>March 20, 1865.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command
                    since February 27, 1865:</p>
<p>At an early hour on the morning of the 27th my command broke camp near
                    Winchester, and moved up the Valley pike, following the First Cavalry Division.
                    The Second Brigade, of the Second Cavalry Division, Army of West Virginia,
                    having been assigned to my command, reported to me soon after leaving camp, and
                    was designated the Third Brigade of the Third Division. Nothing worthy of note
                    occurred until March 1. At 3 o'clock on that morning the Third Brigade, Col.
                    Capehart commanding, was pushed forward to Harrisonburg, and there awaited the
                    arrival of the main column, when it again moved in advance, skirmishing with the
                    enemy under Rosser, until the North River was reached. Here the enemy had made
                    preparations to oppose the crossing, by throwing up a line of earth-works and
                    barricades on the south bank and occupying them with dismounted cavalry. The
                    long, covered bridge over the North River had also been fired by the enemy, and
                    was in flames upon Col. Capehart's arrival. Sending two of his regiments to swim
                    the river above the bridge and attack the enemy in flank, Col. Capehart at the
                    same time sent a column to charge through the burning bridge. The enemy was
                    driven in disorder and the bridge saved. The pursuit was continued to within
                    four miles of Staunton, where the command was encamped for the night. The enemy
                    in the affair at the bridge lost 37 men, including 5 commissioned officers; our
                    loss was slight.</p>
<p>The importance of our success in saving the bridge over North River cannot be
                    over-estimated. Had the enemy succeeded in destroying the bridge it would have
                    compelled a long delay on our part, as there were no fords practicable in that
                    vicinity. On the 2d we moved to Staunton, where the command was halted for a
                    short interval. In accordance with verbal orders received from the major-general
                    commanding the expedition I then marched toward Waynesborough. My orders were to
                    proceed to Waynesborough, ascertain something definite in regard to the
                    position, movements, and strength of the enemy, and, if possible, to destroy the
                    railroad bridge over the South River at that point. The roads were almost
                    impassable, owing to the mud caused by the heavy rains of the past few days. Our
                    march was necessarily slow. Upon reaching Fisherville, six miles from Staunton,
                    our advance struck the enemy's pickets, and drove them in the direction of
                    Waynesborough. Upon arriving at the latter point we found the enemy in force,
                    posted behind a formidable line of earth-works. His position was well chosen,
                    being upon a range of hills west of the town, from which his artillery could
                    command all the approaches, while his infantry could, by their fire, sweep the
                    open space extending along their entire front. The Second Brigade, Col. Wells
                    commanding, was at once moved against the enemy to compel him to display his
                    force. A short but brisk engagement convinced me that while our success would be
                    doubtful, it would involve a large loss of life to attack the enemy in his
                    front. A careful reconnaissance along his entire line convinced me that the
                    enemy had a heavy force of infantry behind his works, while ten pieces of
                    artillery were in position and completely covered his front. But one point
                    seemed favorable for attack. The enemy's left flank, instead of resting on South
                    River, was thrown well forward, leaving a short gap between his left and the
                    river. The approach to this point could be made under cover of the woods. I
                    directed Lieut.-Col. Whitaker, of my staff, to conduct three regiments of
                    Pennington's brigade to our extreme right. Selecting three regiments armed with
                    the Spencer carbine, they were moved, dismounted, under cover of the woods to
                    the point previously indicated, where they were held in readiness to charge the
                    enemy's left. Col. Well's, commanding the Second Brigade, had been instructed to
                    keep the enemy's attention engaged in front by displaying a heavy force of
                    mounted skirmishers, while Col. Capehart, commanding the Third Brigade, was
                    ordered to place his brigade in readiness to charge the enemy in front the
                    moment the attack on the right began. The remaining two regiments of the First
                    Brigade were under similar instructions. Woodruff's section of horse artillery,
                    which, to deceive the enemy, had previously been moved to the rear in open view
                    of their line, was again brought to the front, under cover of the woods, and
                    placed in position to open on the enemy's lines. At a given signal the three
                    dismounted regiments charged on our right. Woodruff opened his guns upon the
                    enemy, compelling them to lie down behind their works, while the brigades of
                    Wells and Capehart moved to the attack in front, at the charge. So sudden was
                    our attack and so great was the enemy's surprise that but little time was
                    offered for resistance. The artillery, however, continued to fire till the last
                    moment and till our troops had almost reached the muzzles of their guns. One
                    piece was captured with the sponge-staff still inserted in the bore and the
                    charge rammed half way home. The rout of the enemy could not have been more
                    complete; no order or organization was preserved. The pursuit was taken up by my
                    entire command, and continued through Rockfish Gap for a distance of twelve
                    miles.</p>
<p>Among some of the substantial fruits of this victory we had possession of about
                    1,800 prisoners, 14 pieces of artillery, 17 battle-flags, and a train of nearly
                    200 wagons and ambulances, including Gen. Early's headquarter's wagon,
                    containing all his official desks and records. The result of this engagement was
                    of the highest value and importance to us for another reason; it opened a way
                    across the Blue Ridge Mountains through Rockfish Gap, and thereby saved us from
                    several days' delay and marching.</p>
<p>My command encamped that night at Brookfield (Brooksville). The following morning
                    I moved in the direction of Charlottesville. When near that place we struck a
                    force of the enemy's cavalry, but drove them without difficulty. A deputation of
                    the citizens of Charlottesville, headed by the mayor and common council, met me
                    outside the town and formally surrendered the town. Moving through the town, in
                    the direction of Gordonsville, the enemy was again encountered, and a skirmish
                    ensued, which resulted in the route of the enemy, we gaining possession of 3
                    guns and 1 battle-flag. We remained at Charlottesville until the morning of the
                    6th, destroying, in the meanwhile, the railroad bridge over the Rivanna River,
                    beside rendering unserviceable but twenty miles of the Virginia Central
                    Railroad. A scouting party sent out from my command on the 5th came upon a party
                    of rebels, among them being Commodore Hollins, formerly of our Navy. In
                    attempting to make his escape the commodore was killed. On the morning of the
                    6th my commandant moved in the direction of Lynchburg, parallel to the railroad
                    to that point. All the bridges and trestle-work on the Lynchburg road were
                    destroyed as far as the bridge over Buffalo Run, including the the latter
                    bridge. On the 8th we moved to New Market, on the James River, where a cut was
                    made in the canal. On the 9th marched to Scottsville; the following day reached
                    Columbia, where we rested until the morning of the 12th, when we marched to
                    Frederick's Hall Station, on the Virginia Central Railroad, a portion of the
                    division going to Bumpass Station. The following day the entire command was
                    engaged in destroying the railroad track, by burning the ties and bending the
                    rails. In this manner about ten miles of the road was destroyed at this point.
                    On the 14th marched to Ground Squirrel bridge over the South Anna, at which
                    point the main portion of the command was halted, while two regiments proceeded
                    as far as Ashland and returned, meeting no enemy on the route. The entire
                    command encamped near the Ground Squirrel bridge. I sent a scouting party toward
                    Richmond on the Brook pike, which succeeded in capturing a train of 40 wagons
                    and a number of prisoners, including one of Gen. Early's staff officers. Moved
                    at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 15th, reaching Ashland early in the day,
                    where I learned that Longstreet and Pickett were advancing upon that point, with
                    a heavy force composed of all arms. The First Brigade, under Col. Pennington,
                    was sent forward to hold the enemy in check until the rest of the command could
                    pass that point in the direction of the railroad bridge over the South Anna. The
                    enemy made several attempts to force Pennington back, but was repulsed each
                    time. His most determined effort was made just before dark, but was a complete
                    failure. Having held the cross-road as long as was desirable or necessary,
                    Pennington, in obedience to my orders, withdrew his command, and followed the
                    remainder of the division to the north bank of the North Anna, where the entire
                    command encamped near Carmel Church. From the latter point we marched, via
                    Mangohick Church and King William Court-House, to White House, crossing the
                    Pamunkey River at that point over the railroad bridge on the 19th; encamped near
                    White House.</p>
<p>In the battle of Waynesborough, in which the loss of the enemy in killed,
                    wounded, and captured was upward of 2,000, my loss was but 9 in all. With
                    reference to the conduct of the officers and men of my command throughout the
                    entire expedition, both when engaged with the enemy and while on the march, I
                    have nothing but words of the highest praise and commendation to offer. As a
                    special report will be made, making mention of those who are particularly
                    deserving and meritorious, none of the many instances of personal gallantry and
                    merit, as displayed on the late expedition, are mentioned in this report.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>G. A. CUSTER,<br> Brevet Maj.-Gen.</p>
