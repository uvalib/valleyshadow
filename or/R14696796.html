<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Winfield Scott Hancock writes Chief of Staff Halleck to discuss a

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, VA.,</p>
<p>March 2, 1865</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two of Sheridan's scouts sent out several days ago have just returned. They went
                    within six miles of Staunton, and report as follows:</p>
<p>Not more than 1,500 infantry of Breckinridge's old command camped at Rushville,
                    between Waynesborough and Staunton. Rosser has been ordered to Richmond. His
                    brigade had been called together, and was ordered to concentrate at Swoope's
                    Depot. It was reported that they were going to Richmond. The Thirteenth and
                    Eighteenth Virginia Cavalry, of Jackson's brigade, and four Lynchburg
                    batteries--Johnson's, Kirkpatrick's, Jackson's, and Moorman's--had left;
                    reported gone to North Carolina.</p>
<p>Gen. Davidson is in command of the cavalry in the Valley. McCausland was at
                    Gordonsville. The scouts are sure that Fitz Lee's division is at Richmond. They
                    heard nothing of Gen. Sheridan, as they were obliged to leave the Valley and go
                    over into Luray to avoid capture, and the streams were so high that there was no
                    communication between the Shenandoah and Luray Valleys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WINF'D S. HANCOCK,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
