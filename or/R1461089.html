<p>Lieut.-Col. STRATTON,<br> Cmdg. Eleventh Pennsylvania
                        Cavalry:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 4, 1865.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>The commanding general directs that you proceed to Staunton, Va., to receive the
                    surrender of Gen. Rosser's command. By agreement with the authorities here he is
                    to have his command collected and necessary steps taken for their parole on the
                    10th instant. The general terms are the same as those agreed upon between Gen.'s
                    Grant and Lee. All public stores appertaining to said command,whether of
                    ordnance, quartermaster's, or commissary will be received by you. The ordnance
                    stores will be brought to such point on the Virginia Central Railroad as is in
                    communication with this place by cars, and thence sent forward to the chief of
                    ordnance of this department by railroad. All quartermaster's and commissary
                    stores will be distributed to the needy persons of the country between Staunton
                    and Gordonsville. When you shall have received the public stores of Gen.
                    Rosser's command you will return to Charlottesville and communicate with these
                    headquarters by telegraph, or, should there be no communication with this place
                    by telegraph or cars, you will go to such point of the Central Railroad that
                    there is. In your march through the country you will hold your command to the
                    strictest rules of discipline and order, giving protection to persons and
                    property, and bands of outlaws and guerrillas infesting the country will be
                    broken up, and the partisans sent to these headquarters for trial. You will move
                    with fourteen days' rations and short forage for your command. You will forward
                    from Charlottesville, or such other place as you return to, a full report of
                    your operations, indicating the number of arms received, quantity of
                    quartermaster's and commissary stores and the disposition made thereof. Such
                    instructions as you may need hereafter will be received from Brevet Brig.-Gen.
                    Voris, commanding the district, or from these headquarters direct.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>N. M. CURTIS,<br> Brig.-Gen. and Chief of Staff.</p>
