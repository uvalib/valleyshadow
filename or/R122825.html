<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In May, 1861, new Confederate recruits from western Virginia mustered in at
					Staunton. In this letter, Robert E. Lee informs Thomas J. Jackson, commanding at
					Harper's Ferry, that troops will be sent him from Staunton as they muster
				in.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Col. T. J. JACKSON,<br> Virginia Volunteers, Commanding
						Harper's Ferry, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 10, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 7th instant, by Maj. Massie, has been received. Orders have
					been given to fill your requisition for arms, ammunition, and accouterments as
					far as possible. In addition to the guns that you were advised yesterday would
					be sent to you, I have directed two 32-pounders, with navy carriages, and a
					supply of ammunition, &amp;c., to be forwarded to you. They will be in
					charge of Lieut. Fauntleroy,of the Navy, who is ordered to report to you, and I
					hope will be useful in defending your post.</p>
<p>Your intention to fortify the heights of Maryland may interrupt our friendly
					arrangements with that State, and we have no right to intrude on her soil,
					unless, under pressing necessity, for defense. I had hoped that her own citizens
					would have relieved u of that question, and you must endeavor to give to the
					course you may find it necessary to pursue the appearance of its being the act
					of her citizens. At all events, do not move until actually necessary and under
					stern necessity.</p>
<p>I have directed the companies ordered to rendezvous at Staunton to be sent to you
					as soon as mustered into the service, and I hope you will receive a large
					accession of troops under the authority extended to you. Several officers of
					experience have been sent to you, and I shall endeavor to send some cadets. I
					know, from the spirit with which you are animated, that you will leave nothing
					undone to insure the defense of your post and the security of your command. You
					will not neglect, therefore, the instruction of the troops, who ought to be
					constantly practicing their military exercises and prepared in every way for
					hard service. Every rifle that you can finish will be of advantage, but it will
					be necessary to send off that machinery as soon as the musket factory is
					removed. I have directed the Quartermaster and Commissary Department to send
					funds, if practicable, to the assistant quartermaster and commissary at your
					post.</p>
<p>Respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
