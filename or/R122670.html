<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson, commanding at Chambersburg, writes Assistant
                    Adjutant E. D. Townsend in June, 1861, regarding movements of regiments in
                    preparation for an advance into Maryland.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> Asst. Adjt. Gen., Washington
                        City:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>June 7, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>On the 24th ultimo I was notified by the Gen.-in-Chief to make use of the New
                    Jersey quota on this line. I called upon the governor of that State to ascertain
                    when they would be ready, and was informed that they would, at the request of
                    the Secretary, go to Washington.</p>
<p>Before daybreak this morning a New York regiment passed through Harrisburg,
                    claiming orders of later date than the 4th instant from the Gen.-in-Chief to
                    move to Washington. I have ordered it to return, unless their last order from
                    the Gen.-in-Chief is subsequent to the one to me.</p>
<p>To-day I commenced placing on the road to Hagerstown the brigades as prepared,
                    Col. Thomas, Second Cavalry, leading off with five companies of horse; a
                    battalion of two companies of the First Artillery; one of Eighth Infantry, and
                    one of volunteers; the Sixth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-third Regiments
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers. He will encamp near Greencastle, and hold himself ready
                    to move at any moment.</p>
<p>To-morrow morning Brig.-Gen. Williams, commanding the Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and
                    Twentieth Regiments, will encamp near him. If Col. Miles arrives by the time
                    wagons will be prepared, he will be assigned to the command of a brigade, and
                    placed in close proximity to Gen. Williams. The baggage train comes in slowly,
                    but every one is working hard, intelligently, and cheerfully to be prepared at
                    the earliest moment, and I expect that by the arrival of the Third Infantry and
                    battery the whole command will be ready to move off together.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding. </p>
