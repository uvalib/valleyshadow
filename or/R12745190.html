<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Schenck's adjutant William Chesebrough passes on orders for
                    Union cavalry to prepare to move to engage Confederate forces at Chambersburg in
                    June, 1863.</p>

<p>IV. Maj.-Gen. Milroy will proceed without delay, via Harrisburg and Bedford, or
                    such other route as he may find expedient or necessary from Harrisburg, to put
                    himself in communication with that body of cavalry and infantry of his division,
                    who, under command of Col. Galligher, were yesterday at Hancock, and are
                    understood to have proceeded thence northward into Pennsylvania. He will take
                    charge of these forces, reorganize them, and obtain supplies and ammunition as
                    they may need, using them, if opportunity presents, for offensive operations
                    against any smaller or equal force of rebels now supposed to be at Chambersburg
                    or in that neighborhood, or will conduct them to Harrisburg, reporting, as often
                    as practicable, his movements to these headquarters; or, if found more expedient
                    and advisable, after reaching the troops of which he will be in search, he may,
                    if he can obtain the necessary supplies and ammunition, use them to observe,
                    pursue, or interrupt the movements and operations of any rebel force at
                    Cumberland or proceeding westward. In this case, he will, as soon as possible,
                    by messengers or otherwise, put himself in communication with Brig.-Gen. Kelley,
                    at New Creek. He will at Harrisburg confer with Maj.-Gen. Couch, commanding the
                    Department of the Susquehanna, in regard to his proposed movements and
                    operations, but without delaying for this purpose at Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Milroy and staff will be furnished transportation for their horses over
                    such portions of the route as they may travel by railroad.</p>
<p>By command of Maj.-Gen. Schenck:</p>
<p>WM. H. CHESEBROUGH,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
