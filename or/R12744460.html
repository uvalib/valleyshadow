<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Jubal Early reports on the actions of his division during the
                    Gettysburg campaign of June and July, 1863. He discusses movements and battles
                    from Winchester through Gettysburg and the final withdrawal to Virginia. Early
                    mentions visiting General Richard Ewell at Chambersburg and sending supply

<p>Maj. A. S. Pendleton,<br> Asst. Adjt. Gen., Second Corps,
                        Army of Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>Hdqrs. Early's Division,</p>
<p>August 22, 1863.</p>
<p>Maj.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this
                    division during the recent campaign, commencing with its departure from
                    Fredericksburg, and ending with its arrival in the vicinity of Orange
                    Court-House:</p>
<p>MARCH FROM FREDERICKSBURG.</p>
<p>On June 4, the division marched from Hamilton's Crossing, and, having been joined
                    by Jones' battalion of artillery, passed Spotsylvania Court-House, Verdierville,
                    Somerville Ford (on the Rapidan), Culpeper Court-House, Sperryville, Washington
                    (the county seat of Rappahannock County), and, crossing the Blue Ridge at
                    Chester Gap, arrived at Front Royal late on the night of the 12th. Hoke's and
                    Smith's brigades crossed both branches of the Shenandoah that night, and
                    encamped, and Hays' and Gordon's brigades, with Jones' battalion of artillery
                    and the division trains, encamped on the east side of the South Branch, near
                    Front Royal.</p>
<p>CAPTURE OF WINCHESTER.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of the 13th, Hays' and Gordon's brigades and Jones'
                    artillery and the trains were crossed over to the north side of the North Branch
                    of the Shenandoah, and I received orders from the lieutenant-general commanding
                    to move my division to the Valley turnpike, and advance to the vicinity of
                    Kernstown, and then move to the left, so as to get a position from which the
                    main work of the enemy at Winchester could be attacked with advantage,
                    information at the same time being given me that there was a hill to the
                    westward of this work, and commanding it, of which it was desired I should get
                    possession.</p>
<p>Lieut. W. S. Barton, of the Second Virginia Regt., of Walker's brigade, Johnson's
                    division, accompanied me as a guide, and Brown's battalion of reserve artillery,
                    under Capt. Dance, was ordered to accompany my division.</p>
<p>Having received the instructions of the lieutenant-general commanding, the
                    wagons, excepting the ambulances and regimental ordnance and medical wagons,
                    were left at Cedarville, and I diverged from the Winchester and Front Royal
                    turnpike at Nineveh, and reached the Valley turnpike at Newtown, and thence
                    advancing toward Winchester, I found Lieut.-Col. Herbert, of the Maryland Line,
                    with his battalion of infantry, the battery of Maryland artillery, and a portion
                    of the battalion of Maryland cavalry, occupying the ridge between Bartonsville
                    and Kernstown, and engaged in occasional skirmishing with a portion of the enemy
                    which had taken position near Kernstown.</p>
<p>I halted my command here, forming it in line on either side of the turnpike, and
                    proceeded to reconnoiter the ground for the purpose of ascertaining the strength
                    and position of the enemy near Kernstown, and also of finding the road by which
                    I was to diverge from the turnpike, so as to reach the position in rear of the
                    enemy's works which I had been directed to gain.</p>
<p>The only portion of the enemy in sight on my arrival consisted of cavalry; but I
                    was informed that an infantry picket occupied Kernstown, and I soon discovered
                    that a battery of artillery was located on Pritchard's Hill, near Kernstown,
                    which was the same position occupied by the enemy's artillery at the time of
                    Gen. Jackson's engagement at this place.</p>
<p>Finding it necessary to dislodge the enemy from this hill, after making a
                    reconnaissance, I moved Hays' brigade to the left, through a skirt of woods and
                    a meadow, to the foot of the ridge along which Gen. Jackson made his advance,
                    and thence along a road which runs from Bartonsville to the Cedar Creek
                    turnpike, until it reached an eligible position for advancing upon Pritchard's
                    Hill from the left. From this point, Hays was ordered to advance and gain
                    possession of Pritchard's Hill, which he did without opposition, the enemy
                    having withdrawn his battery; but, while advancing, Gen. Hays sent me word that
                    the enemy had a considerable infantry force on the ridge to his left, and I
                    immediately conducted Gordon's brigade over the same route, and sent word to
                    Hays to halt his command until Gordon's should get up. Gordon then advanced his
                    brigade to the left of Hays, and, in conjunction with skirmishers sent out by
                    Hays, drove the enemy's force across the Cedar Creek turnpike and over the ridge
                    between that road and Abraham's Creek, which here crosses the Valley turnpike.</p>
<p>While this was going on, Hoke's and Smith's brigades, which had been formed in
                    line on the right and left of the Valley turnpike, respectively, were ordered to
                    advance toward Kernstown. Gordon having advanced so that his right reached the
                    Valley turnpike, was halted, and Hays was moved to his left, and then Smith's
                    brigade was moved to the left of Hays, the whole being formed in line in rear of
                    the crest of the ridge which is immediately south of Abraham's Creek.</p>
<p>The enemy then occupied Bowers' Hill, near Barton's Mills, with infantry and
                    artillery, and it being too late for any further operations that evening, Hoke's
                    brigade, under the command of Col. I. E. Avery, of the Sixth North Carolina
                    Regt., which had been ordered up to the support of the other brigades, was
                    ordered back to Kernstown, where it was placed in position to protect the
                    ambulances, wagons, and artillery, which had been brought up to that position,
                    from an attack from the left and rear, and Herbert was ordered to take position
                    with his battalion of infantry on the right of Gordon, who had extended his line
                    on the right across the Valley turnpike. In this position the troops remained
                    all night, under a drenching rain.</p>
<p>Early next morning, the 14th, I ordered Gordon and Hays, respectively, to advance
                    a regiment across the creek and get possession of Bowers' Hill, then occupied
                    only by the enemy's skirmishers, as his artillery had been withdrawn during the
                    night. This was accomplished after some skirmishing, and the skirmishers from
                    Smith's brigade were also advanced across the creek, to the left of those of
                    Hays and Gordon.</p>
<p>Gen. Ewell having come up in the meantime, we proceeded together to reconnoiter
                    the position, and, having gone to the top of Bowers' Hill, now occupied by my
                    skirmishers, had a fair view of the enemy's works about Winchester, and from
                    this point we discovered that the hill to the northwest of the enemy's works,
                    which I had been directed to gain, had also been fortified, and was occupied. It
                    became necessary, then, to take this hill by assault, and, having discovered a
                    position to the northwest of it from which it was thought it might be attacked
                    with advantage, I was directed to move my division around to that position and
                    make the attack, leaving a force where the division then was to amuse the enemy
                    and conceal the movement upon his flank and rear.</p>
<p>I will here state that when Hays' and Gordon's skirmishers had advanced to
                    Bowers' Hill, Maj. W. W. Goldsborough, of the Maryland battalion, with the
                    skirmishers from that battalion, had advanced into the outskirts of the town of
                    Winchester, but, fearing that the enemy would shell the town from their main
                    fort, I ordered him back.</p>
<p>After receiving final instructions from Gen. Ewell, I replaced the skirmishers of
                    Hays' and Smith's brigades by others from Gordon's brigade, and leaving Gen.
                    Gordon, with his brigade, the Maryland battalion, and two batteries of artillery
                    (the Maryland battery and A. Hupp's battery, of Brown's battalion) to amuse the
                    enemy and hold him in check in front, I moved with Hays', Hoke's, and Smith's
                    brigades, and the rest of Jones' and Brown's battalions of artillery, to the
                    left (west), following the Cedar Creek turnpike for a short distance, and then
                    leaving that and passing through fields and the woods, which I found
                    sufficiently open to admit of the passage of artillery, thus making a
                    considerable detour, and crossing the macadamized road to Romney about 3 miles
                    west of Winchester and a half mile from a point at which the enemy had had a
                    picket the night before.</p>
<p>After crossing the Romney road, at which point I left the Fifty-fourth North
                    Carolina Regt., of Hoke's brigade, on picket, I continued to move on until I got
                    very near to the Pughtown road before I reached the position from which I wished
                    to assault the enemy's works, which proved to be a wooded hill, a part of the
                    range of hills called Little North Mountain, close to the Pughtown road, and on
                    the south side of which was an old orchard and the ruins of a house called
                    Folk's Old House, and on the north side a corn-field, on Mrs. Brierly's land.
                    Both these points afforded excellent positions for posting artillery in easy
                    range of the enemy's works on the hill overlooking his main fort, this hill
                    being on Fahnestock's land and adjoining the Pughtown road. To this point I was
                    guided by a worthy and intelligent citizen, whose name I forbear to mention, as
                    he has already been the object of the enemy's persecution; and I was so
                    fortunate as to reach it without meeting with any scouts, pickets, or stragglers
                    of the enemy, or exciting his attention in any way.</p>
<p>I reached here about 4 p. m., and as the day was excessively hot, and the men had
                    marched a circuit of some 8 or 10 miles without meeting with water to drink, and
                    were very much fatigued, I massed them in the woods in rear of the position, and
                    gave them time to blow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I proceeded to reconnoiter the enemy's position and the ground
                    over which I would have to operate. I discovered the favorable positions for my
                    artillery before mentioned, and that the intervening woods afforded an excellent
                    cover for troops to advance under to within a short distance of the foot of the
                    hill I wished to carry by assault. I also discovered that the body of the enemy
                    occupying the work on this hill, which was a bastion front, presenting the
                    appearance of an inclosed work from my point of view, was not keeping a lookout
                    in my direction, but was looking intently in the direction of Gordon's command,
                    on which a gradual advance was being made with infantry skirmishers and a few
                    pieces of artillery.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Col. Jones had quietly prepared for getting his artillery in
                    position as quickly as possible when the moment should arrive for the attack,
                    and the men having rested as much as possible under the circumstances, I
                    directed Gen. Hays, whose brigade had been selected to make the assault, to move
                    his brigade near to the edge of the woods facing the enemy's works, and to keep
                    them under cover until the artillery opened, and then to advance as rapidly as
                    possible to the assault, with three regiments in front and two following a short
                    distance in rear, as soon as he should discover that the enemy was sufficiently
                    demoralized. Jones' artillery was divided so as to put twelve pieces in the
                    orchard mentioned, and eight pieces in the edge of the corn-field to the north
                    of the woods. The Fifty-seventh North Carolina Regt. was detached, so as to
                    protect these latter pieces from an attack in the direction of the Pughtown
                    road, near which they were posted, and the residue of Hoke's brigade and the
                    whole of Smith's were placed in line about a quarter of a mile in rear of Hays,
                    so as to be ready to support him.</p>
<p>The enemy's works on the front presented to me consisted of the bastion front on
                    the high hill, which has been mentioned, another smaller breastwork between that
                    and the Pughtown road, and a more extensive but incomplete work on the north
                    side of the Pughtown road. He had evidently been making recent preparations
                    against an attack from this quarter, but, strange to say, on this occasion
                    failed to keep a lookout in that direction.</p>
<p>About an hour by sun, everything being ready, Jones ran his pieces by hand into
                    position from which they could fire, and opened almost instantaneously from the
                    whole of his twenty pieces upon the enemy before he was aware of our vicinity.</p>
<p>This cannonading was kept up briskly about three-quarters of an hour, when Hays
                    advanced, as directed, and ascended the steep slope of the hill leading to the
                    enemy's works, through a brushwood that had been felled to answer the purpose of
                    an abatis, and drove the enemy from his works in fine style, capturing in the
                    assault six rifled pieces, two of which were immediately turned upon the enemy,
                    thus preventing an effort to recapture the works before re-enforcements could
                    arrive, for which the enemy commenced preparing.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Hays' men entering the enemy's work, I ordered forward Smith's
                    brigade to his support, and also ordered Jones to advance with his pieces, which
                    were posted on the left, leaving Avery with part of Hoke's brigade to look out
                    for the rear. On reaching the captured hill, I found that it overlooked and
                    commanded, as had been anticipated, the enemy's main work, and also a smaller
                    redoubt to the north of the main work, which was also occupied, and that all the
                    works to the left of this hill had been evacuated.</p>
<p>The enemy was in evident commotion, but by the time the artillery and Smith's
                    brigade reached the captured hill, it was too late to take any further steps for
                    the capture of the main work, which was very strong, and to accomplish which
                    would have required the cooperation of the other troops around Winchester. I
                    contented myself, therefore, with directing an artillery fire to be kept up
                    until near dark on the enemy's position, which was returned from the main work
                    and the redoubt spoken of, but with little effect.</p>
<p>During the night, I had the captured works turned and embrasures cut, so as to
                    open at early light on the main work, and the Fifty-seventh North Carolina
                    Regt., of Hoke's brigade, was ordered to occupy the work on the north of the
                    Pughtown road. Hays occupied the works captured by him, and Smith's brigade was
                    formed in line in rear of him, Avery being left with two regiments in the rear,
                    to prevent any surprise by the enemy in that direction, and the Fifty-fourth
                    still remaining on picket on the Romney road. In this position the troops lay on
                    their arms all night. I sent my aide (Lieut. William G. Calloway) to Gen.
                    Gordon, to direct him to move upon the main fort at daylight, and also sent a
                    courier to Gen. Ewell to inform him of what had been accomplished, and that I
                    thought the enemy would evacuate before morning.</p>
<p>As soon as it was light enough next morning to see, it was discovered that the
                    enemy had evacuated, taking the road toward Martinsburg, and very shortly
                    afterward firing was heard on the Martinsburg road, which proved to be from the
                    encounter of Gen. Johnson's division with the retreating enemy. I immediately
                    ordered my whole command in pursuit, having detached the Thirteenth Virginia
                    Regt., of Smith's brigade, to guard the abandoned wagons and property. Gordon's
                    brigade, which first reached the fort and pulled down the flag flying over it,
                    preceded the rest of the division, and, on reaching the point at which Gen.
                    Johnson had encountered the enemy, I found his division halted, and in
                    possession of the greater part of the enemy's infantry as prisoners. It was
                    evident, then, that further pursuit on foot was useless, and I therefore halted
                    my command, and encamped them near this place.</p>
<p>The enemy had abandoned all his artillery, all his wagons, and a considerable
                    quantity of public stores. Twenty-five pieces of artillery with their caissons
                    were secured, and a considerable quantity of artillery ammunition, though
                    somewhat damaged. Though in the hurry I gave such directions and took such steps
                    as it was possible to take under the circumstances to preserve the captured
                    property, much of it was pilfered and damaged by stragglers, and, even after it
                    got into the hands of the quartermasters and commissaries, a good deal of it was
                    made away with.</p>
<p>I cannot too highly commend the conduct of Gen.'s Hays and Gordon and their
                    brigades in the two day's fighting which took place around Winchester. The
                    charge of Hays' brigade upon the enemy's works was a most brilliant achievement,
                    and the affair of the day before, when Gen. Gordon drove the enemy from the
                    position he occupied to the left of Kernstown, reflected equal credit upon
                    himself and his brigade.</p>
<p>All the arrangements of Col. Jones and the conduct of himself and his artillery
                    were admirable, and have not been surpassed during the war. I must also commend
                    the gallantry of Lieut.-Col. Herbert and Maj. Goldsborough, of the Maryland
                    Line, and their troops.</p>
<p>Hoke's and Smith's brigades did not become engaged on either day.</p>
<p>The members of my staff--Majs. S. Hale, division inspector, and John W. Daniel,
                    assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut.'s Andrew L. Pitzer and Calloway,
                    aides-de-camp--acquitted themselves to my entire satisfaction. Mr. Robert D.
                    Early and Mr. Lake, volunteer aides (the latter a citizen of Maryland, who had
                    been sent through the lines the day before our arrival), rendered me efficient
                    service, as did Lieut. Barton, of the Second Virginia Infantry, detailed to
                    accompany me as a guide.</p>
<p>My loss in the whole affair was slight, consisting of 30 killed, 143 wounded, and
                    3 missing. Among the killed and wounded, however, were some gallant and
                    efficient officers.</p>
<p>Having been afterward assigned to the command of Winchester for a short time, I
                    sent to Richmond, by the way of Staunton, 108 officers and 3,250 enlisted men as
                    prisoners, leaving in Winchester several hundred prisoners sick and wounded. The
                    greater part of the prisoners were captured by Gen. Johnson's division while
                    attempting to make their escape after the evacuation.</p>
<p>MARCH FROM WINCHESTER INTO MARYLAND AND PENNSYLVANIA, TO THE DATE OF THE BATTLE
                    OF GETTYSBURG.</p>
<p>While in command at Winchester, I detached the Fifty-fourth North Carolina Regt.,
                    of Hoke's brigade, and the Fifty-eighth Virginia Regt., of Smith's brigade, to
                    Staunton, in charge of prisoners, and, leaving the Thirteenth Virginia Regt., of
                    Smith's brigade, on duty in Winchester, I left that place on the afternoon of
                    the 18th, and proceeded, with the residue of Hoke's brigade and Jones' battalion
                    of artillery, to Shepherdstown on the next day, Gordon's, Hays', and Smith's
                    brigades having preceded me to that place.</p>
<p>On the 22d, I crossed the Potomac at Shepherdstown, and moved through Sharpsburg
                    and Boonsborough, encamping on the road toward Hagerstown, about 3 miles from
                    Boonsborough. The Seventeenth Virginia Cavalry, under Col. William H. French, of
                    Jenkins' brigade, reported to me on this day, by order of Gen. Ewell, and
                    remained with me until the battle of Gettysburg. On the 23d, I moved through
                    Cavetown, Smithsburg, and Ringgold (or Ridgeville, as it is called), to
                    Waynesborough, in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>On the 24th, I moved through Quincy and Altodale to Greenwood, on the turnpike
                    from Chambersburg to Gettysburg.</p>
<p>At this point, my division remained in camp on the 25th, and I visited Gen. Ewell
                    at Chambersburg, and received from him instructions to cross the South Mountain
                    to Gettysburg, and then proceed to York, and cut the Northern Central Railroad,
                    running from Baltimore to Harrisburg, and also destroy the bridge across the
                    Susquehanna at Wrightsville and Columbia, on the branch road from York toward
                    Philadelphia, if I could, and rejoin him at Carlisle by the way of Dillsburg.</p>
<p>Col. E. V. White's battalion of cavalry was ordered to report to me for this
                    expedition, and on the morning of the 26th, having sent all my trains to
                    Chambersburg, excepting the ambulances, one medical wagon for a brigade, the
                    regimental ordnance wagons, one wagon with cooking utensils for each regiment,
                    and fifteen empty wagons to gather supplies with, and carrying no other baggage,
                    I moved toward Gettysburg, and on reaching the forks of the road, about 1 1/2
                    miles from Cashtown, I sent Gen. Gordon, with his brigade and White's battalion
                    of cavalry, on the pike through Cashtown toward Gettysburg, and moved with the
                    rest of the command to the left, through Hilltown to Mummasburg. I had heard on
                    the road that there was probably a force at Gettysburg, though I could get no
                    definite information as to its size, and the object of this movement was for
                    Gordon to amuse and skirmish with the enemy while I should get on his flank and
                    rear, so as to capture his whole force.</p>
<p>On arriving at Mummasburg, I ascertained that the force at Gettysburg was small,
                    and while waiting here for the infantry to come up (whose march was considerably
                    delayed by the muddy condition of the roads), a company of French's cavalry that
                    had been sent toward Gettysburg captured some prisoners, from whom it was
                    ascertained that the advance of Gordon's force (a body of cavalry from White's
                    battalion) had encountered a regiment of militia, which fled at the first
                    approach, and I immediately sent forward Col. French with his cavalry to pursue
                    this militia force, which he did, capturing a number of prisoners. Hays' brigade
                    on arriving was also dispatched toward Gettysburg, and the other brigades with
                    the artillery were halted and encamped near Mummasburg.</p>
<p>I then rode to Gettysburg, and found Gordon just entering the town, his command
                    having marched more rapidly than the other brigades, because it moved on a
                    macadamized road. The militia regiment which had been encountered by White's
                    cavalry was the Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania Militia, consisting of 800 or 900 men,
                    and had arrived in Gettysburg the night before, and moved that morning a short
                    distance out on the road toward Cashtown, but had fled on the first approach of
                    White's cavalry, taking across the fields between Mummasburg and Gettysburg, and
                    going toward Hunterstown. Of this force, 175 prisoners in all were captured and
                    subsequently paroled. Hays' brigade was halted, and encamped about a mile from
                    Gettysburg, and two regiments were sent to aid French in the pursuit of the
                    fugitive militia, but could not get up with it.</p>
<p>The authorities of Gettysburg declared their inability to furnish any supplies,
                    and a search of the stores resulted in securing only a very small quantity of
                    commissary supplies, and about 2,000 rations were found in a train of cars, and
                    issued to Gordon's brigade. The cars, numbering 10 or 12, were burned, as was
                    also a small railroad bridge near the place. There were no railroad buildings of
                    consequence. The day was rainy and the roads very muddy, and as it was late when
                    I reached the place, and having to move upon York early next day, I had no
                    opportunity of compelling a compliance with my demands in this town, or
                    ascertaining its resources, which I think, however, were very limited.</p>
<p>I ordered Tanner's battery, of Jones' battalion, to report to Gen. Gordon during
                    the night, and also a company of French's cavalry, and directed him to move with
                    them and his brigade on the turnpike toward York at light next morning, and I
                    also directed Col. White to proceed with his cavalry to Hanover Junction, on the
                    Northern Central road, destroying the railroad bridges on the way, and to
                    destroy the junction and a bridge or two south of it, and then proceed toward
                    York, burning all the bridges up to that place.</p>
<p>With the rest of the command, I moved next morning (the 27th) from Mummasburg,
                    through Hunterstown, New Chester, Hampton, and East Berlin, toward Dover, and
                    encamped a short distance beyond Berlin; and I rode over to Gordon's camp, on
                    the York pike, which was about 4 miles distant, to arrange with him the manner
                    of the approach upon York, if it should be defended. But all the information we
                    could gain induced me to believe there was no force in York, and that night a
                    deputation from the town came out to Gordon's camp, to surrender it. I directed
                    Gen. Gordon, in the event of there being no force in York, to march through and
                    proceed to Columbia Bridge, and secure it at both ends, if possible.</p>
<p>Next morning (the 28th), Gen. Gordon marched into the town of York without
                    opposition, and I proceeded with the rest of the command by the way of
                    Weigelstown, leaving Dover to my left. At Weigelstown, I dispatched Col. French
                    with the greater part of his cavalry to the mouth of the Conewago, to burn two
                    railroad bridges at that point and all others between there and York, and then
                    proceeded on to York, sending Hays' and Smith's brigades into camp at Lauck's
                    Mills, near the railroad, some 2 miles north of the town. Avery's command was
                    marched into the town, and put into quarters in some extensive buildings put up
                    for hospitals. I here met with Gen. Gordon, and repeated to him my instructions
                    to proceed to the Susquehanna and secure the Columbia Bridge, if possible, and
                    he moved in that direction with his command.</p>
<p>I then made a requisition upon the authorities for 2,000 pairs of shoes, 1,000
                    hats, 1,000 pairs of socks, $ 100,000 in money, and three days' rations of all
                    kinds. Subsequently between 1,200 and 1,500 pairs of shoes, the hats, socks, and
                    rations, were furnished, but only $ 28,600 in money was furnished, which was
                    paid to my quartermaster (Maj. C. E. Snodgrass), the mayor and other authorities
                    protesting their inability to get any more money, as it had all been run off
                    previously, and I was satisfied they made an honest effort to raise the amount
                    called for.</p>
<p>A short time before night, I rode out in the direction of Columbia Bridge, to
                    ascertain the result of Gordon's expedition, and had not proceeded far before I
                    saw an immense smoke rising in the direction of the Susquehanna, which I
                    subsequently discovered to proceed from the burning of the bridge in question.
                    On arriving at Wrightsville, on the banks of the Susquehanna, opposite Columbia,
                    I ascertained from Gen. Gordon that, on approaching Wrightsville, in front of
                    the bridge he found a command of militia some 1,200 strong, intrenched, and,
                    after endeavoring to move around their flank to cut them off from the bridge
                    (which he was unable to do from want of knowledge of the locality), he opened
                    his artillery on the militia, which fled at the bursting of the third shell, and
                    he immediately pursued; but as his men had marched a little over 20 miles, on a
                    very warm day, the enemy beat him running. He, however, attempted to cross the
                    bridge, and the head of his column got half way over, but he found the bridge,
                    which had been prepared for the purpose, on fire in the middle. As he had
                    nothing but muskets and rifles, he sent back for buckets to endeavor to arrest
                    the flames, but, before they arrived, the fire had progressed so far that it was
                    impossible to arrest it. He had, therefore, to return, and leave the bridge to
                    its fate.</p>
<p>This bridge was one mile and a quarter in length, the superstructure being of
                    wood, on stone pillars, and it included in one structure a railroad bridge, a
                    pass-way for wagons, and also a tow-path for the canal, which here crosses the
                    Susquehanna. The bridge was entirely consumed, and from it the town of
                    Wrightsville caught fire and several buildings were consumed, but the further
                    progress of the flames was arrested by the exertions of Gordon's men. I
                    regretted very much the failure to secure this bridge, as, finding the
                    defenseless condition of the country generally, and the little obstacle likely
                    to be afforded by the militia to our progress, I had determined, if I could get
                    possession of the Columbia Bridge, to cross my division over the Susquehanna,
                    and cut the Pennsylvania Central Railroad, march upon Lancaster, lay that town
                    under contribution, and then attack Harrisburg in the rear while it should be
                    attacked in front by the rest of the corps, relying, in the worst contingency
                    that might happen, upon being able to mount my division from the immense number
                    of horses that had been run across the river, and then move to the west,
                    destroying the railroads and canals, and returning back again to a place of
                    safety. This project, however, was entirely thwarted by the destruction of the
                    bridge, as the river was otherwise impassable, being very wide and deep at this
                    point. I therefore ordered Gen. Gordon to move his command back to York next
                    day, and returned to that place myself that night.</p>
<p>Col. White succeeded in reaching Hanover Junction and destroying the depot and
                    also one or two bridges in the vicinity, but he did not, however, destroy all
                    the bridges between that point and York, as he reported that one or two of them
                    were defended by an infantry force.</p>
<p>Col. French succeeded in destroying the bridges at the mouth of the Conewago, and
                    all the bridges from that point to York, and I sent him to destroy the remaining
                    bridges over the Codorus, between York and Hanover Junction, which he succeeded
                    in doing, any force which may previously have been defending them having
                    disappeared.</p>
<p>I found no public stores at this place. A few prisoners found in the hospital at
                    York, with 19 captured by Gordon at Wrightsville, were paroled. All the cars at
                    that point were destroyed, but the railroad buildings and two car manufactories,
                    as well as the hospital buildings, were not burned, because, after examination,
                    I was satisfied that the burning of them would cause the destruction of the
                    greater part of the town, and, notwithstanding the barbarous policy pursued by
                    the enemy in similar cases, I determined to forbear in this case, hoping that it
                    might not be without its effect even upon our cruel enemy. This example has been
                    lost upon the Yankees, however, as, so far from appreciating the forbearance
                    shown, I am informed that it has been actually charged by some of their papers
                    that Gordon's command fired the town of Wrightsville, whereas the exertions of
                    his men saved the place from utter destruction.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 29th, I received, through Capt. Elliott Johnston, aide to
                    Gen. Ewell, a copy of a note from Gen. Lee, and also verbal instructions, which
                    required me to move back, so as to rejoin the rest of the corps on the western
                    side of the South Mountain; and accordingly, at daylight on the morning of the
                    30th, I put my whole command in motion, moving by Weigelstown and East Berlin in
                    the direction of Heidlersburg, from which I could move either to Shippensburg or
                    to Greenwood by the way of Arendtsville, as circumstances might require. At the
                    same time, I sent Col. White's cavalry on the pike from York toward Gettysburg,
                    to ascertain if any force of the enemy was on that road. At East Berlin, a small
                    squad of the enemy's cavalry was seen and pursued by my cavalry advance, and I
                    received information at this point from Col. White that a cavalry and infantry
                    force had been on the York road, at Abbott's Ford, but had moved south toward
                    Hanover. A courier from Gen. Ewell met me here with a dispatch, informing me of
                    the fact that he was moving with Rodes' division by the way of Petersburg to
                    Heidlersburg, and directing me to march in that direction.</p>
<p>I encamped about 3 miles from Heidlersburg, and rode to see Gen. Ewell at that
                    point, and was informed by him that the object was to concentrate the corps at
                    or near Cashtown, and received directions to move next day to that point. I was
                    informed that Rodes would move by the way of Middletown and Arendtsville, but it
                    was arranged that I should go by the way of Hunterstown and Mummasburg.</p>
<p>BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG.</p>
<p>Having ascertained that the road from my camp to Hunterstown was a very rough and
                    circuitous one, I determined next morning (July 1) to march by the way of
                    Heidlersburg, and then from that point to the Mummasburg road. After passing
                    Heidlersburg a short distance, I received a note from you, written by order of
                    Gen. Ewell, informing me that Gen. Hill was moving from Cashtown toward
                    Gettysburg, and that Gen. Rodes had turned off at Middletown, and was moving
                    toward the same place, and directing me to move also to that point. I therefore
                    continued to move on the road I was then on toward Gettysburg, and, on arriving
                    in sight of that place, on the direct road from Heidlersburg, I discovered that
                    Gen. Rodes' division was engaged with the enemy to the right of me, the enemy
                    occupying a position in front of Gettysburg, and the troops constituting his
                    right being engaged in an effort to drive back the left of Gen. Rodes' line.</p>
<p>I immediately ordered my troops to the front, and formed my line across the
                    Heidlersburg road, with Gordon's brigade on the right, Hoke's brigade (under
                    Col. Avery) on the left, Hays' brigade in the center, and Smith's brigade in the
                    rear of Hoke's. Jones' battalion of artillery was posted in a field on the left
                    of the Heidlersburg road, immediately in front of Hoke's brigade, so as to fire
                    on the enemy's flank, and, as soon as these dispositions could be made, a fire
                    was opened upon the enemy's infantry and artillery by my artillery with
                    considerable effect.</p>
<p>Gordon's brigade was then ordered forward to the support of Doles' brigade, which
                    was on Rodes' left, and was being pressed by a considerable force, of the enemy,
                    which had advanced from the direction of the town to a wooded hill on the west
                    side of Rock Creek, the stream which runs northeast of the town, and as soon as
                    Gordon was fairly engaged with this force, Hays' and Hoke's brigades were
                    ordered forward in line, and the artillery, supported by Smith's brigade, was
                    ordered to follow.</p>
<p>After a short but hot contest, Gordon succeeded in routing the force opposed to
                    him, consisting of a division of the Eleventh Corps, commanded by Brig.-Gen.
                    Barlow, of the Federal Army, and drove it back with great slaughter, capturing,
                    among a number of prisoners, Gen. Barlow himself, who was severely wounded.
                    Gordon advanced across the creek, over the hill on which Barlow had been posted,
                    and across the fields toward the town, until he came to a low ridge, behind
                    which the enemy had another line of battle, extending beyond his left. I
                    directed him to halt here, and then ordered Hays and Avery, who had been halted
                    on the east side of Rock Creek while I rode forward to where Gordon had been
                    engaged, to advance toward the town, on Gordon's left, which they did in fine
                    style, encountering and driving back into the town in great confusion the second
                    line of the enemy.</p>
<p>Hays' brigade entered the town, fighting its way, and Avery moved to the left of
                    it across the railroad, and took his position in the fields on the left, and
                    facing Cemetery Hill, which here presented a very rugged ascent. This movement
                    was made under the fire of artillery from this hill, which had previously opened
                    when my artillery had first opened its fire, but Avery succeeded in placing his
                    men under the cover of a low ridge which here runs through the fields from the
                    town. Hays' brigade was formed in line in the street running through the middle
                    of the town.</p>
<p>A very large number of prisoners were captured in the town, and before reaching
                    it, their number being so great as really to embarrass us. Two pieces of
                    artillery (Napoleons) were also captured outside of the town, the capture being
                    claimed by both brigades; but it is unnecessary to decide which reached these
                    pieces first, as the capture was unquestionably due to the joint valor of both
                    brigades.</p>
<p>While these operations were going on with my division, I saw, farther to the
                    right, the enemy's force on that part of the line falling back and moving in
                    comparatively good order on the right of the town toward the range of hills in
                    the rear, and I sent back for a battery of artillery to be brought up to open on
                    this force and the town, from which a fire was opened on my brigades, but before
                    it got up, my men had entered the town, and the force on the right had retired
                    beyond reach. I had at the same time sent an order to Gen. Smith to advance with
                    his brigade, but he thought proper not to comply with this order, on account of
                    a report that the enemy was advancing on the York road.</p>
<p>As soon as my brigades had entered the town, I rode into that place myself, and,
                    after ascertaining the condition of things, I rode to find Gen. Ewell and Gen.
                    Rodes, or Gen. Hill, for the purpose of urging an immediate advance upon the
                    enemy before he should recover from his evident dismay, in order to get
                    possession of the hills to which he had fallen back with the remnant of his
                    forces; but before I found either of these officers, Gen. Smith's son, who was
                    acting as his aide, came to me with a message from the general, stating that a
                    large force of the enemy, consisting of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, was
                    advancing on the York road, and that we were about to be flanked; and though I
                    had no faith in this report, I thought proper to send Gen. Gordon with his
                    brigade to take charge of Smith's also, and to keep a lookout on the York road,
                    and stop any further alarm.</p>
<p>Meeting with an officer of Maj.-Gen. Pender's staff, I sent word by him to Gen.
                    Hill that if he would send up a division, we could take the hill to which the
                    enemy had retreated; and shortly after meeting with Gen. Ewell, I communicated
                    my views to him, and was informed that Johnson's division was coming up, and it
                    was determined with this division to get possession of a wooded hill to the left
                    of Cemetery Hill, which it commanded; but this division arrived at a late hour,
                    and its movement having been delayed by the report of the advance on the York
                    road, no effort to get possession of the wooded hill on the left of the town was
                    made that night.</p>
<p>Having been informed that a large portion of the rest of our army would come up
                    during the night, and that the enemy's position would be attacked on the right
                    and the left flanks very early next morning, I gave orders to Gen. Hays to move
                    his brigade under cover of night from the town into the field in front of the
                    left of the town, to a place where he would not be exposed to the enemy's fire,
                    and would be in position to advance upon Cemetery Hill when a favorable
                    opportunity should occur. This movement was made, and Hays formed his brigade on
                    the right of Avery and just behind the extension of the low ridge on which the
                    town is located. The attack did not begin in the morning, as was expected, and
                    in the course of the morning I rode with Gen. Ewell to examine a position for
                    the artillery on the left.</p>
<p>Having been subsequently informed that the attack would begin at 4 p. m., I
                    directed Gen. Gordon to move his brigade to the railroad in rear of Hays and
                    Avery, Smith being left, under Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, to guard the York road. The
                    fire from the artillery having opened on the right and left at 4 o'clock, and
                    continued for some time, I was ordered by Gen. Ewell to advance upon Cemetery
                    Hill with my two brigades that were in position as soon as Gen. Johnson's
                    division, which was on my left, should become engaged at the wooded hill on the
                    left, which it was about to attack, information being given me that the advance
                    would be general, and made also by Rodes' division and Hill's divisions on my
                    right.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as soon as Johnson became warmly engaged, which was a little before
                    dusk, I ordered Hays and Avery to advance and carry the works on the heights in
                    front. These troops advanced in gallant style to the attack, passing over the
                    ridge in front of them under a heavy artillery fire, and then crossing a hollow
                    between that and Cemetery Hill, and moving up this hill in the face of at least
                    two lines of infantry posted behind stone and plank fences; but these they drove
                    back, and, passing over all obstacles, they reached the crest of the hill, and
                    entered the enemy's breastworks crowning it, getting possession of one or two
                    batteries. But no attack was made on the immediate right, as was expected, and
                    not meeting with support from that quarter, these brigades could not hold the
                    position they had attained, because a very heavy force of the enemy was turned
                    against them from that part of the line which the divisions on the right were to
                    have attacked, and these two brigades had, therefore, to fall back, which they
                    did with comparatively slight loss, considering the nature of the ground over
                    which they had to pass and the immense odds opposed to them, and Hays' brigade
                    brought off four stand of captured colors.</p>
<p>At the same time these brigades advanced, Gordon's brigade was ordered forward to
                    support them, and did advance to the position from which they had moved, but was
                    halted here because it was ascertained that no advance was made on the right,
                    and it was evident that the crest of the hill could not be held by my two
                    brigades supported by this one without any other assistance, and that the
                    attempt would be attended with a useless sacrifice of life. Hays' and Hoke's
                    brigades were reformed on the line previously occupied by them, and on the right
                    and left of Gordon, respectively.</p>
<p>In this attack. Col. Avery, of the Sixth North Carolina Regt., commanding Hoke's
                    brigade, was mortally wounded. With this affair the fighting on July 2
                    terminated.</p>
<p>After night, I was ordered by Gen. Ewell to send Smith's brigade to report to
                    Gen. Johnson, on the left, by daylight, and Gen. Smith was ordered to do so, and
                    did report to Gen. Johnson, and his three regiments were engaged on the 3d on
                    the extreme left, under Gen. Johnson's directions.</p>
<p>As the operations of this brigade on this day were under the immediate orders of
                    Gen. Johnson, I will merely refer to the report of Col. John S. Hoffman, the
                    present brigade commander, herewith forwarded.</p>
<p>Before light on the morning of the 3d, I ordered Hays' and Hoke's brigades (the
                    latter now under the command of Col. A. C. Godwin, of the Fifty-seventh North
                    Carolina Regt.) to the rear, and subsequently formed them in line in the town on
                    the same street formerly occupied by Hays, Gordon being left to occupy the
                    position which was occupied by these brigades on the previous day. In these
                    positions these three brigades remained during the day, and did not again
                    participate in the attack, but they were exposed during the time to the fire of
                    sharpshooters and an occasional fire from the enemy's artillery on the hills.</p>
<p>At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 4th, my brigades were quietly withdrawn from
                    their positions, and moved back on the Cashtown road, and formed in line on both
                    sides of that road, in rear of Rodes' and Johnson's divisions, which occupied
                    the front line, running along the crest of the ridge on the west of the town.</p>
<p>My loss in the three days' fighting at Gettysburg was 158 killed, 796 wounded,
                    and 227 missing, a large proportion of the missing being, in all probability,
                    killed or wounded. The enemy's loss at the points where the three brigades of
                    Gordon, Hays, and Hoke were engaged far exceeded my loss, and a very large
                    number of prisoners were secured.</p>
<p>THE MARCH BACK FROM GETTYSBURG, AND RECROSSING OF THE POTOMAC.</p>
<p>At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 5th, under orders from Gen. Ewell, my division
                    moved back on the road toward Fairfield, following in the rear of the corps, and
                    constituting the rear guard of the whole army.</p>
<p>While waiting at the junction of the road on which I had moved with the direct
                    road from Gettysburg to Fairfield for the passage of all the troops and trains,
                    a few pieces of artillery were opened by the enemy at long range, but without
                    doing any damage. The whole force having gotten on the road in front of me, I
                    moved on slowly in the rear, Gordon's brigade bringing up my rear, followed by
                    White's cavalry battalion, and on arriving in view of Fairfield, which is
                    situated in a wide and low plain surrounded by hills, I found the wagon trains
                    in front blocked up. While waiting here for the road to be cleared, Col. White
                    sent forward to inform me that a force of the enemy was advancing in the rear,
                    and I sent forward to hasten up the trains, but as they did not move off, I was
                    preparing to fire a blank cartridge or two for the purpose of quickening their
                    pace, when the advance of the enemy appeared on a hill in my rear, and it became
                    necessary to open on him with shell; and a battery having been brought up by the
                    enemy, and replying to my fire, the trains soon cleared the road. One of
                    Gordon's regiments was deployed as skirmishers to hold the enemy in check, which
                    it did effectually, driving back his advance, and my division was gradually
                    moved forward beyond Fairfield, and formed in line in a favorable position, and
                    Gordon's regiment was called in.</p>
<p>In this affair, this regiment (the Twenty-sixth Georgia) sustained a loss of 11
                    wounded and missing.</p>
<p>The division was then encamped, by order of Gen. Ewell, not far from Fairfield,
                    and so posted as to protect the trains, which had been parked a little farther
                    on.</p>
<p>The enemy did not again molest me, and at light next morning, the 6th, my
                    skirmishers having been replaced by those of Gen. Rodes' division (which was
                    this day to constitute the rear guard), I moved to the front of the corps, and,
                    passing Monterey Springs, on the summit of the mountain, crossed over to
                    Waynesborough, where I encamped for the night.</p>
<p>Very early next morning, the 7th, I moved on toward Hagerstown, by Leitersburg,
                    following Rodes, and being followed by Johnson, whose division this day
                    constituted the rear guard. My division was halted and encamped about a mile
                    north of Hagerstown, on the Chambersburg pike. It remained in this position
                    until the afternoon of the 10th, when it was moved through Hagerstown, and
                    placed in position on the Cumberland road, on the crest of the ridge southwest
                    of Hagerstown. On the next day, the 11th, it was moved farther to the right, and
                    placed in position, with its right resting near the road from Hagerstown to
                    Williamsport.</p>
<p>It remained here until after dark on the 12th, when it was moved to the right
                    across the Williamsport road to the rear of Gen. Hill's position, for the
                    purpose of supporting his line, which faced the road leading toward Sharpsburg,
                    and in front of which a considerable force of the enemy had been massed.</p>
<p>At dark on the night of the 13th, my division was withdrawn, and moved to
                    Williamsport that night, bringing up the rear of the corps, and, after light on
                    the 14th, it was recrossed over the Potomac, Gordon's, Hoke's, and Smith's
                    brigades (the latter now commanded by Col. Hoffman, as Gen. Smith had tendered
                    his resignation on the 10th, and received leave of absence) fording above
                    Williamsport, and Hays' brigade, with Jones' battalion of artillery, crossing
                    over the bridge at Falling Waters.</p>
<p>The division encamped near Hainesville that night, and the next day moved through
                    Martinsburg, and on the 16th reached Darkesville, where it went into camp, and
                    remained until the afternoon of the 20th, when it was ordered to move across
                    North Mountain, at Mills' Gap, and down Back Creek, to intercept a body of the
                    enemy reported to have advanced to Hedgesville.</p>
<p>On the night of the 20th, I encamped near Gerrardstown, and next day crossed the
                    mountain, and, proceeding down Back Creek, reached the rear of Hedgesville, but
                    found that the enemy had hastily retreated the night before. I then moved
                    through Hedgesville and encamped.</p>
<p>Receiving orders that night to move up the Valley, with a view to crossing the
                    mountains, I moved next day to Bunker Hill, and then through Winchester to the
                    Opequon, on the Front Royal road, but in consequence of instructions received
                    from Gen. Ewell, I turned off to the Valley road from Cedarville, and thence,
                    marching by the way of Strasburg, New Market, Fisher's Gap, Madison Court-House,
                    Locust Grove, and Rapidan Station, I reached my present camp, near Clark's
                    Mountain, in the vicinity of Orange Court-House, on the 1st of this month.</p>
<p>The Fifty-fourth North Carolina Regt. and Fifty-eighth Virginia Regt. rejoined
                    their respective brigades near Hagerstown on the march back, after having
                    participated in the repulse of the enemy's attack on our trains near
                    Williamsport, and the Thirteenth Virginia Regt. rejoined its brigade on the
                    passage through Winchester.</p>
<p>The conduct of my troops during the entire campaign, on the march as well as in
                    action, was deserving of the highest commendation.</p>
<p>To Brig.-Gen.'s Hays and Gordon I was greatly indebted for their cheerful,
                    active, and intelligent co-operation on all occasions, and their gallantry in
                    action was eminently conspicuous.</p>
<p>I had to regret the absence of the gallant Brig.-Gen. Hoke, who was severely
                    wounded in the action of May 4, at Fredericksburg, and had not recovered, but
                    his place was worthily filled by Col. Avery, of the Sixth North Carolina Regt.,
                    who fell, mortally wounded, while gallantly leading his brigade in the charge on
                    Cemetery Hill, at Gettysburg, on the afternoon of July 2. In his death the
                    Confederacy lost a good and brave soldier.</p>
<p>The conduct of Lieut.-Col. Jones and his artillery battalion on all occasions, as
                    well as that of Brown's battalion at Winchester, was admirable.</p>
<p>My commendations are also due to Col. French and Lieut.-Col. White and their
                    respective cavalry commands for the efficient service performed by them.</p>
<p>To the members of my staff--Maj.'s Hale, division inspector; Daniel, assistant
                    adjutant-general; Lieut.'s Pitzer and Calloway, my aides, and Mr. Robert D.
                    Early, a volunteer aide--I was indebted for the active zeal, energy, and courage
                    with which they performed their duties.</p>
<p>Though I do not wish to make invidious distinctions by calling attention to
                    individual acts of daring and gallantry, of which there were so many instances,
                    I must refer to the case of Lieut. John Orr, adjutant of the Sixth Louisiana
                    Regt. (mentioned by Gen. Hays), who mounted the enemy's breastworks at
                    Winchester, and received a bayonet wound on the top of the parapet, and I
                    respectfully recommend this officer for promotion to the position of captain of
                    cavalry, he being desirous of entering that branch of the service, for which he
