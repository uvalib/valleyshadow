<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Samuel Cooper writes Secretary of War James Seddon to inform
                    him that troops are being sent from Millborough to Staunton in July, 1863.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>James A. Seddon,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Narrows,</p>
<p>July 9, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your telegram of this date just received. Another, from Gen. Cooper, ordering me
                    to Winchester instead of Charlottesville. I shall obey the last order with all
                    practicable dispatch.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the corps I design sending were in front of Lewisburg.
                    Agreeably to orders I have given, they ought to march this evening from
                    Millborough; thence by rail to Staunton.</p>
<p>A dispatch of yesterday's date, by special courier from the officer commanding
                    near Raleigh Court-House, informs me on undoubted authority that the enemy at
                    Fayetteville had been re-enforced the day before; that they were reconnoitering
                    him in force, and he confidently expected to be attacked. He begs me to
                    re-enforce him by about 1,000 of the troops now at Lewisburg. As you have
                    ordered them east, of course I cannot send them to McCausland. I only repeat to
                    you the substance of McCausland's dispatch, that you may have the information,
                    as in the present rapidly changing current of events it may possibly modify your
                    order to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
