<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes General John B. Floyd in August, 1861, to discuss movements
                    and orders in western Virginia. Staunton is mentioned as a supply base.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HDQRS.,</p>
<p>Gen. J. B. FLOYD,<br> Cmdg., Lewisburg, Va.:</p>
<p>Valley Mountain,</p>
<p>August 8, 1861.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have learned from a letter received from Gen. Wise this morning that you
                    intended moving upon Lewisburg yesterday. The general reports his legion
                    unprepared at present to take the field for want of tents, clothing, means of
                    transportation, &amp;c., for which he has sent to Staunton. I have written
                    to him to-day to join you as soon as possible. A part of his force now occupies,
                    I believe, Meadow Bluff, and from his cavalry scouts you will learn of the
                    proceedings of the enemy in your front. I need not repeat to you the importance
                    of holding the enemy west of Lewisburg if possible, and of preventing his
                    approach by the turnpikes through Raleigh to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad
                    in Wythe and Washington Counties, and in Pulaski County. I hope some Southern
                    regiments have by this time been posted at Wytheville, and should you learn that
                    such is the case you are desired to keep in communication with their commander,
                    to give such directions to the troops collected on the Fayette and Raleigh
                    turnpike as may be necessary, and to assume the control of the troops operating
                    in the Kanawha District, unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary of War. It
                    may be proper to inform you that a part of Gen. Loring's forces occupy this
                    position with its depot and reserve at Huntersville. Another part of his
                    command, under Gen. H. R. Jackson, holds a position on the Staunton and
                    Parkersburg turnpike, where it crosses the Alleghany, having its reserve and
                    depot at Monterey. You are desired to communicate to him any information of
                    interest to his command. I learn from recent advices believed to be reliable
                    that the enemy is fortifying Charleston, repairing the Gauley bridge, and is
                    advanced seven or eight miles east to the Hawk's Nest. His march with 300
                    infantry to Fayette Court-House was for the purpose of releasing some prisoners
                    confined there in jail. Gen. Cox is said to have made himself very acceptable to
                    the inhabitants of Kanawha Valley by his considerate conduct, and that he has
                    between 3,000 and 4,000 men at Gauley River. I also learn that the troops that
                    had been sent to Summersville from this line are returning, probably walled by
                    the advance to this point. I have heard of no movement of the enemy as yet
                    threatening the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen., Cmdg.</p>
