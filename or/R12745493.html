<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas reports to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton
                    on Confederate troop movements in Pennsylvania in this July 2, 1863, dispatch.
                    He reports that confederate troops moved rapidly through Chambersburg and that
                    Lee has his headquarters near there.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Received 9.20 a. m.<br> E. M. Stanton,<br> Secretary of
                        War:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 2, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everything quiet at the front. Capt. Boyd, supposed to be at Shippensburg, who
                    commands some cavalry, reports the rebels evacuated Chambersburg the night of
                    July 1, at 12 o'clock, going in the direction of Greenwood and Fayetteville. The
                    rear guard of the rebels passed through Shippensburg rapidly, not stopping. Lee,
                    whose headquarters were near Chambersburg yesterday, is evidently massing his
                    troops in that region, to encounter Meade. Heavy firing heard all day at
                    Carlisle from the direction of Gettysburg. Railroad communication open from here
                    to within 1 1/2 miles of Carlisle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>L. THOMAS,<br> Adjutant-Gen.</p>
