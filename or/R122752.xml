                <p>Your telegram of 8 p. m. received. I am much pained at its contents. My
                    three-months' men are homesick and discontented with their officers, and
                    determined to return at once. When I suggested the Staunton movement I expected
                    these regiments to unite in it. I should be compelled to fight the enemy now
                    ascertained in force at Monterey, and should reach Staunton without men enough
                    to accomplish much. McDowell's check would greatly increase my difficulties and
                    render numerous detachments necessary to keep open my communications and protect
                    my flanks. How would it meet your views were I to leave, say, four regiments at
                    Huttonsville and in the strong position of Cheat Mountain, one at Beverly, one
                    at Bulltown, and send two or three and a better general to re-enforce Cox, then
                    move with the rest by railroad to New Creek, on Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and
                    effect a junction with Patterson near Jamesburg, on the road from New Creek to
                    Charlestown? With this force, in addition to such State troops as Pennsylvania
                    can furnish, we should be able either to defeat Johnston or separate him from
                    Beauregard, and, connecting with McDowell, fight them in detail. I shall know
                    early to-morrow the exact condition of the three-years' regiments now in Ohio
                    and Indiana. Depending upon that information, I can join Patterson with probably
                    fifteen thousand men besides such as Pennsylvania can furnish. The time required
                    would be about seven days, perhaps six, from the day on which I receive your
                    orders until the junction with Patterson at Jamesburg. This, though not so
                    brilliant a plan as a movement on Staunton, appears to me the sounder and safer
                    one. Whatever your instructions may be, I will do my best to carry them out. I
                    will suspend all further preparations for my projected movement on Kanawha until
                    I hear from you. Please reply by telegraph at once.</p>
