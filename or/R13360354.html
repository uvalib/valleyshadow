<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William Averell reports to General Benjamin F. Kelley on
                    intelligence gathered from two refugees who passed through Richmond and Staunton
                    in January, 1864. The refugees discussed the bad conditions in Richmond, and
                    reported seeing wagons filled with leather bound for Staunton.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. B. F. KELLEY,<br> Cmdg. Department of the
                        Cumberland:</p>
<p>Martinsburg,</p>
<p>January 5, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several refugees have just arrived from Richmond and Staunton. They left Richmond
                    on 27th ultimo. They give the usual reports with regard to the miserable
                    condition of affairs in the rebel capital. Gold at 22 to 30. They avoided
                    Early's force in coming here, and passed a portion of it falling back on Sunday
                    near Newton. They met several wagons returning toward Staunton loaded with
                    leather. Their report confirms those heretofore received and forwarded to you
                    with regard to the force in the valley, except that they heard or saw nothing of
                    Ewell. They state the force at three brigades of infantry and two of cavalry,
                    besides Imboden's command. Imboden is not with his command, which is now under
                    Col. Smith.</p>
