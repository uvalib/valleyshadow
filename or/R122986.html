<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In mid-July, 1861, Union troops under George B. McClellan drove Confederates
                    under Robert Garnett from what is now West Virginia. In the aftermath,
                    Confederates in the Shenandoah Valley scrambled to stop the Federal advance. In
                    this letter, Robert E. Lee orders William W. Loring to take control of forces in
                    the area. Lee informs Loring that troops and supplies from Staunton will come to
                    his aid.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS,</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. W. W. LORING,<br> Provisional Army,
                        Confederate States:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>July 20, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>You are assigned to the command of the Northwestern Army, and it is important
                    that you join it without delay. Brig. Gen. H. R. Jackson, now in command of the
                    forces, was at Monterey when last heard from, and he will give you all the
                    information relative to previous operations, the state of the troops, country,
                    &amp;c., You will perceive the necessity of preventing the advance of the
                    enemy, and the importance of restraining him the other side of the Alleghany
                    Ridge. For this purpose you will occupy such passes as in your judgment will
                    effect the object, and your attention is particularly called to the defense of
                    the road leading from Huttonsville (where the enemy is said to be now
                    stationed), through Mailing's Bottom to Huntersville, and the Warm Springs to
                    Millborough, on the Virginia Central Railroad. In addition to the force you will
                    find at Monterey and on the march from Staunton, Brig.-Gen. Floyd has been
                    directed to move with his brigade upon Covington. Brig.-Gen. Wise, operating in
                    the valley of the Kanawha, has been directed to move up towards the same point,
                    and Col. Angus W. McDonald, on the South Branch of the Potomac, to Staunton. A
                    union of all the forces in the West can thus be effected for a decisive blow,
                    and, when in your judgment proper, it will be made. Such supplies as you cannot
                    procure in your vicinity will be forwarded from Staunton and this place.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>R.E. LEE,<br> Gen., Commanding.</p>
