<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Phil Sheridan writes General Grant to inform him of December, 1864,
                    Confederate troop movements in the Shenandoah Valley. He reports that Early's
                    men moved to Staunton, possibly to go into winter quarters there.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gen. U. S. GRANT,<br> City Point, VA.:</p>
<p>KERNSTOWN, VA.,</p>
<p>December 12, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reports up to this evening are as follows: Early moved a portion or all his
                    infantry back toward Staunton, commencing the movement last Friday. The soldiers
                    said they were going into winter quarters there. I cannot get any information of
                    Gordon's and Pegram's division other than the report of one deserter. All others
                    state that Pegram did not move previous to last Friday, and know nothing of the
                    movements of Gordon's division. I have been unable to do anything toward
                    determining absolutely these movements on account of the snow-storm and the
                    intensely cold weather now prevailing here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
