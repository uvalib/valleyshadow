<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee writes to General Samuel Jones concerning May, 1863, movements of
            cavalry to Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Gen. SAMUEL JONES,<br> Cmdg. Department of Western
                        Virginia:</p>
<p>FREDERICKSBURG,</p>
<p>May 9, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of the 25th ultimo. I will endeavor to make the
                    exchange of cavalry you propose. I have telegraphed you to send Gen. Jenkins to
                    Staunton, or the most convenient point to him in the Valley. Please let me know
                    the time he may be expected to arrive there.</p>
<p>I know that Gen. Jenkins is a gallant soldier, but am unacquainted with his
                    administrative qualities.</p>
<p>How would cavalry in this part of Virginia.</p>
<p>You see how Gen. Stoneman has been running wild over the State, cutting our
                    railroads, &amp;c., and even going to within sight of Richmond. He has
                    twenty-eight regiments of cavalry, organized into four divisions, forming a
                    cavalry corps under himself. He must be restricted in his operations or we shall
                    be ruined. Where can we obtain re-enforcements of cavalry from? I have received
                    no detailed reports from Imboden and Jones. So far as heard from, they have been
                    successful. Success is a necessary to us, and all must endeavor to win it.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
