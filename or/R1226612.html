<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union officer Fitz-John Porter writes Assistant Adjutant E. D. Townsend from
                    Chambersburg in June, 1861. He discusses the building of a blockhouse on
                    Maryland Heights, the Confederate defense of the Shenandoah, actions of
                    Confederate cavalry including oppression of civilians, and the green nature of
                    Union troops.</p>

<p>Col. TOWNSEND</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>June 4, 1861.</p>
<p>COLONEL:</p>
<p>The last paragraph in the general's letter (next preceding) refers to this, that
                    at night the sound of the hammer is heard breaking stone on the Maryland
                    Heights, the ax felling trees. Evidently a block-house is going up. No one can
                    get near enough to see, and no one is permitted to come here all the way from
                    there. Their informers only go part way. No guns have been placed on this side,
                    unless they are light field pieces, and taken up in wagons. The Virginia side of
                    the Shenandoah is armed, and the guns are iron and long-probably 32 or 24
                    pounders. Squadrons of cavalry roam the Virginia shore, oppressing people and
                    pressing them into service. Our volunteers are as green as green can be.
                    Marching is their forte, if they have a drum or a band. They cannot form a
                    square yet of those I have seen, yet they think themselves perfect. As the Gen.
                    has just said he would send one or two batteries here, the general will do
                    nothing about getting the field artillery from Harrisburg, though ammunition
                    will be called here, which will be available for the two field batteries if they
                    come. If they do not come, we can get those guns and plant them. We are working
                    like bees.</p>
<p>Yours, truly,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER.</p>
