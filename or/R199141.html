<p>Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War:</p>
<p>ROLLISTON, NEAR NORFOLK,</p>
<p>January 26, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I express to you gratefully my acknowledgments for yours of the 23d instant. Your
                    order to be at my post in the hour of apprehended danger was very proper, yet it
                    relieves my absence from reproach to have it said that I hastened away from it
                    only to return as speedily as possible with the means of its defense. The
                    weather has delayed here the transportation of my Second Regiment of Infantry.
                    They started yesterday for Roanoke Island: and I depart to-morrow, if a steam
                    tug, through the canal, can be found. You, I am certain, would have me succeed
                    triumphantly in my duties, and will excuse even eager, as well as anxious,
                    appeals for the means of victory.</p>
<p>Wherever the Burnside expedition may be, the forces of the enemy already in the
                    Hatteras Inlet are sufficient to overwhelm the present forces and means of
                    defense.</p>
<p>I avail myself of your kindness in attending to my requests and helping me to the
                    best of your ability, by asking that you will order commissions to be issued to
                    the following officers: Maj. C. B. Duffield, of cavalry; Ordnance Officer James
                    H. Pearce; Assist. Inspector-Gen. H. Dugan; Adjutant(of the First Regiment of
                    Infantry) Henry A. Wise, jr., and Second Lieuts. (in the Engineer Corps,
                    Artillery) T. C. Kinney, C. Ellis Munford, and R. A. Wise, &amp;e.</p>
<p>Please order the forces of my Legion under Col. Green, at Wilmington, N. C., and
                    the two companies at Staunton, assigned to the command of Col. N. Tyler, to be
                    forwarded to me, and order my artillery corps at Richmond to be furnished with
                    guns, carriages, and caissons, and forwarded. I beg you also to order back to me
                    the Third Regiment of Infantry taken from my command.</p>
<p>With the highest respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>HENRY A. WISE,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
