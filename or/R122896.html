<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston writes a memorandum for Robert E. Lee on
                    Union preparations in the vicinity of Chambersburg for an advance on Virginia.

<p>Memorandum for Gen. Lee.</p>
<p>HEADQUARTERS,<br> Harper's Ferry, Va.,</p>
<p>May 31, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Intelligence was brought me this morning, from a gentleman residing near
                    Hagerstown, that 1,600 troops arrived in Chambersburg on Tuesday and 5,000
                    yesterday, making, with the 3,500 there before, 10,100, with plenty of artillery
                    (quantity unknown), many wagons and horses. A note was shown me yesterday,
                    written in Hagerstown on Wednesday afternoon, by a woman, in which it is said
                    that such a force is to move to the Potomac (with baggage wagons) from
                    Chambersburg through either Hagerstown or Greencastle.</p>
<p>In another note (from an officer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), it is said
                    that large forces are to enter Virginia somewhere between Cumberland and
                    Hagerstown to meet Ohio troops. The Northern papers confirm this.</p>
<p>An officer of the railroad told me here that news of the occupation of Grafton by
                    U.S. troops is brought by telegraph. We can learn nothing from the west, nor
                    beyond the range of persons specially employed. Should the enemy cross the river
                    above, we cannot learn when the Ohio troops join them, nor in what numbers.</p>
<p>This place cannot be held against an enemy who would venture to attack it. Would
                    it not be better for these troops to join one of our armies, which is too weak
                    for its object, than be lost here? They are not equipped for the field. The only
                    means of transportation, besides the railroad, are wagons impressed in the
                    neighborhood. Should these troops be ordered elsewhere, please indicate any
                    objectionable route.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>J.E. JOHNSTON,<br> Brig.-Gen., C.S. Army.</p>
