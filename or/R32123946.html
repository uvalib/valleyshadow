<p>Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>December 13, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All the organized drafted men have left this State. I saw the last regiment leave
                    Chambersburg yesterday, and this regiment, I think, will prove to be the most
                    efficient. It is commanded by Col. McKibbin, an officer of the Regular Army, who
                    has already distinguished himself. He is a fine soldier, untiring in his
                    efforts, and I would like to see his regiment placed in the field. The two
                    companies for Cockeysville are here, being armed and equipped, and will be
                    placed in position on Monday morning. Gen. Wool desires a regiment for provost
                    duty; this can soon be organized from the drafted men now coming in. All drafted
                    men will be sent to Camp Curtin for organization, except those arriving at
                    Philadelphia to be organized there for the regiment desired by Gen. Wool. I have
                    called for reports, to show the number of drafted men made available. This
                    accomplished, I might close my duties here. To collect the balance of the
                    drafted men the appointment of provost-marshal will be necessary, and with a
                    provost guard many stragglers can be arrested and sent to their regiments.</p>
