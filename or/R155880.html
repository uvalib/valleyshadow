<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Captain Joseph Jones writes from Staunton to Adjutant General Samuel
                    Cooper on the state of men under his command. The companies, ordered to Staunton
                    in September, 1861, suffer from disease and fatigue. Jones asks that they be
                    granted a furlough.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Gen. COOPER:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>September 25, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>By an order of Gen. Jackson I have brought the two companies (I and K) of the
                    Twentieth Regt. Virginia Volunteers to this place, to await further orders. From
                    the fact that the two companies have been ordered from active service to this
                    place, I ask leave to submit to you, sir, a report of their condition. They have
                    been engaged in active duties since the 3d of June last.</p>
<p>After our disastrous retreat from Rich Mountain all the companies of the
                    Twentieth Regt. asked to return home for the purpose of recruiting, except
                    Companies I and K. We were ordered to form a separate battalion, and to act as a
                    guard to Capt. Shumaker's battery of Danville artillery, which position we have
                    occupied ever since, up to the late order of Gen. Jackson. Shortly after our
                    retreat, before the men could recover from cold contracted from exposure, the
                    measles broke out in our company. In Company I alone there were 50 cases. The
                    men have mostly recovered from the measles, but the debility consequent upon
                    this disease has left them unfit for the hard service of the northwest.</p>
<p>There are at present here now 38 men, rank and file, of Company I. Of this number
                    there are not more than 25 who would be fit for duty. The most of the company
                    were granted furloughs from this place and Richmond, and from last accounts they
                    were, or most of them, convalescent. The same statement is true of Company K.
                    Besides the sickness in Company I at this time 7 have died and 6 were taken
                    prisoners. Company K is under command of first lieutenant in Company I, it being
                    destitute of a commander. Two of their lieutenants were take prisoners at Rich
                    Mountain. The other has since died. Their captain has been lying in Richmond
                    sick for the last two or three weeks.</p>
<p>In view of all these facts I most respectfully suggest that if it is not the
                    purpose of the Government to muster these companies out of service, they be
                    permitted to visit their homes under a furlough for thirty days, to recruit
                    their health and attend to their business-such as would need their immediate
                    presence to transact. I will further say that, under favorable circumstances, in
                    thirty days each of these companies ought to report at least 60 men, rank and
                    file.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>JOSEPH JONES,<br> Capt., Cmdg. Companies I and K, Twentieth Reg't Va.
