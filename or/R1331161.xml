                <p>Army quartermasters, because of their direct access to military supplies, had
                    plenty of temptations toward corruption, and were often accused of indiscretions
                    when supplies ran low. In this February, 1864, letter, Robert E. Lee writes
                    General Alexander Lawton to explain his reasons for revoking an order that
                    allowed quartermasters to purchase supplies for their families. Lee reasons that
                    doing so would help remedy the Confederates' increasing supply problem. Lee also
                    refers to the public prejudice toward commissary officers.</p>

                <p>I have had the honor to receive your letter of February 8, calling my attention
                    to Col. Larkin Smith's indorsement in reply to mine of February 1. You have
                    misunderstood the purport of my indorsement, which makes no charge against
                    officers of the Quartermaster or any other department of using supplies in an
                    unauthorized manner. I was not aware of the distinction drawn by Col. Smith
                    between post quartermasters and quartermasters of military posts. My intention
                    was to draw the attention of Col. Smith to the fact that officers at many
                    military posts in the country, such as Staunton, Liberty, Farmville, Danville,
                    Richmond, &amp;c., under article 1127, Army Regulations, are allowed to
                    purchase supplies for their families. It is believed that large amounts of
                    commissary stores are consumed in this way which it would be prudent to send to
                    soldiers in the field. About the date of the indorsement of February 1, I wrote
                    to the Secretary of War recommending a modifications of regulation 1127 so as to
                    take this privilege from officers at posts, in order to husband our limited
                    supplies and remove causes of dissatisfaction in the army and among the people.
                    If the Secretary of War has no power to modify the privilege, I would
                    respectfully suggest that Congress pass a law upon the subject abolishing the
                    law in question. A proper inspection of the military posts would show the extent
                    of the evil.</p>
                <p>I can appreciate the difficulties under which Col. Smith has labored in his
                    efforts to collect the tithes by a well-regulated system, and no one can more
                    cordially wish him success than myself.</p>
