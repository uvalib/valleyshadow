<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch writes U. S. Assistant Adjutant Edward D. Townsend in
                    August, 1864, concerning the raising of the border militia during the
                    Confederate cavalry raid into Maryland and southern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Col. E. D. TOWNSEND,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>August 11, 1864.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I respectfully state, in consequence of being absent at Chambersburg and
                    McConnellsburg, I did not see the message of His Excellency Governor A. G.
                    Curtin, of the 9th instant, to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, until this
                    evening. There in is a copy of a letter addressed by me to the honorable
                    Secretary of War, dated Harrisburg, July 22, 1864, which came into the
                    Governor's possession and was published in this manner: He applied for a copy of
                    my communication to the Secretary on the subject of organizing the border
                    militia. I telegraphed to Maj. John S. Schultze, assistant adjutant-general, the
                    following:</p>
<p>PITTSBURG, August 4, 1864--9 a. m.<br> Maj. SCHULTZE,<br> Assistant
                    Adjutant-Gen., Harrisburg:</p>
<p>Give the Governor a copy of my letter or plan to organize the militia of the
                    border counties with his indorsement.<br> D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
<p>A copy of the letter as above was sent to him by mistake, as accompanying the
                    plan with his indorsement, when only the plan was intended to have been
                    furnished. This is matter of regret to me, as my official letters and reports to
                    the War Department are never given to any parties.</p>
<p>I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg. Department.</p>
