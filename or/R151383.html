                    Regt. and one section of Rice's battery, Col. E. Goode commanding. The remaining
                    companies of the cavalry will retain their present positions, scouting
                    thoroughly the country between Monterey and Petersburg. The Danville Artillery
                    will re-enforce the column at Huntersville, proceeding by the road known as the
                    Warm Springs road. The remainder of the troops will proceed to Staunton. In
                    order to facilitate the movements the quartermaster of the post will take
                    immediate charge of all the transportation which is now at or may come to the
                    post, and move all surplus stores, baggage, &amp;c., to the summit of
                    Alleghany, leaving one wagon with each regiment for the necessary police
                    purposes. It is enjoined upon commander of regiments to see that all but
                    indispensable equipage be forwarded. On Wednesday, the 20th instant, the post
                    quartermaster will take charge of all the transportation and distribute it
                    equitably among the different corps. Regimental quartermasters or officers
                    detailed for the purpose will cause the trains to be driven to their respective
                    parade grounds to encamp for the night, and under the superintendence of their
                    commanders assign transportation to each company. The general will be sounded
                    from each brigade headquarters at 3 a. m. on the 21st instant, when the tents
                    will be struck and wagons packed and placed upon the road, each train in charge
                    of its quartermaster, and without further orders will proceed to the summit of
                    Alleghany, where an officer will further direct them. It is expected that the
                    whole of the wagon train will be in motion by 4 a. m. That regiment which shall
                    occasion delay will be placed in the rear and kept there during the entire
                    march. On the departure of the wagons the troops will remain on their parade
                    grounds to await orders, and it is strictly forbidden to leave their stations
                    without permission for necessary purposes.</p>
