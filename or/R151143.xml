                <p>Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston writes Inspector General Samuel Cooper in
                    June, 1861, concerning the Confederate defenses in northwestern Virginia.
                    Johnston describes the composition of Confederate forces in the area, speculates
                    as to the plans of the Union force stationed at Chambersburg, and complains of
                    Union sentiment among north-west Virginians.</p>

                <p>Col. Jackson, with a field battery and four regiments of Virginia Volunteers, is
                    at Martinsburg; Lieut.-Col. Stuart, with six companies of Virginia cavalry,
                    between that place and the Potomac; seven battalions are near this place; three
                    battalions under Col. A. P. Hill are on the road toward Romney, and a battalion
                    under Lieut. Col. G. H. Steuart, detached to Harper's Ferry. There are three
                    field batteries with the battalions here. The enemy's movements cannot be
                    ascertained accurately. Yesterday Lieut.-Col. Stuart reported him encamped
                    around Williamsport. He was informed by a well-recommended clergyman that he had
                    met 5,000 or 6,000 on the way from Williamsport to Chambersburg going, they
                    said, to Washington. This morning Col. Stuart reports that a regiment of
                    infantry has returned to our side of the river. All the information I could
                    obtain from this vicinity in Maryland, and from friends in Baltimore, was to the
                    effect that 18,000 men would advance from Chambersburg to co-operate with an
                    army from Ohio. My belief in these reports prevented me from availing myself of
                    an opportunity to strike a hard blow. Gen. Cadwalader's forces which crossed the
                    Potomac probably scarcely exceeded 8,000. The population bordering the Potomac
                    in Virginia is all hostile to us; they inform the enemy of every movement of
                    ours, while we know nothing of his but what we see. I send two prisoners taken
                    by one of Col. Stuart's men opposite Williamsport yesterday. They represented
                    themselves to be a lieutenant-colonel and private acting as colonel's secretary.
                    Your main re-enforcements, I doubt not, should go to Gen. Beauregard. A few
                    mounted companies are much wanted here. We have not the number required for
                    picket service. If this want can be supplied, I beg that it may be. I had the
                    pleasure to receive 8,000 cartridges this morning, and your letter of the 18th.</p>
