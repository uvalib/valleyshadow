<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin writes New Jersey Governor Joel Parker in
                    June, 1863, to request that he send emergency state troops to help defend
                    against Lee's invasion of his state. Curtin mentions that the Confederates
                    occupy Chambersburg and have plundered southern Franklin and Fulton

<p>His Excellency Joel Parker,<br> Governor of New Jersey:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>June 24, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22d instant
                    from your secretary. The Secretary of War ordered volunteer forces, for
                    temporary service in this military department, from New York and some of the New
                    England States, and the impression rested on my mind that an order of the same
                    kind was made upon you as Governor of New Jersey. The troops raised in
                    Pennsylvania are mustered to serve "during the emergency;" those sent by New
                    York are mustered for thirty days, unless sooner discharged; and to satisfy the
                    apprehensions of men who have taken up arms under the calls, by consent of the
                    War Department, the troops are to be discharged when, in my judgment as Governor
                    of the State, the emergency has expired. The enemy is still in the State, and
                    occupies the country from Chambersburg, in Franklin County, to the Maryland
                    line. He has plundered the southern portions of Franklin and Fulton Counties,
                    and our last advices are that he is north of Greencastle with a force of not
                    less than 8,000 men. It is impossible for us to obtain accurate and reliable
                    information of the number of troops this side of the Potomac, or in the valley
                    immediately south of it. Gen. Couch, who is in command of this department, is
                    under the impression that the number within our borders and threatening the
                    State does not exceed 30,000, and may be much less. He thinks this morning there
                    are indications of a movement in this direction in large force. I suggest that
                    under the circumstances you should continue to prepare troops for this service,
                    and Gen. Couch will communicate with the authorities at Washington to-day on the
                    subject of their enlistment and term of service. When we hear from Washington
                    you will be advised immediately, and it is the more important, as we do not
                    desire to tax the generosity of the State of New Jersey by the payment of any
                    troops she may furnish, whether mustered into the service of the United States
                    or not. Any troops furnished by your State will only be called into service for
                    the military department established in Pennsylvania, and will be discharged
                    when, in my judgment, the emergency has expired, and if there should be a
                    limitation to their term of service, they will be returned to your State at your
                    pleasure if the emergency should not have expired.</p>
<p>I cannot close this communication without expressing to you the thanks of the
                    people of Pennsylvania for your promptness in responding to their calls, and to
                    the people of New Jersey for the patriotic disposition they so truly manifest,
                    and their willingness to take up arms for our defense.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. G. CURTIN.</p>
