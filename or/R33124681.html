<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, writes Provost Marshal-General James B. Fry in August, 1863,
                    concerning drafted men serving in the militia. Couch requests that they be
                    allowed to postpone reporting until after their existing regiment has been
                    mustered out, and outlines the justifications for the request.</p>

<p>Col. J. B. FRY,<br> Provost-Marshal-Gen., Washington, D.
                        C.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg,</p>
<p>August 15, 1863.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I telegraphed yesterday asking you to allow drafted men in the militia to report
                    to their district provost-marshal within ten days after their regiment was
                    mustered out. If my request had been granted I think perhaps these ninety-days'
                    men would be more inclined to stay in service, and Governor Curtin would not
                    have that pressure upon him which he now complains of, and consequently I should
                    have one less obstacle in the way of keeping troops here to assist in completing
                    the draft. If the Governor consents to let a few regiments remain, most of the
                    commanders say that the regiments will be much demoralized by the drafted men
                    leaving. You are probably aware that I am, or shall be, pretty short of men if
                    the militia all go out of the service. I believe the enrollment is now completed
                    in the mining regions.</p>
<p>I am, sir, respectfully,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
