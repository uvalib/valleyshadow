<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Francis Smith, superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute, writes
                    Confederate General John C. Breckinridge in May, 1864, to offer the services of
                    the cadets during any campaigning in the Shenandoah Valley. Smith also mentions
                    General John Imboden's efforts to set up a telegraph line between Staunton and

<p>Maj. Gen. JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,<br> Cmdg. Dept. of
                        Western Virginia, Dublin Depot:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 2, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inclose herewith a letter from Gen. R. E. Lee, commanding
                    Army of Northern Virginia, addressed to the adjutant-general of Virginia, also a
                    copy of instructions from the Governor of Virginia, communicated by the
                    adjutant-general, defining my duty as superintendent of the Virginia Military
                    Institute. Under these instructions and suggestions, I now respectfully report
                    to you for such orders as the emergencies of the approaching campaign may call
                    forth. The Corps of Cadets numbers an aggregate of 280, of whom 250 may be
                    relied upon for active duty, leaving 30 as necessary guard to the Institute and
                    as disabled. The command is organized as a battalion of infantry of four
                    companies, and is usually accompanied by a section of artillery. It is fully
                    equipped, except in horses, and these are impressed in case of need. We have
                    abundance of ammunition, tents, knapsacks, shovels, and picks, and will be
                    prepared to march at a moment's notice. Brig.-Gen. Imboden is about constructing
                    telegraphic communication between the Institute and Staunton. This he hopes to
                    have in operation by the middle of May. In the mean time he will communicate
                    with us by signals. Any orders or intelligence from Dublin Depot had better be
                    forwarded to Gen. Imboden, at Staunton, with instructions to be immediately
                    transmitted to me.</p>
<p>I remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>FRANCIS H. SMITH,<br> Brevet Maj.-Gen. and Superintendent.</p>
