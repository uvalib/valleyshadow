<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In mid-September, 1862, Union General George B. McClellan and the Army of the
                    Potomac followed Robert E. Lee's invading Confederates into Maryland.
                    McClellan's forces fortuitously captured Lee's battle plans, providing the
                    Federals with an opportunity to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia. In this
                    letter, McClellan informs Lincoln of his plans to set a trap for Lee's soldiers.
                    He orders that Pennsylvania forces be placed at Chambersburg to help in the
                    campaign.</p>

<p>Frederick,</p>
<p>September 13, 1862--12 m.<br> (Received 2.35 a. m., September
                        14.)</p>
<p>To the PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but am confident, and no time shall
                    be lost. I have a difficult task to perform, but with God's blessing will
                    accomplish it. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be
                    severely punished for it. The army is in motion as rapidly as possible. I hope
                    for a great success if the plans of the rebels remain unchanged. We have
                    possession of Catoctin. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them
                    in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. I now feel that I can
                    count on them as of old. All forces of Pennsylvania should be placed to
                    co-operate at Chambersburg. My respects to Mrs. Lincoln. Received most
                    enthusiastically by the ladies. Will send you trophies. All well, and with God's
                    blessing will accomplish it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. McCLELLAN.</p>
