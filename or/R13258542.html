<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In mid-1863, Lee sent General James Longstreet's corps west to strengthen
                    Confederate efforts in Tennessee. In this January, 1864, letter, Longstreet
                    writes Lee regarding plans for campaigning in the coming year, and preparations
                    for Longstreet's return east. He asks that supplies be ready at Staunton or
                    Gordonsville for use upon his arrival in Virginia.</p>

<p>Gen. R. E. LEE, Cmdg., &amp;c.:</p>
<p>Russellville, E. Tenn.,</p>
<p>January 10, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have been trying to work out some plan by which we may begin operations before
                    the enemy, and at least disconcert his plans. I do not think we can do anything
                    here or at Chattanooga. I have concluded there is no other opportunity but in
                    Virginia. If we could leave our cavalry here to destroy the railroad and take
                    our infantry to Virginia, it seems to me that we might, by using the turnpike
                    roads, throw our forces behind Gen. Meade me catch him in the mud, and either
                    push on and get Washington or fight him to greater advantage than we can have
                    anywhere else; or you might make arrangements to mount a corps, for locomotion,
                    and throw it with your cavalry behind Meade, and let it push on and get
                    Washington. These plans cannot be well digested, as I have no information as to
                    the difficulties, &amp;c.</p>
<p>If the plan to mount a corps is thought practicable we should take every
                    precaution to prevent its being known or suspected and I would suggest that in
                    collecting saddles for the purpose that the Quartermaster-Gen. be ordered to
                    collect them for Gen. Kirby Smith, and let the horses and mules be got together
                    in Gen. Johnston's name. We could begin to retire from here about the 10th of
                    February, and upon reaching Briston have transportation for Gordonsville ready.
                    Everything should be in readiness for us upon our arrival at Gordonsville or
                    Staunton, so that we should meet with no delay. This should be by the 1st of
                    March, so as to have the full benefit of the bad roads. My position under
                    present circumstances seems to be somewhat precarious. I am just strong enough
                    to tempt the enemy to concentrate against me, and either destroy me or drive me
                    back as far as chooses.</p>
<p>Gen. Johnston cannot aid me, as the enemy can occupy this fortifications about
                    Chattanooga, and send up such forces here as he chooses. We should have the
                    means of communication and cooperation, or we should not allow armies to lie
                    between us.</p>
<p>I remain, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. LONGSTREET,<br> Lieut.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
