<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this March, 1862, letter, Union General in Chief and commander of the Army of
                    the Potomac George B. McClellan, informs General Nathaniel P. Banks of future
                    plans, possibly involving a movement to Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. BANKS, Strasburg:</p>
<p>SEMINARY, VA.,</p>
<p>March 27, 1862-</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have heard from Manassas reliable information that Sumner reached Warrenton
                    Junction at 8.30 a.m. to-day and that all was quiet. I expect a full report from
                    Sumner in a few moments, and will transmit it to you. I judge from this that the
                    enemy have definitely fallen back behind the Rappahannock. I may throw Sumner to
                    the Rappahannock when I have learned the whole position of things, and have
                    serious thoughts of pushing you to New Market, in order to determine the rebels
                    to fall back entirely beyond the Rapidan, and perhaps to move your column
                    farther toward Staunton. Think carefully of this, and obtain all possible
                    information as to roads, supplies, &amp;c., in your front.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. McCLELLAN,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
