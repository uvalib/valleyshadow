<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Franz Sigel writes General Benjamin F. Kelley on May, 1864,
                    movements and fighting in the Shenandoah Valley. Sigel asks Kelley to ask

<p>Brig.-Gen. KELLEY:</p>
<p>MARTINSBURG,</p>
<p>May 17, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After two days' skirmishing, a severe battle was fought at New-Market between our
                    forces and those of Echols and Imboden, under Breckinridge. I had to withdraw
                    our troops from the battle-field toward evening, and recrossed the Shenandoah. I
                    will go back to my position behind Cedar Creek and accept another battle, if
                    necessary.</p>
<p>The troops are in very good spirits, but greatly outnumbered, as Breckinridge has
                    evidently thrown his principal forces against me. I will, however, do my best
                    and depend on your assistance. I wish that you send me immediately the Fourth
                    Virginia Infantry, and the Second Maryland Infantry as there is no serious
                    danger for Cumberland and New Creek, or other places west, as long as I can
                    maintain my position here. Please inform Gen. Crook by any means, and direct him
                    to operate against Staunton, and to destroy if possible the railroad between
                    Staunton and Jackson River Depot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>F. SIGEL,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
