<p><b>Summary:<br></b>John D. Imboden, engaged in raising a regiment of partisan rangers in May, 1862,
                    writes from Staunton to President Jefferson Davis to plead for the exchange of

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> President
                        Confederate States of America. </p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>May 8, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>My brother, F. M. Imboden, was captured at Roanoke Island and paroled as a
                    volunteer aide of Gen. Wise and is now out of the service. As I am organizing my
                    regiment of partisan rangers under authority of the War Department I am
                    exceedingly anxious that he shall command one of my companies. His long service
                    in the mountains last summer qualifies him for most important service to me and
                    the country. As to his soldierly qualifications and character Gen. Wise can
                    speak. Is it not possible to effect his exchange? Cannot some Yankee be sent
                    away in exchange for him? There is now a prisoner in your hands, a New Yorker,
                    named Bryson, captured by my brother in person in the mountains of Virginia in
                    October last, unless he has been sent North, who might appropriately it seems to
                    me be exchanged for my brother. I beg that if it be possible such an arrangement
                    be made so that my brother can again enter the field at the head of a company.</p>
<p>With the highest respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. D. IMBODEN.</p>
