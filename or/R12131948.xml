                    <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Yours of this morning, by Maj. Russell, was received this evening. I had grave
                    doubts of Washburn's safety from the time I left him there, and I feel greatly
                    relieved to learn that Col. Mulligan has got to Moorefield with his fighting
                    Irish boys. I have no fears of their safety now. Had I a few more regiments here
                    I would send a brigade at once to Wardensville, to cut off Jones; but with the
                    small force I have here now, a sufficient force detached from here to meet Jones
                    would endanger the safety of this place. But the temptation is very great, and
                    hard to resist from prudential motives.</p>
                <p>You do me the honor to ask me to write you my views fully. I will guarantee to
                    hold Winchester and the country to Mount Jackson, and to guard securely the four
                    gaps of Manassas, Ashby, Gregory, and Snicker, and to keep the road from
                    Winchester to Martinsburg and Charlestown open, if I have sufficient force.</p>
                <p>The sufficient force should consist of at least two regiments of cavalry and ten
                    regiments of infantry, two batteries, and three or four heavy guns for the
                    fortifications at this place. With such a force I will insure Winchester against
                    any force the rebels can bring against it, hold the other points indicated, act
                    on the offensive, and make raids to Staunton, Luray, and other points in Dixie.</p>
                <p>The magazines in the fortifications here were blown up and the platforms for the
                    guns torn up, and the breastworks torn down and injured in places. If this place
                    is to be held, the fortifications should be repaired and finished, the telegraph
                    to Martinsburg put up (we leave discovered telegraph wire, left here by the
                    rebels, probably sufficient to complete the line to Martinsburg), and the
                    railroad to Harper's Ferry repaired. I think that Moorefield and Petersburg
                    cannot safely be held by less than a brigade, a battery, and two cavalry
                    companies, while the valley from Strasburg to Staunton is held by the rebels, as
                    these places (Moorefield and Petersburg) are too far from support to be safely
                    held by a less force, and are liable to be attacked from Staunton, by way of
                    Monterey and Franklin, and from Harrisonburg, by way of the South Fork. Romney
                    is the key to New Creek, Cumberland, and the railroad, as far east as Little
                    Cacapon.</p>
                <p>A single regiment, with a section of artillery and two cavalry companies,
                    stationed at Romney, would insure the safety of these points and of the railroad
                    between them, while this place and vicinity is held by such a force as I have
                    indicated. The rebels will never attempt a raid upon any point on the Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad from Charlestown to Piedmont while there are two cavalry
                    regiments and such a force as I have indicated here to cut them off. One or two
                    infantry companies, with a section of artillery, would be sufficient to guard
                    New Creek, with other forces disposed as indicated. The railroad can be much
                    better defended and more securely protected by offensive operations against the
                    enemy that threaten it from 20 to 100 miles away from it than by a greater
                    defensive force scattered along its line. This valley is splendidly adapted to
                    cavalry operations, and I could profitably employ all the cavalry that can be
                    sent to me. I would like much if you can send me the Fourteenth Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry. I am acquainted with some of its officers, and hear that it is composed
                    of fine material.</p>
                <p>Should you think proper to order Washburn and Mulligan to fall back from
                    Moorefield, I hope you will permit my two regiments, two sections of artillery,
                    and cavalry company to come back to me. I feel certain that Mulligan at Romney,
                    with his Irish boys, two cavalry companies, and a section or two of artillery,
                    with the force that is at New Creek, would be amply sufficient for that valley,
                    and will insure the safety of New Creek, Cumberland, Green Springs, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>I hope, at least, that you will permit the return of the two sections of
                    artillery now with Washburn, as their absence cripples my two batteries. As the
                    telegraph office is discontinued at Petersburg, and Mr. Samuel Sbaw, who put up
                    the line, not needed there as an operator, if you can order him over here, he
                    could put up the line from Martinsburg to this place with little or no expense
                    to the Government. The poles are now all up.</p>
                <p>Deserters from the rebels say there are a great many rebel troops from Staunton
                    to Mount Jackson, and the rebels here intimate we will be driven out soon, and
                    are looking for Jackson back. I hope he will come; my boys are spoiling for a
                    fight. Glorious weather; too fine to be lying still. My scouting parties are
                    bringing in prisoners daily. General Cluseret was in Strasburg on Saturday last
                    with some cavalry, and captured a rebel mail and 3 rebel cavalry. I find much
                    more Union feeling here than I expected. The portion of the Ringgold Cavalry
                    battalion that was here left this evening, and will be at Romney by to-morrow
                    morning. I delayed sending them to know whether you would withdraw our troops
                    from Moorefield after receiving my dispatch.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,</salute>
