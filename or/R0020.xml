    <p>On the morning of Saturday, the 30th, Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's corps came on the ground
     by the same road that had been taken by the divisions of King and Ricketts--the Sudley Springs
     road--and turned up the Warrenton turnpike, following the course of King's division. The order
     you first gave was that we should hold the center and left and mass our troops on the right, to
     attack the enemy's left; and as you ordered me to make this attack with the Third Corps; added
     to the corps of Porter and Heintzelman, I asked to make a reconnaissance in person before
     sending the troops in, and requested Gen. Heintzelman to accompany me.</p>
    <p>The Sudley Springs road is nearly north and south, and the Warrenton turnpike is nearly east
     and west, crossing each other near where your established your headquarters. I found the enemy
     had the day before occupied nearly the half of a circle, commencing at a point beyond Bull Run,
     on the northeast angle made by those roads and sweeping around irregularly through Sudley
     Springs to the west, and then south to a point in the southwest angle. Our line opposing them
     had on the right Heintzelman's corps; in the center, first Reno's and then Sigel's corps, and
     on the left King's division and Bayard's cavalry; Ricketts, in an interior position, in
     reserve. Porter's corps, which on the day before had been detached and been on the extreme
     left, hanging on the enemy's right and rear, was now on the left, up the Warrenton road.</p>
    <p> On going with Gen. Heintzelman over to the position held by his troops we found all the
     points held by the enemy the day before beyond Bull Run abandoned, and in going over to the
     Sudley Springs road and west of it was saw no evidence of the enemy in force, some skirmishers
     and advanced posts or rear guards, as the case might, be being all that we found. On returning
     to headquarters and reporting these facts we found that word had been sent in from the front
     that the enemy was moving back on the road to Gainesville. Similar word was given by Gen.
     Patrick. On the supposition that the enemy was falling back I received your orders<ref n="1" 
      target="note1">[1]</ref> to take command of the corps above named and pursue the enemy. I
     accordingly gave orders that Ricketts' division should report to Gen. Heintzelman, who was to
     have charge of the right of the advance, and was to move on the enemy by the road from Sudley
     Springs to Hay Market--a road running west nearly parallel with the Warrenton turnpike and the
     north side of it--and paled the other division, Reynold's and King's, which were to the front
     on the Warrenton turnpike and near Gen. Porter's corps, under that general, to support him in
     his advance on that road; but just as these orders<ref n="2" target="note2">[2]</ref> were issued
     Gen. Reynolds rode up to my headquarters and reported, of his own personal knowledge, that the
     enemy were not falling back; on the contrary, that he was passing his troops to the south of
     Warrenton turnpike, and massing them behind the woods, to turn our left and make an attack on
     the southwest angle of the two roads and thence across the Sudley Springs road to the southeast
     angles. It may be well to state here--what, however, is well known to you--that the country
     around the field of battle is much of it thickly wooded, and that the march of large bodies on
     the side of the enemy could only be seen at intervals and can be easily hidden from view. </p>
    <p>On Gen. Reynolds' information, seeing no time was to be lost and that instant measures were
     to be taken to meet this unexpected movement, I gave him orders to take his division
     immediately over to provide for this threatened attack and occupy the hill south of the
     turnpike, he knowing the ground well, having been over it in the course of the battle the day
     before. You at the same time gave orders that some of Gen. Sigel's corps should also move to
     the south of the turnpike on the Bald Hill, so called, near Groveton. I immediately wrote to
     Gen. Porter that he must exercise his discretion as to the use of King's division in the
     movement, he suggested, in his front, that I had been obliged to take Reynold's division from
     him to guard the left, and had to go there in person to see to it; that you said if he should
     need more force you would send him Gen. Sigel. I sent word also to Gen. Heintzelman of the
     change, and that I was obliged to take from him two brigades and two batteries of artillery of
     Ricketts' division to aid in improvising the defense of the left, south of the turnpike, where
     I immediately repaired, and remained throughout the battle, having no further communication
     either with Gen. Ricketts' division, under Gen. Heintzelman, or Gen. King's division, under
     Gen. Porter.</p>
    <p>The Warrenton turnpike goes west up the valley of the little rivulet of Young's Branch, and
     through the battle-field is mostly closed to the stream. The ground rises from the stream on
     both sides, in some places quite into hills. The Sudley Springs road, in crossing the stream at
     right angles, passes directly over one of these hills, just south of the stretching back away
     from it some hundreds of yards to the forest. This is the hill on which the Henry house stood.
     To the west of it is another hill--the Bald Hill, so called--which is, in fact, a ridge lying
     between the roads, and making about the same angle with each, and running back to the forest.
     Between the two hills is a small stream--a tributary, I think, of Young's Branch.</p>
    <p>The two brigades under Brig.-Gen. Tower and the two batteries from Ricketts' division were
     taken from north of the Warrenton turnpike on the Sudley Springs road to the hill first above
     mentioned to the farther side of the first woods. Whilst reconnoitering in advance of these
     woods--the positions which the enemy would be likely to occupy in the direction indicated by
     Gen. Reynolds--I was joined by that officer, and, seeing no evidence at that time of the enemy
     to the left, I accompanied him across to the Bald Hill ridge, on which, next to the main woods,
     his division was taking up its position, and on which, next to Gen. Reynolds, Gen. Schenck was
     coming up from the Warrenton road. Whilst these troops were forming on this ridge, which
     commanded a view of the enemy in the northwest angle of the two roads before mentioned, and
     which overlooked the Warrenton road, we saw the effects of the attack which had been made by
     Maj.-Gen. Porter in front with his own troops and King's division of my corps. Seeing that it
     was resulting disastrously for us, and that our troops were falling back, I returned
     immediately to the Henry House Hill to see to the placing of Tower's two brigades and the two
     batteries. On my way I met one of your staff with your message, asking if in ordering over this
     force I had not taken too much from the right. But soon after meeting you, as you came up the
     Henry House Hill from the right, and representing the state of affairs in front, with your
     sanction I sent Tower's command over to the Bald Hill, to the right of Gen. Schenck. The line
     thus formed, in connection with that on the north of the turnpike, held by Reno, Sigel, and
     other, commanded the Warrenton road and protected the retreat of Porter's command, then moving
     down from the front.</p>
    <p>The line had not been formed any too soon, for the enemy, after our troops in front had
     retreated, made the expected attack, and assailed the troops on the ridge both in front and on
     their left flank. Those of the enemy who had passed to the south of the Warrenton turnpike, as
     represented by Gen. Reynolds, soon after opened a severe fire from the southwest of the Henry
     House Hill on the Bald Ridge, and at the same time prepared to move down to take the woods on
     the Henry House Hill itself. The next step was to provide in some way for the defense of this
     hill, and as at this time some battalions of regulars, of Sykes' division, came up the hill,
     they were sent to the left to occupy the woods which covered it. The Rhode Island battery,
     under Capt. Monroe, and some time after two brigades of Reynolds' division, under Gens. Meade
     and Seymour, which had been withdrawn from the extreme left of the front to form a line across
     the road behind which Gen. Porter's troops might rally, were brought over from the right and
     relieved the regular battalions. The latter rejoined their division, which formed another line
     on the hill to the east, in rear of the Henry House Hill and at a few hundred yards distant
     from it. Reno's corps was also withdrawn by your order from the north of the turnpike to the
     Henry House Hill.</p>
    <p>The attack on the Bald Ridge line had been too severe for the troops to hold it long under
     the hot fire the enemy maintained upon it. Jackson's brigade, of Reynolds' division; McLean's,
     of Schenck's, and Tower's two brigades, of Ricketts' division, were, after heavy losses, little
     by little compelled to yield it, Gen. Schenck and Gen. Tower receiving severe wounds, the
     former in the arm, the latter in the left knee, as they were encouraging and leading on their
     men. Col. Fletcher Webster, Twelfth Massachusetts, and Capt. Fessenden, aide to Gen. Tower,
     were mortally wounded.</p>
    <p>Though we lost this position, it had been held long enough to aid in protecting the retreat
     of our men from the front, who as they came in, either formed behind it or in rear of the line
     on the north of the turnpike. It was the only position on the left from which we were forced,
     and its loss reflects no discredit on those who held it, for they yielded to the overwhelming
     force of the whole right of the enemy's army, which was concentrated on them after our advance
     had been driven back. The troops immediately north of the Warrenton turnpike the commenced
     falling back.</p>
    <p>On going to the turnpike where it ascends from the bridge over Young's Branch to the top of
     the hill to the right and rear of the Henry House Hill, to see to the placing of some troops
     which I thought might be of King's division, of my corps, coming there from the front, I found
     Brig. Gen. Carl Schurz with some of Gen. Sigel's corps drawn up by the road. The general spoke
     to me concerning the posting of a battery then out of position, which I caused to be placed so
     as to be of use in case we should be forced from the Henry House Hill as we had been from the
     Bald Hill, but with warning they were not fire till after our men should have left the position
     in front. Seeing them commence loading, I sent a captain on my staff to warn the battery not to
     fire except on the contingency mentioned. I refer to this incident, as it may have served as a
     foundation for one of the strange stories that soon after became prevalent as to this battle.</p>
    <p>I annex hereto an extract of Gen. Schurz' report and a correspondence which grew out of it,
     from which it will be seen that the general says "he did not mean what he seems to have said."
     [See Appendix B.] Leaving Gen. Schurz drawn up on the hill, I went to the left, where the corps
     of Gen. Porter, or the larger part of it that came out of the fight in front, had been formed
     in double line, and when near Sykes' division of regulars Brig.-Gen. Milroy--a gallant officer,
     of Gen. Sigel's corps--came riding up a state of absolute frenzy, with his sword drawn, and
     gesticulating at some distance off, shouting to send forward re-enforcements, to save the day,
     to save the country, &amp; His manner, his dealing in generalities, which gave no
     information whatever, and which, in the way he uttered them, only showed him as being in a
     state of mind as unfit to judge of events as to command men and as being away from his command,
     caused me to receive him coldly.</p>
    <p>It was a question with me whether we could hold the Henry House Hill--whether to break the
     line of reserve at this time or hold the position they then occupied. It was a question of
     importance, on which I should have liked to consult you, the general-in-chief, before
     deciding--the more so as I had reason to think this line had been established under your own
     orders, given direct. But you were farther over to the left, and the case had to be determined
     at once.</p>
    <p>But while Gen. Milroy gave me nothing whatever on which I could be justified in acting, and
     while in double for the moment in view of the circumstances as to the course to be taken, I
     received a clear message from that intelligent as well as gallant officer Brig.-Gen. Meade,
     through one of his aides-de-camp, to the effect that if he could have some re-enforcements sent
     to him in the woods on the Henry House Hill could not only hold them, but drive out the enemy,
     who were not then there in great force. Relieved from all doubly by this message, I exclaimed,
     "Meade shall have re-enforcements," and immediately gave Gen. Porter orders to send them
     forward.</p>
    <p> I send herewith an extract<ref n="3" target="note3">[3]</ref> from Gen. Milroy's report, to which
     I regret I have to refer to say that his statement that I refused to send re-enforcements to
     Gen. Sigel is without foundation in anything that I said or thought. I had just come from a
     large part of Gen. Sigel's corps. I had received no intimation from Gen. Sigel that he needed
     re-enforcements. He was in reserve, and mostly in a different part of the field than that in
     which I had been operating. On Friday I had re-enforced him with Reynolds' whole division, and
     on Saturday the only part of his corps with which I had had anything to do up to the time of my
     seeing Gen. Schurz was Gen. Scheneck's division, which I had re-enforced, without being asked,
     with every man I had at the time under my control. </p>
    <p> I send herewith a copy of my correspondence with Col. Buchanan, commanding the brigade of
     regulars sent forward at the time in question,<ref n="4" target="note4">[4]</ref> and with other
     officers present on the occasion, from which you see the condition of mind Gen. Milroy was in,
     and how little his impressions at the time are to be relied on, either as to what he did or
     what I said. </p>
    <p>To Gen. Sigel personally I bore no ill-will, but had he been my enemy, and had I desired to
     see him harmed--Gen. Sigel here represented several thousand men, many of them from my own
     State, and aside from the great question of the loss of the battle, the fate of the campaign
     and the ruin of the country, which might all have been involved--I could not be so stupidly
     bad, so utterly false to the simplest form of duty, as to refuse aid to my brother soldiers
     when I had the power to give it only because they were under an officer I did not like. As it
     seems to have been the impression not only that I was unfriendly to Gen. Sigel, but that we had
     bitter altercations and even personal conflicts on the field itself, I take the occasion to
     state that during the whole course of the operations from Thursday morning at Buckland Mills to
     the next Monday evening at Fairfax Court-House not only I did not exchange a word with Gen.
     Sigel, but I did not see him, and I do not think he saw me. The re-enforcements taken forward
     by Col. Buchanan and the troops brought by your orders from the north of the turnpike held the
     position on the Henry House Hill until they were withdrawn long after dark.</p>
    <p>It was about 7 o'clock when I received your order to take such portions of my corps as I
     might find intact and proceed with them to take a position covering the bridges over Bull Run
     and Cub Run. Proceeding to the place where I had left Gen. Schurz I found he had withdrawn, but
     Gen. Gibbon's brigade, of King's division, was just coming up the hill, and seeing it would not
     be well to leave the position as unsupported as it then was, I told Gen. Gibbon to take post
     there and hold it till everything should have passed him. He remained there, I am told by one
     of the colones of his brigade, till some two hours after dark, when he withdrew.</p>
    <p>Learning at this place that Patrick's brigade, of King's division, had just passed toward the
     bridge I followed it there. Seeing the road much blocked up with wagons I endeavored to find
     the ford, a couple of hundred yards below the bridge, but it was so dark I could not see the
     way, and returned to the road and crossed over. I left here two officers of my staff and a
     guard of the Pennsylvania Bucktail Battalion, belonging to the Third Corps, under the gallant
     Col. Kane, and directed some pieces of artillery that were passing by to be placed in position
     on the left bank. All contest, however, save a short now and then from one of our pieces on the
     Henry House Hill, had ceased for some time. This brave little battalion remained here until
     everybody had passed, when they destroyed the bridge and brought up the rear. The troops in
     passing over the bridges and in moving to the rear did so in good order. Stragglers there were,
     of course--a march, either in advance or retreat, is seldom without them--but the mass of the
     men preserved their organization and moved by battalions and batteries. At Cub Run Bridge I
     left, with Maj. Houston, U.S. Engineers, who had constructed the bridge over Bull Run, and
     rendered valuable service throughout the campaign, a regiment to keep the troops in the proper
     order in passing to the rear.</p>
    <p>I have no reports from King's division, and, as its operations were under direction of
     another commander, I am unable to speak as I would like to do concerning it. It was, I know,
     driven back in the engagement in front, but I know it to be one of the finest, best-drilled,
     best-disciplined bodies of troops in the service, and in the main ably commanded, and if it
     could not accomplish its task it must have been an excessively had one it was called on to
     perform.</p>
    <p>The two brigades of Rickett's division, engaged over in the extreme right, under Gen.
     Heintzelman, were under Gen. Ricketts, whose report is herewith.</p>
    <p>On the morning of the 31st the corps was reunited, and by your order placed in reserve behind
     Centreville, the cavalry, under Bayard, being detached and operating to the right of that
     place.</p>
