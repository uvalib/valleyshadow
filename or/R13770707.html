<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In May, 1864, Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley prepared to advance in
                    conjunction with General Grant's offensive in the east. In this letter, Robert
                    E. Lee warns General John C. Breckinridge of these developments, and expresses
                    the opinion that Union General William Averell planned to capture Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,<br> Cmdg. Department of
                        Southwestern Virginia:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 1, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I gather from the reports of scouts recently from the Valley that Averell has set
                    out on an expedition, the design of which is either to reach some point on the
                    Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, or to effect the capture of Staunton. The
                    general impression is that he will pursue the route which he took on his last
                    raid. I think it would be well to have everything prepared to meet him, and, in
                    conjunction with Gen. Imboden, to destroy him, if possible. The enemy will
                    probably make a diversion from the Kanawha Valley to keep your forces occupied
                    while he accomplishes his main design. I am inclined to think that his object is
                    to move on Staunton. If so, you might move against his line of communications
                    while Imboden holds him in front, or concoct some other plan of defeating him.
                    These movements in the western department will probably be simultaneous with the
                    attack by Grant here, who has recently been re-enforced by Burnside's army from
                    Annapolis, so it will be impossible to send any re-enforcements to the Valley
                    from this army. I have instructed Gen. Imboden to communicate with you. A late
                    report from a citizen places Gen. Sigel at Martinsburg, but this conflicts with
                    former reports.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
