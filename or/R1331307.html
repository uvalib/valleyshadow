<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Lee's aide-de-camp Charles Marshall writes General J. E. B. Stuart in April,
                    1864, to warn him of a suspected Union raid on either Staunton or the Virginia
                    and Tennessee Railroad.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. E. B. STUART,<br> Cmdg. Cavalry Corps:</p>
<p></p>
<p>April 23, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>The commanding general directs me to inform you that, in view of the reports of
                    your scouts and those of Gen. Imboden, he is disposed to believe that Averell
                    contemplates making another expedition, either to Staunton or the Virginia and
                    Tennessee Railroad, simultaneously with the general movement of the Federal
                    army. The reduction of the enemy's force on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, in
                    the lower valley, has induced the general to direct Gen. Imboden, if he finds it
                    practicable, to endeavor to anticipate the movement of Averell and disconcert
                    his plans by a demonstration against the railroad and the force guarding it in
                    Martinsburg and the lower valley. Should Gen. Imboden attempt this, Gen. Lee
                    thinks that his end might be promoted by the co-operation of Col. Mosby, and he
                    directs that you will notify the latter to communicate with Gen. Imboden and, if
                    possible, arrange some plan for a combined movement. Great care should be taken
                    to prevent your letter to Mosby from falling into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>CHARLES MARSHALL,<br> Lieut.-Col. and Aide-de-Camp.</p>
