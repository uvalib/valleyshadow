<p>Brig. Gen. W. E. JONES,<br> Cmdg. Valley District:</p>
<p></p>
<p>May 23, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have heard of your safe arrival in Staunton with your brigade.</p>
<p>I am much gratified with the success of your expedition, and especially that you
                    have accomplished so much with so little loss to your command.</p>
<p>In a letter of may 20, I gave directions as to the disposal of the beef-cattle,
                    horses, &amp;c., which you brought back with you.</p>
<p>I desire you to join Gen. Stuart, by easy marches, as soon as you can, giving
                    your men and horses proper rest and refreshment.</p>
<p>Gen. Jenkins will relieve your cavalry pickets in the Valley, so as to leave your
                    whole cavalry brigade free to move.</p>
<p>Gen. Stuart's headquarters are for the present at Culpeper Court-House.</p>
<p>Bring with you your transportation and equipment for service in the field for the
                    summer's campaign on this side of the mountains, and pay particular attention to
                    the thorough organization of your command.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
