<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General David Hunter writes from occupied Staunton to reassign General
                    Julius Stahel who received a wound at the June, 1864, Battle of Piedmont.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff, U. S. Army,
                        Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>June 9, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inform you that in consequence of a wound received while
                    gallantly leading his division, in the recent battle of the 5th instant, at
                    Piedmont, I have relieved Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel from service with forces in
                    the field, and have ordered him to Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry for the
                    purpose of collecting and organizing all troops that can be spared from the
                    defense of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and returning to this army in charge
                    of the important train about which I have had the honor to telegraph to you in
                    cipher. I beg that if you can aid Gen. Stahel to collect the detachments
                    belonging to this command from the Dismounted Camp, in Pleasant Valley, Md., you
                    will do so; and that you will be kind enough to forward his views under the
                    instructions he has received. It is but justice to Maj.-Gen. Stahel to state
                    that in the recent engagement he displayed excellent qualities of coolness and
                    gallantry, and that for the final happy result the country is much indebted to
                    his services. I part with Gen. Stahel with regret, and trust most respectfully
                    that there will be no delay in forwarding the train with which, and the troops
                    collected at Martinsburg, Harper's Ferry, from the Kanawha and Pleasant Valley
                    (if possible), he is to return.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient
                        servant.</p>
<p>D. HUNTER,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
