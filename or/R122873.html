<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Throughout the war, Staunton, VA, served as an important Confederate base of
                    supply. In this May, 1861, letter, General Robert Garnett writes Colonel John
                    McCausland concerning his request for harnesses. Garnett orders McCausland to
                    contact Michael G. Harman, quartermaster at Staunton, to fill his order for
                    supplies.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Lieut. Col. JOHN McCAUSLAND, Buffalo, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 24, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Your requisition for harness for a battery of artillery and for ammunition has
                    been received. The Ordnance Department has been instructed, as far as
                    practicable, to supply the ammunition, and to send it to the care of Maj. M.G.
                    Harman, at Staunton, who has been instructed to adopt the safest and most
                    expeditious means of sending it to you. You will confer with him by letter as to
                    the best means of doing this. It is believed that suitable harness can be made
                    or purchased, you are authorized to direct the quartermaster to buy it for you.
                    There is none to be had here immediately. You will report what can be done in
                    this respect. Send a copy of this communication to Col. Tompkins, commanding,
                    &amp;c.</p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R.S. GARNETT,<br> Adjutant-Gen.</p>
