<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General John Echols writes from Staunton to Robert E. Lee in May,

<p>Maj. Gen. R. W. LEE,<br> Commander-in-Chief,
                        &amp;c.:</p>
<p>STAUNTON,</p>
<p>May 16, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>Under your order of 6th instant, directing me to call out and muster into the
                    service of the State two regiments of volunteers, I proceeded immediately to
                    call upon the companies of the nine counties named in said order, and was
                    expecting soon to muster in the specified force. I have, however, been informed
                    to-day by Maj. Harman, of the quartermaster's department, that under directions
                    or advice from Richmond, he had directed the force from two or three of these
                    counties to be sent to the northwest. This will prevent me for some time,
                    probably, from raising as large a force as two regiments, but I shall endeavor
                    to raise as many as possible. I have here now two rifle companies and an
                    infantry company, which I will send on to Harper's Ferry as soon as they can
                    possibly be equipped, which will be in two or three days. There are also two
                    cavalry companies here, called out a day or two before I reached here by Maj.
                    Harman, who intended them for the northwest. I shall, however, in compliance
                    with your order of the 15th instant, this evening received, send at least one of
                    the companies to Harper's Ferry. The infantry and rifle companies I shall,
                    unless otherwise directed by you, arm with the flint-lock muskets now here.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JNO. ECHOLS,<br> Lieut.-Col. of Volunteers.</p>
