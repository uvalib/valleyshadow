<p> Gen. RICKETTS, Commanding Second Division. </p>
<p></p>
<p>August 14, 1862</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that this brigade took up the line of march for the
                    scene of action at Slaughter Mountain on the evening of the 9th instant at 4
                    o'clock p.m., arriving on the field about 7 o'clock. When within about 1,000
                    yards of the enemy he opened upon the column from a battery within a wood with
                    solid shot and shell, causing a panic among the wagon and ambulance drivers, who
                    turned their horses and fled toward the rear. The troops, however, remained
                    firm, conducting themselves admirably.</p>
<p>The shot at this point passed over us, doing little damage. We continued our
                    march along the road until we arrived within 500 yards of the enemy, filing to
                    the right into a corn field. The enemy then poured in a volley, which killed a
                    captain of the Twelfth Massachusetts, who was in close proximity, and wounded 8
                    or 10 of my command.</p>
<p>We progressed in our march under fire until we obtained a supporting position to
                    Thompson's and Hall's batteries. These batteries soon after opened a terrific
                    and deadly fire, which closed the conflict for the day. The enemy then took up
                    his line of retreat.</p>
<p>The list of casualties in this command has already been reported.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. DURYEA, <br> Brig.-Gen. </p>
