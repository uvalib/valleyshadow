<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch writes to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in June,
                    1863, concerning the impending invasion of the state by Robert E. Lee's Army of
                    Northern Virginia. Couch discusses rumors, the rescue of a threatened wagon
                    train in the Chambersburg area, and also mentions that African American troops
                    have applied to participate in state defense. Couch turned them down due to
                    apprehensions over the reaction of the general public.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. Stanton,<br> Secretary of War, Washington, D.
                        C.:</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>June 16, 1863</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have endeavored to keep you advised of all that was reliable in reference to
                    the enemy. The country is so wild with rumors that I was compelled to use great
                    caution in communicating with you. A deserter, a Northern Irishman, states that
                    Stuart had orders read to his command, which they called 20,000, that he would
                    reach Philadelphia before their return. I have made every exertion to protect
                    the bridges across the Susquehanna, but they are to be fired, if it becomes
                    necessary. Had the people responded to my first call as they should have done, I
                    would now be in a situation to march up the Valley. I think we have succeeded in
                    running off most of the horses. I am of the opinion that the squads of cavalry
                    thrown out around Chambersburg saved Milroy's train, very few wagons being lost.
                    Applications have been made of colored troops for State defense. I judged that
                    it would be bitterly opposed, and have, therefore, merely stated that I had no
                    authority for accepting them.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, yours,</p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
