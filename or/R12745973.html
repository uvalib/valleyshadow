<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General D. H. Hill writes Secretary of War James Seddon concerning
                    the location of Union troops following the battle of Gettysburg. Hill fears a

<p>Hon. James A. Seddon,<br> Secretary of War, C. S. A.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 5, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sent up a courier this morning to get all the information he could from the
                    front. He says that a considerable battle was fought on the North Anna--musketry
                    and artillery; on the South Anna a mere skirmish with cavalry; Yankees repulsed
                    at both places. At the latter, however, they surprised and captured a dozen of
                    our men. About 100 came to Ashland, and recrossed at Littlepage's, burning the
                    bridge.</p>
<p>The trouble here seems to be in the want of a thoroughly organized system of
                    scouts; those employed are not old soldiers, and are very timid.</p>
<p>I am troubled about the news from North Carolina. There was force enough at
                    Magnolia to have whipped the cavalry, but, as they have broken through, they may
                    go on and destroy the Fayetteville arsenal.</p>
<p>I wished to fortify Fayetteville some time ago, and urged the Governor to guard
                    it with militia. If the Yankees would go up and catch the Legislature, they
                    would do the State an infinite service.</p>
<p>Where have the Yankees gone? The design on Richmond was not a feint but a faint.
                    I fear that they may go up to Gordonsville and Staunton, and down the Valley,
                    doing much mischief. It may be, however, that they will march direct for
                    Washington, via Aquia Creek; if so, some of our force ought to go up to Lee, who
                    is, doubtless, hard pressed.</p>
<p>In spite of their boast of numbers, I doubt whether the Yankee force has ever
                    exceeded ours. It is mortifying to have them play around us as they have done;
                    but with our imperfect information and defective system of scouting, I know not
                    how it is to be stopped, especially as the Yankees have control of the water.</p>
<p>Could you learn by telegraphing to Gordonsville, via Staunton, what is known of
                    the direction of the Yankees? I presume they hear from Stuart's men at
                    Gordonsville.</p>
<p>I would suggest that Colquitt be placed on the Meadow Bridge road, where he could
                    relieve the clerks, &amp;c.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. H. HILL,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
