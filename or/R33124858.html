<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union war Department Assistant Adjutant Thomas Vincent writes in October, 1863,
                    to General Darius Couch, commanding the Department of the Susquehanna at
                    Chambersburg, concerning mustering out of six months men. Vincent authorizes
                    Couch to establish a muster-out rendezvous at Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. COUCH,<br> Comdg. Department, Chambersburg,
                        Pa.:</p>
<p>Washington,</p>
<p>October 1, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Secretary of War directs that all six-months' troops within your department,
                    except those at Scranton, be immediately mustered out and discharged the
                    service. Harrisburg and Philadelphia are fixed as rendezvous for muster-out; but
                    should the localities where troops are from make it more proper to muster-out
                    the troops now near Chambersburg and Pottsville at these places, respectively,
                    order it, and all others to Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Inform Capt. Dodge,
                    chief mustering officer at Harrisburg, and Capt. Lane, at Philadelphia, of the
                    arrangements made by you. If troops are mustered out at Chambersburg and
                    Pottsville it will hasten matters for you to appoint mustering-out officers at
                    these places.</p>
<p>Paymasters at Philadelphia and Harrisburg will be ready to act on information
                    received through the chief mustering officers at those places. It is directed
                    that the troops in question may be mustered out and paid off within forty-eight
                    hours. Clothing issued to them will not be charged on muster-out rolls.
                    Acknowledge this and report all you do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>THOMAS M. VINCENT,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
