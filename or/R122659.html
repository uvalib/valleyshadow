<p>HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>Maj. Gen. W. H. KEIM,<br> Commanding U. S. Forces,
                        Chambersburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>Philadelphia, </p>
<p>May 29, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>The commanding general instructs me to give you in his name the following
                    information and directions:</p>
<p>A movement, as soon as the force is prepared, will be made to Hagerstown, for the
                    purpose of establishing beyond an encampment as the base of future operations.
                    You are relied upon to organize and hold ready for instant movement those
                    regiments which are prepared to move and face an enemy, and now gathering at
                    Chambersburg, in the following manner:</p>
<p>1. A column of cavalry and three regiments of well-drilled infantry, to march
                    from Chambersburg to Hagerstown. This column to be under the command of Col.
                    George H. Thomas, Second Cavalry, U. S. Army.</p>
<p>2. A second column, to be commanded by Brig.-Gen. Williams, to follow next day on
                    foot, or by rail, if circumstances demand.</p>
<p>3. A third brigade, to go by rail, and to land in Hagerstown just after arrival
                    of Col. Thomas' brigade. If the second brigade goes by rail, the third, wholly
                    or in part, will be pushed to Hagerstown as rapidly as transportation will
                    permit.</p>
<p>4. A fourth brigade, composed of the other regiments, will be pushed by regiment
                    to Hagerstown as soon as prepared and transportation (rail) can be procured.</p>
<p>Col. Thomas, with his cavalry from Carlisle, will arrive at Chambersburg on
                    Friday. Direct the regimental commanders to report at once.</p>
<p>Wagon transportation is being prepared at Harrisburg and will be pushed to
                    Chambersburg, and the train organized by A. R. Eddy, assistant quartermaster.
                    Capt. Eddy will have charge of the quartermaster's department at Chambersburg,
                    and transfer the depot to Hagerstown as the forces are located.</p>
<p>Capt. B. Du Barry, Subsistence Department, at Harrisburg, will provide for your
                    present depot, and you are desired to see that each regiment has when it moves
                    at least three days' provisions.</p>
<p>The commanding general wishes you to require commanders to keep their officers
                    and men in camp and out of the towns, and always ready to turn out.</p>
<p>The commanding general, with his staff, will join you in a few days, till which
                    no movement to the front will be made unless circumstances should imperatively
                    demand, which you will telegraph. He hopes on his arrival to find, through your
                    energy and judgment, aided by the active efforts of every officer of your
                    command, the different commands organized and prepared to move at a moment's
                    notice on arrival of accouterments, and, if necessary, before their arrival.</p>
<p>Capt. John Newton, Engineers, will soon join you. He goes with special
                    instructions relating to reconnoitering the ground in advance of Hagerstown. He
                    and Capt. Eddy have the confidence of the commanding general, and on this
                    account are sent to you.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
