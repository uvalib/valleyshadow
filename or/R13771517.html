<p>Gen. KELLEY:</p>
<p>HANCOCK,</p>
<p>July 30, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rebels crossed at McCoy's Ferry yesterday. They made directly north; they
                    were in Mercersburg last evening at 6 o'clock. They then went to Loudon,
                    twenty-five miles north of here, and cut the telegraph about 8 o'clock last
                    evening. No news from them since. Number not known; report to be some force. It
                    is the general opinion that they are making for Chambersburg. This news is
                    brought by Jonathan Hees, from Pott's Mills, twelve miles north of here.</p>
<p></p>
