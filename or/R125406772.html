<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In March, 1863, Confederate general John Imboden planned a raid to destroy the
                    Cheat River Bridge. In this letter, Confederate General Samuel Jones writes
                    General William E. Jones concerning plans for the operation. Samuel Jones
                    mentions sending engineers to report at Staunton to participate in the raid.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. W. E. JONES,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Edenburg, Va.:</p>
<p>Dublin,</p>
<p>March 19, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Lieut. Thomas Dolan handed to me to-day your letter of the 16th instant. Lieut.
                    Hart, of the Engineers, will report at Staunton on the 23d instant with 8 or 10
                    men and the necessary tools and materials; but, as at present advised, I shall
                    direct him to report to Gen. Imboden, who informs me that he has on foot an
                    expedition embracing Capt. McNeill's, but there seems to be some misapprehension
                    between you and Capt. McNeill and Imboden. The latter expects you to do
                    something more than you indicate, and he does not expect to start as soon as you
                    say McNeill will be ready to start. I advise by all means that you communicate
                    with Imboden before the expedition starts, otherwise there may be some
                    unfortunate confusion, causing failure.</p>
<p>I do not understand Imboden's position exactly. Is he under you, or does he
                    receive orders directly from Gen. Lee or the War Department? I will write to
                    Imboden by Lieut. Dolan.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>SAM. JONES,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
