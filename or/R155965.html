<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Adjutant General Samuel Cooper writes General William Loring in
                    November, 1861, concerning the defense of the Shenandoah Valley, and the
                    movement of troops from Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Brig. Gen. W. W. LORING,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c.,
                        Huntersville, Va.:</p>
<p>RICHMOND,</p>
<p>November 20, 1861.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have received your telegram of the 19th instant, and, referring to you letter
                    of the 9th, I have to inform you that Special Orders, No 222, was not intended
                    to control your discretion in retaining such amount of force as you might find
                    necessary for defensive purposes, &amp;c., but only to make provision for
                    such regiments as you might send from you command to Staunton. It is hoped you
                    may yet be enabled to spare some troops from your command after making all your
                    arrangements; but of this you must judge for yourself. Troops are much wanted
                    both at Manassas and in the Valley District, commanded by Maj.-Gen. Jackson; but
                    other points must be looked to as well.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>S. COOPER,<br> Adjutant and Inspector Gen.</p>
