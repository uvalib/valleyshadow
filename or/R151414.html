<p>Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>CONGRESS HALL,</p>
<p>December 18, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I beg leave respectfully to ask your attention to the inclosed letter from Adam
                    Stephenson, esq., a leading citizen of Monterey, remonstrating against the
                    withdrawal of our little force on the top of the Allegheny. Had this little but
                    most gallant army been crushed by the late advance of the enemy upon our lines
                    in seemingly overwhelming numbers, there would have been no obstacle to an
                    onward march to Staunton, in the very heart of the Valley of Virginia. I trust
                    there is no foundation for the rumor which has so much agitated the population
                    of that part of the valley, that it is the purpose of the Government to deprive
                    them of all protection.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH.</p>
