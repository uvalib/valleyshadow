<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In November, 1862, while Army of the Potomac Commander Ambrose Burnside planned a
                    movement on Fredericksburg, General Thomas J. Jackson's Confederates operated in
                    the Shenandoah Valley. In this letter, Robert E. Lee writes Jackson concerning
                    the strategic situation in the Valley and Virginia. He states that loss of the
                    Valley and its supplies would be a severe blow. He also mentions a telegram from
                    Staunton concerning Federal troop strengths in the area.</p>

<p>Lieut. Gen. THOMAS J. JACKSON,<br> Cmdg. Corps:</p>
<p></p>
<p>November 12, 1862</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 10th, by special courier, has been received. In my letter of
                    yesterday, in reply to yours of first date, I discussed the question of your
                    further delay in the valley. I cannot add more to what has been said, and it
                    must depend upon the advantages you can effect by operating against the
                    communications of the enemy. He has as yet given no indications of his further
                    movement or direction southward. Whether he will cross the Rapahannock or
                    proceed to Fredericksburg I cannot tell. It is easier for you to determine what
                    damage you can inflict upon him where you are. If you can accomplish nothing but
                    to retain occupation of the valley, in the apparent and probable need of all our
                    forces southward, the force under you is too far from the scene of action. If an
                    advance toward Fredericksburg is discovered, it is plain that you cannot delay
                    longer, and you must be prepared to move at any time. Make your arrangements
                    accordingly, and be prepared to move at any moment. Gen. Stuart has been
                    directed to watch the enemy closely, but you know the difficulty of determining
                    the first movements. You may learn more from the rear than we can in front. It
                    would be grievous for the valley and its supplies to fall into the hands of the
                    enemy unnecessarily, but we can only act upon probabilities and endeavor to
                    avoid greater evils.</p>
<p>Col. Davidson, at Staunton, telegraphs that the enemy is within 35 miles of that
                    place--one column at McDowell and one at Rawley Springs; the two columns
                    estimated at from 4,000 to 6,000 men. He asks for re-enforcement. I have none to
                    send him. Have you a disposable force? The Marylanders, if unable to remain at
                    Winchester, might be stationed there.</p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
