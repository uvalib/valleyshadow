<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate superintendent of the Virginia Central Railroad, H. D. Whitcomb,
                    writes Secretary of War James Seddon in June, 1864, concerning efforts to
                    rebuild the road after a Union raid. Whitcomb mentions repairs needed in the
                    Staunton area, and the possibility of supplying Richmond with grain once the
                    road reopens.</p>

<p>Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>June 28, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>This road will be opened to within four miles of Staunton on Thursday. Permit me
                    to urge upon you the importance of protecting us at Hanover Court-House. That is
                    really the only point east of Gordonsville where a small raiding party can
                    injure us materially by destroying the trestles and the bridge over south Anna,
                    four miles beyond. Our road is not so important as it has been, but we hope to
                    bring to the city a considerable amount of wheat and other supplies. We have now
                    repaired about nine miles of burned track, besides the bridges. We cannot hope,
                    with the materials we have on hand or likely to get, to survive a similar
                    disaster. We have yet about eight miles of track to repair at and west of
                    Staunton, and ten bridges to rebuild. We do not propose to repair west of
                    Staunton at present. I have requested the editors of the city papers not to
                    notice the re-opening of the road.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>H. D. WHITCOMB,<br> Gen. Superintendent.</p>
