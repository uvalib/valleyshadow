<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate quartermaster H. M. Bell writes General John C. Breckinridge,
                    commanding at Staunton, concerning General Lee's May, 1864, request for corn.
                    Lee asks Bell to borrow corn from citizens in the Lynchburg, Staunton, and
                    Charlottesville areas. If the citizens refuse to part with the corn, Lee
                    authorizes Bell to impress it. Bell also reports that he will send much of
                    Breckinridge's supplies to Lee, as Breckinridge can subsist his horses on the
                    good grass in the Staunton area.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>May 15, 1864.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have just received the following dispatch:<br> GORDONSVILLE, May 15,
                    1864.<br> Maj. H. M. BELL:</p>
<p>I have dispatch from Gen. Lee, dated 12 o'clock last night, in which he says:
                    "Borrow all the corn you can from citizens and send me at once If persons
                    holding corn will not let you have it, impress it. I presume an impressment will
                    not be necessary when the magnitude of the stake is thought of. Answer me at
                    once what you can do." He wants an answer from Lynchburg, Staunton, and
                    Charlottesville. He also wants every artillery horse that can be had. Send by
                    passenger train anything you can get.<br> W. B. RICHARDS,<br> Maj. and
                    Quartermaster.</p>
<p>I am arranging to send to every part of the country to get corn from the
                    citizens, but as the emergency is great and pressing, I will ship from the corn
                    here belonging to your command all that I can get off by mail train in the
                    morning--say from 600 to 1,000 bushels. As you are in a good grass country, I
                    hope you will be able to subsist without much grain, but I will, if you cannot
                    spare this corn, replace what I take from the corn I hope to borrow from
                    citizens. If you can spare it, I will send all I can get from citizens besides.
                    My forage master reports that there is in my forage house about 1,000 bags of
                    corn belonging to Maj.'s Green and McKendree. Will you please consult with these
                    officers and advise me how much of this corn I can send to Gen. Lee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. M. BELL,<br> Maj. and Quartermaster.</p>
