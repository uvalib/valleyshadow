                <p>In this May, 1862, letter, General Nathaniel P. Banks discusses movements in the

                    <salute>MY DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Your dispatch announcing that you were ordered to join McDowell was received a
                    day or two since and the letter relating to the bands of rebels infesting the
                    line of railway last evening.</p>
                <p>I regret very much indeed that you are to be separated from us more than I ought
                    to express in an official letter. I regret it because I feel that the policy of
                    which this order is a part is to end in allowing the grand army of the rebels to
                    escape unharmed from Virginia and to add another year to the war. But results
                    are not for us to consider and orders are received to be obeyed.</p>
                <p>We are to fall back to Strasburg. Gen. Shields has received orders similar to
                    your own. There are not less than 17,000 men left in the vicinity of the valley
                    in Jackson's and Ewell's command, and any small force left in the valley will of
                    course receive their attention.</p>
                <p>We were within a few miles of Staunton when ordered to halt. I only wish that
                    with my whole force I could have held that place and co-operated with Fremont,
                    who was then coming down from the mountains. The valley would have been cleared
                    of the enemy from the Manassas Gap Railway to the Virginia Central between
                    Staunton and Gordonsville. But that is not in the line of our orders.</p>
                <p>I wish, colonel, you would, before you leave for McDowell's position, send us the
                    artillery that belongs to Gen. Williams' division. It came from Abercrombie and
                    was left with your command while on its way here. We are very short of
                    artillery. Half our guns are 6-pounder smooth-bores.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to anticipate what work lies before us, and I feel the
                    imperative necessity of making preparations for the worst.</p>
                <p>I congratulate you on your most deserved promotion, and regret only that your
                    brigade is not to join us again. Our connection has been long and to me most
                    pleasant, and I shall be glad at all times to acknowledge the efficiency,
                    alacrity, and unsurpassed energy and ability with which you have discharged all
                    your duties.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,</salute>
                    <signed>N. P. BANKS,<lb/> Maj.-Gen.</signed>
