<p>Capt. FULTON, Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen. </p>
<p></p>
<p>July 23, 1861</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have the honor to report that at dawn on the morning of the 9th instant we left
                    camp near the Rapidan River and marched a distance of 7 miles. Engaged the enemy
                    about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The line of battle being formed in a woods,
                    with the Thirty-third Regiment resting on our right and the Second on our left,
                    the Fifth being the center regiment of the brigade, we then advanced in line of
                    battle through the woods a distance of about 400 yards to the edge of a field,
                    where we were ordered to halt and throw down a line of fencing immediately in
                    our front. After removing the fence we were ordered to prepare to</p>
<p>charge, which was done, and we moved forward in line of battle of the top of
                    little hill or rise in the field, when the order was given by our gallant
                    commander (Col. Ronald) to the brigade to charge, which was obeyed and the
                    charge executed in most elegant style, driving the enemy entirely from the field
                    into the woods, a distance of some 300 or 400 yards.</p>
<p>I then received an order to close my regiment at right angles with and on the
                    left of the Thirty-third. Thus having passed the Thirty-third and Twenty-seventh
                    some 200 yards, I succeeded in forming my right wing perpendicular with the
                    former line of battle and advanced it about 100 yards, thus giving me a good
                    position to fire upon the enemy, who were crossing a large wheat field upon the
                    enemy, thus causing a large number of them to surrender. The regiment also
                    captured three stand of the enemy's colors; the left wing still holding their
                    former position at the edge of the woods, thus protecting the left of my right
                    wing from a severe fire from the enemy in the woods.</p>
<p>The conduct of all officers and men was such as would attack the admiration and
                    win the praise of the greatest of champion warriors, and particularly the
                    conduct of Color Sergt. John M. Gabbert, who was in advance with a sword in one
                    hand the colors in the other, waving both the sword and colors, calling upon the
                    men to come on, when he received a wound in the shoulder and leg, which disabled
                    him so much he was compelled to abandon the field.</p>
<p>At a late hour we were re-enforced by two other brigades. We then advanced, the
                    left wing being rallied by Adjt. C.S. Army, whose conduct was highly commendable
                    in rallying it to the colors and pressing forward with the Second and Fourth
                    Regiments boldly in hot pursuit of the enemy till after dark, when, reaching the
                    top of a hill a corn field, were ordered to halt and remained until morning. I
                    joined in with Col. Lee, of the Thirty-third, and advanced, overtaking the
                    Second and Fourth, who had halted in a corn field on the brigade remained
                    overnight and until about 9 o'clock on the morning of the 10th, the enemy not
                    having made any demonstration up to that time. We were ordered back a distance
                    of about 3 miles and encamped until the morning of the 12th, when we were
                    ordered to take up the line of march to our old camp near Liberty Mills, at
                    which place we arrived about 6 p.m.</p>
<p>I forward with this a list of casualties. Very respectfully, your
                        obedient servant,</p>
<p> H.J. WILLIAMS,<br> Maj., Commanding Fifth Virginia Infantry. </p>
