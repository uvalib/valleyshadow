<p>Major</p>

<p>February 14, 1865.</p>
<p>MAJ</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of operations during the 5th,
                    6th, and 7th instant:</p>
<p>At 6.30 o'clock on the morning of the 5th of February my command moved, in
                    accordance with circular from corps headquarters, of the 4th instant, left in
                    front, in the following order: First, Two hundred and tenth Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, Col. William Sergeant commanding; second, Third Delaware Volunteers,
                    Maj. James E. Baily commanding; third, One hundred and ninety-first Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers, Capt. P. L. Norton, commanding; fourth, one hundred and ninetieth
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers, Capt. R. M. Birkman commanding; fifth, One hundred and
                    fifty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, Bvt. Maj. D. H. Kent commanding. The
                    route was along the Halifax road, my brigade being in the advance. The cavalry
                    being unable to overcome the opposition made by the enemy at Rowanty Creek, the
                    One hundred and ninetieth and One hundred and ninety-first Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers were advanced as skirmishers, supported by Fourth Delaware
                    Volunteers, and ordered to take the works beyond the creek. The other regiments
                    of brigade were also brought up. But few men could get across, as the bridge was
                    destroyed. These few, however, succeeded in dislodging the enemy and capturing a
                    few prisoners. After a short delay, to cover the crossing of remainder of
                    division, the brigade again advanced some three or four miles and took up
                    position before dark on the left of Second Brigade. The march was again resumed
                    at 11 o'clock, and continued until reaching the crossing of Vaughan road at
                    Harcher's Run, when the brigade was massed in reserve. During morning of the 6th
                    instant relieved Gen. Winthrop's brigade in the works. In the afternoon moved
                    right in front, following the Second Brigade to the right and in front of the
                    works occupied by the First Division. Then, forming in two lines, moved by the
                    right flank through the woods till the Second Brigade had gained position.*
                    While waiting the order to advance the left of brigade was broken by the
                    stampede of a portion of Gen. Gregg's cavalry, but was afterward rallied and
                    placed in position on left of Second Brigade. I advanced the brigade and engaged
                    the enemy for about two hours; not being supported on either my right or left
                    flank I returned to crest of hill in front of breast-work.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 7th instant, reoccupied the line of works on left of Second Division.</p>
<p>I herewith transmit nominal and tabular list of casualties during the engagement.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>JAMES GWYN, <br> Brevet Brig.-Gen., Cmdg. Brigade.</p>
