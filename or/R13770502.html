<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Benjamin F. Kelley writes General Franz Sigel to notify him of
                    General William Averell's May, 1864, victory over Confederates at Goshen, on the
                    General Railroad, twenty-one miles from Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. SIGEL, Cedar Creek:</p>
<p>CUMBERLAND,<br> (Via Martinsburg.)</p>
<p>May 20, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Fourth Virginia Infantry, or a portion of it (four companies being detached
                    in Lewis and Gilmer Counties), passed here last night en route for Martinsburg.
                    The lieutenant-colonel commanding represents that in consequence of their hard
                    service in the southwest, and being so reduced in numbers, only numbering now
                    about 300, the War Department ordered him back into West Virginia to assist in
                    guarding railroad. May I, therefore, ask you, if you can do so consistently, to
                    use this remnant of a regiment on your line at Winchester, or between there and
                    Martinsburg. They can then render the double service in protecting the Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad and your line of communication also. Col. Harris, at Beverly,
                    reports that his scouts started on the 14th to communicate with Gen. Crook; he
                    sent another on the 17th. Refugees, arrived at Beverly on the 17th from
                    Rockbridge County, report that Averell defeated Echols and Jackson on the 11th
                    at Goshen, on the General railroad, twenty-one miles southwest of Staunton. I
                    fear this is not reliable, as Echols confronted you at New Market on the 15th.</p>
