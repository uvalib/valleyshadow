<p>[Lieut. BUFFINGTON, Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.]</p>
<p></p>
<p>March 28, 1865.</p>
<p>LIEUT</p>
<p>In compliance with circular from headquarters Third Division, dated March 27,
                    1865, I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my
                    regiment in the action of the 25th instant:</p>
<p>About -- o'clock I was requested by an aide of Gen. Willcox to form my regiment
                    and move it to a point near the signal station, a short distance in rear of the
                    Dunn House Battery. I was then conducted by the same aide to the front and right
                    of the Dunn House Battery. I had scarcely got my regiment into position when the
                    same aide informed me that it was Gen. Hartranft's order that I should
                    immediately, with the Two hundredth Pennsylvania Volunteers, charge the hill in
                    my front, which was then held by the enemy. I at once gave the order to charge,
                    and the regiment moved forward, under a very heavy fire of musketry and
                    artillery, gaining a line of works running across the open field over which we
                    were advancing. Halting for a moment, we again advanced, gaining a ditch near
                    the hill occupied by the enemy. Here we were shelled from both front and rear.
                    It was here also that the gallant Lieut. Hugh Jones, commanding Company C, fell,
                    pierced through the heart by a musket-ball. We remained in the ditch for some
                    time, when, noticing the enemy retreating, we poured into them a murderous fire,
                    which was continued until I saw the Two hundredth Pennsylvania Volunteers, which
                    was on my left, preparing, as I supposed, to move forward. I immediately ordered
                    my regiment forward, and forward we went, not an officer or man halting or
                    faltering until our advance line was gained and our colors planted on the works,
                    and I am satisfied that they were the first colors planted on the works.</p>
<p>My officers and men all did their duty so well that it would seem invidious to
                    make any distinction; yet I feel it my duty to make honorable mention of
                    Sergeants Stiles and Humphreys, color bearers, who were always to be seen in
                    advance.</p>
<p>A considerable number of prisoners were sent to the rear, estimated at 350.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>G. W. FREDERICK,<br> Lieut.-Col., Cmdg. Regt. </p>
