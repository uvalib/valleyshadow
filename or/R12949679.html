<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Samuel Jones reports to Robert E. Lee regarding August, 1863, movements
                    and fighting in western Virginia. He reports that General Wharton's brigade was
                    3 miles from Staunton on the way to Warm Springs. Jones also reports repulsing a
                    Union force under William Averell.</p>

<p>Gen. R. E. LEE,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c., Orange
                        Court-House:</p>
<p>WARM SPRINGS,</p>
<p>August 30, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The enemy that fought us on the 26th and 27th retreated very rapidly by
                    Huntersville, and passed Greenbrier Bridge at Marling's Bottom early yesterday
                    morning. My cavalry pursued them to that point, and a small force still
                    following them. A part of Col. Wharton's brigade arrived here yesterday.
                    Jenkins' cavalry was about 3 miles west of Staunton last evening, coming on to
                    this place. From what I hear of Imboden, he was probably at Monterey last night,
                    with the intention of moving on to Huntersville. I fear he cannot reach there in
                    time to intercept the retreating enemy. They have been severely punished, and
                    when they reach Beverly will not, I think, be fit for service for several weeks.
                    A captain of artillery whom I have prisoner says they started from Moorefield
                    with between 4,000 and 5,000, Gen. Averell commanding. Is that the force
                    referred to by you in your dispatch of the 26th instant?</p>
<p></p>
