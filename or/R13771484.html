<p>Capt. P. G. BIER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>Hagerstown, Md.,</p>
<p>July 28, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.:</p>
<p>All is quiet from Hancock to Shepherdstown. Some picket-firing has occurred
                    across the river at several points. The enemy lost some prisoners yesterday in
                    an attempt to cross the river at Little Georgetown. The enemy are reported
                    encamped as follows: Johnson's cavalry brigade, near Hedgesville; McCausland's
                    cavalry brigade, near McCoy's Ferry; Vaughn with some infantry, Falling Waters;
                    Imboden, at Shepherdstown; Early, with 20,000 infantry (about) is camped near
                    Martinsburg, thrashing grain and destroying the railroad. His wagons came with
                    him from Winchester. These wagons, loaded with supplies, have joined him from
                    Staunton. Small squads continually join him from Richmond. Persons state that
                    they heard Hill was moving some days ago.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
