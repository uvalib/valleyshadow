                    hostilities; (7) George William White, to be sent to provost-marshal at Staunton

                    furnished transportation to Chrtistiansburg, Va.; (9) Aaron Bennett, to be sent

                    reside without injury to our cause; (10) Thomas Raleigh, to be discharged as a
                    British subject on parole of good conduct; (11) George Miller, to be held as a
