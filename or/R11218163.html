<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this May 10, 1862, letter, Union General Robert Schenck reports on the
                    movements of Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson in the Valley. He mentions a
                    scouting party sent to Staunton, and the reports they brought back of Jackson's
                    and Johnson's combined force, augmented by troops arriving by train in
                Staunton.</p>

<p>Col. ALBERT TRACY,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>CAMP MILROY, Franklin,</p>
<p>May 10, 1862.<br> (Received 10.45 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have certain information that the rebels have a strong picket advanced to
                    within 9 miles of my camp on the road from Monterey, and near the place where we
                    encamped last night. More than 100 infantry were seen there by a reliable
                    scouting party an noon to-day, and there might be, they said, many more. Three
                    of Gen. Milroy's best scouts, who were sent in the direction of Staunton last
                    Monday, have just returned. They ascertained that Jackson's and Johnson's united
                    forces amounted to 14,000, and were being re-enforced three days ago by troops
                    arriving in trains at Staunton; they know of three long trains full. We have
                    some apprehensions that an attempt may be made to send a force around between
                    you and us. It will be best, I think, if you can get forward your additional
                    force and Blenker's division as fast as possible.</p>
