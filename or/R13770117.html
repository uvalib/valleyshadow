<p>ACTG. ASST. ADJT. Gen., FIRST BRIGADE, FIRST
                        DIVISION.</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>June 7, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th instant the Eighteenth Regiment Connecticut Volunteers
                    was formed on the right of Gen. Hunter's line of battle, and immediately began
                    to feel of the enemy with a strong line of skirmishers. Advancing over the open
                    field, we drove the rebels into the woods on the crest of the hill in front.
                    Here, the Eighteenth Regt. Connecticut Volunteers on the extreme right, and the
                    Fifth New York Heavy Artillery on our left, we dressed our line of battle under
                    cover of the rising ground, to charge. Advancing with a yell, we drove the enemy
                    from the woods to their breast-works of rail pens in the rear. In the charge we
                    lost our adjutant, E. B. Culver, and about a dozen men. Here the soldiers fought
                    desperately and at some disadvantage, being entirely in the open field. Seeing
                    an excellent opportunity to use cannon I dispatched an orderly with a request
                    for two howitzers, which came promptly and did excellent service, in knocking
                    the rail pens in splinters amid great slaughter. All of this time my soldiers
                    were fighting obstinately and effectively, and many were falling under the hot
                    fire. At noon my horse was killed under me. In the afternoon when I received
                    orders from you that Col. Thoburn's forces were flanking the enemy we, together
                    with the other regiments of your line, made the final charge on the
                    fortifications, capturing a large number of prisoners, and putting the others to
                    rout.</p>
<p>Our losses, as you will see by inclosed list, are 120 men and 2 officers. Our
                    colors were riddled by three cannon shot and thirteen bullets, and all of the
                    color guard but one killed or wounded.</p>
<p>All of the officers and men behaved most gallantly, obeying orders with alacrity
                    even in the hottest of the fight.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. G. ELY,<br> Col., Cmdg. Eighteenth Connecticut Volunteers.</p>
