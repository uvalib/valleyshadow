                <p>The rebel cavalry under Stuart, which left Chambersburg yesterday morning in the
                    direction of Gettysburg, reached the Potomac, near the mouth of the Monocacy, at
                    about 9 a. m. to-day, having marched about 100 miles in twenty-four hours. Gen.
                    Stoneman, who was at Poolesville, near where the rebels passed, was ordered by
                    telegraph, at 1 o'clock p. m. yesterday, to keep his cavalry well out on all the
                    different approaches from the direction of Frederick, so as to give him time to
                    mass his forces to resist their crossing into Virginia. As you will see from the
                    dispatch of Gen. Pleasonton, just received and herewith transmitted, it does not
                    appear that he complied with this order. He will be called upon for an
                    explanation of this matter. It would seem that Pleasonton's forces, although
                    within but a short distance of Poolesville, received but little assistance from
                    Stoneman.</p>
                <p>HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION,<lb/> Camp near Mouth of Monocacy, October 12, [1862]-
                    1.30 p. m.<lb/> Gen. R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:</p>
                <p>This morning, after my dispatch of 1.30 my advance guard met Stuart, disguised in
                    our uniform, and, before they were recognized, a fire was opened, and, very soon
                    after, their guns began to play upon us. In consequence of the weakness of the
                    battery horses, they having marched 78 miles in the last twenty-four hours, they
                    could not move the pieces, and I had only two pieces that I could bring to bear
                    on the enemy.</p>
                <p>This continued for upward of an hour, when I succeeded in getting up my six guns
                    and soon silenced their battery. They retreated hastily and covered the ford, 3
                    miles below, with their guns on this side and some guns that were placed in
                    position for them on the other. I sent a regiment of cavalry and some infantry
                    down the towpath to intercept their crossing, and used every exertion to get my
                    guns to follow them, but horses could not pull up the hills, and I was obliged
                    to use men. This took time enough for the rebels to escape. There was no
                    artillery at this point, and, with the exception of a few infantry companies, I
                    had no assistance. I held Stuart in check for tho hours, but, for the reasons I
                    have assigned, it was necessary to have timely assistance to capture his party.
                    My men have behaved admirably.<lb/> A. PLEASONTON,<lb/> Brig.-Gen.</p>
                <p>Six regiments of my cavalry had been sent to Cumberland to prevent the rebel
                    depredations upon the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which left us very deficient
                    in cavalry here. As soon as Stuart's approach was known, however, one of these
                    regiments was ordered back, but has not yet arrived.</p>
