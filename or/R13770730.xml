                <p>In May, 1864, cadets from the Virginia Military Institute went to reinforce
                    Staunton against an expected Union attack. In this dispatch, Francis Smith,
                    director at the Institute, writes John C. Breckinridge to tell him how many
                    troops he can expect. Smith also itemizes the supplies and ammunition he is
                    sending to Staunton with the cadets.</p>

                <p>Your dispatch of yesterday by courier was received by me at 9 p. m. Immediately
                    gave orders to Lieut.-Col. Shipp, commanding Cadets, to have his battalion in
                    readiness to move this morning at 7 o'clock. They are now forming and will reach
                    Bell's, sixteen miles, to-day and be in Staunton to-morrow. I have issued to
                    them rations for two days, and will send with them 500 pounds of bacon and as
                    much beef as I can find transportation for. I have sixty-four barrels of flour
                    near Staunton. I send 100 bushels of corn for forage. The Cadets are armed with
                    Austrian rifles and take 40 rounds of ammunition. The section of artillery will
                    consist of 3-inch iron, rifled, and the ammunition chests of the limbers and
                    caissons will be filled. I have ten or twelve 6-pounder brass pieces here
                    mounted and one 12-pounder howitzer, if any should be needed. Horses have been
                    impressed for the artillery and transportation, but the horses are slow in
                    coming in. The artillery have orders to reach the infantry battalion to-night.</p>
                <p>I have ordered the four companies of reserves to rendezvous here. I will arm and
                    equip them, and hold them in readiness to move at a moment's notice. No
                    commanding officers have been appointed to this battalion. I will direct the
                    commander of the post of Lexington to supply rations, should they be called out.
                    Your dispatch finds me very unwell, but I shall hope to be with you to-morrow.
                    Lieut.-Col. Shipp has orders to report to you on reaching Staunton. If the
                    reserve companies are required to move to Staunton, I will have them in
                    readiness to move to-morrow, and shall get transportation for 6,000 pounds bacon
                    from the commissary of Confederate States here.</p>
