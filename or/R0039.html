<p></p>
<p>March 31, 1864</p>
<p>COL:</p>
<p>I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of the artillery
                    under my command in the battle of Chancellorsville:</p>
<p>The Napoleon guns of my battalion, except two of Tanner's battery, were sent very
                    early in the morning of Sunday, May 2 [3], under the command of Capt. [James
                    McD.] Carrington and Lieut. [Alexander H.] Fultz, commanding Staunton Artillery,
                    to the right of the road about half a mile, and were for the time under the
                    command of some other officer--Col. [T. H.] Carter, I think. Capt. [C.]
                    Thompson, commanding Louisiana Guard Artillery, with a section of rifled guns,
                    was placed near the road, under command of Maj. [D. G.] McIntosh. I was then
                    ordered to take all the Napoleon guns unoccupied, and such other guns as would
                    be of service, to a point farther down the road, and nearer to the enemy's
                    breastworks. This I did, and placed the guns in position so as to have a front
                    fire on their works and to enfilade the road. We immediately opened fire on the
                    enemy, and succeeded in materially assisting to dislodge him from his works.
                    During the action, a charge having been made on the works by the infantry, the
                    fire of the guns was directed upon a dense column of the enemy coming down the
                    road in front of the Chancellor house to re-enforce those who held their line of
                    works. Enfilading this column as we did, we very soon broke it and dispersed the
                    men. I afterward found out from prisoners that this was Meagher's brigade.</p>
<p>In the meantime the enemy succeeded in turning the flank of a portion of a
                    brigade of ours on the left of the road, and compelled it to fall back into the
                    road a short distance in front of our guns. From the manner in which our men
                    retired, I supposed that the enemy were close and would soon be in the road. I
                    therefore ordered such guns as were in the road to be loaded with canister, and
                    to fire at the word. As soon as the enemy appeared in the road, the order was
                    given to fire, and the enemy were driven back in confusion. The batteries were
                    then ordered forward to take position behind the works of the enemy, but before
                    the movement could be executed entirely, the enemy reoccupied them, and we were
                    compelled to retire to our former position.</p>
<p>Although very much exposed, the casualties were inconsiderable, owing to the wild
                    fire of the enemy, caused by the destructive fire of our guns on the right,
                    under Lieut.-Col. Carter.</p>
<p>After continuing in this position for two hours, hotly engaged, and occasionally
                    directing the fire of some of the guns on the enemy advancing through the woods
                    on our left, we were relieved by Maj. McIntosh; not, however, until the enemy
                    had been driven from the plateau in front of the Chancellor house.</p>
<p>The following batteries and portions of batteries were engaged, making in all
                    twelve guns under my command: From Col. Carter's battalion, Capt. [William P.]
                    Carter, commanding battery, Capt. [William J.] Reese, and Capt. [C. W.] Fry;
                    Capt. [W. A.] Tanner, with a section of Napoleon guns of my own battalion, and
                    Lieut. [O. B.] Taylor, commanding a section of guns from Eubank's battery,
                    Alexander's battalion.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to the officers and men for the coolness and gallantry they
                    displayed in this trying and exposed position.</p>
<p>I have to regret that I have not the material at hand for a fuller and more
                    accurate report.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>H. P. JONES,<br> Col. of Artillery. </p>
