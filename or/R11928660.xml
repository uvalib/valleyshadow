                <p>In October, 1862, in the aftermath of Antietam and Second Manassas, the
                    Confederates had many sick and wounded to bring to hospitals in Virginia. In
                    this letter, Lafayette Guild, Medical Director of the Army of Northern Virginia
                    writes to Confederate Surgeon General Dr. Samuel Moore concerning the problem.
                    Guild reports moving wounded from Winchester to Staunton.</p>

                    <salute>SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I inclose duplicate receipts of blank forms forwarded to me from your office in
                    care of Asst. Surg. J. H. Vaughan. We have experienced so much difficulty in
                    every branch of our department that I have upon day to day postponed reporting
                    to you, vainly hoping that I might be able to inform you fully and intelligently
                    of the condition of the medical department of the Army of Northern Virginia. The
                    reports of casualties are now slowly coming in, and I trust soon a complete
                    report can be furnished by me. As you are doubtless aware, many of our sick and
                    wounded have been paroled by the enemy's cavalry, an expedient resorted to by
                    them to get an equivalent for their men captured in battle. Our limited
                    transportation has compelled us to leave many wounded in exposed positions, and
                    they have fallen into the hands of the enemy. Hospitals in the rear have been
                    entered and patients paroled who were reported to be in articulo mortis.
                    However, I presume everything is fair in war. We are in great need of ambulance
                    wagons; could it be possible to furnish the army with about 50 more? While in
                    Maryland we were unable to procure medical supplies to any amount. I received
                    your communication relative to purchasing such articles as we need if
                    opportunity should offer, and will have your orders executed. Up to this time
                    but few reports of sick and wounded have been sent in, the surgeons being unable
                    to make them out, owing to the continued march to which the army has been
                    subjected since leaving Richmond, and their time being also much occupied in
                    caring for the wounded in the late battles. There are about 5,000 sick and
                    wounded still at Winchester, who are being removed to Staunton in ambulance
                    wagons that should be with the marching army. I am greatly obliged to you for
                    relieving me from the care and responsibility of hospitals left in the rear of
                    the army. I sincerely hope that Medical Director Williams, or some competent
                    under him, will be ordered to Winchester to superintend the removal of these
                    disabled soldiers, their position being an unsafe one in the event of a movement
                    of the army. If our army leaves here, they may be paroled by the enemy's
                    cavalry.</p>
