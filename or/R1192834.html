<p>Capt. B. F. FISHER,<br> Cmdg. Signal Detachment:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 10, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rebel Gen. Stuart, with about 3,000 cavalry and two batteries took
                    Chambersburg this afternoon, and is now trying to return to Virginia. By
                    daylight to-morrow you will have a party at Williamsport, to communicate with
                    Rowley; one on Washington Monument, to communicate with Spencer, at Hagerstown;
                    one on Catoctin Ridge, west of Frederick, commanding the valleys on both sides
                    for the ridge, and communicating with a point as near as is practicable to this
                    camp. Notify Point of Rocks of the facts. All are to look out and instantly
                    report any force of this nature trying to move across the Potomac Washington
                    Monument reporting to Hagerstown, Rowley reporting to Hagerstown and
                    Williamsport, and stations on Catoctin Ridge reporting near here. Carry out
                    these orders as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>Send a party to assist Rowley and ascertain whether he is taken prisoner, as is
                    possible, the enemy being reported as having crossed at the ford near Fairview.
                    Cox is at Hancock, with his division in railroad cars, and will move by rail the
                    instant he receives information. Officers will return after forty-eight hours,
                    ordered.</p>
<p>By order of Maj. A. J. Myer:</p>
<p>WM. S. STRYKER,<br> First Lieut. and Adjutant, signal Corps.</p>
