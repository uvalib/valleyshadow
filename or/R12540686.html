<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee writes General John Imboden on a planned spring, 1863,
                    expedition into West Virginia. Lee promises to send ammunition and supplies to
                    Staunton for Imboden's use.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Gen. J. D. IMBODEN,<br> Cmdg. Northwestern Brigade,
                        Shenandoah Mountain:</p>
<p>Fredericksburg,</p>
<p>March 26, 1863.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I am anxious to know how you progress in your preparations for your expedition
                    west of the Alleghany, the strength and composition of your forces, &amp;c.
                    The season is now at hand when it should be executed, and as soon as the roads
                    and mountain streams permit, it should move.</p>
<p>I have sent Col. Baldwin to Richmond to-day, to procure you the rifled pieces,
                    arms, ammunition, &amp;c., you require, and forward them immediately to
                    Staunton. I have written to Gen. W. E. Jones, when you are ready to move, to
                    threaten the enemy at Romney, New Creek, and Cumberland, and prevent their
                    forces moving west. Gen. Sam. Jones has been desired to attract the enemy in the
                    Kanawha from you, and urged to send you two regiments of his infantry to aid in
                    your movement against Beverly, &amp;c. If the different columns move with
                    precision and act rapidly and boldly, success appears certain.</p>
<p>If all is not accomplished that is desired, the bridges at Oakland and
                    Rowlesburg, which are of wood, can be destroyed, and cattle, horses, and men
                    obtained from that region, which is now closed to us.</p>
<p>Leave your feeble men and horses with your 6-pounders to guard the pass at your
                    camp, and keep your entire march a secret, even from your own men.</p>
<p>If there is anything more I can do to aid you, let me know, and inform me when
                    your preparations will be complete and when you expect to move.</p>
<p>I have suggested to Gen. Sam. Jones that his infantry might join you at Monterey
                    or such other point as you may designate. The enemy's attention in the Kanawha
                    Valley has already been drawn to the counties west of that river and toward
                    Northern Kentucky.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant.</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
