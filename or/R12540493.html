<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General B. S. Roberts writes W. H. Chesebrough to inform him of May, 1863,
                    action in the Valley. Roberts reports on a retreat by Jackson's men toward
                    Staunton. He suggests sending troops to Staunton to trap Jackson.</p>

<p>Col. W. H. CHESEBROUGH,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.,
                        Baltimore:</p>
<p>WESTON, VA.,</p>
<p>May 15, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imboden's and Jackson's forces are effecting their retreat by Summerville, toward
                    Staunton, with their artillery. Jones' forces are moving from Glenville toward
                    the Gauley. Are there no forces that can be thrown out to Staunton to cut them
                    off? I have re-occupied Buckhannon with cavalry, and am here with the infantry
                    of the Fourth and Gen. Kenly's brigades, waiting rations and transportation to
                    re-occupy Sutton, Birch, and Bulltown. I have only rations for to-day and
                    to-morrow, and it takes all the trains in the country to get rations to this
                    point as fast as they are consumed. Wagons cannot be half loaded, on account of
                    the bad condition of the roads.</p>
<p></p>
<p>B. S. ROBERTS.<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
