<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Franz Sigel reports to Generals Heintzelman and Burnside regarding
                    the November, 1862, situation in the Valley. He discusses interviewing a sick
                    man who had passed through Staunton and saw no Confederate troops between that
                    place and Winchester.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HEINTZELMAN and Maj.-Gen. BURNSIDE:</p>
<p>FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, VA.,</p>
<p>November 24, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. Sickles informs me that he will move his division to-morrow to Potomac
                    Creek, and that he will take with him all the detachments on the railroad
                    between Burke's Station and Bull Run Bridge, and at Bristoe and Occoquan. Be so
                    kind as to inform me whether some other troops will be sent in place of these
                    detachments, amounting to three regiments and two batteries. Our scouts were at
                    Leesburg and Aldie to-day. They found at Leesburg 16 rebel cavalry who came from
                    Mount Gilead. They also found a cavalry picket of the enemy at Aldie. Nothing of
                    the rebels could be seen by our scouts at Hopewell and Thoroughfare Gap. At
                    Brentsville they learned that 50 rebel cavalry had passed during the day. It is
                    reported from other sources that Stuart's cavalry, with some artillery, is still
                    near Warrenton, but that there were no troops in Warrenton yesterday. I examined
                    to-day a man who came from Mobile, by Montgomery, Knoxville, Staunton, and was
                    lying sick at Winchester for a fortnight. He saw no large bodies of troops
                    between Staunton and Winchester, nor were there any troops between Staunton and
                    Winchester, nor were there any troops at Winchester and Berryville. He says
                    there are no troops at Bunker Hill, but large pickets near Martinsburg. He
                    crossed at Snicker's Ferry yesterday. His reports are confirmed somewhat by
                    those of a teamster, who was met by my scout near Leesburg to-day. The teamster
                    says that he was pressed by the rebels to help Gen. Early's troops, moving from
                    Snicker's Gap to Paris, on Thursday and Friday last. Early's division was
                    stationed between Berryville and Snickersville, as I previously reported. From
                    all this, it seems that Mackall's [McLaws'] and Early's divisions have united at
                    Ashby's, and that, therefore, Jackson was expected at Salem on last Friday and
                    Saturday.</p>
