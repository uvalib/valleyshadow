                <p>Robert E. Lee issues orders in Chambersburg to his troops on the march in June,
                    1863, during the Army of Northern Virginia's invasion of Pennsylvania. In
                    general, Lee praises his men for their conduct, but reminds them that
                    depredations against unarmed men and private property will not be tolerated.</p>

                <p>The commanding general has observed with marked satisfaction the conduct of the
                    troops on the march, and confidently anticipates results commensurate with the
                    high spirit they have manifested.</p>
                <p>No troops could have displayed greater fortitude or better performed the arduous
                    marches of the past ten days.</p>
                <p>Their conduct in other respects has, with few exceptions, been in keeping with
                    their character as soldiers, and entitles them to approbation and praise.</p>
                <p>There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness, on the part of some, that
                    they have in keeping the yet unsullied reputation of the army, and that the
                    duties exacted of us by civilization and Christianity are not less obligatory in
                    the country of the enemy than in our own.</p>
                <p>The commanding general considers that no greater disgrace could befall the army,
                    and through it our whole people, than the perpetration of the barbarous outrages
                    upon the unarmed and defenseless and the wanton destruction of private property,
                    that have marked the course of the enemy in our own country.</p>
                <p>Such proceedings not only degrade the perpetrators and all connected with them,
                    but are subversive of the discipline and efficiency of the army, and destructive
                    of the ends of our present movement.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered that we make war only upon armed men, and that we cannot
                    take vengeance for the wrongs our people have suffered without lowering
                    ourselves in the eyes of all whose abhorrence has been excited by the atrocities
                    of our enemies, and offending against Him to whom vengeance belongeth, without
                    whose favor and support our efforts must all prove in vain.</p>
                <p>The commanding general therefore earnestly exhorts the troops to abstain with
                    most scrupulous care from unnecessary or wanton injury to private property, and
                    he enjoins upon all officers to arrest and bring to summary punishment all who
                    shall in any way offend against the orders on this subject.</p>
