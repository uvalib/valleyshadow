<p><b>Summary:<br></b>William T. Sherman replies to June, 1864, news of the capture of Staunton, which
                    he rates as one of the most militarily important towns in Virginia.</p>

<p>Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:</p>
<p> ACWORTH, GA.,</p>
<p>June 8, 1864--8 p. m.<br> (Received 10 a. m. 9th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Am rejoiced at Gen. Hunter's success on that line. Staunton, Charlottesville, and
                    Lynchburg are points of as much military importance as any in Virginia. I cannot
                    give an active command to Gen. Crittenden without displacing worthy incumbents,
                    who started on the campaign, and are fairly entitled to see it out. I already
                    have Gen.'s Schurz and Milroy on nominal duty, yet I wish Crittenden all honor
                    and success, and will bear his case in mind should the accidents of war create a
                    vacancy. Gen. Hovey, of Indiana, is very discontented that he has not been made
                    a major-general. He has tendered his resignation, and though I esteem him as a
                    man, I shall recommend the acceptance of his resignation. All well here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>W. T. SHERMAN,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
