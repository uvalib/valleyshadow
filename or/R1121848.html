<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this April, 1862, letter, Union officer B. R. Durfee informs Adjutant-General
                    Don Piatt of actions in Virginia. Durfee speculates that Confederate forces
                    retreated toward Staunton, and also discusses an incident on the Wardensville
                    Road, probably involving guerrillas.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,</p>
<p>DONN PIATT, Assistant Adjutant-Gen., Cumberland, Md.:</p>
<p> At Moorefield, Va.,</p>
<p>April 5, 1862.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>I am in receipt of intelligence partially reliable that the enemy have evacuated
                    Alleghany Summit, and are falling back on Staunton, with the intention of
                    crossing east of the Blue Ridge.</p>
<p>I yesterday sent out 40 cavalrymen and 20 mounted skirmishers, with Enfield
                    rifles, to look after the neighborhood of the affair of the day previous on the
                    Wardensville road. They returned to camp last evening, having found the
                    murderous wretches; failing to kill or take any of them prisoners; severely
                    wounding two of them; found some ammunition, and brought in one suspected
                    person, from whom we hope to get full knowledge of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I shall send a squad of cavalry to Romney to-day and open communication with the
                    forces in that direction.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>B. R. DURFEE,<br> Lieut.-Col., Commanding Forces at Moorefield, Va.</p>
