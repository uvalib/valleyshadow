<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In September, 1862, General Robert E. Lee invaded Maryland and threatened
                    Pennsylvania. In this dispatch, Union General George McClellan writes
                    Pennsylvania governor Andrew Curtin with instructions on calling out and using
                    militia to meet the invasion. McClellan suggests concentrating troops in the
                    Chambersburg area.</p>

<p>ANDREW G. CURTIN,<br> Governor of Pennsylvania:</p>
<p></p>
<p>September 10, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everything that we can learn induces me to believe that the information you have
                    received is substantially correct. I think the enemy are checked in the
                    directions of Baltimore and Gettysburg. You should concentrate all the troops
                    you can in the vicinity of Chambersburg, not entirely neglecting Gettysburg. I
                    will follow them up as rapidly as possible, and do all I can to check their
                    movements into Pennsylvania. Call out the militia, especially mounted men, and
                    do everything in your power to impede the enemy by the action of light troops;
                    attack them in flank, destroying their trains and any property which must
                    inevitably come into their possession. You may be sure that I will follow them
                    as closely as I can, and fight them whenever I can find them. It is as much my
                    interest as yours to preserve the soil of Pennsylvania from invasion, or,
                    failing in that, to destroy any army that may have the temerity to attempt it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GEO. B. McCLELLAN,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
