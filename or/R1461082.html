<p><b>Summary:<br></b>After the major Confederate armies surrendered, the Union faced the task of
                    demobilizing the remaining Confederate troops in the field. In this May, 1865,
                    letter, Union Chief of Staff Henry Halleck informs General Grant that
                    Confederate General Thomas Rosser has offered to surrender his command at
                    Staunton. Halleck ordered Union troops to Staunton to collect arms and parole
                    the troops.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>May 4, 1865--2.30 p.m.<br> (Received 7 p.m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Rosser has offered to collect his command and surrender them at Staunton. I
                    have ordered a regiment of cavalry there to receive their arms and paroles. On
                    its return it will be stationed at Gordonsville to preserve order and repress
                    any incipient guerrillas. To supply it the railroad should be opened to that
                    place. The company can do this in a few days if permitted to purchase iron at
                    the Tredegar works. I shall direct the officer in charge to sell them what is
                    required for that purpose, the money or obligation to pay being held subject to
                    the disposal of the Government.</p>
<p>By rendering these companies slight assistance, to be paid for hereafter, I think
                    these roads can be repaired and put in operation much cheaper by them than by
                    the Government. This of course will not affect the question of confiscating the
                    stock of rebel stockholders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. W. HALLECK,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
