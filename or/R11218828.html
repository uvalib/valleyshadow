<div id="mainResults">
<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Edward Johnson commanded Confederate forces in western Virginia during the early spring of
    1862. In this March dispatch, Johnson reports to Robert E. Lee, then advisor to Jefferson Davis
    in Richmond, on the situation facing his troops. He reports difficulty in recruiting disloyal
    mountain dwellers, and discusses enemy plans to move on Staunton, and his attempts to place
    defenses to prevent this.</p>

<p>Gen. R. E. Lee,<br> Commander-in-Chief, P. A. C. S., Richmond:</p>
<p> Camp Alleghany,</p>
<p>March 18, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In reply to your communication received this day I have the honor herewith to transmit a
     statement of the strength of this command and the positions occupied by the several detachments
     composing it.</p>
<p>The prospect of calling to my aid volunteers from the country in which I am operating is by
     no means flattering. The people of this country are many of them, if not disloyal, at least
     indifferent as to which cause triumphs, and are willing to range themselves on the stronger
     side. The population is sparse, the country very mountainous.</p>
<p>The principal portion of my command is at this point, which has been fortified and is
     defended by ten pieces of artillery. My position has been considerably strengthened since the
     battle for the 13th December.</p>
<p>I have a force at Huntersville to protect that line. It is weak, and the position you are
     well acquainted with. Another force at Crab Bottom, about 9 miles in my rear, on the
     Parkersburg turnpike. This position is not at all fortified. The troops were ordered there by
     Gen. Loring and hunted themselves in November last. This force is 6 miles from Monterey. A
     small cavalry force at Franklin, to scout in that direction and watch for any movement of the
     enemy from that direction; one or two companies of cavalry at Monterey, and one of Tennessee
     Cavalry at the Warm Springs. This last was ordered from Huntersville, it being difficult to
     procure forage at Huntersville for any but a small cavalry force.</p>
<p>The force for the enemy opposed to me I have reason to believe does not exceed 3,000; are
     posted at Cheat, Huttonsville, Beverly, Crouch's, and in the valley. This is the latest and
     most reliable intelligence from that country. As to the plan of operations for the ensuing
     campaign, it is evident what with my present force little can be done save hold the enemy in
     check, and scarcely that, if he advances with a very superior force. The road via Huntersville
     and into the turnpike in rear is familiar to you. In order to check the advance of the enemy in
     that direction a larger force should be stationed at Huntersville or some point in that line.</p>
<p>The enemy might gain my rear via Romney, Moorefield, and Franklin to Monterey by a road
     practicable for artillery. Three thousand of the enemy advanced as far as Moorefield this
     winter from Gen. Lander's forces. The enemy also advanced upon Huntersville in January,
     destroying a portion of the stores at that place. I hardly deem it probable that the enemy will
     attempt to force a passage to Staunton by this point (top Allegheny.) There is a road by
     Grenbrier from Cheat Mountain, or from Greenbrier (Camp Barton) by which they might reach
     Huntersville, but this road at this time is very bad, and will remain so, like most of the
     roads in this country, for some time to come. I have been informed that the enemy have had
     great difficulty in getting supplies to Cheat Mountain and its dependencies in consequence of
     the condition of the roads on that side; hence I think he will not attempt an advance in that
     direction during the early spring.</p>
<p>The enemy, it is reported, speak of advancing on Staunton in this direction from Gauley and
     by Winchester; also of sending a force by Huntersville. I know not what reliance to place on
     these reports, but their present numbers do not indicate any such intention. There is but one
     point beyond this toward Staunton which I regard as defensible-Shenandoah Mountain, 26 miles
     from Staunton and about 19 from Monterey. This is a strong position, but I am not sufficiently
     acquainted with the position to speak positively as to the facilities of water, &amp;c.,
     for a military encampment; but I believe there is water, &amp;c., in abundance.</p>
<p>I deem it probable that the enemy have thrown more of their forces from Northwestern Virginia
     to Winchester and expect to make us evacuate this position by advancing in that direction.</p>
<p>I submit these views with much diffidence, feeling confident that your superior judgement
     will enable you at a glance to see and decide upon what is most expedient and proper.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p> E. JOHNSON,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
