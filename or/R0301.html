<p>Lieut. [S. V.] Southall, Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>August 4, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>On the morning of July 1, while marching in rear of Early's division, I received
                    an order from Gen. Early to bring the batteries at once to the front, for the
                    purpose of engaging the enemy. This I did, and found on arriving at the front
                    that the enemy were posted in front of Gettysburg, and engaging hotly what I
                    afterward learned was Gen. Rodes' division. I immediately brought twelve guns
                    into position, and opened a brisk fire upon the enemy's artillery and infantry,
                    taking them in flank as they were being massed upon Rodes' left and Gen. Early's
                    right.</p>
<p>The batteries were very soon driven from the position and forced to retire,
                    leaving one carriage disabled, which, however, they afterward succeeded in
                    getting off. Our fire was very effective upon their infantry, presenting, as
                    they did, large bodies in easy range of us.</p>
<p>In this engagement, I had three guns temporarily disabled and one permanently so.
                    One man of the Louisiana Guard Artillery was killed, and 1 of the Staunton
                    Artillery wounded.</p>
<p>For your better information, I have the honor herewith to inclose the reports of
                    Capt.'s Tanner and Green, of the operations of their batteries at Wrightsville,
                    Hunterstown, South Mountain, and Williamsport.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>H. P. JONES, Lieut.-Col., Comdg. Artillery Battalion.</p>
