                <p>I have the honor to report my arrival at this place. Previous to leaving
                    Philadelphia, I arranged for the satisfactory working of the staff departments
                    there and on this line, and in passing Harrisburg removed many inconveniences
                    under which we have labored for the transportation of troops and supplies.
                    Though this road is of very limited capacity, I expect to execute my designs as
                    herein expressed. I am forced to adopt this mode of putting the column in
                    motion, as not more than six regiments of infantry per day can be transported
                    over the railroad. Wagons will be arriving and no inconvenience will be
                    experienced, as regiments will be receiving accouterments while the troops are
                    advancing to Hagerstown.</p>
                <p>My impressions as to the point of attack indicated in my plan of operations have
                    been confirmed by Capt. Newton, who has been industriously engaged gathering
                    information, and I shall arrange to advance on Thursday morning. I request to be
                    informed by telegraph if the Gen.-in-Chief has no objection.</p>
                <p>Unless something should change my present design, I will direct Col. Thomas to
                    pass through Hagerstown early on Saturday morning, and advance the whole or
                    part, as circumstances indicate best, of his command to Williamsport, seize the
                    ford, and throw pickets beyond.</p>
                <p>As he passes through Hagerstown a company of cavalry will be detached from his
                    advance guard to the road leading through Boonsborough to Harper's Ferry. The
                    brigade under Gen. Williams (three regiments) will be directed to follow Col.
                    Thomas, and will be close upon him. Other regiments will be thrown forward as
                    rapidly as the capacity of the road will permit (six or seven per day,
                    probably), and sent on the roads towards Boonsborough and Williamsport-the
                    former to guard against forays from Harper's Ferry, the latter to sustain the
                    main column. Some of these regiments will reach Hagerstown as soon as Col.
                    Thomas. Of course I rely upon artillery arriving in time to permit the column to
                    continue on towards Martinsburg.</p>
                <p>On Monday morning I hope to have about fourteen regiments in advance of
                    Hagerstown. I asked this morning by telegraph for the Second Infantry, which
                    newspaper report placed at Pittsburgh. My design was to unite it to a brigade of
                    volunteers, to command of which Col. Miles would be assigned, thus having two
                    brigades under experienced officers of the Regular Army. The information I have
                    received leads me to believe a desperate resistance will be offered at Harper's
                    Ferry.</p>
