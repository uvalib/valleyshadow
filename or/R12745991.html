<p>Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart:</p>
<p></p>
<p>July 10, 1863</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I received last evening your note of the 9th, relative to information brought by
                    your scouts. During the night, Lieut. Thomas L. Norwood, Thirty-seventh North
                    Carolina Regt., who was wounded at Gettysburg and made his escape, arrived. He
                    reports he passed at Waynesborough what he supposed a division of the enemy,
                    though it was called a heavy column. He also stated he heard that another column
                    was passing down toward Boonsborough, and a third to Fredericktown. Notify B. H.
                    Robertson to be on the lookout, and offer stiff resistance. Lieut. N. says that
                    Gen. Couch, with Pennsylvania militia, was at Chambersburg. We must prepare for
                    a vigorous battle, and trust in the mercy of God and the valor of our troops.
                    Get your men in hand, and have everything ready.</p>
<p>Very truly,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
