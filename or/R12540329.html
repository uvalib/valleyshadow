<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Dan Butterfield forwards a May, 1863, scouting report to Army of the
          Potomac commander Joseph Hooker. The report estimates the number of Confederates stationed
          under John Imboden at Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HOOKER:</p>
<p></p>
<p>MAY 1, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sharpe's Richmond man returned. Following report received:</p>
<p>Our friend just returned. The works around Richmond are most formidable at Meadow Bridge
          and Mechanicsville road. They are intended for field artillery. No guns in position.
          Fifty-nine thousand rations issued to Lee's army, exclusive of cavalry. Not able to learn
          their number. Rumor put it down from 8,000 to 12,000 troops. At Richmond are the City
          Battalion and some artillery. Two thousand seven hundred rations issued to the troops in
          Richmond in active service. Gen. Wise has 5,000 on the Peninsula. Longstreet has three
          divisions at Suffolk. When they left Lee, they were each 8,000 strong. Their effective
          force, all told, not over 15,000 men. D. H. Hill is ordered from Washington, N. C., to
          re-enforce Longstreet's corps. He may, however, take Longstreet's place at Suffolk, and
          Lee may be-enforced by Longstreet. Imboden has 2,500 men at Staunton. If not sent to
          Jones, may go to Lee. No other re-enforcements can be brought to Lee in any reasonable
          time. Jones has 4,500 men in Western Virginia.</p>
