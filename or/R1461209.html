<p><b>Summary:<br></b>As the end of the war neared, supply problems in the Confederacy became more and
                    more critical. In this February, 1865, letter, Confederate General William
                    Pendleton discusses a plan proposed by Colonel Michael Harman of Staunton to
                    obtain good horses for the artillery. Harman and Pendleton wish to give
                    civilians worn-out army horses in exchange for good horses. Pendleton also
                    mentions Harman's farms and a stage line in Staunton.</p>

<p>Col. A. H. COLE:</p>
<p></p>
<p>February 7, 1865.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Col. Thomas H. Carter, the distinguished commander of Gen. Early's artillery in
                    the Valley during all the latter part of the late campaign, was here a few days
                    ago, and conversed with me fully in relation to horses in the Valley. He
                    mentioned a suggestion of Col. Michael Harman, of Staunton, which he thought
                    might be turned to good account, viz, that the worn-down horses of the
                    Government might be turned over to citizens, and good horses impressed from the
                    latter. Harman, besides having many horses on his farms, runs an extensive line
                    of stages, and he expressed his willingness to share in the operation for the
                    common good. Col. Carter thinks quite a number of good artillery horses would
                    thus be gotten in Augusta, Rockbridge, and other counties, and as illustrating
                    the supply and the bad policy of leaving them unused, he told me that Sheridan
                    had taken out of Rockingham County alone some 1,700 horses, notwithstanding all
                    the previous drain of the war.</p>
<p>I conversed with Gen. Lee on the subject, and he requested me to write to you as
                    in charge of the horse business, and get you to do whatever might be
                    practicable. Worn and feeble horses can, I think, be much better cared for by
                    farmers, a few in one place, and as individual property, than by Government
                    agents having charge of droves of them with no special interest in them, and
                    horses however saved are now important to the country. It would even by better,
                    I believe, to give the condemned horses to farmers and get good ones by
                    impressment, than to consume so much of our scant stock of forage in the country
                    in the public recruiting depots. The law provides, I think, for the sale of
                    condemned animals, and this might furnish the authority for such arrangements in
                    the premises as you deem best.</p>
<p>There are serious evils, some of them no doubt unavoidable, in the mode of
                    getting to the rear condemned horses. They are accumulated in certain
                    receptacles, until everything is ready for their removal. There little forage
                    can be had and scarcely an attention can be given to particular animals, and the
                    consequence is many die in those pens and the rest become more and more
                    exhausted. I have again and again witnessed this.</p>
<p>The question of our horse supply is hardly second to that of supplying men for
                    the army, or food for the men, and it is of great importance that all measures
                    be adopted, both for keeping up the stock in the Confederacy, and for having
                    strong teams in sufficient number for our artillery and transportation by the
                    opening of our spring campaign. If you could visit Col. Harman in Staunton, you
                    might derive from him valuable information on this whole subject, and if you
                    cannot go I would suggest the propriety of communicating with him by letter.</p>
<p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. M. PENDLETON,<br> Brig.-Gen. and Chief of Artillery.</p>
