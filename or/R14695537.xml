                <p>Union Major William Russell reports on a March, 1865, scouting expedition in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. Russell reports that refugees from Staunton gave him

                <p>In compliance with your orders, I left Winchester on the morning of the 27th
                    instant, with a detachment of 300 men, to go up the Valley as far as Woodstock,
                    for the purpose of ascertaining the position and strength of any force of the
                    enemy in the Valley. I arrived at Woodstock at 4 p.m., and there ascertained
                    through citizens, and two refugees who came from Staunton on Saturday last, that
                    there was no force of any nature between Staunton and this place. At Edenburg
                    there is a small picket of not more than twenty men, stationed there for the
                    purpose of preventing deserters and refugees from coming north. At New Market
                    there is a small provost guard, left there for the purpose of collecting any men
                    of Rosser's command and sending them to Gordonsville, where it is said that
                    Rosser it collecting what forces he can; also, that Imboden's command has been
                    ordered to report to him. The present whereabouts of Imboden's command I could
                    not ascertain. The most significant information I received was that the
                    re-enforcements sent to Lynchburg at the time Gen. Sheridan was approaching that
                    place consisted of the Engineer Brigade from Richmond, composed of 1,800 men,
                    who were to strengthen the works, and it was the opinion of my informant (a
                    citizens of Woodstock) that no other troops had been sent there.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the Valley being cut off from southern communication by the
                    destruction of the Virginia Central Railroad, it is difficult to learn anything
                    of late occurrence. Aside from some half dozen scouts at Woodstock and a party
                    of some fifteen guerrillas, who fired into my rear guard to-day at Newton, I saw
                    none of the enemy.</p>
