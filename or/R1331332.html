<div id="mainResults">
<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In April, 1864, Union forces prepared to move in northern Virginia, the
                    Shenandoah Valley, and the West as part of General Grant's overall strategic
                    plan. In this letter, Robert E. Lee writes Jefferson Davis to inform him of the
                    situation, including his suspicion that Generals Averell and Sigel planned a
                    raid on Staunton or the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.</p>

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> President
                        Confederate States:</p>
<p></p>
<p>April 30, 1864.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>My dispatch of 1.45 p.m. to-day announced to you the march of Burnside's forces
                    through Centreville. Citizens report the arrival of his troops at Rappahannock
                    Station. I send you the Philadelphia Inquirer of the 26th, from which you will
                    learn that all their available forces are being advanced to the front. They are
                    also apparently drawing troops from Florida and the southern coast. Lieut.-Col.
                    Mosby, who was within a mile of Centreville on the 28th, the day that Burnside
                    passed through, learned from prisoners that no troops were left at Annapolis
                    except convalescents. I see no evidence of more troops being brought from
                    Tennessee, and it may be inferred from newspapers sent, and from the Washington
                    Chronicle of the 27th, that the Twelfth Corps is still in that department.</p>
<p>As far as I can judge, although there may be a large force in Tennessee, it seems
                    to occupy an extended line, and is not yet concentrated as if for attack. If
                    Gen. Johnston could be re-enforced from Mobile, or by Gen. Polk, he might be
                    able to penetrate their lines or successfully resist their advance. Our scouts
                    report that the engineer troops, pontoon trains, and all the cavalry of Meade's
                    army have been advanced south of the Rappahannock. The regiments of the old
                    Fifth Corps, which have been guarding the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, have
                    been brought forward and replaced by negro troops. Everything indicates a
                    concentrated attack on this front, which renders me the more anxious to get back
                    the troops belonging to this army, and causes me to suggest, if possible, that
                    others be moved from points at the south, where they can be spared, to Richmond.
                    There will no doubt be a strong demonstration made north of south of the James
                    River, which Beauregard will be able successfully to resist. I judge also, from
                    present indications, that Averell and Sigel will move against the Virginia and
                    Tennessee Railroad or Staunton, to resist which Gen.'s Breckinridge and Imboden
                    should act in concert. I have requested them to do so.</p>
<p>With great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
