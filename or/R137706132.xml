                <p>13. The Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, Col. J. M. Campbell, is
                    hereby transferred from the First to the Second Infantry Division of this
                    department. Col. Campbell will at once report to Brig. Gen. George Crook,
                    commanding Second Infantry Division, for instructions and orders, and will be
                    placed in command of one of the brigades.</p>
                <p>18. Brig.-Gen. Duffie, commanding brigade, Second Cavalry Division, is relieved
                    from duty with that division, and will report for duty to Maj.-Gen. Stahel,
                    commanding First Cavalry Division.</p>
                <p>20. Brig.-Gen. Duffie is hereby assigned to the command of the First Cavalry
                    Division, and will immediately proceed to reorganize his division with a view to
                    the most complete efficiency. He will report for dismissal, subject to the
                    approval of His Excellency President, any officer or officers whom he may find
                    to be derelict or incompetent for their positions.</p>
                <p>21. In consequence of a wound, received while gallantly leading his division in
                    the recent battle of Piedmont, Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel, commanding First Cavalry
                    Division, is relieved from duty with the army in the field, and will immediately
                    proceed to Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry, where he will at once devote himself
                    to the important duty of collecting together and organizing all the troops that
                    can be spared from the defense of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and all
                    detachments of regimentals serving with this command, together with
                    convalescents, and mounted men from the Dismounted Camp. With the forces thus
                    collected and organized, Gen. Stahel will assume command of the important train
                    to be sent after this command, and will with all discreet speed rejoin this
                    command. He will also see that Keeper's battery, First Virginia Artillery, is
                    horse, completely equipped, and sent forward with his forces, and will draw all
                    troops that can be possibly spared from the Kanawha Valley, with the exception
                    of the 100-days' militia there on duty. All commanding officers of the
                    department will see that every facility is furnished to Maj.-Gen. Stahel for the
                    execution of the important duties herein confided to him, and will promptly fill
                    all requisitions which in his judgment may be necessary for the success of his
                    operations. In temporarily parting with Gen. Stahel, the major-general
                    commanding desires to express his appreciation of the faithful, zealous, and
                    gallant services of this officer, and to express the hope that when he rejoins
                    this command he will have entirely recovered from the injuries received in the
                    recent battle.</p>
                <p>23. The chief of artillery will detail one section of a battery to report to
                    Brig. Gen. A. N. Duffie, commanding First Cavalry Division, at 3 a. m.
                    to-morrow, for special service at Gen. Stahel's HDQRS.</p>
