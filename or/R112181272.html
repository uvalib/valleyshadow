<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter, Union General Nathaniel P. Banks warns John C. Fremont of
                    Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson's movements toward Staunton in the
                    Shenandoah Valley in preparation for his May, 1862, offensive.</p>

<p>Gen. FREMONT, Grafton:</p>
<p>NEW MARKET,</p>
<p>May 2, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks for dispatches received to-day. Jackson withdrew his army Wednesday
                    afternoon to roads in the direction of Waynesborough or Staunton. He was seen
                    to-day (2.30 p.m.) moving toward Port Republic, which is 20 miles from Staunton.
                    His march is possibly a feint, possibly to join Johnson and attack Milroy near
                    Staunton. Of that you will judge best. His force is not over 8,000, we think.
                    Gen. Ewell, commanding rebel force near Rappahannock, is now said to be at
                    Stanardsville with about 5,000. The three united cannot muster over 18,000. We
                    rest here for the present. By order we occupy Harrisonsburg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>N.P. BANKS,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
