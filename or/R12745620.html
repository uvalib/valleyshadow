<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union railroad specialist Herman Haupt writes Army of the Potomac quartermaster
                    Rufus Ingalls in July, 1863, to discuss reopening railroads in the aftermath of
                    the Gettysburg campaign. He mentions sending men to Chambersburg to begin repair
                    work there.</p>

<p>Gen. Ingalls:</p>
<p>Gettysburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 9, 1863.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are about straight again at Gettysburg. I have put the road in charge of our
                    own men. I have also 150 track men, on special train, on way to Gettysburg. I
                    will march them over the mountain, and set them at work at Chambersburg to
                    reconstruct the road. The Northern Central Railroad is open to York, but the
                    opening to Harrisburg will be delayed a couple of days by the loss of some of
                    our bridges by high water. Telegraph me, at Gettysburg, the position of affairs.
                    Have the rebels possession of Hagerstown; if so, how much of the railroad? Have
                    they bridges, and have any crossed the river? We hear nothing in this place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>H. HAUPT,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
