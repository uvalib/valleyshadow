<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Army of the Potomac commander Ambrose E. Burnside replies to General in Chief
                    Henry Halleck on a reported January, 1863, Confederate advance on Winchester

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 6, 1863--11.15 p.m. (Received 12 a.m., 7th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your dispatch is received. I can scarcely believe that Gen. Hill is in the
                    valley, and I certainly cannot conceive why he should move from here to Staunton
                    to make a start. He was reported some days' since by Gen. Dix's spies as having
                    gone south. If he is there, his force, combined with that of Gen. Loring, can
                    scarcely exceed 15,000 men, and I take it that the forces of Gen.'s Milroy,
                    Kelley, and Kenly will be able to check any serious movement they may attempt.
                    Should you find it necessary, you can order Gen. Slocum to that region, and I
                    will replace him by the Eleventh Corps. If they are moving up the valley they
                    are too far off for any general movement of this army to have any effect upon
                    them before they will have encountered our forces there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. E. BURNSIDE,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
