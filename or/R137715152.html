<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William Averell writes from Chambersburg to General Darius Couch on
                    July 30, 1864. Averell reports the actions of his men during the Confederate
                    raid into southern Pennsylvania. He reports that Chambersburg was burned by the
                    Confederates, suggests making provisions for the citizens of the town, and
                    requests supplies for his troops.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. COUCH,<br> Harrisburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>July 30, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the enemy crossed the river yesterday one of my brigades on picket duty
                    along the Potomac was broken into several fragments, but during last night I
                    extricated and united it at Greencastle. Your dispatches, reporting the approach
                    of the enemy from Mercersburg, were not received until 3.30 a. m. to-day.
                    Vaughn, Imboden, and Jackson were on my front, and Johnson and McCausland in my
                    rear. At 4.30 a. m. McCausland set fire to the principal portion of
                    Chambersburg. Marching as rapidly as possible, leaving the infantry behind, I
                    placed my command between the enemy and Baltimore, and advanced to attack. The
                    enemy retreated in the direction of Saint Thomas. From prisoners I learn that a
                    raid is being made by Breckinridge toward Wheeling or above, to return by the
                    Kanawha Valley. Please notify the War Department. This information strengthens
                    the opinion which I expressed to you last evening by telegraph. Some provision
                    should be made for the citizens whose houses have been burned. I am pressing the
                    enemy as rapidly as possible, and shall overtake them, I think. My command is
                    out of rations. Please let a train, containing hard bread, coffee, and sugar for
                    six days for 2,000 men follow me. It was the intention of the enemy to burn
                    Carlisle also, in retaliation for the burning of private houses by Gen. Hunter.
                    It is said by prisoners that Longstreet's corps is to threaten Washington, and
                    Early's to hold the Valley while Breckinridge is making his raid. The force at
                    Cumberland should be notified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>WM. W. AVERELL,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
