<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston writes to General William Whiting in
                    November, 1861, to discuss troop movements to Fredericksburg and elsewhere,

<p>Brig.-Gen. WHITING:</p>
<p>Centreville, HDQRS.,</p>
<p>November 16, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR GEN.:</p>
<p>A regiment left Richmond on the 14th for Fredericksburg, and another is to do so
                    to-day and another to-morrow, all unarmed. I directed the quartermaster to send
                    you these regiments, beginning with the Texans, twenty-four wagons, which will
                    start to-day, should the Occoquan be fordable. They are to take 1,600 muskets
                    (perhaps 1,800) and about 60 boxes of cartridges for the regiments of the 14th
                    and 16th-dates of leaving Richmond. All these new troops are unarmed, and as I
                    said that two could be armed at Manassas, they send fife to use the
                    muskets-these people in Richmond.</p>
<p>I requested Gen. Holmes to procure permanent transportation for these troops
                    about Fredericksburg, if possible; I shall therefore wait to hear for him before
                    sending more wagons.</p>
<p>When I hear of the last regiment, arms shall be sent for it, too, if they can be
                    found.</p>
<p>I have had a brigade over the Occoquan begun on the road from Dumfries to
                    Manassas, and am asking for labors to improve the road.</p>
<p>I have desired Gen. Homles to have such field works as can now be made begun on
                    the heights at Evansport. Will you advise in the case?</p>
<p>No Staunton regiments are to join Wigfall. His brigade consists of the three
                    Texas regiments belonging to your command. The three regiments to come, also to
                    be under your command, are new, I suppose being unarmed. Brigade them at you
                    discretion.</p>
<p>Col. Walker is, I doubt not, a very competent officer. I knew him as an excellent
                    captain.</p>
<p>If the new regiments can serve where there are breastworks it will be well to so
                    place them, by exchanges if necessary. I wish the dividing lines between the
                    districts considered obliterated.</p>
<p>Yours, truly,</p>
<p>J. E. JOHNSTON.</p>
