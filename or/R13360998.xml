                <p>Union General Franz Sigel writes to General Grant with information taken from
                    Confederate prisoners in April, 1864. Sigel reports that Confederate General
                    Elzey, commanding at Staunton, received authorization from Lee to reinforce his
                    command. The prisoners also discuss other Confederate troop movements.</p>

                <p>Six rebel prisoners, of Gilmor's battalion, were brought in yesterday. I examined
                    them. They wish to be exchanged and go back to the Southern army, with the
                    exception of an Irishman, a sailor, who wishes to take the oath of allegiance. I
                    had a private interview with him and he says the following:</p>
                <p>Longstreet's troops were encamped on last Saturday between Charlottesville and
                    Gordonsville, on his way to Lee. He says that 2 men came from Richmond to join
                    Gilmor's battalion, at Mount Jackson. They told him that Roland (?) was on the
                    Peninsula, and that Wise has taken command at Charleston. Opinion prevails in
                    the South that we have got tired of Charleston. He assures me that there is no
                    truth in the rumor of Johnston having joined Lee's army; at least there was
                    nothing known about it at Staunton and in the valley. He says that Gen. Elzey,
                    at Staunton, is authorized to strengthen his division, assisted by Marshal Kane,
                    of Baltimore, from all Marylanders of Lee's army and other commands, but that
                    Lee refused to let them go. Imboden has been made a major-general, and Gilmor is
                    before a court-martial for robbing citizens on the railroad instead of
                    destroying bridges and cars, when he made his last raid.</p>
                <p>Our cavalry had a successful skirmish yesterday at Springfield, north of Romney.</p>
