                </opener>
                <p>Having been left in command at Moorefield by the general, April 24, with orders
                    to move when I got ready via Franklin to this place, I collected upward of 350
                    stragglers, formed them in a battalion, had 350 bushels of wheat ground into
                    chop, and on the morning of the 27th left for this place in the following order:
                    Advance guard (infantry), battalion of infantry, R. P. Chew's battery, Baltimore
                    Light Artillery; wagon-train, each regiment to itself, under its quartermaster
                    or commissary, the whole train under the especial care of Capt. P. H. Woodward,
                    whose services were invaluable to me in having the train parked at night and
                    move at sun-up in the promptest manner. Next came a guard of cavalry, to prevent
                    any one on horseback getting in the way of the train, the rear being brought up
                    by battalion of cavalry, under Lieut. J. C. Allen, followed by rear guard with
                    myself. The prisoners sent from Greenland to me were (after my arrival here)
                    sent on to Richmond, with the exception of one--a man by name of Shreve, said to
                    be a noted bushwhacker--I ordered to be heavily ironed and left in jail at
                    Staunton, subject to the general's order. The Jews I returned to Richmond.</p>
                <p>The morning we left Moorefield I rode into the town to see that all the men were
                    out. Just as I left the place and had got half-way to the toll-gate, about half
                    a mile from town, I heard a dozen shots fired, citizens running, and a man rode
                    up and reported the Yankees as having run him into town, and they were going up
                    on the other side of the river to cut us off. The command was at least 4 miles
                    ahead. I had 20 men with me. I dispatched a courier to Maj. William W.
                    Goldsborough, First Maryland Battalion, to halt and send me one company of
                    infantry back. I stopped on the hill where our camp was, but could see or hear
                    no more of the Yankees. They came into Moorefield that evening about 3 o'clock.</p>
                <p>I reached Harrisonburg the evening of the 30th, and reported at once to
                    Lieut.-Col. Funsten.</p>
                <p>To Maj. George H. Kyle I was under the greatest obligations for his zeal and
                    activity in the double capacity of quartermaster and commissary. Having my
                    command unexpectedly increased by the prisoners, guard, and 450 to 500 men,
                    stragglers, for whom no provision had been made, through his aid I was enabled
                    through a scarce country to bring everything through safely. Thinking the
                    general would like to have it, I make this report.</p>
