<p><b>Summary:<br></b>This Confederate report describes the capture of Chambersburg citizen J. Allison
                    Eyster as he followed Union General Robert Patterson's army into Virginia early
                    in the war to collect money due him from the sale of military equipment. The
                    report describes Eyster's standing in the community, his political views, and
                    his drunken behavior while in Virginia. The report recommends that he not be
                    detained.</p>

<p>J. Allison Eyster.--He is a Pennsylvania and a resident of Chambersburg. He is a
                    wealthy merchant, well known in Baltimore; addicted sometimes to intemperance.
                    He voted for Lincoln, but declares that he was entirely opposed to the war. He
                    acted as a sutler in some sort to Patterson's army, selling it a large amount of
                    goods on account of which there is till due to him he says about $11,000, to
                    collect which he says he followed that army into Virginia, where he was arrested
                    at the instance of his connection, Jonas Chamberlin, of Frederick County, whose
                    affidavit is herewith returned. Chamberlin says that Eyster came to his house
                    very drunk, and came into Virginia in a drunken frolic under Patterson's pass. I
                    see no reason to detain Eyster unless as a hostage for the safety of our people
                    who are in the hands of the enemy.</p>
