<p>AJDT. Gen., Lieut. Gen. EWELL'S COMMAND,<br> Richmond,
                        Va.</p>
<p>STAUNTON</p>
<p>November 25, 1864.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
                    artillery of the Second Corps from May 4 to 31, 1864:</p>
<p>I received orders on May 4 from Lieut.-Gen. Ewell to move my artillery to the
                    front. I immediately broke up my grazing camps in the neighborhood of
                    Gordonsville, and directed Col. Brown to move his division of artillery in the
                    direction of Locust Grove. Cutshaw's battalion was ordered to report to Col.
                    Carter, who had been ordered some days before the vicinity of Raccoon Ford with
                    Page's battalion, of his division. Nelson's battalion had been some time on the
                    front operating with Early's division of infantry.</p>
<p>On the 5th all my artillery was concentrated at Locust Grove, on the old turnpike
                    from Orange Court-House to Fredericksburg, in the immediate vicinity of the
                    infantry of the Second Corps. On reporting to Gen. Ewell I learned that the
                    enemy was in his front. Maj. Gen. Edward Johnson's division of infantry was
                    advanced, accompanied by Nelson's battalion of artillery. After moving a short
                    distance the division was deployed across the pike, and one battery (Milledge's)
                    was put in position to the right of the road in front of Jones' brigade. The
                    enemy attacking while the position of this brigade was being changed, it became
                    necessary to withdraw Milledge's battery. After a very spirited attack the enemy
                    was repulsed with considerable loss. Gen. Ewell then took up his position
                    without further opposition. His line extended on each side of the turnpike, the
                    road passing through the center of his division. The right wing was nearly at
                    right angles to the pike, and the left wing was bent back to cover the road
                    leading to the Germanna plank road. The country was of such a character (being a
                    dense wilderness) that but few opportunities offered for the effective use of
                    artillery; nevertheless, a portion of Nelson's guns were posted on a commanding
                    ridge, with a small field in front, immediately on the road, 1 mile from the
                    Lacy house. Two others of Nelson's guns were placed on the road leading to
                    Germanna Ford, to operate with the troops of the left wing of the corps. The
                    artillery during the day was several times used with effect in repulsing partial
                    attacks of the enemy. For the better service of the artillery, our line being
                    quite extended, I directed Col. Brown to take charge of that portion posted on
                    the right of the turnpike, and Col. Carter that on the left. Early on the
                    morning of the 6th Col. Carter was directed to concentrate as many guns as could
                    be spared on the left of our position, which was a good deal exposed, and the
                    enemy was feeling in that direction as if intending to attempt our flank. These
                    guns, with a small infantry support, sufficiently protected this point. During
                    the day the enemy made an attack on Gordon's brigade, which was on our extreme
                    left. Some of these guns were used with considerable effect in assisting to
                    repel this attack. Early in the day Col. Brown, while selecting a position for a
                    battery, was shot by a sharpshooters and instantly killed. His loss was deeply
                    felt throughout the whole army. He not only exhibited the highest social
                    qualities, but was endowed with the first order of military talents. On every
                    where he was called to act he was distinguished for gallantry and skill. The
                    artillery will ever remember him as one of its brightest ornaments. Nelson's
                    battalion was relieved during the day by guns from Lieut.-Col. Hardaway's and
                    Maj. Cutshaw's battalions, Cutshaw occupying the position on the right of the
                    pike, and Hardaway that on the Germanna road. Lieut.-Col. Braxton's battalion
                    was put in position on our extreme right, filling the intervals between Rodes'
                    right and Hill's left. A few guns were distributed along Rodes' front.</p>
<p>The opposing forces were during the 7th only occupied in light skirmishing. I was
                    directed by Gen. Ewell to make a reconnaissance in the direction of Germanna
                    Ford. Taking one brigade of infantry and two battalions of artillery. I advanced
                    to the Germanna plank road, striking it about a mile from the ford. Two or three
                    regiments of cavalry were occupying the road at this point. These were soon
                    driven away by a few well-directed shots, a small number retreating toward the
                    ford, and the rest in the direction of the main body of Grant's army. It was
                    discovered that the enemy had almost entirely abandoned the ford and road. It
                    was evident that they were leaving our front. Late in the afternoon I was
                    ordered by Gen. Ewell to hold myself in readiness to move. Nelson, Hardaway, and
                    Cutshaw were directed to encamp at Verdierville. Braxton and Page were ordered
                    to remain with the infantry and move with it.</p>
<p>The enemy was found on the morning of the 8th to be shifting his position toward
                    Spotsylvania Court-House. Our whole army also moved in that direction, and
                    arrived at that place on the same evening. A few guns were put in position near
                    the Court-House. The infantry of Gen. Ewell's corps bivouacked on the position
                    it was to occupy in line of battle. On the 9th Gen. Ewell's line was accurately
                    established and fortified. Braxton's and Page's battalions were put in position
                    along the line of infantry. This position, like the one at the Wilderness, was
                    not well adapted to the effective use of artillery, the view being obstructed by
                    forest and old field pine. Gen. Hill's position to the right of Gen. Ewell
                    afforded a better field. The artillery was, however, carefully posted, with the
                    view of rendering the most effective support to the infantry. On the morning of
                    the 10th Braxton and Page were relieved by Nelson and Hardaway, the former
                    occupying the position on Johnson's front, and the latter those on Rodes' front.
                    In the afternoon the enemy, having massed heavily in front of Doles' brigade,
                    under cover of a dense pine thicket, made a sudden attack upon this brigade,
                    broke it, and entered our works, overrunning and capturing Smith's battery, of
                    Hardaway's battalion. Our infantry was soon rallied, and being re-enforced
                    repulsed the enemy and recaptured the battery. The captain and some of his men
                    were made prisoners and carried off. Hardaway's guns were principally engaged in
                    this attack and were served with gallantry and effect. Smith's guns being
                    without cannoneers were manned by Capt. Garber and his men, of Cutshaw's
                    battalion. In this attack the gallant Maj. Watson, of Hardaway's battalion, was
                    mortally wounded. Lieut.-Col. Hardaway was also wounded, but did not leave the
                    field.</p>
<p>On the 11th Cutshaw's and Page's battalions were brought up and put in position,
                    and a portion of Hardaway's battalion was relieved. The enemy made no decided
                    attack upon any part of our line during the day. Late in the afternoon I
                    received orders to have all the artillery which was difficult of access removed
                    from the lines before dark, and was informed that it was desirable that
                    everything should be in readiness to move during the night; that the enemy was
                    believed to be moving from our front. I immediately ordered all the artillery on
                    Johnson's front, except two batteries of Cutshaw's battalion, to be withdrawn,
                    as it had to pass through a wood by a narrow and difficult road, and the night
                    bid fair to be very dark. The withdrawal of the artillery proved to be very
                    unfortunate, as the enemy instead of retreating massed heavily on Johnson's
                    front during the night for the purpose of attacking.</p>
<p>At 3.30 a.m. on the 12th I received a note from Gen. Johnson, indorsed by Gen.
                    Ewell, directing me to replace immediately the artillery that had been withdrawn
                    the evening before; that the enemy was preparing to attack. I immediately
                    ordered Page's battalion to proceed with all haste to the assistance of Gen.
                    Johnson. He moved his battalion with great rapidity, but just as he reached the
                    point to be occupied the enemy broke Johnson's line and enveloped and captured
                    all of Page's guns except two, which were brought off by Capt. Montgomery. At
                    the same time two batteries twenty guns-twelve from Page and eight from Cutshaw.
                    Had the artillery been in position the result might have been different, or had
                    the weather been favorable this disaster might have been avoided; but the
                    morning was so dark and foggy that it was with difficulty that we could
                    distinguish friend from foe. Every effort was made to drive the enemy from our
                    lines, but stimulated by a successful assault, and by the desire to hold the
                    large number of guns he had taken, he most stubbornly opposed every effort to
                    dislodge him. He was, however, so hotly pressed that he was forced to abandon
                    most of our works, and was prevented from carrying off during the day the guns
                    he had captured.</p>
<p>The enemy threw his whole force in this attack and kept it up till late in the
                    afternoon. Every gun that we could bring to bear was put in position, and
                    officers and men displayed great coolness and skill in the service of them. Maj.
                    Cutshaw and Capt. Garber, with the men who escaped on the capture of the
                    batteries, succeeded in reaching some of the guns which the enemy could not
                    remove, and turning them upon the enemy, used them with great effect. Capt.
                    Montgomery was put in position with one gun in a ravine to the right of the
                    Harris house, where he remained all day actively engaged at short range. He
                    exhausted the ammunition from three caissons, which was used with effect. The
                    conspicuous gallantry of these officers called forth general admiration. About
                    12 m., on account of the heavy pressure the enemy was making on our lines and
                    the loss we had sustained in artillery in the early part of the action, I found
                    it necessary to ask for re-enforcements of artillery. Col. Cabell and
                    Lieut.-Col. McIntosh, with parts of their battalions, were sent to me. I am much
                    obliged to these officers for the valuable service they rendered on this
                    occasion. Col. Cabell was put in position on the left of Hardaway's battalion
                    (this battalion was now commanded by Capt. Dance, Hardaway having been wounded
                    in the early part of the day), McIntosh was held in position at the Harris
                    house, with the exception of two guns, which were posted on the hill above the
                    McCool house. Col. Carter commanded in the morning the artillery posted on the
                    hill above the Court-House, but later in the day he joined me in front of the
                    main attack. He rendered valuable assistance; his coolness and judgment
                    everywhere had their effect. I was also ably assisted by Lieut. S. V. Southall,
                    assistant adjutant-general, and by Lieut.-Col. Braxton, whose battalion was
                    engaged throughout the day. Lieut.-Col. Nelson occupied a position on the
                    Court-House hill and handsomely assisted in repelling an attack on that portion
                    of the line. At night a new line was established, and all the artillery was
                    withdrawn from the positions occupied during the day and put upon it.</p>
<p>The next day was occupied in reorganizing. Maj. Cutshaw was assigned to the
                    command of Hardaway's battalion; Maj. Stribling was also assigned to this
                    command. Maj. Page was put in command of the remnants of his own and Cutshaw's
                    battalions.</p>
<p>Everything remained quiet along the lines till the morning of the 18th. The
                    enemy, about 9 a.m., advanced a heavy force against our new line. He was allowed
                    to come within good canister range of our breast-works. Carter's division of
                    artillery then opened a most murderous fire of canister and spherical case-shot,
                    which at once arrested his advance, threw his columns into confusion, and forced
                    him to a disorderly retreat. His loss was very heavy; ours was nothing. This
                    attack fairly illustrates the immense power of artillery well handled. A select
                    force of 10,000 or 12,000 infantry was broken and driven from the field in less
                    than thirty minutes by twenty-nine pieces of artillery alone. In the afternoon
                    (19th), Gen. Ewell having determined to make a flank movement, Lieut.-Col.
                    Braxton was directed to accompany him with six guns of select caliber. After
                    proceeding 2 or 3 miles the road were found to be impracticable for artillery,
                    and Braxton was ordered to return to his former position. The Second Corps, on
                    the 21st, moved to the right to Mud Tavern, there taking the Telegraph road to
                    Hanover Junction. Arrived at that place on the 22d.</p>
<p>The enemy soon confronted us, but not making any attempt on our lines, the
                    artillery remained quietly in position till the morning of the 27th, when the
                    whole army moved in the direction of Richmond, and on the 28th went into
                    position on the Totopotomoy, Gen. Ewell's corps being near Pole Green Church.
                    About this time Gen. Early assumed command of the Second Corps.</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to be able to call the attention of the commanding
                    general to the uniform good conduct of all the officers and men under my
                    command. In battle they were brave and determined, and in camp they were
                    obedient and attentive. I have ever found them what soldiers should be. I would
                    especially call attention and express my thanks to Col. Carter, who commanded a
                    division of artillery, and also rendered valuable assistance in selecting
                    positions and in the general supervision of the lines; and to Lieut.-Col.'s
                    Nelson, Hardaway, and Braxton, Maj.'s Cutshaw and Page, commanding battalions,
                    and to Maj.'s Stribling and Moorman. These officers were always particularly
                    distinguished for gallantry in the field and for their careful attention to
                    discipline in camp and on the march. I would also call special attention to the
                    members of my staff. Lieut. S. V. Southall, assistant adjutant-general, was with
                    me in all our operations and rendered me the most valuable aid. He was always
                    conspicuous for coolness and judgment. Maj. F. P. Turner, chief assistant
                    quartermaster; Capt. W. J. Armstrong, commissary of subsistence; Capt. Gregory,
                    ordnance officer, and Dr. J. A. Straith, chief surgeon, were all distinguished
                    for the able administration of their departments; also my aide-de-camp, Lieut.
                    Robert O. Arrington.</p>
<p>Being absent from my command, I am unable to append a list of casualties. The
                    chief loss was upon the capture of Custhaw's and Page's battalions on May 12.</p>
<p>This report would have been submitted at a much earlier period had it not been
                    for the difficulties incident to an active campaign in getting sub-reports, and
                    my own lines.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>A. L. LONG,<br> Brig.-Gen., Chief of Artillery.</p>
