<p><b>Summary:<br></b>The Official Records sum up this document as follows: "T. Parkin Scott, of
                    Baltimore, was arrested by order of the War Department on the 13th day of
                    September, 1861, and placed in confinement at Fort McHenry. He was afterward
                    successively transferred to Fort Monroe, Fort Lafayette and Fort Warren. The
                    criminal complicity of Scott with the rebellion was well known and his arrest
                    was a measure of military precaution to prevent the probable occurrence of
                    disturbances through his efforts and influence. Among the papers communicated to
                    the Department of State in this case is a letter of which the following is a
                    copy:"</p>

<p></p>
<p>TO THE BOARD OF POLICE OF THE CITY OF BALTIMORE:</p>
<p>BALTIMORE,</p>
<p>May 2, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the 22d of April, 1861, I obtained through Governor Letcher an order from the
                    adjutant-general of Virginia on the ordnance officer at Staunton for 5,000
                    flint-lock muskets as a loan for the use of the Maryland troops, and with said
                    order I proceeded to Staunton and there obtained 2,000 stand in part of said
                    order and employed G. R. Mason to carry them in wagons to Winchester, and on the
                    26th of April I had them forwarded thence to Baltimore consigned to William T.
                    Walters and they were here delivered to your board. The freight and charges upon
                    these arms from Lexington, Va., through Staunton and Winchester amounted to
                    $563.04 and is unpaid and I am responsible for the amount. Of course under the
                    circumstances I expect your board to pay these charges.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>T. PARKIN SCOTT.</p>
