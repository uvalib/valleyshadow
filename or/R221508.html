<p><b>Summary:<br></b>J. M. Heck writes to President Jefferson Davis in August, 1861, to defend Doctor

<p>His Excellency JOHN LETCHER, Governor of Virginia:</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA.,</p>
<p>August 14, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have learned with regret that some person has had Dr. Washington Hilleary, a
                    former resident of Randolph County, Va., arrested on suspicion of having piloted
                    the Federal army around our camp at Rich Mountain. Knowing that these suspicions
                    are entirely unfounded I feel that great injustice is being done to one of our
                    friends. I therefore make the following statement of facts, hoping that they
                    will be sufficient to procure his immediate release:</p>
<p>Doctor Hilleary resides about two miles west of Camp Garnett (Rich Mountain), at
                    Roaring Run, and he and his family did all in their power to befriend and
                    relieve our little army while it was at Camp Garnett, and when he heard that the
                    Federal army was approaching he asked us to send our teams down to his house to
                    bring to our camp all his grain, saying that he did not want it to fall into the
                    hands of the Yankees, and he for safety fled to Beverly in the rear of our camp,
                    and left there in company with other refugees and came on to the Valley of
                    Virginia, where he was arrested and taken to Staunton. A young man by the name
                    of Hart (as I learned while a prisoner) acted as pilot to the Federal army in
                    their march through Rich Mountain.</p>
<p>Yours, respectfully,</p>
<p>J. M. HECK.</p>
