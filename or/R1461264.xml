                <p>After my dispatch of last night I received a report from Gen. Pickett, who, with
                    three of his own brigades and two of Gen. Johnson's, supported the cavalry under
                    Gen. Fitz Lee near Five Forks, on the road from Dinwiddie Court-House to the
                    South Side road. After considerable difficulty, and meeting resistance from the
                    enemy at all points, Gen. Pickett forced his way to within less than a mile of
                    Dinwiddie Court-House. By this time it was too dark for further operations, and
                    Gen. Pickett resolved to return to Five Forks to protect his communication with
                    the railroad. He inflicted considerable damage upon the enemy and took some
                    prisoners. His own loss was severe, including a good many officers. Gen. Terry
                    had his horse killed by a shell and was disabled himself. Gen. Fitz Lee's and
                    Rosser's divisions were heavily engaged, but their loss was slight. Gen. W. H.
                    F. Lee lost some valuable officers. Gen. Pickett did not retire from the
                    vicinity of Dinwiddie Court-House until early this morning, when, his left flank
                    being threatened by a heavy force, he withdrew to Five Forks, where he took
                    position with Gen. W. H. F. Lee on his right, Fitz Lee and Rosser on his left,
                    with Roberts' brigade on the White Oak road connecting with Gen. Anderson. The
                    enemy attacked Gen. Roberts with a large force of cavalry, and after being once
                    repulsed finally drove him back across Hatcher's Run.</p>
                <p>A large force of infantry, believed to be the Fifth Corps, with other troops,
                    turned Gen. Pickett's left and drove him back on the White Oak road, separating
                    him from Gen. Fitz Lee, who was compelled to fall back across Hatcher's Run.
                    Gen. Pickett's present position is not known. Gen. Fitz Lee reports that the
                    enemy is massing his infantry heavily behind the cavalry in his front. The
                    infantry that engaged Gen. Anderson yesterday has moved from his front toward
                    our right, and is supposed to participate in the operations above described.
                    Prisoners have been taken to-day from the Twenty-fourth Corps, and it is
                    believed that most of that corps is now south of the James. Our loss to-day is
                    not known. A report from Staunton represents that the Eighth Corps passed over
                    the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from the 20th to the 25th ultimo. Gen. Hancock
                    is at Harper's Ferry with 2,000 men. One division of the Nineteenth Corps is at
                    Winchester, with about 1,000 cavalry. The infantry at Winchester have marching
                    orders, and all these troops are said to be destined for all his troops from
                    Wolf Run Shoals and Fairfax Station, and to be concentrating them at Winchester.</p>
