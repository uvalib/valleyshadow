<p>Brig.-Gen., Commanding Division. Maj. Gen. JOSEPH HOOKER.</p>
<p>Near Sharpsburg</p>
<p>September 21, 1862</p>
<p>GEN:</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my division:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th instant the division was under arms to march at
                    daylight from its encampment near the Monocacy, and arrived at the east side of
                    South Mountain, about a mile north of the turnpike, at 5 p. m., forming line of
                    battle, First Brigade, Brig.-Gen. Duryea, on the extreme right; Third Brigade,
                    Brig.-Gen. Hartsuff, in the center, and Second Brigade, Col. Christian, on the
                    left. The route of the First and Third Brigades extended over very rough ground
                    to the crest of the mountain, which was gallantly won. On the left the Second
                    Brigade was sent to the relief of Gen. Doubleday's, which was hard pressed and
                    nearly out of ammunition. It engaged the enemy with terrible effect, and drove
                    him down the west side of the mountain.</p>
<p>It being now too dark to advance, and the men much exhausted, operations ceased
                    for the night. The next morning, the enemy having fled during the night, the
                    division moved forward and encamped near Keedysville. The artillery was not
                    engaged.</p>
<p>The list of casualties is annexed: First Brigade, 5 killed, 16 wounded; Second
                    Brigade, 2 killed, 6 wounded; Third Brigade, 2 killed, 4 wounded. Total killed
                    and wounded, 35.</p>
<p>From Keedysville on the afternoon of the 16th the division crossed the Antietam
                    River and moved toward Sharpsburg, in direction of the enemy's left flank. Third
                    Brigade was formed in line of battle while under from the enemy's artillery;
                    Second Brigade toward the left of the Third, and First Brigade in reserve. The
                    artillery, though within range, was placed as much under shelter as possible for
                    the night.</p>
<p>The morning of the 17th your order to advance and occupy the woods in front was
                    being carried out, when Gen. Hartsuff, who was examining the ground, was
                    severely wounded, and the services of this valuable officer were lost. The
                    brigade moved forward, supported by Second Brigade on the left and First Brigade
                    on the right, all advancing with the artillery, Battery F, First Pennsylvania,
                    under Capt. Matthews, and Capt. Thompson's Independent Pennsylvania Battery,
                    each consisting of four 3-inch rifled guns. Taking advantage of the ground, both
                    batteries opened with destructive effect, officers and men displaying great
                    coolness while exposed to a severe fire of artillery and infantry.</p>
<p>The division gained the outer edge of the wood, and kept up a fearful fire for
                    four hours, until the ammunition being exhausted and the supports coming up, it
                    was compelled to retire to refill boxes, after which the division joined the
                    rest of the corps on the right, near the turnpike, and, with the exception of a
                    brisk fire from the enemy's artillery, under which they stood, was not employed
                    again during the day only to hold that position.</p>
<p>I commend the general good conduct of the division, and would mention
                    particularly Brig.-Gen. Duryea; Col. Coulte, Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers;
                    Col. Lyle, Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteers; Capt. E. W. Matthews, First
                    Pennsylvania artillery, and Capt. James Thompson, Independent Pennsylvania
                    Artillery; also the names in the subjoined list, marked B. Indeed, both officers
                    and men displayed courage under a severe fire.</p>
<p>Casualties as per annexed list, marked C*: Out of 3,158 taken into action 1,051
                    were killed and wounded--153 killed and 898 wounded.</p>
<p>Of my staff I take pleasure in mentioning the distinguished gallantry of Capt.
                    John W. Williams, assistant adjutant-general; also Capt. Benjamin W. Richards,
                    aide-de-camp, and Capt. F. Gerker, commissary of subsistence.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>JAMES B. RICKETTS, <br> Brig.-Gen. </p>
