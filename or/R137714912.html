<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Darius Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, writes General in Chief
                    Henry Halleck in July, 1864, to report the number and location of men in his

<p>Gen. H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>July 28, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have sixty infantry, forty cavalry, and two guns in this Valley, the cavalry
                    being the permanent party of Carlisle, not of my command; two sections and forty
                    infantry at Harrisburg; one cavalry company, Lehigh District; forty independent
                    and unpaid horsemen near Emmitsburg; Veteran Reserves, twelve companies,
                    guarding hospitals, Petersburg, York, Philadelphia; provost guard, Philadelphia;
                    one company Veterans, Pittsburg. The rendezvous at Carlisle has eighty reliable
                    men. Six companies 100-days' men, unorganized into regiments, are between
                    Harrisburg and Pittsburg. Have been ordered here. I will send them to Hagerstown
                    when they arrive. Have already sent there my 100-days' mounted men--two
                    companies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
