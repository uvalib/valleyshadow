                <p>Union General James Wilson writes Colonel Forsyth regarding the September, 1864,
                    situation in the Shenandoah Valley. He reports that no troops are moving through
                    Staunton, but many wounded men are headed toward Richmond. He also mentions the
                    conversion of churches, schools and homes into hospitals.</p>

                <p>A man just in from New Market, sent to Gen. Torbert, says there are no troops in
                    Powell's Valley, and a pretty good road through if from this place to Woodstock,
                    twenty miles distant; not a soldier on the road. No troops passing from Staunton
                    to Strasburg, but there are many wounded going toward Richmond. Churches,
                    school-houses, and private residences at Woodstock and Mount Jackson turned into
                    hospitals, and people say Early was badly beaten and cannot make a stand till he
                    gets to Port Republic. They fear a movement through Luray or Page Valley.
                    Though, from the fact that the trains of the troops which were in our front
                    yesterday went by Woodstock and New Market, they will probably make a vigorous
                    defense. All the pickets say the enemy had infantry yesterday at Milford, and
                    the people of the country have a report that Kershaw was ordered back and had
                    arrived at Milford. There is no proof that this is so. In the fight yesterday
                    Col. Wells reports he heard the enemy in the woods giving commanded, "load,"
                    "fire," &amp;c., not usual in cavalry. Five thousand infantry in Page
                    Valley, either at Gooney Run, Milford, or Luray, and doubtless many other
                    places, could hold it against 40,000 men. There is a pretty fair cavalry road on
                    this side of South Fork to Luray, crossing river at Brushy Bottom, six eight
                    miles from Luray; impracticable for wagons, or nearly so. We are entirely out of
                    provisions, horses worked down, and very little in the country. What is news?</p>
