<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee instructs General John Imboden to bother the enemy in the
                    Shenandoah Valley during June, 1863. Lee also orders Imboden to cooperate with
                    commissary agents near Staunton in obtaining cattle for the army. Lee also hopes
                    Imboden will have success recruiting soldiers in the area.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. J. D. Imboden,<br> Comdg. Northwestern
                        Brigade, via Staunton:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 7, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>In view of operations in the Shenandoah Valley, I desire you to attract the
                    enemy's attention in Hampshire County, and to proceed down to Romney, or such
                    other point as you may consider best calculated for the purpose. After leaving a
                    sufficient guard on the Shenandoah Mountain, you can use the rest of your
                    command for the purpose specified. In attracting their attention and detaining
                    whatever force they may have at New Creek, Cumberland, Cacapon, &amp;c., you
                    will, of course, do them all the injury in your power by striking them a
                    damaging blow at any point where opportunity offers, and where you deem most
                    practicable. It will be important, if you can accomplish it, to destroy some of
                    the bridges, so as to prevent communication and the transfer of re-enforcements
                    to Martinsburg. After accomplishing what you can in Hampshire, should you find
                    it practicable or advantageous, you can co-operate with any troops that you may
                    find operating in the Valley. Forward to the commanding officer of the force
                    there any information that you may deem important, and comply with any
                    requisition on his part.</p>
<p>I desire you to move into Hampshire as soon as possible. Let me know the time of
                    your departure and the time of your expected arrival. In connection with this
                    purpose, it is important that you should obtain, for the use of the army, all
                    the cattle that you can. Communicate with the agents of the Commissary
                    Department you may find purchasing in the country west of Staunton, and let them
                    make arrangements to assist you in purchasing and taking care of the cattle.
                    Maj. B. P. Noland, of that department, is now in that region, making
                    arrangements for cattle. I wish you to communicate with him, if practicable. I
                    hope you will also be able, while in that country, to collect recruits for your
                    brigade, both cavalry and infantry, and bring them out with you.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
