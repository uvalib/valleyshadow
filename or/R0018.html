<p>Brig.-Gen. DURYEA, Commanding Brigade.</p>
<p>Camp near Mercerville, Md.</p>
<p>October 8, 1862</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>For your information I would respectfully present the following report of the
                    operations of the One hundred and seventh Regt. Pennsylvania Volunteers while
                    under my command in the Army of Virginia, terminating on the 31st day of August,
                    1862:</p>
<p>At the dawn of the next morning (the 29th) we were again upon the road to
                    Manassas, where we arrived before noon, and unexpectedly found it in the
                    possession of our army. After two or three hour's rest the line of march was
                    taken for another battle-field, the battle then raging with great fury near the
                    old Bull Run battle ground. At the close of the day we arrived upon the ground,
                    the battle still in progress, the rebels being strongly pressed and yielding
                    ground. The regiment, in connection with those composing the brigade, bivouacked
                    on the field while the balls and shells of the enemy were still flying over and
                    around them.</p>
<p>Soon after daylight the next morning (30th) the regiment was in line on the right
                    of the brigade, and moved forward under your orders to the conflict, forming in
                    linen of battle on the extreme right of the front line, and advancing over a
                    ridge obliquely to the left, and relieving the sharpshooters on our front, and
                    forward to a position in the little valley beyond the ridge-a point considerably
                    nearer the enemy than any previously occupied by our troops in this part of the
                    field. Being in close proximity to the enemy, whose sharpshooters were
                    endeavoring to pick off officers and men, a number of skirmishers were sent
                    forward to guard against this, and subsequently at your suggestion others were
                    sent forward, under direction of Sergt. J.H. Beamenderfer, of Company I, to
                    ascertain the locality of the enemy's batteries. I would also mention Sergt.
                    S.R. Hough, of Company A, as rendering good service in scouting at different
                    times. The regiments of this brigade upon our left about this time began to fire
                    frequent volleys, which soon brought within grape-shot range in a corn field, in
                    front a rebel battery that opened fire with great effect, you yourself receiving
                    a slight wound and contusion from the explosion of a shell. An order was then
                    given to retire some distance, as to have maintained this forward position, with
                    no battery of our own available at the time to reply to that of the enemy, would
                    have been a useless sacrifice of our brave men. The regiments on our left in the
                    brigade retired, at once, but not receiving the order, I continued to hold the
                    ground occupied by the One hundred and seventh, and soon after fell back in good
                    order under a heavy fire, and, considering the exposed position with
                    comparatively little loss. A new line was soon formed more in prolongation of
                    the general line of battle in the same wood of the former line, but believed to
                    be better protected from the enemy's batteries. Other movements were made at
                    different times during the day, under your orders, which would occupy too much
                    space to give in detail.</p>
<p>On occupying the new position the battle appeared to have slackened by a partial
                    cessation of fire on both sides. Before the regiment, with the others belonging
                    to the brigade, advanced to the position referred to, we received the
                    encouraging word that the enemy was falling back. As we occupied the old ground
                    the firing began to increase, both artillery and musketry, principally to the
                    left of our position, but gradually approaching. It was now evident that instead
                    of falling back and leaving us the victory, as supposed, they had received heavy
                    re-enforcements and were in the act of making a most desperate attempt to drive
                    our forces from the field. For hours the battle grew in volume and intensity. At
                    about 5 o'clock in the afternoon the firing was terrific in the extreme.
                    Gradually the regiments on the left of your brigade retired, and the enemy,
                    immediately in front in large force with batteries, advanced with columns of
                    infantry. The regiments on our immediate left and in our brigade retired,
                    leaving the One hundred and seventh Regiment (the order to fall back not having
                    been received by me) the only in position along the whole front of this part of
                    the field. The firing was very heavy, and was now more so than at any previous
                    time during the day, being rapidly concentrated upon us, and in the face of what
                    I think was an effective fire from our side. Being flanked on both sides, our
                    supports all gone, and in a very brief period sure to be surrounded and the
                    regiment lost, we moved back under a destructive fire in the direction of our
                    supporting regiments and others that had preceded us. As soon as we had reached
                    proper ground (having been in a thick wood nearly all the day) we rallied as
                    many of the men as practicable in the growing darkness. Meeting with you,
                    general on the same ground, rallying the brigade and soon after, with you at our
                    head, we took up the line of march to Centreville, at which point the army was
                    to concentrate for further action, and where we arrived at the dawn of the next
                    morning, being he 31st of August, 1862.</p>
<p>In reviewing the conduct of the regiment I had the honor to command during the
                    memorable operations of which the foregoing is a very brief account, it affords
                    me great satisfaction to have it in my power to say that it was uniformly such
                    as was worthy the patriotic and the brave volunteer soldier fighting in defense
                    of his beloved country and its constituted authorities. Although victory did not
                    crown their brave efforts they bravely performed every duty, and no failure to
                    accomplish any object can be chargeable to them.</p>
<p>The company, officers who were present in all or part of the foregoing fifteen
                    days' and nights' operations in Virginia were: Company A, Capt. Jacob
                    Dorsheimer, Lieuts. Theodore K. Scheffer and Oliver P. Stair; Company B, Capt.
                    J. MacThomson, Lieuts. T.H. N. McPherson and J. V. Gish; Company C, First Lieut.
                    James Corcoran, commanding company ; Company D, First Lieut. A. Wilson Norris,
                    commanding company; Company E, Capt. E.D. Roath, Lieuts. James A. Carman
                    (commanding Company C at Bull Run), and J.F. Williams; Company F, Capt. E.W.H.
                    Eisenbise, sick on the 30th (Lieut. Templeton , of same company, was in command
                    during that day); Company G, Second Lieut. E.E. Zeigler, commanding; Company H,
                    Capt. J.T. Dick, and Second Lieut. G.W. Z. Black, Company I, Capt. Henry J.
                    Sheaffer, Lieuts. W.N. Black, and D.S. Matthews, the latter rendering good and
                    faithful service as acting adjutant until August 28, when from severe illness he
                    was compelled to cease the performance of duty; Company K, Capt. A. J. Brand and
                    Lieut. Benjamin Rodes. My thanks are due to Sergt. Maj. James B. Thomas for aid
                    rendered in the battle of the 30th, during which time he was acting adjutant.</p>
<p>The field officers present and who rendered me much assistance were Lieut. Col.
                    R. W. McAllen and Maj. J. Forney, and although laboring under disease that would
                    have justified them in being relieved, they remained with the regiment for duty
                    on the march and in the engagements. The former, in making a dangerous
                    reconnaissance in the wood on our right in the battle of Bull Run, narrowly
                    escaped capture by the rebels. Quartermaster Lyon, although absent with the
                    train, was in the line of duty, and its preservation is evidence that his duties
                    were well performed. I am pleased to be assured that Commissary Sergt. J.
                    MacMontgomery performed well his difficult duties. Surgeon Hutchinson and
                    Assistant Surgeon Westcott were with the regiment in the discharge of their
                    arduous and responsible duties. Rev. W.T. Campbell, chaplain, was with the
                    regiment, and ever willing and prompt in the discharge of duty. The wounded at
                    Thoroughfare Gap were placed in ambulances, to be conveyed under his care, by
                    direction of Dr. Heard, brigade surgeon, to hospitals at Alexandria, and,
                    falling within the lines of the enemy near Manassas Junction, were detained
                    until September 7. Chaplains being exempt from capture as prisoners of war he
                    was released, and remained with our surgeons within the enemy's lines in
                    assisting to convey the wounded at Bull Run battle ground to places of comfort
                    and safety.</p>
<p>The losses, although not being extremely great-only 125 in killed, wounded, and
                    missing-have been severely felt by the regiment. The list of casualties has been
                    forwarded to your headquarters. We have to mourn the loss of a brave and worthy
                    officer in Capt. John T. Dick, of Company H, who was killed on the field, in the
                    battle of Bull Run, August 30, 1862. First Lieut. A. Wilson Norris, Company D,
                    and Second Lieut. John F. Williams Company E (the latter slightly wounded) both
                    good and esteemed officers, were taken prisoners in the same battle and
                    forwarded by the enemy to Richmond. They are now on parole, awaiting exchange to
                    enable them to rejoin the regiment. First Sergt. E.H. Green, Company E, highly
                    commended for good conduct, was also wounded and taken prisoner. The persons of
                    many brave and efficient non-commissioned officers and men are no longer to be
                    seen in the ranks. They are either dead, wounded, or prisoners. It gives me
                    pleasure to record that Sergt. Richard Hough, Company A; Sergt. J.H.
                    Beamenderfer, Company I; Corpl. H.W. Smyser; Company E, Corpl. Samuel Lehman,
                    Company G; Corpl. H. Sixrever, Company B, and Private Thomas Wheeler, Company C,
                    have been named to me as worthy to be mentioned as having shown more then usual
                    zeal and courage, and I am happy to learn that the subsequent battles have
                    increased the list of such worthy and gallant soldiers.</p>
