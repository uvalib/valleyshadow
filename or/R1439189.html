<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Phil Sheridan reports to General Grant on the September, 1864,
                    situation in the Shenandoah Valley. Sheridan discusses reports that Confederate
                    General W. H. F. Lee's cavalry had left Staunton after a flood.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gen. GRANT,<br> City Point:</p>
<p>NEAR BERRYVILLE, VA.</p>
<p>September 15, 1864.<br> (Received 16th.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have nothing new to report for yesterday or to-day. There is as yet no
                    indication of Early's detaching; and I have report that a small number of
                    pontoon-boats have passed through Winchester to Stephenson's Depot, and that W.
                    H. F. Lee's old brigade of cavalry left Staunton after the flood. These reports
                    were brought by one of our soldiers who escaped from Winchester, and I question
                    their reliability. The enemy are greatly chagrined at the capture of Henagan and
                    the Eighth South Carolina Regiment; we got the entire organization. We are now
                    getting some recruits, but in small numbers. Our increase has been from returned
                    convalescents. It seems impossible to get at the enemy's cavalry, as it is in
                    poor condition and is kept in close on their infantry.</p>
