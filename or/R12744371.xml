                    <salute>Sir:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>In accordance with a circular from brigade headquarters, issued July 30, calling
                    for a report of the operations of this regiment from the time of its leaving
                    Culpeper Court-House until its return to the same, I submit the following
                    report:</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, June 16, we left our camp near Culpeper Court-House, taking the road
                    to Sperryville; moved to that point, and encamped for the night.</p>
                <p>The 17th, passed through Washington, crossing and encamping 4 miles beyond the
                    headwaters of the Rappahannock, in Fauquier County.</p>
                <p>The night of the 18th, we encamped 1 mile in rear of Piedmont Depot, on the
                    Manassas Gap Railroad. The march for the past two days was very hot and dusty,
                    many of the men fainting and falling by the way-side.</p>
                <p>On the 19th, we reached Ashby's Gap, in the Blue Ridge, and relieved Gen.
                    Pickett's division, encamping for the night upon the top of the mountain.</p>
                <p>At 5 p. m. of the 20th, we left our camp at the Gap, and forded the Shenandoah at
                    Berry's Ford, which, from the swollen condition of the stream, was attended with
                    considerable difficulty and some danger, and encamped a short distance beyond.
                    Our regiment lost 2,370 rounds of ammunition by the fording.</p>
                <p>On Sunday (21st), we were put in motion at 4 p. m., and marched rapidly across
                    the river back to the top of the Gap, and formed into line of battle, to repel a
                    threatened attack from cavalry. In this position we remained with the other
                    regiments of the brigade until 3 p. m. of the 22d, when we returned to our camp.</p>
                <p>On June 24, we took up the line of march from Berry's Ford, passing through
                    Berryville, and encamping for the night at Summit Point, on the Harper's Ferry
                    and Winchester Railroad.</p>
                <p>Early the next day we were upon the march, passing through Smithfield and
                    Martinsburg, and encamping 1 mile beyond the latter place.</p>
                <p>On the 26th, we moved on the Williamsport road, fording the Potomac in a rain at
                    that point, passing through Williamsport, Md., and encamping for the night a
                    short distance beyond.</p>
                <p>At daylight on the 27th, we were again en route, passing through Hagerstown, Md.,
                    as early as 6 a. m.; reached and passed through Greencastle, Pa., encamping for
                    the night 5 miles in rear of Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
                <p>June 28, on the march this morning at a later hour than usual, passing through an
                    encampment just beyond the limits of the town.</p>
                <p>A portion of the 29th was spent in tearing up and burning the railroad track at
                    this place.</p>
                <p>Leaving this point on the morning of June 30, we entered and moved along the pike
                    leading from Chambersburg to Gettysburg, Pa., encamping at the village of
                    Fayetteville. At 9 p. m. of the same day, our regiment and the -- South Carolina
                    were ordered on picket duty at New Guilford, remaining until relieved next day
                    by Gen. Law, of Hood's division.</p>
                <p>On July 1, we took up the line of march for Gettysburg, crossing the mountain gap
                    after nightfall, and resting a few hours on the edge of the battle-field where
                    Gen. Hill had engaged the enemy that day.</p>
                <p>At an early hour on the morning of July 2, we were moved forward to take up
                    position in line of battle. We moved to the right of the turnpike some distance,
                    and when at Bream's Hotel (afterward our hospital), on the road leading from
                    Gettysburg to Fairfield, we were countermarched nearly to the pike that we had
                    left early in the morning, to gain the cover of a range of hills, when we again
                    moved by the right flank to a position 1 1/2 miles in front of the hotel above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>At 3 p. m. our artillery opened upon the enemy's position at the foot and upon
                    the sides of a mountain range, and at 4 o'clock our regiment, with others, was
                    ordered forward to the attack, across an open plain, 1,500 yards in width.</p>
                <p>Our orders from Gen. Kershaw were to gradually swing round to the left until
                    nearly facing an orchard, from which the enemy were pouring a deadly fire of
                    artillery. The wheel was accomplished in gallant style by the regiment, when we
                    moved forward under a galling fire of grape, shell, and cannister. When within
                    300 or 400 yards of the batteries, the order was passed along the line from the
                    right to move by the right flank double-quick. The regiment moved, in obedience
                    to this order, to the cover of a piece of woods, and formed upon the left of the
                    Seventh South Carolina Regt., which was the battalion of direction. In making
                    this move, we lost several men from the enemy's artillery fire. Sheltering
                    ourselves behind some rocks and trees, the left was directed to open fire upon
                    the artillery of the enemy, while the right was instructed to open fire upon
                    their infantry in our front.</p>
                <p>After being thus engaged for some time, we found that the right flank was very
                    much exposed, and subject to an enfilade fire. Although fighting gallantly, they
                    were gradually being pressed back. To get our right flank out of this
                    cross-fire, and prevent its flank from being too much cut up, it was ordered
                    back, holding the left at the same time firmly in its place. This made the line
                    to be at nearly an acute angle to the first line. In this position the enemy
                    advanced to within 30 yards of us, and, for more than one hour, we held him in
                    check, notwithstanding the repeated re-enforcements brought up by him.</p>
                <p>While thus engaged, about 40 men of the Fiftieth Georgia Regt., under command of
                    its major, came in on our left, and engaged the enemy. We remained in this
                    position, under a heavy fire of musketry at short range in front, and an
                    enfilading fire of grape and shrapnel from the batteries that the left had
                    failed in entirely silencing, until about dusk, when we were ordered by Gen.
                    Kershaw back to another line a short distance in our rear. Thus ended the fight
                    for the day.</p>
                <p>In this position we remained until the heavy cannonading of the 3d, when, acting
                    under orders from the general, we moved to the right about 300 or 400 yards, and
                    formed behind a stone wall, where we remained until ordered back to the first
                    line of battle formed on the afternoon of July 2.</p>
                <p>It is proper to state that Capt. R. E. Richardson's company (A) was thrown out
                    early in the day as sharpshooters, and were not in the main engagement, but did
                    good service as sharpshooters, and (with other companies from the brigade)
                    engaged a column of the enemy's infantry, which was endeavoring to gain our
                    rear. Other companies of the regiment were afterward sent as sharpshooters, who
                    performed the duty assigned them satisfactorily. The regiment went into the
                    fight in as good spirits as ever before observed, and stood their ground
                    gallantly, none leaving the field unless disabled. Our line was not broken
                    during the engagement.</p>
                <p>Our loss in the engagement was 83 killed and wounded, 2 of whom were severely
                    wounded during the cannonade of the 3d.</p>
                <p>Col. J. D. Nance arrived late in the afternoon of the 3d, and assumed command in
                    person.</p>
                <p>On the morning of July 23, while on picket at Gaines' Cross-Roads, I was placed
                    in command of the regiment again, and ordered to follow the division, which was
                    done, encamping for the night within 8 or 9 miles of Culpeper Court-House.</p>
                <p>Early on the morning of the 24th, we moved forward, passing through Culpeper
                    Court-House, and encamping on Mount Jones, on the road leading to Kelly's Ford,
                    on the Rappahannock.</p>
