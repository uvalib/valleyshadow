<p>Hon. L. P. WALKER:</p>
<p>LYNCHBURG,</p>
<p>July 28, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There have been ordered by your instructions to Lynchburg five regiments, there
                    of whom have been forwarded to and are now at Staunton, commanded by Col.
                    Hatton, Col. Forbes, and Col. Maney. These are the three first advanced. The
                    other two are commanded by Col. Fulton and Col. Savage. Part of Fulton's command
                    has already reached Lynchburg, and the remainder, with Savage's regiment, will
                    probably reach here to-day or to-night. At Haynesville and Bristol, East,
                    Tennessee, there are three regiments, commanded by Col. Battle, Col. Newman, and
                    Col. Rains, ordered there from Middle Tennessee. Your order yesterday evening
                    was to forward the two additional regiments expected here to Staunton. Under
                    your telegram to-day I have to ask whether I shall order these regiments
                    (Fulton's and Savage's) to remain here, go to Staunton, or to return to Bristol.
                    I proceed to Bristol this evening. Answer to my acting aide, Col. G. P. Smith,
                    at this point.</p>
<p></p>
<p>S. R. ANDERSON,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
