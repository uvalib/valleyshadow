<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Robert E. Lee writes President Jefferson Davis to discuss the July, 1862,
                    strategic situation. Lee speculates on Union plans in the Shenandoah Valley that
                    might involve the capture of the Virginia Central Railroad at Staunton. He also
                    remarks on the impact of rumors on civilian morale.</p>

<p>His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,<br> President
                        Confederate States:</p>
<p>Near Richmond,</p>
<p>July 18, 1862.</p>
<p>Mr. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>I have the honor to inclose a note just received from Gen. Stuart. I had directed
                    Gen. Jackson, in the uncertainty of the enemy's intentions and in the hope of
                    striking a blow at him, to take position from Beaver Dam Station to Frederick's
                    Hall, so as to be on his flank should he move from Fredericksburg to Richmond or
                    make an attempt toward Charlottesville from Culpeper. He writes me, under date
                    of 17th, that from the reports received he was under the impression that
                    Fredericksburg was being evacuated and the enemy was moving to Orange
                    Court-House. He was therefore drawing nearer Gordonsville and collecting his
                    troops at Louisa Court-House. This information from Gen. Stuart would indicate a
                    large force assembling at Winchester, which I do not credit. But it may be the
                    enemy's intention to secure possession of the Valley, for which purpose they
                    would seize the Central Railroad at Staunton and advance toward Charlottesville
                    to cut off that communication with Lynchburg. The reports are so conflicting and
                    sometimes opposing, and our people take up so readily all alarming accounts,
                    which swell in their progress, that it is difficult to learn the truth till too
                    late to profit by it. I think it is certain that heavy re-enforcements are
                    reaching McClellan, and that they will leave no stone unturned to capture
                    Richmond. I fear they will draw upon their Western army, leaving a force to make
                    ours, and thus render it unavailable to us. I hear nothing of Pemberton's troops
                    or of the conscripts from the south. We must endeavor to arouse our people. This
                    army is improving, increasing, reorganizing, and undergoing daily instruction.
                    When we get the new officers in their places, I mean the present vacancies
                    filled, their improvement will be more apparent. I need not tell you that the
                    whole division take stone from its commander. The brigade receives its share in
                    addition to what is imparted from the brigadiers.</p>
<p>I am, with esteem, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
