                <p>In July, 1861, Union troops under George B. McClellan won a series of victories
                    in what is now West Virginia. In this dispatch, Major Michael G. Harman,
                    commanding at Staunton, reports to Robert E. Lee on the strategic situation.
                    Harman had been recruiting men in the Staunton area to meet the emergency, and
                    he tells Lee he refuses to accept any volunteers for less than three years.
                    Harman also expresses the fear that Federals will enter the Valley. According to
                    Harman, this would prove disastrous due to the large unionist population he
                    believes to exist in Augusta and other counties.</p>

                    <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>After your dispatch of to-day, I have informed all that no company would be
                    received as a volunteer company for less than three years or the war, except
                    those companies that were in process of organization before the proclamation.</p>
                <p>I would earnestly suggest for your consideration and prompt action the great
                    importance of fortifying Cheat Mountain, and sending forces on the right and
                    left, so as to guard the road from Huttonsville to Huntersville, and prevent the
                    enemy from approaching the Central Railroad, at either Millborough or Jackson's
                    River, and from near Beverly, through Hardy and Pendleton, and thence to
                    Rockingham, in rear of Gen. Johnston. I would call your attention to the fact
                    that there is a very good road down on the eastern base of Cheat Mountain to
                    Huntesville.</p>
                <p>Our retreat, in my opinion, to Monterey, is disastrous to us. If not Changed, by
                    marching at once upon Cheat Mountain and taking possession of it and fortifying
                    it, so that we can hold them in check in front, and flank them on the right and
                    left, the retreat to Monterey will have a very demoralizing effect upon our
                    people. And I would urge upon you the great importance of keeping the enemy from
                    ever touching this country, for Union men, in great numbers, would be found here
                    in this county, and other counties in the valley, if the Federal troops were
                    here in force to protect them. It is necessary, to keep all our people loyal, to
                    keep the enemy from having an opportunity to tamper with many of them. Of
                    course, I would not express this opinion where it would be spoken of, as it
                    would have a bad effect; but I assure you it is nevertheless true.</p>
                <p>I hope you will not consider me as desiring to press my opinions, but my
                    knowledge of the country induces me to make these suggestions. I feel confident
                    that if Col. Scott had gone to the aid of Col. Pegram we would have gained a
                    victory instead of meeting with a serious defeat. The enemy displayed no courage
                    after defeating us on the top of Rich Mountain, or the whole force at Camp
                    Garnett would have been cut to pieces. If President Davis would take
                    twelve-months' volunteers, the call for the militia could be turned to a good
                    account.</p>
