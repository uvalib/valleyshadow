                <p>Union Colonel Ambrose E. Burnside, commanding First Regiment, Rhode Island
                    Volunteers, reports to General Winfield Scott on the movements of his regiment
                    in June, 1861. He describes arriving in Chambersburg on cars of the Northern
                    Central Railroad to join General Robert Patterson's command, camping at
                    Greencastle, and advancing into West Virginia with Harper's Ferry as an
                    objective.</p>

                </opener>
                <p>I have the honor to report that the regiment under my command, in pursuance to
                    orders from headquarters of the U. S. Army, departed from Washington on Monday,
                    June 10, for the purpose of joining the column of Maj.-Gen. Patterson, then
                    moving from Chambersburg upon Harper's Ferry. The battery of artillery attached
                    to the command, with the baggage, preceded the main body of the regiment twelve
                    hours.</p>
                <p>Early upon Monday morning we left camp, marching to the station of the Baltimore
                    and Ohio Railroad, entered the cars prepared for our transportation, and were
                    carried to Baltimore. The command was composed of 1,128 men and 117 officers,
                    accompanied by a long wagon train. The passage through Baltimore was peacefully
                    made, and, taking the cars of the Northern Central Railroad, the entire regiment
                    reached Chambersburg, Pa., on the morning of Tuesday, June 11, when I
                    immediately reported to Maj.-Gen. Patterson for duty. Still proceeding by rail,
                    we reached Greencastle at noon, and encamped. The command remained in camp at
                    Greencastle until Saturday morning, when, in conjunction with the First Brigade
                    of Maj.-Gen. Patterson's column, under command of Col. Thomas, the line of march
                    was taken up for Williamsport, Md. That place was reached at noon, and occupied
                    by the force of which this regiment formed a part.</p>
                <p>On Sunday a portion of the battery of artillery was ordered across the Potomac to
                    Falling Waters; but, in accordance with orders from Maj.-Gen. Patterson, it was
                    recalled on Monday, and the regiment, once more complete, commenced its march at
                    an early hour for Frederick City. The route lay through Hagerstown,
                    Boonsborough, and Middletown, and in these places the command was received with
                    enthusiastic demonstrations of favor. The march continued through the entire day
                    and a part of the following night, with an interval of three hours for rest at
                    Boonsborough.</p>
                <p>At 12.30 a. m. on Tuesday the regiment bivouacked in the immediate vicinity of
                    Frederick, having accomplished a march of thirty-three miles.</p>
                <p>Soon after sunrise the regiment marched into the city, and remained there through
                    the day.</p>
                <p>At 7 p. m. we left Frederick by rail and proceeded to Washington, arriving at 6
                    o'clock on Wednesday morning, June 19. It gives me pleasure to assure the
                    Gen.-in-Chief of the gratification which I feel at the bearing and conduct of
                    the command during this expedition. The fatigues of the way were endured with
                    fortitude, and had any danger threatened I have no doubt that it would have been
                    bravely met. As it is, I cannot avoid the expression of my satisfaction that the
                    object of the expedition in which this regiment participated was attained in
                    safety and without the loss of life. The command is now in an effective
                    condition for the further service of the Government of the United States.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
