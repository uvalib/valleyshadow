<p>[Capt. RYERSON,] Acting Assistant Adjutant-Gen., First
                        Brigade. </p>
<p></p>
<p>October 29, 1864.</p>
<p>SIR</p>
<p>I have the honor to forward the following report of the operations of this
                    regiment since the 26th instant:</p>
<p>Breaking camp on the afternoon of the 26th instant, we marched in connection with
                    the brigade, bivouacking late same night a mile or two beyond the Gurley house.
                    Resumed the march about 4 a.m. next morning (27th instant). Came in contact with
                    the enemy at noon, and during the engagement which followed were merely engaged
                    in shifting position, losing 6 men killed, 10 wounded; missing, as yet
                    uncertain, as they are coming in at intervals, the last report being 35.
                    Withdrawing at 1 or 2 a.m. on the 28th instant, we returned to present camp,
                    arriving at 5 p.m. or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>CHAS. KLECKNER, Lieut.-Col., Cmdg.</p>
