                <p>Robert E. Lee writes General John Imboden on July, 1, 1863, during the battle of
                    Gettysburg. He orders him to Chambersburg to relieve George Pickett's division,
                    and send it to the front. Lee also issues Imboden orders about procuring
                    supplies and guarding reserve trains.</p>

                <p>I have received your letter of 7 a. m. yesterday, from near Mercersburg. I regret
                    the capture of Capt. Irwin and part of his company at McConnellsburg, especially
                    as it appears to have been the result of want of proper caution on this part. I
                    hope it will have the effect of teaching proper circumspection in future.</p>
                <p>Upon arriving at Chambersburg to-day, I desire you to relieve Gen. Pickett, who
                    will then move forward to this place. You will, of course, establish guards on
                    the roads leading to your position, and take every precaution for the safety of
                    your command. Obtain all the flour that you can load in your wagons from the
                    mills in your vicinity, and if you cannot get sufficient, I believe there are
                    700 or 800 barrels at Shippensburg, about 10 miles north of Chambersburg, on the
                    Carlisle road. You must turn off everybody belonging to the army on the road to
                    Gettysburg. The reserve trains of the army are parked between Greenwood and
                    Cashtown, on said road, and tomorrow I desire you to move up to this place,
                    establish yourself so as to command the cross-roads and roads leading into town,
                    throw out pickets on the roads to Shippensburg, New Guilford, Chambersburg, and
                    Greencastle, and establish a separate picket at Greencastle, to turn off all
                    persons seeking the army by the direct road from Greencastle to Greenwood. It
                    will be necessary for you to have your men well together and always on the
                    alert, and to pay strict attention to the safety of the trains, which are for
                    the present placed under your charge, and upon the safety of which the
                    operations of this army depend.</p>
                <p>You will at the same time have an opportunity of organizing your troops,
                    refreshing them for a day or two, and getting everything prepared for active
                    operations in the field, for which you will be speedily wanted.</p>
                <p>Send word to Gen. Pickett at this place to-morrow, which is 8 miles from
                    Chambersburg, the hour when you will arrive here, in order that he may be
                    prepared to move on your arrival. My headquarters for the present will be at
                    Cashtown, east of the mountains.</p>

                    <salute>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
