                <p>From the most reliable information we have been able to collect the raiding force
                    in Maryland consisted of, first, Early's corps, reorganized, in three divisions,
                    under Rodes, Gordon, and Ramseur (Johnson's old), re-enforced in Virginia by
                    conscripts and convalescents to about 12,000; second, Breckinridge's corps (a
                    new one), consisting of two divisions; re-enforced by all the rebel troops at
                    Staunton, Charlottesville, Lynchburg, and in the Valley, to about 12,000; third,
                    the cavalry of McCausland, Ransom, Imboden, Rodes, Bradley Johnson, Gilmor, and
                    Mosby. Ransom seems to have had principal command. Its force is estimated by
                    good observers at from 4,000 to 6,000. All the dismounted men have been
                    remounted on stolen horses. The artillery and trains have also been supplied
                    with fresh animals. They have between twenty and thirty pieces of artillery.
                    Some, however, who prevented to have counted them, say they number much higher.
                    Many estimate the entire force at from 30,000 to 40,000. The mass of evidence
                    would make it a little less than the former number. Their loss at Monocacy and
                    near Silver Springs was considerable, but they say they have made it up by
                    volunteers and conscripts. Their captures have not been valuable, except in
                    horses. The foregoing is formed from the most reliable data that I can
                    obtain,and is about the lowest estimate. Some estimates are unquestionably very
                    much exaggerated. I give the organizations in order that you may compare them
                    with data which you have.</p>
