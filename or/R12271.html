<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel George A. Porterfield writes Robert S. Garnett in June, 1861.

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES</p>
<p>Col. R. S. GARNETT, Adjutant-Gen., Richmond Va.</p>
<p>Randolph County, Va.</p>
<p>June 11, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I omitted to state in my last report that Lieut. Col. William L. Jackson,
                    Virginia Volunteers, had reported to me for duty. He has been very active, and
                    will become a most useful officer. Col. Willey, who has also been very zealous
                    and useful, was left sick in Philippi. I have assurance that he shall be well
                    treated.</p>
<p>The enemy remains at Philippi, where they are reported to have about five
                    thousand men, and are fortifying themselves. The same number are said to be at
                    Grafton. From five hundred to one thousand are said to be at the Cheat River
                    Bridge; but of this I have no reliable information. Other forces are stationed
                    at different points on the railroads. I understand their object to be occupy the
                    western part of the State, to the Aleghanies or Blue Ridge, if possible. The
                    greatest outrages have, in numerous cases, been perpetrated upon the private
                    property of secessionists. Some militia companies have recently joined this
                    command. A regiment from Tennessee is expected the to-morrow, having in charge,
                    as I am informed, some pieces of heavy artillery. No pieces heavier than
                    6-pounders should be sent to this country, until some position is selected to be
                    fortified and a strong and reliable infantry force sent to support it. I am not
                    informed what quantity of ammunition is in Staunton. I have never received any
                    other than the most limited supplies from that place. The percussion caps sent
                    have nearly all been of small size for shot-guns and not large enough for
                    muskets. As re-enforcement are now expected, and we shall have active service in
                    this part of the State, I desire to be continued on duty here. It was not until
                    after repeated calls for aid, and when left, with a small militia force entirely
                    unprepared for the field, that I asked for duty elsewhere. Beverly is now
                    occupied by our cavalry.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>GEO. A. PORTERFIELD,<br> Col. of Volunteers, Commanding.</p>
