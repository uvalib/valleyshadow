                <p>I have the honor to report that on the 3d of May, 1864, I received orders from
                    division headquarters to march on the following morning at 4 o'clock. We left
                    camp at 4.30 a.m. on the 4th of May, crossed the Rapidan at 3.45 p.m., and
                    bivouacked near the river.</p>
                <p>May 5, marched at 7 a.m. Capt. King brought me orders to pass Gen. Seymour's
                    command and go into position near the house occupied on the preceding evening by
                    Gen. Wright. One section First Massachusetts Artillery accompanied me. Formed
                    line at 7.30 a.m., placing Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers in reserve,
                    and threw out skirmishers; soon after placed some of my command in position on
                    one of the side roads and on left of Gen. Seymour. At 12.45 received orders
                    through Capt. Allstrom to march my command to the plank road. Capt. Richards
                    came as my command was moving, and told me to wait until Gen. Willcox came. At
                    about 1.15 p.m. Gen. Willcox arrived. I showed him the dispositions I had made,
                    and then withdrew to the plank road. I massed my troops in front of the
                    Wilderness Tavern, and about a mile from it.</p>
                <p>May 6, at 1 a.m. Lieut. Waker brought me orders to attack the enemy; at 4.30 a.m.
                    I went to see Gen. Ricketts, who told me my position would be on Upton's left. I
                    immediately went to see Col. Upton, accompanied by Lieut. Waker, and conferred
                    with him. Col. Upton informed me that his line would swing around his left flank
                    as a pivot when the troops on his right advanced. He suggested that I should be
                    a little in the rear of his left, so as to be on his left after he had swung
                    around. He had received notice that the attack was postponed until 5 o'clock. I
                    again saw Gen. Ricketts, and related to him my interview with Upton. At 4.30
                    a.m. I crossed my troops from the left to the right of the road, and placed them
                    in position. The point being one of serious importance to hold, and owing to a
                    swamp having but little room, the troops were necessarily extremely crowded. My
                    brigade was in three lines, with two lines of Bartlett's command in my front.
                    About 10 a.m. the enemy commenced shelling us with an exact range upon my
                    brigade, and continued to do so at intervals throughout the day. The loss from
                    this cause was 3 killed and 19 wounded in my brigade. At about 3 p.m. I was
                    informed that Warren was authorized to call upon Upton's and Morris' brigades if
                    the enemy attempted to force his way between Warren and Burnside. Toward evening
                    Capt. Halsted, of Gen. Sedgwick's staff, brought around orders for three
                    regiments of my brigade to re-enforce troops on his right, as they had been
                    driven in by the enemy. I moved out at a double-quick the Tenth Vermont,
                    Fourteenth New Jersey, and One hundred and sixth New York. Finding that our
                    troops were retreating in such numbers that it was impossible to stop them, I
                    changed front so as to face to the right, in order to injure the enemy as much
                    as possible with my fire as he advanced. I sent a staff officer to search for
                    Gen. Sedgwick to explain my position and ask for further instructions. It
                    resulted in his coming in person, as also many of his staff, to my line. While
                    placing my three regiments as I have just explained, I was aided by Capt.
                    Judson, who displayed on that occasion great gallantry and judgment. The shells
                    of the enemy were severe upon us, and, as I have not since that time heard of
                    him, I presume he was either captured or killed. Later in the evening I was
                    instructed to move my three regiments to the breast-works in the rear, and to
                    recall the remainder of my command some hour later. Gen.'s Sedgwick and Wright
                    mentioned to me that they were going to establish a new line, and I accompanied
                    them in order that I might know where to place my troops. As soon as I knew
                    where to place my brigade, I posted three of my regiments. The remaining
                    regiments which sent Capt. Lockwood, my aide-de-camp, to bring in, I posted in
                    the breast-works.</p>
                <p>May 7, at dawn Gen. Griffin and I, following the instructions of Gen. Ricketts,
                    examined carefully the lines and placed one of my two regiments, which had
                    bivouacked in the breast-works, in its proper place, and threw out the
                    Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, Col. Schall, as picket. One hundred men
                    in addition, from the One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, were sent
                    out as pickets. Breast-works were thrown up. During the day some changes in the
                    relative position of my troops were made, owing to other troops reporting to the
                    division commander. At 9.30 p.m. we marched along the pike and plank road to
                    Piney Branch Church, through Chancellorsville. We were on the march fifteen
                    consecutive hours. The brigade was massed on the left of the road. Col. Schall
                    reported with his withdrawn pickets at about 1 p.m., 2 men only having
                    straggled. At about 2.10 p.m. May 7 marched to report to Warren; reached him at
                    3.10. About 15,000 men, I should suppose from what I could see, were drawn up in
                    a column of attack, composed of several lines. My brigade was placed in one of
                    these lines. I received instructions to regulate my movements by those of Gen.
                    Wright. Lieut.-Col. McMahon, assistant adjutant-general, brought me a peremptory
                    order from Gen. Meade to move the whole of Rickett's division to the left, and
                    said there was not time to communicate with Gen. Ricketts first, but would
                    inform him of what had been done. Col. McMahon presently ordered me to halt and
                    wait for further orders. Soon after Maj. Biddle, of Gen. Meade's staff, ordered
                    me to move still farther to the left, and place my left flank about 50 paces
                    beyond the main road, in the rear of Gen. Meade. I inquired of Gen. Meade if the
                    line was where he wished it, and he seemed satisfied. Maj. Roebling, of Gen.
                    Warren's staff, made me swing around the right of the left regiment in order to
                    face more directly the enemy. Gen. Warren subsequently made me swing forward my
                    left to the forks of the road. All this I communicated to Gen. Ricketts. About
                    midnight I took up a position in advance and threw out the One hundred and sixth
                    New York as pickets.</p>
                <p>May 9, at dawn laid at breast-works. The exterior line was withdrawn and placed
                    behind the one in the breast-works. About 10 a.m. was ordered to transfer the
                    Fourteenth New Jersey from the left of the Eighty-seventh [Pennsylvania] to its
                    right. While placing it in position I was wounded by a rifle-ball and rendered
                    unfit for service in the field.</p>
                <p>During the incessant labor of the five days' marching and fighting, I had every
                    reason to be proud of the regiments composing my brigade, the Eighty-seventh
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers, the Fourteenth New Jersey, the One hundred and sixth
                    New York, the Tenth Vermont, and the One hundred and fifty-first New York, and
                    of the coolness, judgment, and gallantry of their commanding officers, Col.
                    Schall, Lieut.-Col. Hall, Lieut.-Col. Townsend, Lieut.-Col. Fay, and Lieut.-Col.
                    Henry. The field and line officers also distinguished themselves. The small
                    amount of straggling from the command showed good discipline.</p>
                <p>A list of casualties is appended.</p>
                <p>Capt. Charles H. Leonard, my chief of staff, was untiring in his duties, and was
                    conspicuous for prompt action, personal exposure, and courage.</p>
                <p>Capt. Henry C. Lockwood, my aide-de-camp, rendered valuable service, and was many
                    times exposed to severe fire. Capt. Kimball, acting aide-de-camp, was useful and
                    indefatigable. Lieut. Oakes, acting aide-de-camp, accompanied me constantly, and
                    performed creditably the missions intrusted to his charge. My thanks are due to
                    my surgeons for their faithful attendance to the sick and wounded.</p>
