<p>Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:</p>
<p>Camp near Culpeper Court-House,</p>
<p>November 17, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>From the general reports received from the scouts yesterday, it is plain that the
                    enemy is abandoning his position around Warrenton, and does not intend to
                    advance in the direction first assumed. His troops and trains, as far as can be
                    discovered, are moving toward the Orange and Alexandria Railroad; but whether
                    with a view of massing them on that line of communication, to threaten
                    Gordonsville, or to fall down upon Fredericksburg, or to retire toward
                    Alexandria, to be transferred by water south of the James River, I cannot yet
                    discover. The railroad trains are kept in active operation; but it is not known
                    whether they are employed in carrying troops toward Alexandria or in bringing
                    them in this direction. Knowing the difficulties of his pursuing his former
                    route along the Blue Ridge, I have supposed from the half that has taken place,
                    that he intended to march upon Fredericksburg, but have learned of no
                    preparation to rebuild the wharves,&amp;c., at Aquia, or to subsist his
                    army, which would naturally precede such a movement. I think it, therefore,
                    probable that the movement in execution is with a view of transferring the army
                    south of James River, and the appointment of Gen. Burnside to the command favor
                    his supposition. I will give you further information as soon as anything
                    reliable can be ascertained. But in the mean time I beg that every preparation
                    that can possibly be made, with a view of opposing in North Carolina, may be
                    urged forward.</p>
<p>In the condition in which both corps of this army now are, I do not think it
                    advisable to advance upon the enemy, as it might injure their efficiency in
                    future operations, which I think are threatening us. Partial operations,
                    however, have been and are being made, tending to embarrass and damage the
                    enemy.</p>
<p>I learn that Col. Imboden was unable to destroy the bridging at Cheat River, in
                    consequence of the strength of the enemy in that quarter, and is in position on
                    the Shenandoah Mountains. He captured one company of the enemy, paroled the men,
                    and brought off their arms and equipments. Col. Davidson reports that the force
                    which has been threatening Staunton has retired beyond the Alleghenies.</p>
<p>I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
