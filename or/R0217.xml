                <p>In obedience to instructions from division headquarters, I have the honor to
                    report that this command left camp near Petersburg, Va., on the morning of 29th
                    of March, 1865, arriving at Dinwiddie Court-House, without opposition, and
                    bivouacked for the night. It rained all night, and next day brigade remained in
                    bivouac.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the 31st First Brigade (Gen. Davies) and Third Brigade (Gen.
                    Smith) were attacked by the enemy's cavalry and Pickett's division of infantry
                    on Chamberlain's Red. First Brigade was driven back by a superior force of the
                    enemy beyond the road leading from Dinwiddie to Five Forks, obtaining possession
                    of said road. At this juncture the Second Brigade, which had been supporting
                    Third Brigade (Gen. Smith), was ordered to attack the enemy (then driving Gen.
                    Davies) in the flank and rear. In order to carry out this order the command was
                    moved across the country about one mile in direction of the firing indicating
                    the point at which Gen. Davies was pressed. The Fourth, Sixteenth, and Eighth
                    Pennsylvania were dismounted, no enemy being in sight, and pushed forward in the
                    direction of the heavy firing; soon they encountered Pickett's division of
                    infantry advancing in line of battle. A hot engagement immediately ensued, in
                    which the enemy were driven back and held in check until the ammunition was
                    exhausted. A number of prisoners were captured and sent to the rear. The
                    position was held until the brigade was ordered to retire; the enemy followed
                    closely in line of battle. A new line was formed and they were checked and held
                    until dark, when the command retired beyond the Boydton, plank road and
                    bivouacked for the night.</p>
                <p>April 1, the brigade not actively engaged, but watching the flank. April 2,
                    brigade marched from White Oak road via Ford's Depot, on South Side Railroad,
                    and joined Gen. Merritt's command near Namozine road. April 3, drew rations and
                    forage; marched to Namozine Creek. April 4, marched on the flanks of the
                    infantry, and reported to Gen. Sheridan at 2 a.m. on the 5th. At 3 a.m., same
                    date, Gen. Davies moved out and struck the enemy's train on the Paineville road,
                    destrying wagons, capturing artillery, flags, &amp;c., and being heavily
                    attacked this brigade was ordered out to his support. When his command was
                    withdrawn this brigade was attacked by the enemy's cavalry and one division of
                    Anderson's infantry, and lost heavily, the enemy obtaining possession of the
                    field.</p>
                <p>On the 6th the brigade, taking the advance, struck the enemy's train near
                    Deatonsville, but were quickly checked by Gordon's corps. We were then withdrawn
                    and participated in the battle at Sailor's Creek. The brigade, being dismounted,
                    was the first to strike and fire the enemy's wagon train, and capturing two
                    pieces of artillery which had been abandoned and thrown into the swamp by the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>On the 7th the brigade, marching in rear, arrived at Farmville, and crossing the
                    Appomattox, took the advance on the Buckingham Court-House road and struck the
                    enemy's train two miles from Farmville, but was driven back by Rosser's division
                    of cavalry and Gordon's infantry. Gen. Davies coming up at this juncture the
                    enemy were checked by him on the right and by the reformation of the Second
                    Brigade on the left. The loss of the Second Brigade was severe; Gen. Gregg and
                    two of his staff were captured; and here that noble officer, Maj. Mays, of the
                    Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry, fell mortally wounded; Lieut. Col. J. K. Robinson,
                    Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, also was wounded in the charge. At dark the
                    brigade was relieved by Gen. Smith, and, following the First Brigade, marched to
                    Prospect Station, and encamped at 2 a.m. on the 8th. At 9 o'clock this brigade
                    took the advance, and marched via Pamplin's Station and formed junction with
                    First and Third Division near Appomattox Station, and encamped for the night.</p>
                <p>On the 9th was ordered out to the main Lynchburg road to support Gen. Smith and
                    Gen. Mackenzie, who were being forced back by the enemy's infantry. Smith was
                    retiring by the right and Mackenzie by the left oblique, and the enemy, taking
                    advantage, charged one regiment of cavalry through the interval, and came up on
                    my rear, and that instant the Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry, who had been ordered
                    to a new position, met and charged them in column, effectually routing them,
                    killing the color-bearer and capturing the colors of Fourteenth Virginia
                    Cavalry. At the same time the Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, who had been
                    dismounted, were double-quicked around by the rear and drove the enemy out of
                    the woods. At the same time the enemy attacked my left flank, but were held in
                    check by the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry until the infantry, who were close at
                    hand, relieved my command. Not finding the division commander, I reported to
                    Gen. Davies, who was engaging the enemy on the road in the direction of
                    Lynchburg, and was ordered to join him with my command. The brigade was massed
                    on the left of the road and pushed forward at a trot, when orders were received
                    to halt and cease firing. Gen. Davies sent flag of truce and a cessation of
                    hostilities was agreed upon. The command lay in the order in which it was halted
                    until the morning of the 10th, when it marched to Prospect Station; camped for
                    the night. 11th, marched to Sandy Creek; 12th, to Burkeville; 13th, to Nottoway
                    Court-House, where the brigade is now encamped.</p>
                <p>I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of the officers and men of the command.
                    I forbear mentioning the names of any officers lest I do injustice to others, as
                    all conducted themselves in the most gallant manner. To the members of my staff
                    am I specially indebted for valuable services.</p>

                    date.</p>
