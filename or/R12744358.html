<p>Col. R. H. Chilton,<br> Assistant Adjutant and Inspector
                        Gen.</p>
<p>Hdqrs. 1st Army Corps, Dept. of Northern Virginia,<br> Near
                            Culpeper Court-House,</p>
<p>July 27, 1863.</p>
<p>Col.:</p>
<p>In obedience to orders from the commanding general, my command marched from
                    Fredericksburg, on June 3, for Culpeper Court-House.</p>
<p>On the 15th, it moved from Culpeper Court-House along the eastern slope of the
                    Blue Ridge, and, on the 19th, McLaws' division was posted in Ashby's Gap, Hood's
                    at Snicker's Gap, and Pickett's supporting Hood's and guarding points between
                    the two Gaps.</p>
<p>On June 20, I received a dispatch from general headquarters, directing that I
                    should hold myself in readiness to move in the direction of the Potomac, with a
                    view to crossing, &amp;c. As I was ready, and had been expecting an order to
                    execute such purpose, I supposed the intimation meant other preparation, and,
                    knowing of nothing else that I could do to render my preparations complete, I
                    supposed that it was desirable that I should cross the Shenandoah. I therefore
                    passed the river, occupied the banks at the ferries opposite the Gaps, and a
                    road at an intermediate ford, which was practicable for cavalry and infantry.</p>
<p>On the following day, the enemy advanced his cavalry in full force against Gen.
                    Stuart, and drove him into and nearly through Ashby's Gap. I succeeded in
                    passing part of McLaws' division across the river in time to occupy the Gap
                    before night, and, upon advancing a line of sharpshooters the next morning at
                    daylight, the enemy retired. I believe that he engaged the sharpshooters
                    lightly. Gen. Stuart re-established his cavalry, and McLaws' division was
                    withdrawn to the west bank of the Shenandoah before night.</p>
<p>On the 23d, I received orders to march, via Berryville, Martinsburg, and
                    Williamsport, into Maryland. The command moved at early dawn on the following
                    day: First, Pickett's division; second, the Reserve Artillery battalions; third,
                    Hood's division, and, fourth, McLaws' division. Pickett's division and the
                    battalions of Reserve Artillery crossed the Potomac on the 25th, Hood's and
                    McLaws' divisions on the following day. The command reached Chambersburg, Pa.,
                    on the 27th, and a halt of two days was made for rest.</p>
<p>On the night of the 28th, one of my scouts came in with information that the
                    enemy had passed the Potomac, and was probably in pursuit of us. The scout was
                    sent to general headquarters, with the suggestion that our army concentrate east
                    of the mountains, and bear down to meet the enemy.</p>
<p>I received orders on the following day to move part of my command, and to encamp
                    it at Greenwood. The command, excepting Pickett's division, which was left to
                    guard our rear at Chambersburg, moved on the morning of the 30th, and the two
                    divisions and battalions of Reserve Artillery got into camp at Greenwood about 2
                    o'clock in the afternoon. Gen. Hood was ordered to put a brigade and a battery
                    on picket at New Guilford, on the road leading toward Emmitsburg.</p>
<p>On the next day, the troops set out for Gettysburg, excepting Pickett's division,
                    not yet relieved from duty at Chambersburg, and Law's brigade, left by Hood on
                    picket at New Guilford. Our march was greatly delayed on this day by Johnson's
                    division, of the Second Corps, which came into the road from Shippensburg, and
                    the long wagon trains that followed him. McLaws' division, however, reached
                    Marsh Creek, 4 miles from Gettysburg, a little after dark, and Hood's division
                    got within nearly the same distance of the town about 12 o'clock at night. Law's
                    brigade was ordered forward to its division during the day, and joined about
                    noon on the 2d. Previous to his joining, I received instructions from the
                    commanding general to move, with the portion of my command that was up, around
                    to gain the Emmitsburg road, on the enemy's left. The enemy, having been driven
                    back by the corps of Lieut.-Gen.'s Ewell and A. P. Hill the day previous, had
                    taken a strong position, extending from the hill at the cemetery along the
                    Emmitsburg road.</p>
<p>Fearing that my force was too weak to venture to make an attack, I delayed until
                    Gen. Law's brigade joined its division. As soon after his arrival as we could
                    make our preparations, the movement was begun. Engineers, sent out by the
                    commanding general and myself, guided us by a road which would have completely
                    disclosed the move. Some delay ensued in seeking a more concealed route. McLaws'
                    division got into position opposite the enemy's left about 4 p. m. Hood's
                    division was moved on farther to our right, and got into position, partially
                    enveloping the enemy's left.</p>
<p>The enemy's first position along the Emmitsburg road was but little better, in
                    point of strength, than the first position taken by these two divisions. Our
                    batteries were opened upon this position, Hood's division pressing upon his left
                    and McLaws' upon his front. He was soon dislodged and driven back upon a
                    commanding hill, which is so precipitous and rough as to render it difficult of
                    ascent. Numerous stone fences about its base added greatly to its strength. The
                    enemy, taking shelter behind these, held them, one after another, with great
                    pertinacity. He was driven from point to point, however, until nearly night,
                    when a strong force met the brigades of Maj.-Gen. R. H. Anderson's division,
                    which were co-operating upon my left, drove one of them back, and, checking the
                    support of the other, caused my left to be somewhat exposed and outflanked.
                    Wofford's brigade, of McLaws' division, was driven back at the same time. I
                    thought it prudent not to push farther until my other troops came up.</p>
<p>Gen. Hood received a severe wound soon after getting under fire, and was obliged
                    to leave the field. This misfortune occasioned some delay in our operations.
                    Brig. Gen. G. T. Anderson, of his division, was also severely wounded, and
                    obliged to leave the field. In the same attack, Gen. McLaws lost two of his
                    brigadiers (Gen. Barksdale mortally wounded, and Gen. Semmes severely wounded,
                    and since died of his wounds). The command was finally so disposed as to hold
                    the ground gained on the right, with my left withdrawn to the first position of
                    the enemy, resting at the peach orchard. During the combat of this day, four
                    pieces of artillery were captured and secured by the command, and two regimental
                    standards.</p>
<p>On the following morning our arrangements were made for renewing the attack by my
                    right, with a view to pass around the hill occupied by the enemy on his left,
                    and to gain it by flank and reverse attack. This would have been a slow process,
                    probably, but I think not very difficult. A few moments after my orders for the
                    execution of this plan were given, the commanding general joined me, and ordered
                    a column of attack to be formed of Pickett's, Heth's, and part of Pender's
                    divisions, the assault to be made directly at the enemy's main position, the
                    Cemetery Hill. The distance to be passed over under the fire of the enemy's
                    batteries, and in plain view, seemed too great to insure great results,
                    particularly as two-thirds of the troops to be engaged in the assault had been
                    in a severe battle two days previous, Pickett's division alone being fresh.</p>
<p>Orders were given to Maj.-Gen. Pickett to form his line under the best cover that
                    he could get from the enemy's batteries, and so that the center of the
                    assaulting column would arrive at the salient of the enemy's position, Gen.
                    Pickett's line to be the guide and to attack the line of the enemy's defenses,
                    and Gen. Pettigrew, in command of Heth's division, moving on the same line as
                    Gen. Pickett, was to assault the salient at the same moment. Pickett's division
                    was arranged, two brigades in the front line, supported by his third brigade,
                    and Wilcox's brigade was ordered to move in rear of his right flank, to protect
                    it from any force that the enemy might attempt to move against it.</p>
<p>Heth's division, under the command of Brig.-Gen. Pettigrew, was arranged in two
                    lines, and these supported by part of Maj.-Gen. Pender's division, under
                    Maj.-Gen. Trimble. All of the batteries of the First and Third Corps, and some
                    of those of the Second, were put into the best positions for effective fire upon
                    the point of attack and the hill occupied by the enemy's left. Col. Walton,
                    chief of artillery of First Corps, and Col. Alexander had posted our batteries
                    and agreed with the artillery officers of the other corps upon the signal for
                    the batteries to open.</p>
<p>About 2 p. m. Gen. Pickett, who had been charged with the duty of arranging the
                    lines behind our batteries, reported that the troops were in order and on the
                    most sheltered ground. Col. Walton was ordered to open the batteries. The signal
                    guns were fired, and all the batteries opened very handsomely and apparently
                    with effective fire. The guns on the hill at the enemy's left were soon
                    silenced. Those at the Cemetery Hill combated us, however, very obstinately.
                    Many of them were driven off, but fresh ones were brought up to replace them.
                    Col. Alexander was ordered to a point where he could best observe the effect of
                    our fire, and to give notice of the most opportune moment for our attack.</p>
<p>Some time after our batteries opened fire, I rode to Maj. James Dearing's
                    batteries. It appeared that the enemy put in fresh batteries about as rapidly as
                    others were driven off. I concluded, therefore, that we must attack very soon,
                    if we hoped to accomplish anything before night. I gave orders for the batteries
                    to refill their ammunition chests, and to be prepared to follow up the advance
                    of the infantry. Upon riding over to Col. Alexander's position, I found that he
                    had advised Gen. Pickett that the time had arrived for the attack, and I gave
                    the order to Gen. Pickett to advance to the assault. I found then that our
                    supply of ammunition was so short that the batteries could not reopen. The order
                    for this attack, which I could not favor under better auspices, would have been
                    revoked had I felt that I had that privilege. The advance was made in very
                    handsome style, all the troops keeping their lines accurately, and taking the
                    fire of the batteries with great coolness and deliberation. About half way
                    between our position and that of the enemy, a ravine partially sheltered our
                    troops from the enemy's fire, where a short halt was made for rest. The advance
                    was resumed after a moment's pause, all still in good order. The enemy's
                    batteries soon opened upon our lines with canister, and the left seemed to
                    stagger under it, but the advance was resumed, and with some degree of
                    steadiness. Pickett's troops did not appear to be checked by the batteries, and
                    only halted to deliver a fire when close under musket-range. Maj.-Gen.
                    Anderson's division was ordered forward to support and assist the wavering
                    columns of Pettigrew and Trimble. Pickett's troops, after delivering fire,
                    advanced to the charge, and entered the enemy's lines, capturing some of his
                    batteries, and gained his works. About the same moment, the troops that had
                    before hesitated, broke their ranks and fell back in great disorder, many more
                    falling under the enemy's fire in retiring than while they were attacking. This
                    gave the enemy time to throw his entire force upon Pickett, with a strong
                    prospect of being able to break up his lines or destroy him before Anderson's
                    division could reach him, which would, in its turn, have greatly exposed
                    Anderson. He was, therefore, ordered to halt. In a few moments the enemy,
                    marching against both flanks and the front of Pickett's division, overpowered it
                    and drove it back, capturing about half of those of it who were not killed or
                    wounded. Gen. Wright, of Anderson's division, with all of the officers, was
                    ordered to rally and collect the scattered troops behind Anderson's division,
                    and many of my staff officers were sent to assist in the same service. Expecting
                    an attack from the enemy, I rode to the front of our batteries, to reconnoiter
                    and superintend their operations.</p>
<p>The enemy threw forward forces at different times and from different points, but
                    they were only feelers, and retired as soon as our batteries opened upon them.
                    These little advances and checks were kept up till night, when the enemy retired
                    to his stronghold, and my line was withdrawn to the Gettysburg road on the
                    right, the left uniting with Lieut. Gen. A. P. Hill's right. After night, I
                    received orders to make all the needful arrangements for our retreat. The orders
                    for preparation were given, and the work was begun before daylight on the 4th.</p>
<p>On the night of the 4th, the troops were withdrawn from our line, and my command
                    took up the line of march, following the corps of Lieut. Gen. A. P. Hill. Our
                    march was much impeded by heavy rains and excessively bad roads. We succeeded,
                    however, in reaching the top of the mountain early in the night of the 5th.</p>
<p>On the 6th, my command, passing to the front, marched for Hagerstown. As our
                    exhausted men and animals were not in condition for rapid movement, I thought
                    myself fortunate when I found that I could reach Hagerstown in time to relieve
                    our trains at Williamsport, then seriously threatened. Reaching Hagerstown about
                    5 p. m., our column moved down the Sharpsburg turnpike, and encamped about 2
                    miles from Hagerstown.</p>
<p>The next day, the command was put in camp on the best ground that could be found,
                    and remained quiet until the 10th, when the enemy was reported to be advancing
                    to meet us. It was supposed at first to be a cavalry force only, but I thought
                    it prudent to move some of the infantry down on the Antietam, at Funkstown.
                    After reaching the Antietam, Gen. Stuart asked for infantry supports for his
                    batteries, and two brigades (Semmes', under Col. Goode Bryan, and Anderson's,
                    under Col. W. W. White) were sent across, as he desired. For the report of their
                    service, I refer to the report of Maj.-Gen. Stuart and the brigade commanders. A
                    line of battle was selected, extending from a point on the Potomac near
                    Downsville to the Hagerstown and Williamsport turnpike, my command on the right.
                    The troops were put to work, and, in twenty-four hours, our line was comfortably
                    intrenched. A few of the enemy's sharpshooters came up on the Boonsborough road,
                    and to within long range of our picket line on the 12th.</p>
<p>On the evening of the same day, a light skirmish was brought on by an advance of
                    a line of sharpshooters at the Saint James' College. That night our bridge was
                    completed, and, the day after, I received orders to recross the Potomac after
                    night, and the caissons of the batteries were started back about 5 o'clock in
                    the afternoon. The troops marched as soon as it was dark, my command leading.
                    Having but a single road to travel upon, our trains soon came to a halt. I rode
                    on to the bridge, to hasten the movements as much as possible, and sent my staff
                    officers to different points along the line to keep everything in motion.
                    Details were made to keep up fires to light the road at the worst points, and
                    Capt. J. H. Manning, with his signal torches, lighted us across the bridge.</p>
<p>The natural difficulties in making such movements were increased by the darkness
                    of the night, a heavy rain storm, flooding the road with mud and water, and
                    finally by one of our wagons, loaded with wounded, running off the bridge,
                    breaking it down, and throwing our wounded headlong into the river. We were so
                    fortunate, however, as to rescue them in a few moments. They were made somewhat
                    comfortable in other vehicles, and sent forward. Maj. John J. Clarke and Capt.'s
                    Henry T. Douglas and S. R. Johnston, of the Corps of Engineers, applied
                    themselves diligently to the work of repairing the bridge, and, in two hours,
                    our line was again in motion.</p>
<p>When the accident occurred at the bridge, I sent back orders for one of my
                    divisions to occupy the redoubts that had been thrown up to protect the bridge,
                    and also directed Col. Alexander to place his batteries in position on the same
                    line. As soon as the bridge was repaired, I rode back to this line, but finding
                    that the enemy was not pursuing, the troops were again put in motion. The rear
                    of my column passed the bridge at 9 o'clock in the morning, and encamped for the
                    night at Hainesville.</p>
<p>On July 19, at Bunker Hill, I received orders to march with my command for
                    Millwood, in order to obtain possession of Ashby's Gap, with a view to covering
                    our future movements. We marched early on the next day, part of the command
                    reaching Millwood at night. The Shenandoah was found to be past fording,
                    however, and the enemy had driven our cavalry from the Gap, and were in
                    possession down to the river bank. I reported this to the commanding general,
                    and continued my march on the following day for Manassas and Chester Gaps.
                    Arriving at the Shenandoah at Front Royal, it was found to be past fording, and
                    the work of laying our bridges was hardly begun. Brig.-Gen. Corse, who had been
                    hurried forward with his brigade to secure the Gaps, succeeded in passing the
                    stream with his men and several batteries. Detaching a regiment to Manassas Gap,
                    he marched his main force into Chester Gap, and succeeded in getting possession
                    of the latter some few moments before the enemy appeared. The enemy was in
                    possession of Manassas Gap, but Col. Arthur Herbert, of the Seventeenth Virginia
                    Regt., secured a strong position with his regiment, from which he held the enemy
                    in check. The rest of Pickett's division was hurried over by crossing the
                    ammunition and arms in a flat-boat, the men wading. Re-enforcements were sent to
                    Col. Herbert, when he drove back the enemy, and secured as much of the Gap as
                    was desirable. Re-enforcements were also sent to Gen. Corse, who was engaged in
                    skirmishing with the enemy, and was threatened by a strong cavalry force. The
                    cavalry withdrew about the time the re-enforcements reached him. The bridges
                    were completed about 12 o'clock at night, and the passage by our trains
                    commenced.</p>
<p>The next day the enemy appeared in stronger force in Manassas Gap, but I had
                    posted Hood's division there, under Brig. Gen. E. M. Law, and he gave us but
                    little trouble. He also reappeared at the foot of the mountain, at Chester Gap.
                    As soon as our men finished cooking their rations, Gen. Wofford's brigade, of
                    McLaws' division, was ordered to disperse the cavalry that was at the foot of
                    the mountain, and endeavor to capture his artillery. Gen. Pickett was ordered to
                    send a force down the mountain by a different route, to get in rear of and
                    intercept the cavalry. After a light skirmish with Gen. Wofford, the enemy made
                    a hasty retreat. Our march was continued, arriving at Culpeper Court-House at
                    noon on the 24th instant.</p>
<p>Gen. Benning's brigade, which had been left on picket at Gaines' Cross-Roads with
                    the Fourth and Fifteenth Alabama Regt.'s, to await the arrival of Lieut. Gen. A.
                    P. Hill's corps, were attacked by the enemy's cavalry while on the march, each
                    having a smart skirmish.</p>
<p>I desire to mention the following-named officers as among those most
                    distinguished for the exhibition of great gallantry and skill, viz: Maj.-Gen.'s
                    Pickett, Hood, and Trimble, the two latter severely wounded; Kemper, very
                    seriously wounded; Semmes, severely wounded, and since died of his wounds;
                    Pettigrew, slightly wounded; Kershaw, Law, and G. T. Anderson, the last severely
                    wounded.</p>
<p>Brig.-Gen. Barksdale was mortally wounded in the attack on the evening of the 2d,
                    while bravely leading his brigade in the assault.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. R. B. Garnett was killed while gallantly leading his brigade in the
                    assault upon the enemy's position upon the Cemetery Hill.</p>
<p>Col. Walton, chief of artillery, and Col. Alexander, Maj. Dearing, Maj. Frank
                    Huger, Maj. Eshleman, and Capt. M. B. Miller, of the Corps of Artillery, were
                    noted for the courage, zeal, and ability with which they discharged their
                    duties.</p>
<p>The troops all exhibited great determination and courage on the battle-field,
                    which, together with the fortitude and endurance subsequently shown by them
                    under circumstances of great trial, justly entitles them to our hearty thanks
                    and highest praise.</p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Pickett's division merits especial credit for the determined manner in
                    which it assaulted the enemy's strong position upon the Cemetery Hill.</p>
<p>For valuable and meritorious services on the field, I desire to express my
                    renewed obligations to the officers of my staff, Lieut.-Col. G. M. Sorrel,
                    Lieut.-Col. Peyton T. Manning, Maj.'s John W. Fairfax, O. Latrobe, John J.
                    Clarke, and Thomas Walton, and Capt.'s Thomas J. Goree, John W. Riely, and H. J.
                    Rogers.</p>
<p>Maj. S. P. Mitchell, chief quartermaster; Maj. R. J. Moses, chief commissary of
                    subsistence; Surgeon J. S. D. Cullen, medical director; Surgeons Randolph
                    Barksdale and Thomas F. Maury, and Capt. Manning, signal officer, discharged the
                    duties of their respective departments with zeal and ability.</p>
<p>Statements of the casualties of the campaign, embracing the killed, wounded, and
                    missing, have been already forwarded.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your most obedient
                        servant,</p>
<p>JAMES LONGSTREET,<br> Lieut.-Gen., Comdg.</p>
