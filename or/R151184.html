<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel of Volunteers William Gilham writes from Staunton to
                    Assistant Adjutant George Deas in July, 1861, to announce his assumption of
                    command of troops at Staunton. Gilham reports on the orders given to the troops,
                    and urges that ammunition be sent quickly.</p>

<p>Lieut. Col. GEORGE DEAS, Assistant Adjutant-Gen.:</p>
<p>STAUNTON, VA.,</p>
<p>July 20, 1861.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders received from the
                    commanding general on yesterday I at once assumed command of the troops here.
                    The Arkansas regiment, Col. Rust, left for Monterey soon after my arrival. This
                    morning I dispatched my own regiment, the Twenty-first, and Col. Burks', the
                    Forty-second, for the same point, and this afternoon the battalion of
                    provisional troops, mounted. Capt. Marye's guns and harness are here. As soon
                    after the arrival of the men and horses as possible the battery will join Gen.
                    Jackson. I shall join my command at Buffalo Gap to-night. Our forces are all, or
                    nearly all, at Monterey, I learn, and I am informed that there is some
                    disorganization among them. I wish respectfully to call the attention of the
                    commanding general to the facts that the quartermaster's and commissary supplies
                    are inadequate to the demand, and that there is a great deficiency in
                    ammunition. I consider it absolutely necessary that the requisitions for
                    ammunition for the troops in this region should be filled at once.</p>
<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WILLIAM GILHAM,<br> Col. of Volunteers.</p>
