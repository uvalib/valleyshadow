<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Quatermaster-General Montgomery Meigs writes to General in Chief Halleck to
                    reply to General George McClellan's complaints about slow delivery of supplies.
                    Meigs blames the problems on the railroads and discusses provisioning the armies
                    with clothing and horses. He mentions the loss of 51 boxes of clothing at
                    Chambersburg to Confederate General Jeb Stuart's raiding cavalry.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief, Washington,
                        D. C.:</p>
<p>Washington City,</p>
<p>October 21, 1862.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to return the letter of Gen. McClellan of the 18th instant, upon
                    the supply of clothing and of horses to the army under his command.</p>
<p>Gen. McClellan is constrained to believe that suffering for want of clothing
                    among the soldiers of his command for some time past is in a great degree owing
                    to the want of proper action on the part of the Quarter's Department. He remarks
                    that the Quartermaster-Gen. may have ordered the clothing to be forwarded, but
                    that it has not yet reached the depots of his army, and that unless greater
                    efforts to insure prompt transmission are made by this department, the articles
                    might as well remain in New York or Philadelphia, so far as the army under his
                    command is concerned.</p>
<p>Upon first hearing that there was a deficiency of supply of clothing in that
                    army, I made inquiries of those whose duty it was to attend to this portion of
                    the business of the Quartermaster's Department, and I am assured that all
                    articles of clothing called for by requisition from Gen. McClellan's
                    headquarters were not only ordered but had been shipped on the 14th of October.
                    This department cannot control the trains upon railroads of which the War
                    Department has not taken the management into its own hands. Messengers were sent
                    over the railroads by Col. Sawtelle, appointed quartermaster, assistant to the
                    chief quartermaster of the Potomac, to endeavor to facilitate and hasten the
                    transport of these stores, and Col. Sawtelle reported to me that not only had
                    they all been shipped but that the messengers could find none of them in
                    transitu, and he concluded that they must have reached the termini of the
                    railroads in Hagerstown, Frederick, or Harper's Ferry, with the exception of 51
                    boxes of clothing, which it was feared had been captured at Chambersburg by
                    Stuart's cavalry. The railroad companies complain that cars are not unloaded at
                    their destinations, and that their sidings are occupied with cars are needed for
                    forwarding supplies. I presume that the missing articles are in some of these
                    cars, or that they have been unloaded and have not yet reached the particular
                    corps or detachment for which they are intended.</p>
<p>The Secretary of War gave to Gen. Haupt (and a more capable man is not to be
                    found) an unlimited authority to do whatever was necessary, in his opinion, to
                    insure safe and rapid transit over the railroads supplying the army of Gen.
                    McClellan. He has, at the instance of the Quartermaster-Gen., within a few days
                    directed Gen. Haupt to take possession of the Cumberland Valley road, against
                    which the greatest complaints are made, and to run it as a United States
                    military railroad route, if on inspection this should appear to be necessary to
                    the public service.</p>
<p>The fact is that no railroad can provided facilities for unloading cars and
                    transacting the business attending the supply of an army of the size of Gen.
                    McClellan's in a short time or in a contracted space. Sidings, switches, depots,
                    turn-outs do not exist and cannot be laid down at once for such a traffic. I
                    believe that the railroad companies and the officers of the Quartermaster's
                    Department have worked faithfully and zealously, but too much business has been
                    thrown upon these railroads. In addition to the stores transported, they have
                    been called upon to move large bodies of troops, which interfered with the
                    transportation and delivery of stores.</p>
<p>Gen. Porter informs me that his troops need clothing still. Any deficiency which
                    may be pointed out will be filled if possible.</p>
<p>Gen. McClellan states that the number of horses received by his army since the
                    commencement of the present campaign is only 1,964, which is several thousands
                    less than reported in my letter of the 14th October to the Secretary of War. The
                    apparent discrepancy is only apparent. That letter was a report made upon seeing
                    a dispatch to you from Gen. McClellan, stating that the arrangements to supply
                    horses were insufficient; that the weekly average issue to the Army of the
                    Potomac, "including that in front of Washington" was only 150 which was not
                    enough to supply waste. That letter stated distinctly that there had been issued
                    to the "army about the Potomac" since the battles in front of Washington 9,254
                    horses, that of these, 1,500 had been sent out toward Centreville to the army of
                    Gen. Pope.</p>
<p>The statement which Gen. McClellan compares with this is a statement of the
                    horses received by assistant quartermaster stationed at Frederick, Hagerstown,
                    Harper's Ferry, and at Headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, from the 8th of
                    September to the date of the report, which is only 1,964 horses, 7,290 less than
                    the number given by the Quartermaster-Gen. as issued to the whole army defending
                    Washington from the date of the battles of Bull run to the 11th of October.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that both statements are correct. They are not inconsistent. Both
                    depend upon official reports of very different transactions. One is the whole,
                    the other a part only of the issues.</p>
<p>Upon Gen. McClellan assuming command of the troops for defense of Washington, he
                    gave orders to the chief quartermaster of the Army of the Potomac to issue no
                    horses except upon his order. I gave instructions to the chief quartermaster of
                    this depot to issue horses only as required by this order, that is to issue them
                    only upon requisitions approved by Gen. McClellan or by the staff officers
                    representing him. Some 11,000 horses have been thus issued, the only exception
                    authorized by me having been a special issue of 1,000 horses to enable Gen.
                    Bank's cavalry to scout and picket the country in front of Washington at the
                    time Stuart's cavalry raid made this of urgent importance.</p>
<p>If Gen. McClellan will instruct the officers authorized to approve requisitions
                    in his name to confine this approval to be made on the Upper Potomac, all the
                    horses will be sent there till his wants are fully supplied; but if by his
                    authority or in his name they approve requisitions for the troops in front of
                    Washington, the horses will be issued to these troops under his direction. The
                    whole 11,000 or 12,000 horses would have been sent to Harper's Ferry of
                    Frederick had he so ordered.</p>
<p>In regard to a falling off in the quality of the horses, I can only say that the
                    horses lately provided have been procured by contracts, and on specifications
                    and inspection identical with those formerly used, expecting that, finding
                    five-year-old horses liable to distemper and disease, officers providing them
                    have generally been instructed to buy no horses under six years of age. The
                    demand for horses has been so great lately that they have been carried off and
                    put to service in many cases before recovered from the fatigue and exhaustion of
                    transportation from the country by rail.</p>
<p>The railroads are heavily taxed and transportation has been delayed. A case is
                    reported in which horses remained fifty hours on the cars without food or water,
                    were taken out, issued, and put to immediate service. The horses were good when
                    shipped, and a few days' rest and food would have recruited them, but the
                    exigencies of the service, or perhaps carelessness and ignorance, put them to a
                    test which no horses could bear.</p>
<p>I do not think that the complaint of Gen. Pleasonton has any greater foundation
                    than this. The same system of purchase, the same system of inspection, the same
                    specifications, and a price fixed by public competition of bidders and
                    contractors, as heretofore, ought to procure horses of the same quality as of
                    old. The stock is not yet seriously affected by the war consumption. There were
                    6,000,000 of horses in the United States in 1860.</p>
<p>As I have learned that Gen. McClellan was of opinion that many horses could be
                    purchased quickly in the country which he now occupies, I have authorized Col.
                    Ingalls, chief quartermaster of the army under his command, to purchase 2,000
                    horses in that neighborhood. Several thousands are ordered here from more
                    distant markets.</p>
<p>Gen. McClellan's letter blames the Quartermaster's Department, of which I am the
                    head. In reply, I have sought only to show that the department has endeavored to
                    supply all the wants of his army, as far as known, and have stated the measures
                    taken for that end, and my opinion, from the investigations made, that the
                    greater part if not all the clothing required is within the lines of his army,
                    and needs only to be distributed by the force under his command.</p>
<p>The department had the supplies on hand, sent them forward, and will send forward
                    others to replace them if advised of any being lost or captured. There was no
                    intention in my letter of 14th instant to make accusations against any one. The
                    statement made you that only 150 horses had been issued weekly to the Army of
                    the Potomac, including that in front of Washington, was a mistake which I was
                    obliged to correct when the dispatch was referred to me. It is the duty of this
                    department to provide for the wants of the army, and it is my desire to do so
                    efficiently, promptly, and abundantly.</p>
<p>I regret that any officer in high command should think that the department under
                    my direction has failed to do its whole duty; but, while I cannot admit that he
                    is right in this opinion, I shall gladly avail myself of any suggestions which
                    he or you may have to offer tending to improve so much depends upon it.</p>
<p>There should be no controversy or misunderstanding between the generals and this
                    department, and there shall be none if I can prevent it. Whether the efforts the
                    department are recognized or not, they will be continued.</p>
<p>The letter of Gen. McClellan is returned herewith.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>M. C. MEIGS,<br> Quartermaster-Gen.</p>
