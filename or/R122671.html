<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Maryland Governor Thomas Hicks writes Union General Robert Patterson, commanding
                    troops at Chambersburg, to request that a detachment of soldiers be sent to
                    defend Frederick, Maryland, in June, 1861.</p>

<p>Gen. PATTERSON,<br> Comdg. U. S. Forces at or near
                        Chambersburg, Pa.:</p>
<p>FREDERICK CITY, MD.,</p>
<p>June 9, 1861.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whereas Lieut.-Gen. Scott has authorized me, by an accredited messenger, to make
                    a requisition upon you for a detachment of troops, to be sent to Frederick City,
                    if in my discretion I deem it necessary for the public welfare; and whereas the
                    city of Frederick is at any moment liable to attack by the rebels at Harper's
                    Ferry and vicinity; and whereas stores and provisions are daily sent from this
                    city and vicinity to Virginia, in aid and comfort of the enemy, I having no
                    means at my disposal of preventing said transportation of stores and provisions:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Thomas H. Hicks, governor of Maryland, do, by this my
                    requisition, call upon you for such detachment of the troops under your command
                    as you, in your military knowledge, may deem sufficient for the purposes
                    indicated, provided your response for this requisition will not interfere with
                    the safety of the great interests confided to you.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with high respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>THOS. H. HICKS.</p>
