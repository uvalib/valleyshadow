<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In mid-September, 1862, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia invaded
                    Maryland. In this dispatch, Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin informs General
                    McClellan of preparations to meet the advance. He mentions sending Union General
                    Reynolds with militia and cavalry to Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN,<br> Hdqrs. near Bolivar:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>September 15, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your glorious message just received. Look out for Jackson's column from Harper's
                    Ferry, where it has been fighting Miles for two days; also for Longstreet's
                    column, which moved from Boonsborough last night to re-enforce Lee. It is
                    thought that both will combine with Lee to give you another heavy battle. Gen.
                    Reynolds has gone to Chambersburg, and will have the 10,000 militia there
                    to-night; also 2,000 good cavalry. Part of them are from Harper's Ferry, under
                    Col. Davis. They cut their way through last night, and report that Col. Miles
                    would be obliged to surrender this morning, unless Jackson leaves to re-enforce
                    Lee against your army.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. G. CURTIN,<br> Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>
