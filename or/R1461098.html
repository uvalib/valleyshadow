<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Alfred Torbert writes General Charles Morgan in May, 1865, to
                    announce the return of cavalry from Staunton, and the parole of 750 men. He also
                    mentions guerrillas and the dispositions of Valley citizens.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. C. H. MORGAN:</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, VA.,</p>
<p>May 5, 1865.<br> (Received 11.10 a.m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Col. Reed, Twenty-second New York Cavalry, has returned from Staunton. Gen.'s
                    Rosser and Lilley left there the day before he arrived. They were trying to
                    organize a party to go south, but were meeting with no success. Col. Reed
                    paroled about 750 men. He was troubled some by guerrillas at Mount Jackson and
                    Harrisonburg. The country generally is quiet and the people well-disposed.
                    Detailed report will be forwarded in the morning. I expect to receive the
                    surrender of Lieut.-Col. White, C. S. Army, with the remnant of Dearing's old
                    brigade. He will rendezvous his command on Monday at Paris, and will probably
                    come in on the same day.</p>
