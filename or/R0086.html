<p></p>
<p>July 4, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT.</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this
                    brigade, from May 4 to 26, inclusive: On the afternoon of May 4 the brigade
                    marched from Culpeper, and encamped near Sheppard's Grove, on the road to
                    Richards' Ford. May 5, crossed the Rapidan at Ely's Ford, and advanced to
                    Chancellorsville. On the morning of May 6 I was ordered to advance with the
                    brigade and Heaton's battery to the Brock road and take up a position on the
                    right of Gen. Custer, and to endeavor to communicate with and watch the left of
                    our infantry line. If I found Gen. Custer engaged I was ordered to support him.
                    On reaching the position, I found Gen. Custer briskly engaged with the enemy,
                    who had also opened a heavy fire upon him from a battery of three guns posted in
                    a field in his front. I formed the brigade in support, and ordered Lieut. Heaton
                    to place his battery in position behind the crest of the hill in rear of
                    Custer's line, and then to run up his guns by hand to the crest, which was
                    covered with dwarf pine. By this means the guns were trained and ready to open
                    before the enemy were aware of their presence. The guns were at once opened, and
                    in a few minutes the rebel battery was driven from the ground, with a loss of
                    captain, lieutenant, several men, and 8 horses killed. The enemy made no further
                    demonstration at this point during the day. I succeeded in connecting
                    Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry with left of Second Corps, and Sixth New York
                    Cavalry with right of Gen. Gregg, near Todd's Tavern. About 5 p. m. I was
                    ordered to retire to the Furnaces, where the brigade encamped. On the morning of
                    May 7 I was ordered to march to the point occupied the day previous, Gen. Custer
                    following. We met the enemy on the road, drove in his advance, and succeeded in
                    establishing the line on the right; but, as Gen. Gregg had not yet come up on
                    the left, the enemy obstinately held the road to Todd's Tavern. A brisk skirmish
                    ensued on that road, part of Sixth New York Cavalry charging down the road, but
                    were repulsed with some loss, the enemy being dismounted and behind barricades.
                    The advance of Gen. Gregg on the left soon after compelled the enemy to retire,
                    and I was ordered to advance to Todd's Tavern, where the brigade was massed.
                    Brig.-Gen. Merritt having assumed command of the division about 4 p. m., I was
                    ordered to support the Reserve Brigade, then engaged with the enemy on the road
                    to Spotsylvania Court-House. On reaching the front I was informed by Col. Gibbs
                    that his ammunition was exhausted, and upon his request I successively
                    dismounted Sixth and Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry, and relieved all of the Reserve Brigade that my front would cover. The
                    men went in with a will and drove the enemy through the woods until dark, when I
                    fell back slightly and took up a position at the cross-roads, holding well on
                    the flanks. The brigade having advanced so far that no connection could be made
                    with our troops on the right, I was ordered to fall back to the edge of the
                    woods and encamp.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 8 I was ordered to march in rear of the Reserve Brigade, on
                    the road to Spotsylvania Court-House. The enemy were met near the point to which
                    we had driven them the night previous, and a sharp fight ensued. I was ordered
                    to support, and dismounting Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry, sent them in on the right and left of the Reserve Brigade. The enemy
                    was driven back to a strong position, barricaded along his whole front, which he
                    succeeded in holding until the cavalry was relieved by the Fifth Corps, when the
                    brigade was ordered to retire. The casualties in the brigade during the two
                    days' fighting around Todd's Tavern summed up as follows: Killed, 7 men;
                    wounded, 3 officers, 43 men; missing, 4 men; total, 3 officers, 54 men.</p>
<p>The brigade was then ordered to proceed to Silver's, on the plank road, near
                    which point in encamped.</p>
<p>THE RAID.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 9 the division, under the command of Brig.-Gen. Merritt,
                    left camp at daybreak. I was ordered to follow in rear of Custer's brigade, and
                    after crossing the Ny, Po, and Mat Rivers, reached Chilesburg, where the
                    division halted to feed. The march was resumed, and, fording the North Anna, the
                    brigade reached a point near Beaver Dam Station, on Virginia Central Railroad,
                    after dark. At this point the Sixth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth
                    Pennsylvania Cavalry were detached to destroy the railroad at the station, after
                    which the brigade encamped.</p>
<p>May 10, the brigade marched in rear of the division to Negro Foot, where a halt
                    was made. After feeding animals the march was resumed, the brigade crossing
                    Ground Squirrel Bridge, on the South Anna, after dark. The Seventeenth
                    Pennsylvania Cavalry was left on the north side to hold the bridge. The Ninth
                    New York Cavalry and Sixth New York Cavalry encamped on south side.</p>
<p>May 11, the brigade, having first burned the bridge, marched in rear of the
                    Reserve Brigade, and reached Allen's Station, on Fredericksburg Railroad, at 11
                    a. m. Parties were immediately detached to destroy the railroad as far as
                    Hungary Station. The enemy showing himself in strong force on left and front, I
                    was ordered to advance to the front and drive him from the Brook turnpike. I
                    moved to Yellow Tavern, where I found part of the Reserve Brigade. Advancing the
                    Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry through the woods on the right, I swung around
                    on the turnpike, driving the enemy from and seizing the cross-roads leading to
                    Ashland and Hanover Court-House, the point being 6 miles from Richmond. I was
                    then ordered to make a reconnaissance toward Richmond, at least as far as Brook
                    Bridge. The Sixth New York Cavalry was ordered to advance, and the two leading
                    squadrons to charge on the rebel cavalry about 500 yards in front. The enemy
                    fled, closely pursued by the Sixth for over 2 miles, across the bridge, and into
                    the outer works of Richmond. Our men were here checked until three squadrons
                    dismounted and drove the rebels from the works, the mounted men charging them
                    beyond Brook Church, and nearly to the inner works. The bells could be heard
                    ringing, locomotives whistling, and general alarm and bustling seemed to prevail
                    in Richmond. I reported the facts to the general commanding division, and was
                    ordered to hold my advanced position as well as the cross-roads, 3 miles in
                    rear. I had but two regiments (Ninth New York Cavalry having been sent to the
                    left to support Reserve Brigade), and one section Williston's battery. I
                    detached two squadrons of Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry to a cross-road
                    between Brook Bridge and my position to cover the rear of Sixth New York
                    Cavalry, and with the other four squadrons and section of battery held the
                    Ashland fork, opening upon the enemy's flank, while Gen. Custer charged him in
                    front. The Ninth New York Cavalry, which had been sent to my left, had
                    successfully charged and routed Fifth Virginia Cavalry from a strong position,
                    killing their colonel (Pate) and killing and wounding a large number of their
                    officers and men, and capturing 8 commissioned officers and 84 men, for whom
                    they have receipts, although the regiment claims to have captured 115 men and 10
                    officers. At dark I was ordered to send a reconnaissance to the Mechanicsville
                    turnpike. I ordered Maj. Hall, of Sixth New York Cavalry, on this duty with two
                    squadrons. The reconnaissance was successfully made as far as Meadow Bridges,
                    capturing an orderly with dispatches from Gen. Bragg. At midnight, I was ordered
                    to march in advance of the division and in rear of Gen. Wilson. Passed through
                    the outer works of Richmond, and about daybreak reached the vicinity of Meadow
                    Bridges. Found Gen. Wilson engaging the enemy on the right. I was here ordered
                    to send my pioneers to repair the Meadow Bridges, which the enemy were
                    endeavoring to destroy. Lieut. Cating, with 8 pioneers, drove the party from the
                    bridges and commenced work, but it was soon found that it would require a large
                    force to repair and also to keep off the enemy. working detachments were sent
                    down, and two regiments of First Brigade, armed with spencer rifles, were sent
                    in to keep the enemy in check. After some hours' labor the bridges were
                    repaired, under the direction of Gen. Custer, and I was ordered to follow the
                    First Brigade across the bridge. The enemy having erected strong works on the
                    left of the railroad, covering the bridges and road, and obstinately refusing to
                    leave them, I was ordered to support Gen. Custer with two regiments. I
                    dismounted and advanced the Ninth New York Cavalry and Seventeenth Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry on the left of the railroad. Those two gallant regiments, after coolly
                    deploying in the open field under the enemy's fire, charged full upon his
                    rifle-pits, utterly routing him and capturing a number of prisoners in the
                    works, besides 30 of the enemy's wounded found in and around the works, who
                    could not be taken off. The movement cost me some gallant officers and men.
                    Lieut. Shultz, Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, was killed, and Maj. Corrigan,
                    Ninth New York Cavalry, lost a leg, and has since died of his wounds. The enemy
                    was pursued for a mile, but having no mounted men over the bridge, we were
                    unable to reach him. After the brigade was mounted and formed I was ordered to
                    march with the division to Gaines' Mill.</p>
<p>May 13, marched with the division from Gaines' Mill to a point near Bottom's
                    Bridge, and encamped.</p>
<p>May 14, crossed the Chickahominy at Bottom' Bridge, and marched to Malvern Hill.</p>
<p>May 17, I received orders to advance with my own and Reserve brigade to the
                    cross-roads at New Market, and threaten the enemy in that direction. I placed
                    the Reserve Brigade in position near New Market, and with the Second Brigade
                    advanced to Camp Holly. From that point I ordered one regiment to proceed on the
                    Varina road in the direction of Chaffin's Bluff. The regiment (Ninth New York
                    Cavalry) returned at night, having met a party of Forty-second Battalion
                    Virginia Cavalry, who they routed, capturing 1 commissioned officer. I returned
                    to camp at Malvern Hill, and the same night marched to Long Bridge.</p>
<p>May 18, crossed the Chickahominy at Jones' Bridge, and marched to Baltimore
                    Store, and encamped.</p>
<p>May 21, marched to White House and encamped.</p>
<p>May 22, crossed the Pamunkey at night and encamped.</p>
<p>May 23, marched by King William Court-House, to the Mattapony, opposite Dunkirk,
                    at which point I was ordered to bridge the river, if possible. This I effected
                    by means of scows or ferry-boats, lashed together, anchored, and covered with
                    lumber, procured by tearing down the store-houses at the ferry. The bridge was
                    amply sufficient to cross the corps. The Sixth New York Cavalry were sent across
                    mounted, and held the roads in front.</p>
<p>May 24, the brigade marched, with the division, by Mangohick Church to Reedy
                    Swamp, where it encamped. Horses and men suffered terrible with heat and dust. I
                    had the horses led for 5 miles, and lost but few.</p>
<p>May 25, marched in rear of the division, by Chesterfield Station, to Pole Cat
                    Creek, where it encamped near the train.</p>
<p>Although diminished in numbers by the absence of one regiment (Fourth New York
                    Cavalry) an battery, the brigade sustained its well-earned reputation throughout
                    this short and sharp campaign. The regimental commandants, Col. Sackett, Ninth
                    New York Cavalry; Lieut.-Col. Anderson, Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry; and
                    Lieut.-Col. Crocker, Sixth New York Cavalry, were conspicuous at all times for
                    their gallantry and enterprise, and were well supported by their officers and
                    men. To the brigade staff, Surgeon Clarke, Capt.'s Mahnken, Wright, and White,
                    and Lieut.'s Cating and Parker, acting aides, I am indebted for valuable
                    service. The lists of casualties have already been forwarded.</p>
<p>Trusting this report may be found satisfactory, I am, very respectfully,
                        you obedient servant,</p>
<p>THOS. C. DEVIN, Col., Cmdg. Brigade.</p>
