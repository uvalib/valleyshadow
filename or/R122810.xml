                <p>I assumed command of this post on Monday last, soon after my arrival here. Since
                    that time I have been busily occupied organizing the command and mustering the
                    troops into service. I send herewith a report of the strength for May 4.
                    To-morrow I will give you a more detailed account of the forces, equipments,
                    &amp;c. All the troops have been mustered into service, except some
                    companies on detached service. I have occupied the Virginia and Maryland
                    Heights, and I am about fortifying the former with block-houses of sufficient
                    strength to resist an attempt to carry them by storm. Whenever the emergency
                    calls for it, I shall construct similar works on the Maryland Heights. Thus far
                    I have been deterred from doing so by a desire to avoid giving offense to the
                    latter State. If you have an experienced engineer officer, I hope that you will
                    order him here, if you have no duty for him elsewhere. There are four 6-pounder
                    guns here without caissons. I respectfully request that you will send the
                    caissons, and also two 6-pounder batteries and two extra 12-pounder howitzers,
                    all fully supplied with ammunition, horses, equipments, and everything necessary
                    for being turned over to companies now waiting for them. Reliable information
                    has been received that the Federal troops are at the Relay House. As four
                    thousand flints have been found here, I have taken the responsibility of
                    ordering the one thousand flint-lock rifles form the Lexington Arsenal, and also
                    the barrels of musket and then barrels of rifle powder, as in my opinion the
                    emergency justified the order. Should the Federal troops advance in this
                    direction, I shall no longer stand on ceremony. In addition to the cavalry
                    stationed at Point of Rocks, I this morning ordered two 6-pounders to the same
                    position. The enemy, from good authority, are about four thousand strong in the
                    neighborhood of Chambersburg. About two-thirds of the machinery from the musket
                    factory has been removed from here. This morning Mr. John Ambler, the
                    quartermaster in Winchester, informed me that the merchants were paying double
                    freights, and were thus securing all the transportation. To prevent the
                    consequent delay of the machinery, I directed him to impress the wagons. He also
                    notified me that the baggage cars from Strasburg were employed in carrying flour
                    from the valley to New York, and that every barrel would be required for our
                    use. To remedy this evil, until the subject could be referred to you, and also
                    to secure the transportation for the machinery, I directed him to impress the
                    cars. About four hundred and eighty Kentucky volunteers are here without arms,
                    and stand greatly in need of them. I directed some old arms to be issued to
                    them, but they refused to receive them. I refer the subject to you, with the
                    hope that something may be done towards arming them. The material is good. My
                    object is to put Harper's Ferry in the most defensible state possible, and hence
                    feel it my duty to give the best arms to the Virginia troops, as the others may
                    at any time be ordered off. The news from the northwest shows great
                    disaffection, especially in Ohio County.</p>
