                <p>In accordance with orders received, I have the honor to report the following as
                    the position of my regiment, and the part taken by it in the battle of
                    Gettysburg:</p>
                <p>At noon of the 2d of July, I was ordered to report with my regiment to Maj.-Gen.
                    Pleasonton, and was stationed in rear of a battery in the center of our line by
                    a captain on Gen. Pleasonton's staff.</p>
                <p>On reporting to Gen. Pleasonton in person, I was ordered to return to Gen. Gregg,
                    there being sufficient cavalry at that point, which was done.</p>
                <p>About 9 p. m. I received orders to report again with my regiment to Gen.
                    Pleasonton, who ordered me to picket the whole of the left of our line to the
                    east of his own headquarters and in advance of our infantry pickets.</p>
                <p>Remained here until 2 p. m. of the 3d, when the enemy being reported advancing on
                    the Littlestown road in our rear, I was ordered by Gen. Pleasonton to advance
                    toward the right and hold them in check. Found the enemy on the extreme right
                    and reported to Col. Gregg, who was engaged with his brigade, and remained there
                    until ordered to camp.</p>
                <p>On the 4th, advanced under Col. Gregg on the right.</p>
                <p>On the 5th, was ordered into Gettysburg by the York road. On the route took
                    possession of five hospitals and about 300 wounded rebels. Advanced same evening
                    to Stevens' Furnace under Col. Gregg, where 1 man of this regiment was killed by
                    the rebel rear guard.</p>
                <p>On the 6th, was ordered to advance toward Greencastle. Captured 100 rebels, 8
                    horses, destroyed about twenty caissons and gun carriages, and a large quantity
                    of ammunition and wagons. The movement was so rapid that out of 250 horses with
                    which I left Gettysburg, only 60 had been able to keep up at Marion, near where
                    I fell in with the rebel rear guard, under Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, and accordingly
                    was ordered to fall back, rejoin the brigade, and march to Chambersburg.</p>
