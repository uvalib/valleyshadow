                    into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Hampton describes the surrender of Chambersburg
                    to his forces by prominent citizens of the town. He also discusses the
                    destruction of the railroad depot, a store filled with arms, and other supplies.
                    He also mentions finding and paroling 280 wounded Union soldiers in the

<p>Maj. FITZHUGH,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
<p>MARTINSBURG, W. VA.,</p>
<p>October 25, 1862.</p>
<p>MAJ.:</p>
<p>In obedience to orders from Maj.-Gen. Stuart, I proceeded, on October 9, with 175
                    men from the Second Regiment South Carolina Cavalry, under command of Col. M. C.
                    Butler; the same number from the First North Carolina Regiment, under
                    Lieut.-Col. J. B. Gordon; 150 from the Tenth Virginia Regiment, under Maj. J. T.
                    Rosses, and 150 from the Phillips Legion, under Capt. Dunlap-in all, 650 men-to
                    the neighborhood of McCoy's Ferry, on the Potomac, where I halted the command
                    soon after nightfall.</p>
<p>Having received orders to cross the river at day light the next morning, I
                    detailed 25 dismounted men, placing them under the command of Lieut. H. R.
                    Phillips, Tenth Virginia, and stationed then on the bank of the river above the
                    ferry at a point I had selected for this squad to cross over. At 3 a. m. Lieut.
                    Phillips took his men over, wading the river. His orders were to attack any
                    force he might find on picket, and Col. Butler, with his command, was to dash
                    across the river as soon as the attack was made on the opposite side. This plan
                    was most successfully carried out, Lieut. Phillips attacking the pickets of the
                    enemy, driving them in after wounding 1, and capturing several horses. As soon
                    as possession of the ford was obtained, my brigade, accompanied by a section of
                    the Washington Horse Artillery, under command of Capt. Hart, passed over the
                    river and stuck out for the National turnpike. As my advance guard reached this
                    road, they fell in with a few of the enemy, who belonged to a large column of
                    infantry which had recently passed up the pike. Capturing these (about 10), I
                    sent a party to endeavor to take the signal officers who were near that point.
                    The officers escaped, leaving their flags, glasses, and tents, which were taken
                    by my men. The brigade then moved on through the narrow strip of Maryland into
                    Pennsylvania, and made direct for Mercersburg. This we entered without
                    opposition, and, passing through continued our march toward Chambersburg, taking
                    in our route the villages of Bridgeport, Clay Lick, and Saint Thomas. At the
                    latter a few shots were fired by some of the Home Guard, who were taken
                    prisoners. Leaving this place about 5 p. m., we pushed on toward Chambersburg,
                    in the hope of reaching that city before dark; but this could not be
                    accomplished, and when we discovered the lights of the town it was so dark that
                    no reconnaissance could be made. Not being able to ascertain if there were any
                    troops in the place, and having heard that some were there, I deemed it prudent
                    to demand the surrender of the town before taking my command into in. Placing
                    the guns then in position to command the place, I dispatched Lieut. T. C. Lee,
                    Second South Carolina Cavalry Regiment, with an escort of 25 men, to demand that
                    the town should be given up. In reply to this summons three citizens, on the
                    part of the citizens at large, came forward to ask the terms proposed. I
                    demanded the unconditional surrender of the town, assuring them at the same time
                    that private persons should be protected and private property unmolested, except
                    such as should be needed for the use of our army. These terms being agreed on, I
                    moved the brigade into the city about 8 p. m., and immediately made dispositions
                    to establish a rigid provost guard. This guard was placed under the command of
                    Capt. J. P. MacFie, Second South Carolina Cavalry Regiment, and I am happy to
                    say that good order was maintained during the whole of our stay in the city.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, the brigade was ordered to bring up the rear and to destroy
                    such public stores as could not be removed. Capt. Cowles, First North Carolina,
                    was detailed to burn the railroad depot and a store in which a large supply of
                    arms was found. As soon as the brigade left the town, Capt. W. H. H. Cowles
                    fired the depot, destroying a very large amount of arms, ammunition, clothing,
                    &amp;c. Many revolvers were taken by the men and quite a large amount of
                    clothing brought off.</p>
<p>Following in the rear the division, no matters of interest occurred during the
                    march of Saturday and Saturday night.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, when I reached Barnesville, orders were sent from Gen. Stuart
                    that I should place gun in position to command the road from Poolesville, while
                    the other gun, with two of my regiments, was sent to the front. The pickets of
                    the enemy appeared in Barnesville while I held this position, but no advance was
                    made on me. The firing in front had been going on for some time, when I was
                    ordered up. Moving rapidly toward the river, I sent the gun that was with me to
                    the ford, while I placed the South Carolina regiment and Phillips' Legion so as
                    to cover our march to the river. As soon as the two brigades in advance of me,
                    together with all the led horses and wagons, had crossed the river, Gen. Stuart
                    ordered me to put my command across. We were under the fire of the artillery of
                    the enemy while their sharpshooters were engaging mine. Placing one gun so as to
                    command all the approaches to the ford, and calling in my skirmishers, I moved
                    my column to the river and commenced the crossing. Large bodies of the enemy
                    (infantry and cavalry) appeared in my rear, but were held in check by the gun I
                    had put in position and my rear guard. As soon as my leading regiment had
                    crossed, I sent the gun over under cover of a fire from one of the guns of Lee's
                    artillery, and brought my rear guard down to protect the crossing of this
                    last-mentioned gun. All passed over in perfect safety and without the slightest
                    confusion. Not a man or a horse was lost, and the passage of the whole command
                    was made rapidly and quietly. About 290 horses were brought over by my brigade
                    and about 60 of my own horses left, broken down.</p>
<p>I was most ably aided during this expedition by my officers, while the conduct of
                    my men met my entire approbation.</p>
<p>Besides the officers commanding regiments whom I have named as having assisted me
                    so materially, I beg to commend the conduct of Capt. Macfie as provost-marshal,
                    and that of Capt. Cowles, who, after destroying the stores in Chambersburg,
                    acted with his company as a rear guard until we had crossed the Potomac,
                    rendering in this position most important services.</p>
<p>Lieut. Phillips, who first crossed the river into Maryland, conducted the affair
                    most successfully and behaved with great gallantry. On this as on every other
                    occasion the members of my staff-Capt. T. G. Barker and Lieut.
                    Hamilton-discharged their duties admirably and assisted me greatly.</p>
<p>To the officers and men of my command I have only praise to bestow, for all
                    deserved it. Hoping that the have been fortunate enough to obtain that of the
                    general commanding,</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WADE HAMPTON,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
