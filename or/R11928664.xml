                    surrender of the town, mention the location of Chambersburg bank deposits, and

                <p>Information received since my letter to you of the 11th instant confirms the
                    belief I then expressed that the army of Gen. McClellan is still in the vicinity
                    of Sharpsburg and Harper's Ferry. From a scout just returned from Maryland, I
                    learn that Sumner's and Williams' (formerly Banks') corps are at Harper's Ferry,
                    Geary on Loudoun Heights, Burnside at Sandy Hook, Hooker, Porter, Reynolds, and
                    Franklin between the Antietam and Hagerstown. Cox has been made a major-general,
                    and it is said has been ordered to Western Virginia, and the four brigades I
                    formerly mentioned I believe are ordered to the same point. The cavalry
                    expedition of the enemy, which in my former letter I reported was moving toward
                    the Rappahannock, has returned without accomplishing much, and I presume that
                    movement was the basis of the report that a large was moving toward Richmond.
                    You will see by the accompanying orders to Gen. Stuart that an expedition has
                    been sent into Pennsylvania. The slip from the Baltimore American of the 11th
                    instant, which I inclose, comprises all the information I have received since it
                    crossed the border.</p>

                    <salute>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>

                    <seg type="postscript">Inclosure.<lb/> Highly important--A rebel cavalry raid
                        into Pennsylvania--Mercersburg and Chambersburg occupied.<lb/> HARRISBURG,
                        October 10, 7.30 p.m.--Governor Curtin has just received the following
                        dispatch from Col. McClure, and Chambersburg:<lb/> Mercersburg was occupied
                        by Stuart's rebel cavalry to-day, and they are now advancing on
                        Chambersburg. They took horses and all other property they wanted at
                        Mercersburg, offering rebel scrip for it. They did no injury to individuals
                        that I have heard of. The force is estimated at 3,000. The rebels are
                        certainly advancing upon Chambersburg. They have cut the Bedford wire. They
                        are reported as near Saint Thomas, about 7 miles from here. There is no
                        doubt whatever of their being in Mercersburg. They will certainly give us a
                        call to-night. We had the rumor at 4 o'clock but it was not credited. We can
                        make no resistance, as it would only exasperate and cause wanton destruction
                        of property and life.<lb/> Later.<lb/> CHAMBERSBURG, 8 p.m.<lb/> About 15
                        men on horseback have come into town, armed with carbines and carrying a
                        flag of truce. They want to see the chief men of the town. They have a large
                        force 1 mile from the town, and will enter in an hour. Col. McClure and
                        Provost-Marshal Kimmell have gone 2 miles from the town to meet the rebel
                        commander. Nothing can be done except surrender. We look for the whole force
                        in half an hour. They crossed the Potomac at Hancock, and came over the
                        country to the Pittsburgh turnpike. The deposits of the Chambersburg bank
                        have not been returned from New York since the late raid.<lb/> HARRISBURG,
                        October 10-p.m.<lb/> Governor Curtin is now pushing troops up the
                        valley.<lb/> Still later-Chambersburg occupied.<lb/> HARRISBURG, October
                        10.<lb/> Dispatches just received from Shippensburg confirm the news of the
                        occupation of Chambersburg. The advance of the rebel force consists of 1,000
                        cavalry and six pieces of artillery.</seg>
