<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton writes General David Hunter to

<p>Maj.-Gen. HUNTER,<br> Cmdg. the Army of the Shenandoah,
                        via Beverly, Va.:</p>
<p></p>
<p>June 14, 1864</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Department has received with great satisfaction your official dispatch
                    announcing the recent brilliant victory won by your army, and their occupation
                    of the city of Staunton. These brilliant achievements wipe out the antecedent
                    disasters to our arms in former campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, and induce
                    strong hope that, led on by the courage and guided by the experienced skill of
                    its commander, the army of the Shenandoah will rival our other gallant armies in
                    the successful blows against the rebels. To yourself, and the brave officers and
                    soldiers of your command, the thanks of the President and of this Department are
                    tendered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>EDWIN M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War.</p>
