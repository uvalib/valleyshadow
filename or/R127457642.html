<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General William F. Smith writes Darius Couch, commanding the Department of
                    the Susquehanna at Chambersburg, in July, 1863, concerning cavalry forces in
                    Pennsylvania. Smith mentions ordering emergency troops raised to defend the
                    state during the Gettysburg campaign to proceed to Chambersburg.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Couch,<br> Comdg. Department of the
                        Susquehanna:</p>
<p>Hagerstown, Md.,</p>
<p>July 24, 1863.</p>
<p>Gen.:</p>
<p>I inclose Col. Franklin's report, which does not put so gloomy a face on matters
                    as was yesterday given in conversation sought for that purpose. He then stated
                    that the colonel of one of the regiments had come to him, and informed him that
                    the regiment would refuse to go on picket, and that the command was generally
                    dissatisfied with the detention here. I informed him that since he had expressed
                    the opinion that he could not depend upon any regiment to force the refractory
                    one to its duty, I would, at any time he desired, send for a couple of
                    McReynolds' regiments to enforce obedience. I also asked him to report the whole
                    matter to me in writing, that I might forward it to you. It had not reached me
                    when your note came last night. I have ordered the "emergency men" of the
                    cavalry to be sent to Chambersburg.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>WM. F. SMITH, Brig.-Gen. </p>
