                <p>Staunton served as an important base of supply during the July, 1861, defense of
                    West Virginia against General George B. McClellan's Federals. In this letter,
                    General Henry R. Jackson urges Michael G. Harman, quartermaster at Staunton, to
                    send west all available troops. Jackson also makes reference to stragglers,
                    apparently gathered at Staunton.</p>

                <p>In response to your favor of this day, I would simply refer you to my previous
                    correspondence in reference to the propriety of starting a column upon the
                    Huntersville and Huttonsville turnpike from Millborough, Central Railroad as its
                    base of supplies, and I had inferred from your favor of July 20 that you
                    concurred with me in that opinion, and had already urged it by telegraph upon
                    the President. Grieved to find that my suggestion had not been adopted, and that
                    no regiment had been sent by the way of Millbourough to support Col. Lee, and
                    confirmed in the correctness of my judgment by the recent reported movements of
                    the enemy, I forwarded to you a telegraphic dispatch to-day, looking to the same
                    end, addressed to headquarters, and desired that you should send all available
                    forces at Staunton at once to Millborough. This would seem to make my response
                    to your letter of this date unnecessary. But I am apprehensive that not to
                    respond at once may possibly occasion some delay in a movement which appears to
                    me to be all-important. I must beg, therefore, to insist that any troops
                    designed for military operations in Northwestern Virginia shall be sent, until
                    further notice, by the way of Millborough to their destination. In answer to
                    your inquiry as to what disposition is to be made of the stragglers from the
                    regiments which have suffered so greatly in the retreat from Lauel Hill, I must
                    refer your for instruction to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
