<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Army of the Potomac Chief of Staff R. B. Marcy sends orders to General Alfred
                    Pleasonton concerning the pursuit of Jeb Stuart's cavalry on raid in
                    Pennsylvania during October, 1862. Marcy mentions the strength of the
                    Confederate force that occupied Chambersburg, and passes on information received

<p>Brig.-Gen. PLEASONTON,<br> Hagerstown:</p>
<p></p>
<p>October 11, 1862 </p>
<p></p>
<p>A report from Governor Curtin this morning states the rebel cavalry force camped
                    at Chambersburg last night, and left there at 9 this morning the direction of
                    Gettysburg. Force about 2,000 strong, consisting of Stuart's and Hampton's
                    cavalry.</p>
<p>It is thought, by Mr. McClure, of Chambersburg, that they intend returning by way
                    of Frederick and Leesburg. You will at once move with your force, and all of
                    Davis' cavalry, at Hagerstown, by Cavetown and Harmon's Gap, to Mechanicstown,
                    where the Sixth Cavalry has been ordered to join you.</p>
<p>You will send scouts on the direct road from Hagerstown to Gettysburg, and also
                    to Emmittsburg and beyond, to ascertain the movements of the enemy. It might be
                    well to send citizens, if you can get them to go, and send any information you
                    may get to these headquarters by telegraph from Hagerstown or Frederick, as may
                    be most convenient.</p>
<p>You will take the best route to cut off the enemy, depending on the information
                    you obtain. Pursue them vigorously, and do not spare your men nor horses, if you
                    see an opportunity of overtaking them. They should not be allowed to escape
                    unharmed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R B. MARCY,<br> Chief of Staff.</p>
