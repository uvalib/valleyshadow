<p>Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN,<br> Attorney-Gen.:</p>
<p>STAUNTON,</p>
<p>October 1, 1861.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:</p>
<p>Some bold and daring spirits on our western border are anxious to have license or
                    authority from the Government in the form of letters of marque and reprisal, or
                    some other legal form, to attack the enemy's trade and commerce on the Ohio
                    River without hazard from civil or criminal process if captured. A gentleman now
                    in my office, Mr. James A. Crawford, who has had already some daring adventures
                    on the borders, is anxious to procure some such authorization from the
                    Government if the law will allow it. Of course so long as the enemy hold the
                    control of the river and its tributaries it would be impossible to bring the
                    vessels he might capture into a friendly port. His plan would be to bring off as
                    much property as could be wagoned away, and have it libeled in the nearest
                    Confederate court. I cannot advise Mr. Crawford as to the legal feasibility of
                    his project. May I request you to say in brief whether the Government could give
                    Mr. Crawford any authority, as though he were on the high seas, to attack, under
                    its protection, the enemy's commerce in the Ohio River, and what proceedings
                    would be required on his part in respect to property so captured. He can enlist
                    a company of twenty-five to fifty bold men in his command who, he thinks, may do
                    some effective service. I trust you will pardon the request I make for the sake
                    of the motives which dictate it, which are damage to our foes, safety to our
                    friends.</p>
<p>Truly, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>HUGH W. SHEFFEY,<br> Attorney at Law.</p>
