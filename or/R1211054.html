<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee refers to corn price regulation in Staunton during the winter of

<p></p>
<p>Col. J. D. IMBODEN, Cmdg.</p>
<p></p>
<p>December 8, 1862</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 6th, to Gen. Jackson, has been referred to me. I regret that
                    you were prevented by the snow-storm from making your descent upon Col. Latham.</p>
<p>As regards the supply of corn for your horses, I am informed that the
                    Quartermaster-Gen. at Richmond has regulated the prices of all kind of forage at
                    Staunton, which prices will have to be paid until altered by the same authority.
                    Should you not be able to provide properly for your horses, it may be necessary
                    to change your position. There is plenty of forage in Greene, Madison, and
                    Culpeper Counties.</p>
<p>Gen. W. E. Jones has been left in command of the valley by Gen. Jackson for the
                    present, with whom you had better kept in communication, as it may be necessary
                    to unite the forces there. Your letter will be forwarded to the Secretary of
                    War, at Richmond.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE, <br> Gen.</p>
