<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During June, 1861, Joseph E. Johnston commanded Confederate troops in the
                    Harper's Ferry vicinity. In this letter, Robert E. Lee writes Johnston
                    concerning the defense of Harper's Ferry. He mentions that several companies of
                    reenforcements have been sent from the supply and recruiting base of Staunton,
                    VA.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,</p>
<p>Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,<br> Commanding, &amp;c,
                        Harper's Ferry, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>June 1, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>In answer to your letter of the 31st ultimo, received by Col. H.A. Edmundson, I
                    have to state that, since my letter to you of this morning, I have directed all
                    the available companies at Staunton to proceed to Harper's Ferry and to report
                    to you for duty. The First Tennessee Regiment, now at this place, Col. Turney,
                    has also been directed to report to you as soon as practicable. With this
                    re-enforcement, and such as you may be able to obtain from the valley, you may
                    probably hold your position and prevent the passage of the Potomac by hostile
                    troops until further troops can reach you. I think that no troops from Ohio have
                    yet reached Grafton, as a special messenger from Col. Porterfield reports the
                    contrary, and that certain bridges on the Parkersburg road had been burned. Some
                    little time must therefore elapse, in all probability, before a movement can be
                    made against you from that direction. Information of the movements of troops in
                    that direction might be obtained from friends in that region. Should you,
                    however, be opposed by a force too large to resist, I can only repeat what is
                    contained in my letter of this morning, viz, destroy everything that cannot be
                    removed which may be of advantage to the enemy. Deprive them of the use of the
                    railroad, take the field, and endeavor to arrest their advance up the valley.</p>
<p>I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R.E. LEE,<br> Gen., Commanding.</p>
