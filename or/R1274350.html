<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In June, 1863, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia invaded Pennsylvania in
                    what became the Gettysburg campaign. In this dispatch, Army of the Potomac
                    commander Joseph Hooker responds to early reports of Lee's movements, including
                    news of enemy forces at Chambersburg.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. Halleck,<br> Washington:</p>
<p>Fairfax Station,</p>
<p>June 17, 1863--9.20 p. m.<br> (Received 10.40 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am in constant receipt of copies of dispatches from Gen. Couch with regard to
                    enemy at Chambersburg. Is there, in your opinion, any foundation for the
                    reports? All my cavalry are out, and I have deemed it prudent to suspend any
                    farther advance of the infantry until I have information that the enemy are in
                    force in the Shenandoah Valley. I have just received dispatches from Pleasonton,
                    dated 4.15 p. m. He ran against Fitzhugh Lee's brigade of cavalry near Aldie,
                    and from prisoners learned that Stuart is at Middleburg; and it is further
                    reported that there is no infantry on this side of the Blue Ridge. When the
                    orderly left, Pleasonton had charged and driven Lee out of Aldie. All my cavalry
                    are out.</p>
<p>Has it ever suggested itself to you that this cavalry raid may be a cover to
                    Lee's re-enforcing Bragg or moving troops to the West?</p>
<p></p>
<p>JOSEPH HOOKER,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
