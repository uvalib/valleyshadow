<div id="mainResults">
<p><b>Summary:<br></b>On May 8, 1862, Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson launched his Valley
                    campaign by attacking and defeating troops under Robert Milroy at McDowell. In
                    the aftermath, Milroy scrambled to discover Jackson's next movements. In this
                    letter to his commanding general, John C. Fremont, Milroy reports on
                    intelligence gathered by his scouts, including the movement of troops on trains
                    in the Staunton area.</p>

<p>Gen. FREMONT:</p>
<p>CAMP MILROY,</p>
<p>May 10, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gen. Schenck, I presume, has kept you fully advised of all matters of importance
                    that have transpired in this part of the detachment since he joined me. Two of
                    my most valuable scouts, who were over in the vicinity of Staunton at the time
                    Jackson's and Johnson's forces advanced across the Shenandoah, got in this
                    evening through many narrow escape. They report that they were on the North
                    Mountain, near Buffalo Gap, the day of the fight at McDowell, and that after
                    Jackson's forces had left three large trains arrived from the direction of
                    Staunton filled with soldiers, who disembarked, and the trains went back, and
                    that from various sources they had learned that Jackson's and Johnson's forces
                    united were about 14,000 previous to the re-enforcements.</p>
<p>My scouts to-day report the enemy's pickets, cavalry and infantry, within 12
                    miles of this place, which is not defensible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R. H. MILROY,<br> Brig.-Gen.</p>
