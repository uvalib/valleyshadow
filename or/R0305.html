<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Brig. Gen. John Buford commanded the First Division of the Army of the Potomac
                    which included the 17th Pennsylvania Cavalry. This report is part of a series of
                    correspondences by Buford about the day preceding the battle and the battle
                    itself.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. Reynolds.</p>
<p>Gettysburg</p>
<p>June 30, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Reserve Brigade, under Gen. Merritt, is at Mechanicstown with my trains. Gen.
                    Pleasonton wrote he would inform me when he relieved it. To-day I received
                    instructions saying it would picket toward Hagerstown and south. I am satisfied
                    that A. P. Hill's corps is massed just back of Cashtown, about 9 miles from this
                    place. Pender's division of this (Hill's) corps came up to-day--of which I
                    advised you, saying, "The enemy in my front is increased." The enemy's pickets
                    (infantry and artillery) are within 4 miles of this place, on the Cashtown road.
                    My parties have returned that went north, northwest, and northeast, after
                    crossing the road from Cashtown to Oxford in several places. They heard nothing
                    of any force having passed over it lately. The road, however, is terribly
                    infested with prowling cavalry parties. Near Heidlersburg today, one of my
                    parties captured a courier of Lee's. Nothing was found on him. He says Ewell's
                    corps is crossing the mountains from Carlisle, Rodes' division being at
                    Petersburg in advance. Longstreet, from all I can learn, is still behind Hill. I
                    have many rumors and reports of the enemy advancing upon me from toward York. I
                    have to pay attention to some of them, which causes me to overwork my horses and
                    men. I can get no forage nor rations; am out of both. The people give and sell
                    the men something to eat, but I can't stand that way of subsisting; it causes
                    dreadful straggling. Should I have to fall back, advise me by what route.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>JNO. BUFORD.</p>
