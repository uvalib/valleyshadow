<p>Capt. Carey:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p>July 9, 1863</p>
<p></p>
<p>I visited Greencastle this a. m. Took the Williamsport pike to near Cunningham's
                    Cross-Roads; then over to Muttontown, or Middleburg. While on the latter trip,
                    we saw a number of wagons foraging; gave chase, and had a skirmish with some 80
                    infantry. We drove them, but were unable to get the wagons, as it was within 1
                    mile of their camp. We retraced our steps to Middleburg, and then here. While at
                    Middleburg, I learned that Lee's headquarters were on the pike between
                    Hagerstown and Williamsport, and a corps is camped on one side of the road this
                    side of Hagerstown; another, near Hagerstown, and another on the Leitersburg
                    road. One hundred men of the First New York Cavalry are here, besides my
                    command. Gen. Couch, I learn, is at Shippensburg; will be here to-morrow.</p>
<p>Received order about returning to Waynesborough. Will attend to it.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>WM. H. BOYD.</p>
