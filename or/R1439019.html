<p><b>Summary:<br></b>General Phil Sheridan commanded Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley during late
                    summer and fall, 1864. In this dispatch, Sheridan reports to Chief of Staff
                    Halleck on August operations in the Valley. He reports a Confederate force under
                    Longstreet marching north from Staunton.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Camp at Cedar Creek,</p>
<p>August 12, 1864--12 midnight.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>I have the honor to report the following operations of my command to-day:</p>
<p>In my dispatch of last evening I reported my advance near Stephensburg or
                    Newtown. This morning at 5 a. m. I resumed the march on Middletown, near Cedar
                    Creek, the cavalry and Sixth Corps passing through Newtown, the balance of the
                    command marching across the country direct on Middletown, the whole command
                    concentrating on Cedar Creek, near where the Strasburg pike crosses the creek,
                    the enemy moved last night across Cedar Creek to Strasburg. All his trains were
                    moved around by the Back Creek Valley road, crossing Cedar Creek high up and
                    moving on Strasburg or Woodstock. A portion of my cavalry was detached at
                    Stephensburg and struck the Back Creek Valley road, and followed the trains to
                    the crossing of Cedar Creek, but did not succeed in capturing them. The enemy
                    have made some show of resistance in front of Strasburg. I am yet unable to
                    determine its character, and could not get my command sufficiently in hand to
                    attack him this evening. I will have to make a slight delay here to get up my
                    supply trains from Harper's Ferry. They should reach Winchester to-night, coming
                    here to-morrow forenoon. I regret that Grover's division was not permitted to
                    come to Harper's Ferry, as I intended to use it as a strong guard for the
                    subsistence trains. As they are now, the trains will be under the escort of
                    Brig.-Gen. Kenly's brigade (which is very small) as far as Winchester, and one
                    of Gen. Wright's brigades from Winchester here. The prevailing report is that
                    Longstreet's corps is marching from Staunton to support Early, and Grover should
                    have been permitted to have come out. Gen. Duffie has not yet joined me, nor has
                    Gen. Averell or Gen. Wilson. Gen.'s Wilson and Duffie should have been here by
                    this time, particularly the latter. A telegram from Capt. Leet and also one from
                    Gen. Max Weber locates Longstreet in the Valley, marching here. A telegram from
                    Lieut.-Gen. Grant received on the 9th stated that his (Longstreet's) corps was
                    still at Petersburg. I would like to hear from Lieut.-Gen. Grant in reference to
                    the truth of this report. Gen. Early's train is a very small one-not to exceed
                    250 wagons--and the stories about accumulated plunder from Maryland are entire.
                    I am exceedingly anxious to hear whether Longstreet has left to come here or
                    not.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN,<br> Maj.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
