<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin writes to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in
                    July, 1864, to arrange for the defense of Pennsylvania against General Jubal
                    Early's Confederate forces threatening the line of the Potomac. He asks whether
                    the Federal government plans to provide Pennsylvania with troops or pay any
                    troops raised by the state. Curtin also mentions suggestions by General Darius
                    Couch, commanding at Chambersburg, to call out state forces.</p>

<p>Hon. E. M. STANTON,<br> Secretary of War:</p>
<p>HARRISBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>July 4, 1864.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following is a copy of the last dispatch I have from Gen. Couch:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, 4TH.<br> At 3 yesterday Gen. Sigel telegraphed me from
                    Shepherdstown, that at 6 a. m. yesterday the enemy, commanded by Gen.'s Early
                    and Ransom, attacked his force at Leetown and Darkesville. All stores were sent
                    off in cars and wagons from Martinsburg, and afterward he withdrew his force to
                    Shepherdstown. He does not know strength of the infantry of the enemy, but says
                    they have 2,600 cavalry. The enemy also sent 1,100 cavalry into his rear by way
                    of North Mountain. He had no communication with Gen. Kelley or Hunter since 10
                    a. m. yesterday.<br> D. N. COUCH,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
<p>In dispatch received in the night and this p. m. he asks me to call out forces. I
                    desire, as usual, to aid, and beg to know what is desired to that end, as at
                    this time, by calling on the old Reserve Corps, it is probable we could get
                    thirteen regiments in a few days, and the two regiments ordered by the Gen.
                    Government for 100 days in Philadelphia could be promptly filled for this
                    service. No doubt you are fully informed of the strength and movements of the
                    rebel army, and I desire to know if the Government is prepared to protect this
                    State, or the service of our people is required for that purpose. I wish to know
                    immediately if call will be made, as last year, for troops to be mustered into
                    the service of the State, and will the United States equip and subsist and pay
                    them?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A. G. CURTIN,<br> Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>
