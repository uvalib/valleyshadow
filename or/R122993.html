<p><b>Summary:<br></b>During July, 1861, Federal troops under George B. McClellan advanced into West
                    Virginia and won a series of victories. Staunton, VA, served as an important
                    base of supply during the campaign. In this letter, Robert E. Lee informs
                    General Henry R. Jackson that supplies have been sent to Staunton to provide for
                    retreating Confederates.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p>HEADQUARTERS OF THE FORCES,</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. H. R. JACKSON, Army of the Northwest,
                        Monterey, Va.:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>July 23, 1861.</p>
<p>GENERAL:</p>
<p>I have received your two letters of the 20th, reporting the state of militia
                    operations in the northwest. You have done all under the circumstances that was
                    proper, and all will yet be well.</p>
<p>Our brave troops must bear up against misfortune. Reverses must happen, but they
                    ought only to stimulate us to greater efforts. I regret my inability to repair
                    to your assistance, but events occurring in our front prevented. I am sure the
                    glorious victory there achieved will cheer the hearts of your troops.</p>
<p>At the first report of the retreat from Beverly, anticipating your wants, I
                    ordered ammunition, tents, blankets, cooking utensils, and shoes to be sent to
                    you. But, unfortunately, they were sent, by mistake, to Gen. T. J. Jackson, at
                    Winchester. A duplicate supply of the articles have been forwarded to Staunton.
                    Gen. Loring, an officer of experience, has been assigned to the command of the
                    Army of the Northwest, and he is accompanied by officers who have served years
                    on the frontier.</p>
<p>Four Virginia regiments, one Arkansas, three Tennessee, and two Georgia
                    regiments, and two field batteries are ordered to join the Northwestern Army.
                    This force, with what ought to be organized from the hardy mountaineers, will be
                    sufficient to drive back the invaders. There is a necessity for repelling them,
                    and it must be done. Every assistant will be afforded in this quarter.</p>
<p>Respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen., Commanding.</p>
