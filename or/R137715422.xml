                <p>D. McConaughy writes Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin on July 31, 1864, with a
                    detailed report on the burning of Chambersburg. He discusses the entrance of
                    Confederates into the town, the ransom demanded for Chambersburg's safety, and
                    gives detailed descriptions of the damage including specific houses, public
                    buildings, and businesses. He reports on the losses of the Eyster family, and
                    estimates the total cost of the damage to the town as a whole. He also mentions
                    that a meeting of citizens selected Reverend John Warner to serve as ambassador
                    to other northern cities in attempts to secure relief for the town.</p>

                <p>Our scouts, Dr. Taylor and William H. Crawford, reached Chambersburg after 6 p.
                    m. evening of 30th. Left there at 8. 30 p. m., and just returned. Report 600
                    mounted rebels, under Gen. McCausland, having entered Chambersburg 6 a. m.
                    yesterday, Saturday, 30th, made a demand on the town for $600,000, $100,000 in
                    gold and balance in Government notes, and accompanied it with threat to burn the
                    town if not complied with within three hours. The rebels immediately began to
                    plunder, and within an hour, before 8 a. m., applied the torch, commencing with
                    town hall, Franklin House, and the private houses until they had fired the whole
                    central portion of town, embracing twenty squares, extending from railroad depot
                    on north to German Reformed Church on Washington street on south, fire squares,
                    and from where Franklin railroad crosses Market street on east to King street on
                    west, four squares, wholly destroying also dwellings and factories elsewhere.
                    All the hotels and boarding-houses are destroyed, Wonderlich and Steed's
                    warehouse, and all the public buildings, except public school, jail, and
                    railroad depot. Rebels left Chambersburg at 1 p. m., going north, taking
                    McCausland with them drunk. Averell's force was within eight miles, between
                    Greencastle and Fayetteville, during Friday 29th night and Saturday, and did not
                    enter Chambersburg until 3 p. m. Hunter's forces, reported at 3,000, passed
                    trough Chambersburg northward on Friday night. Averell overtook rebels at Back
                    Creek, near old cavalry camp, four miles north, fighting them at dusk, and sent
                    some prisoners in. Another strong rebel column crossed on Friday at Edwards
                    Ferry. Its direction not known. Learned from soldier who saw them cross. Capt.
                    Eyster's family is safe, but saved nothing but the clothes they had on. Gross
                    barbarities were practiced by the rebels. Lowest estimate of loss is $1,500,000.
                    A public meeting of citizens was held in afternoon, and Rev. John R. Warner
                    appointed to go to the Northern cities and make an appeal in behalf of the
                    suffering people. Will send out other scouts.</p>
