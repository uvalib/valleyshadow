<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union Adjutant Fitz-John Porter writes from the Department of Pennsylvania,
                    stationed at Chambersburg, to Colonel Lew Wallace, commanding troops in the
                    field, in June, 1861. Porter instructs Wallace to halt his men at Cumberland and
                    cross the Potomac, gather information on the Confederate forces, encourage
                    unionists, and locate stores and forage.</p>

<p>HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,</p>
<p>Col. LEWIS WALLACE,<br> Eleventh Indiana Regiment,
                        Cumberland, Md.:</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pa., </p>
<p>June 6, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I am instructed by Maj.-Gen. Patterson to direct you to halt your forces at
                    Cumberland, securing the bridges over the Potomac and Green Spring Run,
                    respectively, five and fifteen miles upon this side, and there to await further
                    orders from him. He also instructs me to add in his name, as follows: Gather as
                    much reliable information as possible of the disposition of the people of
                    Maryland and Virginia in that vicinity, and extend your inquiries by secret
                    agents south into Virginia and east along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio
                    Railroad. Encourage the Unionists in disaffected regions to band together for
                    self-defense, and to take heart from the support the Government has already
                    given and the protection now given to them. By a kind, yet firm, course on your
                    part, and by the good deportment of your troops, secure the confidence and
                    good-will of the community in which you may be located. Let the inhabitants feel
                    you are in their midst as friends and protectors. Should you gain information of
                    the gathering, for offensive movements, of armed bodies of men not too powerful
                    to be overcome by a force you can safely detach, capture or rout them by
                    surprise, if possible, and seize and held as prisoners of war all parties
                    injuring the lines of communication, or arrayed or plotting against the peace of
                    the United States; ascertain the resources of the country, with a view of
                    subsisting your command (perhaps to be largely increased), and drawing as little
                    as possible provisions and stores from this or other distant regions.</p>
<p>The commanding general desires you to report in full your operations and any
                    information gained on matters of importance, and from time to time, as occasion
                    may offer, he would be pleased to hear from you on such topics as you may deem
                    of interest.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. J. PORTER,<br> Assistant Adjutant-Gen.</p>
