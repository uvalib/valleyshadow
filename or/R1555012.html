<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Confederate Colonel George Hull reports to Colonel John Baldwin, commanding at
                    Staunton, on a January, 1862, battle at Huntersville.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Col. JOHN B. BALDWIN, Cmdg. Post, Staunton, Va.</p>
<p>POST MONTEREY, VA.,</p>
<p>January 4, 1862.</p>
<p>COL.:</p>
<p>Yesterday about 1 o'clock the enemy advanced and took possession of Huntersville.
                    Our forces offered but little resistance, their numbers, as I understand from a
                    member of the Tennessee cavalry, begging only about some 200 men, while that of
                    the enemy could not be correctly estimated, but supposed to be about 4,500.</p>
<p>Our command at Huntersville is now on its road to this place and will be in
                    to-night. I cannot give you an account of the fight, but sure it is that the
                    town and all our stores are in the hands of the enemy, unless it be that a barn,
                    in which some of the commissary stores were placed, was burned, as fire was
                    communicated to it; but it might have been extinguished by the enemy, who were
                    near at the time of setting fire to it. Nothing new from Alleghany.</p>
<p>Very respectfully, yours,</p>
<p>GEO. W. HULL,<br> Col., Cmdg. Post.</p>
