<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In this July, 1862, letter, George D. Ruggles, General Pope's Chief of Staff,
                    informs Union General Franz Sigel of Confederate movements toward Staunton along
                    the Virginia Central Railroad. Ruggles orders Sigel to send out scouts in the
                    Staunton area.</p>

<p>Maj.-Gen. SIGEL,<br> Commanding First Corps d'Armee,
                        near Sperryville, Va.:</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.,</p>
<p>July 21, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Information has been received that a considerable force of troops of the enemy
                    has passed up the Virginia Central Railroad toward Gordonsville. It is stated
                    that their probable destination was Staunton; some believe it was Lynchburg.
                    Push your cavalry out as far as possible toward Staunton. Send out scouts and
                    spies to ascertain if there is a considerable force of the enemy in the
                    neighborhood of, or east of Staunton. Spare no expense in this regard. Keep
                    these headquarter, fully advised of such information as you may be able to
                    obtain.</p>
<p>By command of Maj.-Gen. Pope:</p>
<p>GEO. D. RUGGLES,<br> Col. and Chief of Staff.</p>
