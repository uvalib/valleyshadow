                <p>I have the honor to submit the following statement concerning the events of May
                    12 last at Spotsylvania Court-House, which immediately preceded the battle:</p>
                <p>On the night of the 11th, in riding around my lines, I found the artillery which
                    had occupied a position at the Salient-a point which with artillery was strong,
                    but without it weak-leaving the trenches and moving to the rear. I inquired the
                    cause of the moving, and was informed that it was in obedience to orders, and
                    that a general move of troops was contemplated. About the same time, or soon
                    after, scouts and officers on the picket-line and brigade commanders informed me
                    that the enemy were moving to the right and concentrating in my front, and all
                    concurred in the opinion that my lines would be assaulted in the morning. I
                    concurred in this opinion and communicated the facts that led me to believe that
                    I would be attacked to you about 12, or between 10 and 12 o'clock on the 11th,
                    at the same time requesting that the artillery which had been withdrawn should
                    be sent back to its original position. At the same time I ordered my command to
                    be on the alert, some brigades to be awake all night, and all to be up and in
                    the trenches an hour or so before daylight. This order was obeyed. At the first
                    intimation of the advance of the enemy I went to the trenches. Soon after my
                    arrival there a heavy column assaulted my right (Steuart's brigade), which after
                    a fierce conflict, was repulsed with the assistance of two pieces of artillery.
                    Immediately after this a very heavy column debouched from the pines about half
                    or three-quarters of a mile from my works, and advanced upon the Salient, held
                    by Jones' brigade. I then found that the artillery which had withdrawn the night
                    previous had not returned, but looking I saw it just coming in sight. I
                    dismounted, went into the trenches, collected all the men possible to hold the
                    enemy in check until the artillery could get into position and open upon this
                    column, which came up in large numbers, but in great disorder, with a narrow
                    front, but extending back to the rear as far as I could see. I ordered the
                    artillery to drive up at a gallop. They did so. The enemy were held in check
                    somewhat by the infantry fire, but the artillery did not get into position, nor
                    did it fire a shot upon this column before they were captured. I felt confident
                    that a few shots would disperse this force, which offered so fair a mark to
                    artillery, hence I remained to the last endeavoring to check them until the
                    artillery could get into position. There was no surprise. My men were up and in
                    the trenches prepared for the assault before the enemy made their appearance.
                    The first assault on the right with two pieces of artillery and one brigade was
                    handsomely repulsed. The main attack would have been repulsed had any artillery
                    [been] on the line which could have possibly swept the ground over which they
                    advanced. The ground was over open fields with abatis in front for some
                    distance.</p>
