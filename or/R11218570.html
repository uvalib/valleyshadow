<p>Maj. Gen. FRANZ SIGEL:</p>
<p>Randolph County, Va.,</p>
<p>August 13, 1862.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have the honor to report that I have ascertained to a certainty no troops of
                    any consequence in Staunton or Charlottesville. Jackson's headquarters few miles
                    from Gordonsville, with 35,000 men. Thirty thousand men at Gordonsville.
                    Jackson's men concealed. Left our horses at Alleghany Mountain and went on foot.
                    Had a great deal of difficulty. Could not report sooner. My companion badly
                    wounded. Have succeeded in getting him here. Could have reported sooner only on
                    his account. Fired into by 60 guerrillas. Ewell about making arrangements to
                    furnish all his guerrillas with pack mules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>C. W. D. SMILEY.</p>
