<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General Robert Patterson, commanding at Chambersburg, responds to Maryland
                    Governor Thomas Hicks' June, 1861, request for troops to protect Frederick,
                    Maryland. Patterson assures Hicks that his command, which included Maryland,
                    will do all in its power to protect the state.</p>

<p></p>
<p>His Excellency THOMAS H. HICKS,<br> Governor of
                        Maryland:</p>
<p>CHAMBERSBURG, PA.,</p>
<p>June 10, 1861.</p>
<p>GOVERNOR:</p>
<p>In response to the communication of the 9th instant, with which you have honored
                    me, and to the call for protection you make upon the troops under my command, I
                    have to inform you that the public interest in your vicinity, as well as in
                    other portions of your State, have received my devoted attention, and that I am
                    preparing to protect and secure you against molestation by the common enemy of
                    our country; and I assure you that the people throughout your State, and
                    especially in the vicinity of Frederick, shall have protection so soon as I can
                    extend it consistently with the safety of other important interests confided to
                    me and movements, one object of which is to rid you forever of the parties of
                    whom you complain.</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. PATTERSON,<br> Maj.-Gen., Commanding.</p>
