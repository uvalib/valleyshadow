                    <salute>DEAR GEN.:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Maj. Gen. J. E. B. STUART,</p>
                <p>Cmdg. Cavalry Corps, Army Northern Virginia:</p>
                <p>I have noticed several communications in North Carolina papers from men in
                    Ramseur's brigade charging the "Stonewall" with misbehavior at Chancellorsville
                    on the 3d of May. As I was in command of the brigade during most of the day,
                    Gen. Paxton having fallen before we were actually engaged, I feel it my duty to
                    notice the charge. Gen. Ramseur asserted on the field, as I have heard, "that
                    his brigade had run over this one," but has since addressed me a communication
                    in which he says he was mistaken. Being aware that the action of the brigade was
                    under your eye during a greater part of the engagement, I am desirous, should it
                    meet with your approval, of having your opinion as to its action, and, with your
                    permission, to publish it in conjunction with Gen. Ramseur's letter.</p>
                <p>Early on the morning of the 3d, Gen. Paxton advanced toward the works on the
                    right of the Plank roads, but fell before reaching them; a fact of which I was
                    not aware. The brigade moved on over the works, behind which lay a line of
                    troops, became hotly engaged upon reaching the brow of the hill about 100 yards
                    in front of them, the enemy occupying the works near the frame house, and
                    extending into the woods on our right, which enabled them to enfilade our whole
                    line. As we had no support on our right, we were formed to retire to the works,
                    when, while reforming my regiment, I was informed of Gen. Paxton's death, and of
                    the brigade, with orders to move forward. This order was delivered by Col. [A.
                    S.] Pendleton. I at once put the brigade in motion, the Twelfth Georgia on my
                    right, and carried the works near the frame house. The troops on our left gave
                    way, when we were subjected again to an enfilade fire, and forced to retire.
                    This is but a brief statement of facts. I know the brigade performed its part
                    well, and regret that its conduct has been brought into question.</p>
                <p>I hope you will pardon this trespass upon your time, and will favor me with an
                    answer. I make this request at the suggestion of the officers of the brigade.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute>
