<p>Capt. A. E. DANA, Assistant Adjutant-Gen., First Cavalry
                        Division.</p>
<p></p>
<p>September 1, 1864.</p>
<p>CAPT</p>
<p>I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this brigade
                    from July 4, 1864, to September 1, 1864:</p>
<p>July 4, marched to and encamped at junction of telegraph and Light-House Point
                    roads. July 16, marched to Jerusalem plank road, on the left of the army, and
                    relieved the Second Cavalry Division and Bryan's Provisional Brigade, then
                    picketing that flank. July 19, the pickets of the brigade were attacked and
                    driven in by the enemy's infantry, who were immediately repulsed and the line
                    re-established. July 20, were relieved by Chapman's brigade, of Third Cavalry
                    Division, and returned to camp on telegraph road. July 26, marched to Appomattox
                    River, crossed on pontoons, thence to James River, crossing by pontoons to
                    Jones' Neck, from which point the brigade marched to Deep Bottom, arriving on
                    the morning of July 27. The same day marched to New Market road, where the
                    brigade encamped.</p>
<p>July 28 the brigade was ordered to support the Reserve Brigade, which has been
                    heavily attacked, and the left of which forced back by Wilcox's division of
                    rebel infantry. I immediately ordered the Sixth and Ninth New York and
                    Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry to prepare to fight on foot (the Fourth New
                    York had been previously sent on a reconnaissance in the Charles City road.)
                    While this order was in process of execution the enemy's line of battle appeared
                    on the crest overlooking our position near the New Market road. To carry the
                    enemy's position it was necessary to cross the men by file (on the run) through
                    two passages across a swamp and ditch, and form on the bottom under the crest
                    and the enemy's fire. This was quickly effected; I formed the squadrons as they
                    passed through, and ordered the Ninth New York Cavalry to gain the woods on the
                    enemy's right flank; the Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry were ordered to
                    support the Ninth New York, and as soon as the order was in process of execution
                    I ordered the Sixth New York Cavalry to charge up the crest. The enemy, confused
                    by the rapid and effective fire of the Ninth New York on their flank and the
                    renewed attack of the Reserve Brigade on their left, retired precipitately when
                    charged in front by the Sixth New York, and the brigade, closing in upon them,
                    inflicted severe punishment, capturing seventy-two prisoners (besides a number
                    of wounded), two battle-flags, and killing and wounding a large number of the
                    enemy. The enemy showing a disposition to reform and advance, McIntire's section
                    of Heaton's battery (which had already opened a heavy fire from the bottom) was
                    ordered on the crest, and its splendid practice soon drove the enemy from the
                    woods, where he was massing. The brigade was soon after relieved by Gibbon's
                    division, of Second Corps. The Seventeenth Pennsylvania were ordered to take up
                    a part of the new line for a time, but were retained until 10 p.m., and did not
                    retire until they found the infantry had retired and left their flanks exposed.
                    This short but brilliant engagement reflected great credit on the regiments
                    engaged, and established the fact that our cavalry can dismount and with their
                    carbines successfully repulse their own front of veteran infantry. Col. Cesnola,
                    with the Fourth New York Cavalry, was for a time cut off from the command, but
                    succeeded in coming in, with the loss of one man wounded and a few horses.</p>
<p>I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>THOS. C. DEVIN, Brevet Brig.-Gen., Cmdg.</p>
