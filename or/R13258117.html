<p>Maj.-Gen. HALLECK,<br> Gen.-in-Chief:</p>
<p></p>
<p>January 17, 1864. (Received 3.30 p. m.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your telegram to Gen. Meade has just been received. Gen. Meade has not returned.
                    Scouts from these headquarters returned this morning. Report Longstreet has had
                    no re-enforcements from Lee of late, and that Heth's division that went to
                    Staunton on Christmas is returning to its old camps. A deserter from the First
                    Maryland Cavalry (rebel), who left his regiment on the 13th instant, states no
                    re-enforcements have been sent away from Lee's army to Longstreet of late, and
                    everything is quiet.</p>
