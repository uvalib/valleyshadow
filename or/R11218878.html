<p><b>Summary:<br></b>In early May, 1862, Confederate Thomas J. Jackson prepared to launch an offensive
                    in the Shenandoah Valley. Robert E. Lee, then acting as commander in chief of
                    Confederate forces, orders General Richard Ewell to cover Jackson's advance on
                    Staunton.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p></p>
<p>Maj. Gen. R. S. EWELL,<br> Cmdg., &amp;c., near
                        Stanardsville:</p>
<p>Richmond, Va.,</p>
<p>May 1, 1862.</p>
<p>GEN.:</p>
<p>Your letter of the 30th ultimo, with the inclosure, is received. A letter from
                    Gen. Jackson of the 29th ultimo apprised me of a movement toward Staunton which
                    he had in contemplation, and which is doubtless that referred to by you. This
                    explains the necessity of your occupying the place of Gen. Jackson until his
                    return. All the information I have received confirms your intelligence with
                    regard to the force of the enemy in front of the Rappahannock toward Manassas.
                    It is desirable to remove the supplies in the country referred to by you, but I
                    do not know how it can be done. The cattle, horses, &amp;c., might be driven
                    off, and I advise that you continue to accumulate stores at Gordonsville for
                    your command. You will keep your command in readiness to move toward
                    Fredericksburg or to co-operate with Gen. Jackson in any movement he may make
                    against the enemy at the White Plains or Salem, as occasion may require.</p>
<p>I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen., Cmdg.</p>
