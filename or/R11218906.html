<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Robert E. Lee took command of Confederate forces defending Richmond on June 1,
                    1862. In this letter to Secretary of War George Randolph, Lee discusses sending
                    reinforcements to Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley. Lee also mentions his orders
                    that Major Harman, commanding at Staunton, gather all available troops, raise
                    the community in that vicinity, and march to Jackson's aid.</p>

<p>Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Near Richmond, VA.,</p>
<p>June 5, 1862.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I wrote to His Excellency the President this morning about re-enforcements for
                    Gen. Jackson. The troops from Georgia you propose sending him I believe form a
                    part of Gen. Lawton's brigade. I wish they were mine; but with the North
                    Carolina Battalion, if they can join him, will fill up his ranks. He ought to
                    have more, or these will not materially aid him. His plan is to march to Front
                    Royal and crush Shields. It is his only course, and as he is a good soldier, I
                    expect him to do it.</p>
<p>I telegraphed yesterday to Maj. Harman at Staunton to collect all the troops in
                    that vicinity, raise the community, magnify their numbers, and march down the
                    valley and communicate with Jackson. It will shake Shields and make him pause.</p>
<p>Very respectfully,</p>
<p>R. E. LEE,<br> Gen.</p>
