<p>Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War, Richmond:</p>
<p>Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p>December 1, 1861.</p>
<p>SIR:</p>
<p>I am now pushing the sick and munitions to the rear as rapidly as possible, and
                    have given orders to all trains to go back lightly loaded with train and return
                    with supplies a large amount having collected both at Monterey and Huntersville.
                    Since my last letter I have heard of a movement of the enemy, except that they
                    are sending their spare troops near the railroad to Romney. The information
                    comes to me through a reliable spy, sent to Philippi and Laurel Hill. From what
                    he could learn they sending any troops from Cheat or Beverly in that direction.</p>
<p>I came here to-day to carry into effect the proposed campaign, and find a
                    telegram sending four regiments to Manassas. It is proper to state that, in
                    consequence of movements made, in which I have been endeavoring to carry our
                    your instructions, officers at a distance from my headquarters have been
                    telegraphing without my authority to Richmond, the result of which has been a
                    conflict or orders.</p>
<p>One of the objects I had in bringing the regiments to Staunton was that they
                    should not only be ion the spot for the contemplated movement, but should be in
                    readiness for any emergency.</p>
<p>With respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>W. W. LORING,<br> Brig.-Gen., Cmdg., &amp;c.</p>
