<p><b>Summary:<br></b>Union General John Pope reports to Chief of Staff Henry Halleck on his August,
                    1862, instructions to General Jacob Cox commanding forces in the Kanawha Valley.
                    Pope ordered Cox to move on Staunton, VA.</p>

<p>Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,<br> Cmdg. U. S. Army:</p>
<p>Near Sperryville, Va.,</p>
<p>August 5, 1862</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some four weeks since I directed Gen. Cox, who has about 11,000 men in Kanawha
                    Valley, to intrench 2,400 at or near the mouth of Gauley, so as to cover the
                    valley of Kanawha below that point, and to hold himself in readiness with the
                    remainder of his force, about 8,000 strong, to move forward in the direction of
                    Staunton. A large part of the force which then confronted him has joined Jackson
                    since, under the command of Loring.</p>
<p>I propose, with your consent, to direct Cox to move forward at once to Covington
                    or Jackson's River (on maps James River really), and thence, by the way of Warm
                    Springs and Augusta Springs to Harrisonburg, at which place he can readily join
                    this command. The road is good, and he reports that he will be able to make the
                    march to Harrisonburg within ten days. Though somewhat hazardous, I should
                    prefer that instead of the route I have mentioned. He should pursue the turnpike
                    from Covington to Lexington and thence to Staunton, for its effect in
                    threatening Lynchburg and the railroad leading west from Richmond. Will you
                    please advise me at once what you think of the movement?</p>
<p></p>
<p> JNO. POPE,<br> Maj.-Gen.</p>
