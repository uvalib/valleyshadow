                    William was a 46 year old farmer who resided near Staunton. He voted for the
                    Ordinance of Secession and at the outbreak of war served in a cavalry unit for
                    two months. The claim was disallowed.</p>

                    against the United States to the end thereof, my sympathies were constantly with

                    or offered or sought or attempted to do anything by word or deed to injure said
                    cause or retard its success and that I was at all times ready and willing if

                    near my house, just across the road.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4. Ans. The property was taken in June 1864 by soldiers belonging to <abbr
                        expan="Generals">Gen<hi rend="super">ls</hi></abbr> Hunter's command.
                    I suppose there were probably 200 present. They were only a few minutes in
                    taking the property.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5. Ans. Lewis Hill was present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6. Ans. There were officers present. I think one Major, and several

                    The Corn &amp; Rye was taken in bags by the soldiers they were all mounted.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9. Ans. I suppose the property was taken to Staunton. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10. Ans. I never saw the property after it was taken, and do not know how
                    it was used.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11. Ans. I asked the soldiers not to take the Stallion, but they persisted
                    in doing so. I made no other complaint.</p>

                <p>Ques. 13. Ans. The property was taken about 12 o'clock in day time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14. Ans. <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>
                    Hunter was encamped at Staunton distant 5 miles. The Army had been encamped
                    there 3 or 4 days I think. They left the day following the taking of my
                    property. There had been a battle at Piedmont, in Augusta Co. on Sunday
                    previous. I knew no names of any officer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15. Ans. The Stallion was 4 years old, of good size, in fine order. He rode
                    finely and worked well. I think he was worth $200. The soldier that rode him
                    said was worth it. The bay Mare was <add hand="h1" place="inline">6</add> years old, in fine order and of
                    medium size, well broken and worth $100. The Grey Mare was 14 years old she was
                    in good condition, had a Colt at her side which I kept and raised. She was well
                    broken and worth $65. The Heifer was 3 years old, very fat. The Calf was 6 weeks
                    old, a very large and fine Calf. They were worth what is charged. I had measured
                    the Corn &amp; Rye (mixed) when I put it in the garner, and there had none
                    been taken out. It was well worth $1 per bushel. I recieved no pay at all.</p>

                <p>Ques. 6. Ans. There were officers present. I did not hear names or rank. I did

                <p>Ques. 9. Ans. I suppose the property was taken to the camp. I did not follow to
                    the camp.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10. Ans. I do not know what use they made of the property.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11. Ans. The claimant asked them not to take his property but the soldiers
                    said that they always took such good stock when they found it.</p>

                <p>Answer to first general question.</p>
                <p>My name is John W. Gladwell, my age is 45 years. I reside near Staunton. My
                    occupation a Shoemaker. I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in
                    the claim. I have known the claimant 15 years. I resided about two miles from
                    him. I saw him frequently nearly once a week. We conversed about the War. I was
                    opposed to the rebellion and the claimant knew my position. I have often heard
                    him denounce secession and say that he hoped or wished the Union might prevail.
                    I have heard him converse in the presence of other Union men and he was at all
                    times the same firm Union man. I think he had the confidence of his Union
                    neighbors. I never heard his loyalty doubted. I never knew him to do anything to
                    aid the rebellion. I know that he <orig reg="gave">give</orig> all the aid he
                    could to Union men to keep <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> the rebellion. I do not think if the South had
                    gained an independence the claimant could have proven any loyalty to the
                    Confederate Government. I have often heard him say that if the war should so
                    terminate he would have to leave, and I do not think he could have remained in
                    the South.</p>

                <p>My name is Joseph H. Bailey, my age is 31 years. My occupation a farmer. I reside

                    claimant nor have no interest in the claim. I have known the claimant about 15
                    or 16 years. I lived about 3/4 mile from him during the war. I was very intimate
                    with him, and saw nearly every day. I was a Union man myself nad known such by
                    the claimant. I talked with him often about the war and he was always opposed to
                    it. He said that he would never be forced to fight against the United States. As
                    far as I know his reputation among Union man was that of a true loyal Union man.
                    I never knew him to do anything in aid of the rebellion. He was private to all
                    the plans of Union men, who were escaping the Confederate service. I never
                    doubted his fidelity to the Union. I believe he was as good a Union man as was
                    in the country. I heard of threats being made to his wife by rebel soldiers who
                    were in pursuit of him. From my knowledge of the claimant he could not have
                    proven any loyalty to the Confederate States, if they had succeeded. I do not
                    think he ever did anything to favor the rebellion by his own free will and

                <p>Answer to 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> general question.</p>
                <p>My name is Harvey Gladwell, my residence near Arbor Hill, Augusta County. My age
                    is 26 years by occupation a shoemaker. I am not related to the claimant and have
                    no interest in the claim. I had a slight acquaintance with the claimant about
                    the commencement of the war. I lived about one mile from him a part of the war.
                    The war had progressed for some time. I do not recollect of having any
                    convesation with the claimant about the war until in the fall of 1864. I then
                    heard him say that he did not intend to fight in the war and he made the
                    impression on my mind that he was a Union man. I could as a loyal man myself
                    confide in him and he never deceived me. I never heard his Union sympathies
                    doubted by the Union men of the neighborhood though there were but very few of
                    that class in the neighborhood. I do not know that he ever did anything for
                    either the Union or rebel cause. From the fact of his escape and concealing
                    himself from the rebel authority I do not think he could have proven loyalty to
                    the South, if it had succeedd its gaining independence.</p>
