                <p>Abner Shumake filed this claim in 1871 for $75, claiming the Union army under
                    General Sheridan's command took one horse in 1864. Shumake was a 47 year old

                <p>Claimant was a merchant and took Oath of Allegiance to the Confederacy. Had a
                    nephew in the Confederate Army till he got him across the lines. His Sympathies
                    were for the Union - Such is the Substance of his Statement. The only Witness he
                    calls to his loyalty is his son who was Nine Years old when the War commenced,
                    and who swears to his loyal talk etc.</p>
                <p>When a Man takes the Oath of Allegiance to the Confederate States, it is
                    presumptive evidence that he intends to keep it and the act is an act of
                    unquestionable disloyalty to the United States, and inconsistent with the
                    Character of a loyal adherent to the Cause of the Union and the Government of
                    the United States, when such oath is taken voluntarily.</p>
                <p>There is nothing to show in this case that Claimant did not take the oath and did
                    not bear true faith and Allegiance to the Confederacy, except the casual aid he
                    may have given to his nephew to escape into the Union lines. But this aid may
                    have been inspired by other motives that those of hostility to the Confederacy -</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the evidence of loyalty and therefore reject the Claim.</p>

                <p>4th Witness Says - I think I did take an oath to the Confederate States - I do
                    not recollect its purport. I took an Amnesty oath at Staunton, Va in July 1865.
                    I never asked for any pardon.</p>
                <p>6th Witness Says. I never was in any way connected with the Civil Service of the
                    Confederate States. I held no office, clerkship, or agency or employment of any
                    kind whatever.</p>

                    Confederacy. I never was an Officer, Soldier, Sailor or Marine of the

                        >traffick</orig> or intercourse between the lines. I never left the

                <p>17th Witness Says. I never was arrested by the Confederates. I never was arrested

                <p>18 Witness Says. I never had any property taken by the Confederates. I was
                    threatened with being shot by Confederate Soldiers, if I avowed myself as a
                    Union man.</p>
                <p>21 Witness Says - I never <orig reg="gave">give</orig> anything to the <abbr
                        expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> Government.</p>
                <p>23 Witness Says - I had a nephew in the Confederate Army until I got him across
                    the lines - I did not contribute any equipment to him.</p>
                <p>24 Witness Says - I never owned a Confederate Bond, nor did anything to support
                    the credit of the Confederacy. I never give any aid and comfort to the rebellion
                    -</p>
                <p>30 Witness Says. I never held and office in the <abbr expan="United">U.</abbr>
                    States, not was I educated at any of its Military or Naval Schools.</p>
                <p>31 Witness Says. I never received a pass from any Officer of the Confederate
                    States. I was under no diabilities imposed by the <abbr expan="United States"
                        >U.S.</abbr> Constitution or its amendments.</p>
                <p>33 Witness Says - At the beginning of the War my sympathies were with the Union,
                    I did not vote at all on the Ordinance of Secession - after its ratification I
                    adhered to the Union, and against the State.</p>
                <p>34 Witness Says - I do declare that from the beginning of hostilities to the end
                    thereof my sympathies were constantly with the Union and that I never did
                    anything to injure said cause, or retard its success, and was willing at all
                    times to aid the Union cause so far as was in my power to do so.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John W. Shumake to prove the taking of the Horse mentioned in
                    petition.</p>
                <p>Ques 1. Answer. Witness Says - I am 19 years old I reside in Augusta Co. Va. I am
                    a clerk - I was present and saw the horse charged in the petition was taken -</p>
                <p>4 Witness Says. The horse was taken in the fall of 1864, from the claimants
                    premises, by a officer and soldier, belonging to <abbr expan="General"
                    >Genl.</abbr> Sheridan's command. I did now know the name of the officer, or
                    rank.</p>
                <p>12 Witness Says. There was no receipt given or asked for that I know of. The
                    horse was taken in the day time, about 2 o'clock P.M.</p>
                <p>12 Witness Says. The horse was in good condition, he was I think about 9 years
                    old, I think the horse was low at $75.00</p>
                <p>19 Witness Says. the horse was taken for use of the Army. The Army had no Camp
                    near there at that time. It was on a raid.</p>
                <p>22 Witness Says. I think there was a great necessity for horses in the Army and
                    they were justified in taking the horse, and suppose they had orders to take
                    property. I believe the Government ought to pay for the horse.</p>

                <p>Question 1st Witness Says - I have known the claimant all my life, and was with
                    him during the War, I heard him talk about the War, and he was all the time
                    opposed to the rebellion and in favor of the Union. He was regarded by all who
                    knew him to be a Union man, I have heard rebels abuse him because of his
                    opposition to the rebellion. I never knew him to do anything for the United
                    States, except to assist persons in getting to the Union lines - He done nothing
                    in aid of the Confederate States. He could not have established any claim of
                    loyalty to the Confederacy had it succeeded.</p>
