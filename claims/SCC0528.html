<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimant belongs to the fraternity of Dunkards who eschew Politics and war. He
                    was opposed to secession and in favor at the Union. He did not go to the
                    Election when the Ordinance of succession was
                    submitted. He advised his son and sons in law to go North and aided them to do
                    so. His neighbors testify to his loyal conversation &amp; reputation. We
                    find him loyal. Two of the Horses were taken by Gen Hunter's forces
                    in 1864, and the other by Gen Sheridan's Command in 1865. He abandons
                    the claim for the Cattle, on the ground that although he had bargained for them
                    he had not paid for them and they had not been delivered.</p>
                <p>We allow $300.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Christian Landes</b>
                <p>In answer to the First General Interrogatory, the Deponent says: My name is
                    Christian Landes, my age 64 years, my residence Augusta County, in the State of
                    Virginia, and my occupation a Farmer; I am the claimant, and have beneficial
                    interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>2 I lived all the time on my own farm at Mount Sidney in Augusta County.</p>
                <p>3 &amp; 4 No sir.</p>
                <p>5 Yes sir. I went to Staunton and took it after the war.</p>
                <p>6 to 24 inclusive No sir. I had nothing at all to do with them in any way. My age
                    exempted me from military duty and saved me much trouble.</p>
                <p>25 Yes, the Confederates camped on my place at Mount Sidney for 4 or 5 days in
                    the fall of 1864 and used a quantity of corn from my fields. They never paid me
                    anything for it.</p>
                <p>26 Yes. When I have been asked by the Confederate soldiers to feed their horses
                    and have told them I could not do it, they have threatened to burn my barn down.</p>
                <p>27 to 29 inclusive no sir</p>
                <p>30 Yes, I have one nephew named Levi Landes, two sons named Jacob and Daniel
                    Landes. Jacob was in the secondhe carried to
                        the county in a sick bed after he denied the Confederate cause and
                    carried him away by force. He was 19 years old when he went. He was forced to go
                    both times. Daniel was conscripted in 1865. He was living near my residence at
                    the time, he was about 30 years old. I gave neither of them any
                        equipment nor assistance when in the service, and would
                    have kept them out if I could have done so.</p>
                <p>31 to 39 inclusive No Sir</p>
                <p>40 I sympathized with the Union Cause. I thought the rebellion was wrong. I did
                    not vote on the question of Secession. Our church held that the brethren might
                    not meddle with politics, and recommended that we abstain from voting or
                    attending elections. After the state seceeded I still
                    held for the union.</p>
                <p>41 I was for the Union from first to last. I could never see any good cause for
                    the rebellion. I never did anything against the cause of the U.S. and was always glad of its success. I am a
                    member of the Dunkard Church.</p>
                <p>44 I am a native born Citizen of the United States and I have not  through
                    Bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>In answer to the interrogatories as to the Property deponent says</p>
                <p>I was present and saw my property taken, all except the cattle.</p>
                <p>1 &amp; 2 The Black horse and bay mare were both taken <sup>at the same time one</sup> from a boy I had plowing with them. He was
                    plowing with two and one of them was taken and another from the field. They were
                    taken by the army of Gen Hunter in the summer of
                    1864, when they were passing through here towards Staunton. The main body had
                    passed along and two soldiers came back while other portions of the army were
                    passing. There was some 20 or 30 men stopped while the horses were being taken
                    and they all passed on taking horses from other persons on the way. The black
                    horse I valued at $125 and the bay mare at $135. They were both good animals and
                    in good condition.</p>
                <p>The cattle were taken from the farm of Mr Searight about 4 miles from my place. I
                    had purchased them from him for to butcher, and was to take them at a certain
                    day, but did not get them away and they were driven away by a portion of the
                    army of Gen Sheridan in Sept 1864 as I am informed and expect to prove. The cattle were
                    purchased by weight and I forget the exact amount, but think it was about $80 or
                    $85 for the two.</p>
                <p>The dark brown horse was taken from the stable on my farm at Mount Sidney, by a
                    portion of Gen Sheridans army in March 1865 while going towards Staunton.</p>
                <p>The Stable was locked and the men broke the door open while I was in my yard,
                    across the road from the farm.</p>
                <p>I urged them not to take him, but they told me the less I said, the better for
                    me. There was a large company of men in the party, probably 100 or more. I
                    valued him at $100. He was an excellent farm horse.</p>
                <p>There were officers with the party who knew of the taking. I spoke to one of them
                    about it, but it did no good, and further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>In the summer of 1864 when the Army of Gen Hunter
                    passed through this place I saw some of the soldiers go to a field near the

                    and put a sadle on him and ride him away another party

                    field saddled her and rode her away. Also, both of them were taken along with
                    the army. They did not leave any other horses in places of them.</p>

                <p>During the war I was present and saw a lot of cattle driven from the farm of John

                    year 1864. I dont know how many cattle were in the lot
                    driven away. I supposed they were Mr Searights cattle. I did not know that Mr
                        Landis had purchased any of them. I heard Mr
                    Searight talking about them afterwards, and he said he had sold two or three

                    left there at his Mr Landis risk, and that he should
                    hold him responsible for them.</p>
                <p>I dont know what kind of cattle Mr Landis had bought. Some of those driven away were cows. Some were

                <p>I was present and saw all his property taken except the cattle.</p>
                <p>The black horse was taken from before the plow while plowing corn in the summer
                    of 1864, by a portion of GenHunters command while passing on the Pike towards Staunton. One of
                    the men put a saddle on him and rode him away with the rest of the Army. Our
                    farm is immediately on the pike and the horse was plowing close by when taken.
                    He was a good sized animal and an excellent saddle horse. He was valued at $125
                    when taken.</p>
                <p>The bay mare was taken at the same time from a pasture field across the road by
                    some of the same troops who went into the field and caught her. And one of them
                    rode her away with the rest of the army. She was a medium sized animal, a good
                    worker and rider. She was worth rather more than the horse.</p>
                <p>The brown horse was taken in the spring of the year 1865 a short time before the
                    surrender of Gen Lee by a party of Union cavalry, passing up the Pike toward
                    Staunton. There was a large party of them; they were from 1 Oclk until after dark in passing, marching close to

                    years.</p>
                <p>2 I am the claimant.</p>
                <p>3 I was born and raised in this county.</p>
                <p>4 Where I now live</p>
                <p>5 I sympathized with the north all the time from beginning to end.</p>
                <p>6 I never did.</p>
                <p>7 &amp; 8 I was willing and I did give all the aid in my power. I sent my son
                    and two sons in law to the north through the mountains, and one of my daughters
                    down the valley and they all staid north until the war
                    closed.</p>
                <p>9 Two cousins of my first wife named Wenger and several others one a David Landis.</p>
                <p>10 No Sir</p>
                <p>11 I gave the union troops when camped near me at the time of the burning hay,
                    Oats, bacon and provisions, and my wife cooked for them all day.</p>
                <p>12 I stood by the union all the time. I am no polititian. I belong to the Dunker Church. I did not do anything.</p>
                <p>13 I adhered to the union all the time.</p>
                <p>14 I was always sorry for the defeat, and glad of the success of the union forces
                    as I believed that was the only way to peace, and because the union cause was
                    right. Of course I was sorry for so much slaughter and suffering.</p>
                <p>15 I never asked for any</p>
                <p>16 I never had occasion to take it.</p>
                <p>17 John Yates, Abner Shumate, Daniel and John Miller, John Wampler &amp;
                    Joseph Click were all union men living within one to two miles of here. Some of
                    them wil testify to my loyalty.</p>
                <p>18 They threatened various things if I did not feed their horses, for nothing. I
                    did <sup>not</sup> want to do it.</p>
                <p>19 No sir.</p>
                <p>20 They took from me 100 bushels of wheat I had at Klines Mill, they never paid
                    me a cent. They made me give them a tenth of my crop one year.</p>
                <p>21 to 35 No Sir, to each and every question.</p>
                <p>36 My youngest son was conscripted the second year of the war. He was taken by
                    armed men from my house and was killed in the Wilderness. He was taken against
                    my will: I went to M<sup>t</sup> Jackson and also to Staunton
                    to try to get him off, but could not succeed. His name was Jacob Landis. I had two <sup>cousins</sup>Nephews in the service also, one named Henry and one
                    Daniel Landis. They lived about 2 miles from me. I had
                    nothing to do with their going, and contributed nothing towards their support
                    while in the service.</p>
                <p>37 &amp; 38 No Sir</p>
                <p>39 I took some kind of an oath after the war in Staunton. I reckon it was the
                    amnesty oath.</p>
                <p>40 to 43 No Sir, to each question.</p>
                <p>44 I have no recollection of voting during the war. There was no union
                    candidates. I did not vote at all on the secession question at eather election.
                    Our church advises us to take no part in elections.</p>
                <p>45 to 51 No Sir to each question.</p>
                <p>Concerning the property deponent says During the war I carried on buchering and
                    had purchased the three<sup>two</sup> cattle charged
                    in my claim from a man named George Searight who had agreed to deliver to me
                    three head, but butchered one of them himself, and before the others were
                    delivered to me they were taken by the Union forces, and Searight charged them
                    to me and insisted that I should pay for them because I had not taken them away
                    at the time agreed on, so I charged them to the government. I have since been
                    advised that he cannot compel me to pay for them, and I therefore have thought
                    it best to abandon the claim for the cattle, altho I
                    have had no settlement with him.</p>
                <p>The charge for the cattle is Abandoned.</p>
                <p>The last horse that was taken from me, was a dark brown, or some would say a
                    black horse. He was taken by a party of Union Cavalrymen from my stable. They
                    broke the door of the stable open, and one of the men rode him away with the
                    others going towards Staunton. This was in the spring of 1865. He was a good
                    horse worth at least $100. And further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Claimants wife concerning property.</p>
                <p>My name is Elizabeth J. Landis I am 40 years old. I am
                    the wife of claimant and live with him. I was married to him in 1871.</p>
                <p>In the Spring of 1865 I was living with my own family keeping house about one
                    mile from the claimant on the pike towards Staunton. Claimants <sup>first</sup> wife was then living, and my sister was living
                    with them where where we now live. Claimant had at that time a dark
                    brown or black horse which my sister used to ride when she came to see me, and
                    which I used to see at claimants place very often, and knew the horse well.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1865, I dont remember the month, a
                    party of union cavalry, said to be a part of Sheridans Army passed up the pike going towards Staunton; and in passing
                    my residence, I saw the brown or black horse of claimants with them, rode by one
                    of the men in uniform, and called the  attention of one of my
                    sisters who was visiting with me to the horse, saying "there is Mr Landis's black horse that you have rode many a time."
                    She looked and immediately recognized the horse as belonging to claimant. There
                    were probably two or three hundred in the party, and they all passed on towards
                    Staunton which was the last I ever saw of them. He was a veery fine looking
                    horse, and was called a good one by those who knew him. I saw no other of
                    claimants property taken.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John Miller</p>
                <p>1 My name is John Miller. I am 64 years old. I am a farmer and a preacher in the
                    Dunker Church and live near Mount Sidney in Augusta CoVa where I have lived for 30 years
                    past.</p>
                <p>2 I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in the success of his
                    claim</p>
                <p>53 to 55 I have known him for 30 years or more, have lived within about 1 1/2
                    miles of the Dunker Church. I frequently saw him during the war, sometimes at Mt
                    Sidney sometimes at church and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>56 I had some conversation with him <sup>on</sup> matters
                    relating to war but not much. He is not much of a talker at anytime, is more
                    than ordinary quiet. When I did talk with him he generally expressed union
                    sentiments, but was rather reticent except when in the company of well known
                    union men.</p>
                <p>57 I was not a witness to any acts of his that would indicate his sentiments I
                    have understood that he favored the going north of several members of his family
                    and that they did escape and remained away until the close of the war.</p>
                <p>58 &amp; 59 I do not. I dont believe he did any
                    thing in aid of the rebellion that he was not of need to do.</p>
                <p>60 I have never heard him spoekn of a great deal he did not meddle with politics.
                    If all were like him there would have been no war. He was generally regarded as
                    a union man by those who knew him as far as I know. And I think he was in favor
                    of the Union cause. I am quite sure he had no sympathy with the Confederate
                    cause.</p>
                <p>61 Abner Shumate John Yates, Joseph Glick John Wampler &amp; Daniel Miller
                    were all good union people.</p>
                <p>62 I have had a claim allowed by the commrs of claims. I was a decided Union man
                    at all times.</p>

                <p>1 My name is John Wampler I am 49 years old, a farmer and live near Mt Sidney
                    where I have resided over 20 years.</p>
                <p>2 I m not related to the claimant and have no interest in the success of his
                    claim.</p>
                <p>53 to 55 I have known him about 30 years, part of hte time intimately. We are
                    members of the same church and often met during the war.</p>
                <p>56 We had some considerable talk about the war and such matters. He was opposed
                    to the war and spoke against it, and against secession. I cant relate conversation, but from his language I always took him to be
                    a union man. When the news of a battle came, it was most always in favor of the
                    rebels. I remember his saying you cant believe that
                    side, I expect when we get the news it will be that the Confederates were
                    whipped. He expressed union sentiments when speaking of these things. He is not
                    much of a talker at any time, and we all had to be on our guard in those days.</p>
                <p>He had one son and two sons in law and one daughter who went north during the war
                    and remained there until the war closed. Some of them started from claimants
                    home and he helped them away. I know this because the
                    were started on horseback but found they could not make it, and sent the horses
                    back to claimants house and then took to the mountains.</p>
                <p>58 &amp; 59 No Sir</p>
                <p>60 He was regarded generally by those who knew him as a union man. I have heard
                    him called a union man by the secesh and probably by others I dont remember; the members of our church were generally union
                    people. There were some secesh among them.</p>
                <p>61 John Yates, Abner Shumate, John Miller, Daniel Miller, Joseph Click were all

                <p>Answer to Quest. 54. I lived one fourth of a mile
                    from him during the late war and still live at the same place.</p>

                <p>Answer to Question 56 I had frequent conversations with him during the war, about
                    the war, and he always expressed himself as a Union man. I can remember his
                    exact words but he always spoke in favor of Union Cause, and desired that there
