                <p>Frederick K. Kline filed this claim in 1871 for $895, claiming the Union army
                    took three horses, two cows and eleven cattle in 1864. Frederick was a 43 year
                    old farmer who spent 5 weeks in Indiana to avoid Confederate service and was
                    threatened by Confederate neighbors because of his Unionist sentiments. The
                    commission allowed $568.</p>
