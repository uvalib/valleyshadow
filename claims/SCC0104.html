<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Thomas J. Gilbert,
                            September 19, 1871, Claim No. 7264</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Gilbert's claim was disallowed by the Commissioners because his wartime
                    experiences suggested neutrality rather than loyalty to the Union Government.
                    Gilbert appealed this decision to the Congressional Court of Claims in 1895; his
                    son filed a second appeal in 1898.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claim rejected.</p>
                <p>Mr. Gilbert lived near or in Staunton. He had no property taken by rebels-was
                    never molested or threatened. Had no relatives in either Army. Did not vote on
                    secession. -In May 1864 he left Va. (probably to avoid conscription) &amp;
                    went to Maryland to work in the Coal mines. -He never did anything for either
                    side.</p>
                <p>All this indicates neutrality. -He says he was for the Union &amp; he was
                    willing to do all he could for the U.S. Gov<sup>t</sup>. -That
                    is all he says. -Jess Gilbert (probably a relative) says he regarded him as a
                    Union Man &amp; he was so regarded by the Union men.</p>
                <p>The taking is not sastifactorily proved. No officer present. Looks like
                    depredation. The testimony of W<sup>m</sup>. R. Gilbert who was
                    ten years old at the time of taking does not agree with Smith's &amp; is not
                    reliable.</p>
                <p>We must reject the claim.</p>

                    so. Did not vote at all on the ordinance of secession. After its adoption I went
                    with the Union, and not with my state. I was ready and willing to do all I could
                    for the U.S. Govt. so far as I could. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>JESSE M. GILBERT testifies: Age 68; residence Augusta Co., Farmer: I have lived
                    in Augusta Co. 62 years. Did not change my residence durig the war. Have known
                    the claimant all my life. Saw him frequently during the war until he left this
                    county and went to Md. and talked to him about the war, and I regarded him as
                    loyal to the U.S. Govt. He was so regarded by the Union men. Never knew him to
                    do anything for the Confederate Govt. He did nothing for the U.S. Govt. had no
                    opportunity. I never knew him persecuted or threatened on account of his Union
                    sentiments He was ordered to join the Confederate army, and rather than do so
                    left his home, and went to Md. I believe he was too loyal to the U.S. to have
                    been loyal to the Confederate Govt., had it succeeded, he could not have staid here without torture on account of his Union
                    sentiments. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court, in Aug. 1895.</p>
                <p>D.A. SNITEMAN testifies: Merchant; age 48; residence near Staunton, Va. Not
                    related or interested. (P. 1). I have known the claimant all my life. Lived
                    within a mile and a half of him and saw him off and on throughout the war. Saw
                    him under ordinary circumstances as neighbors. I had no direct conversation with
                    him on the subject of the war, but his reputation in the neighborhood was that
                    of a strong Union man. I was an adherent of the Union cause, and claimant knew
                    it. His public reputation was that of a Union man, opposed to secession. He was
                    so regarded by his loyal neighbors. (P. 2). I don't know of anything the
                    claimant did to aid the Union army. Or the Confederate Govt. I don't know how he
                    voted on secession, but I am satisfied his influence was with the Union side.
                    His views did not change so far as I know..</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Claimant did not have any sons in the Confederate army. I am the claimant in case
                    No. 8799. Haven't been called on to testify in that case. I was present when the
                    case was examined this morning. (P. 3) I never was in the Confederate army, my
                    oldest brother was. I did not own Confederate bonds. My father owned them, but
                    they belonged to the estate of my grand father on my mother's side, of which my
                    father was executor.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT</p>
                <p>I was ready and willing if called on to testify in my father's case. I came here
                    with the expectation of being called upon. I had no objections to testifying.
                    (P. 4).</p>
                <p>O.E. CLEVELAND testifies; Farmer; age 72; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not related
                    ar interested. (P. 5). My acquaintance with the claimant began in '57. Knew him
                    well during the war and lived three or four hundred yards from him. Sometimes I
                    saw him every day and sometimes not so often. He always expressed himself in
                    opposition to the war in frequent conversations. I suppose I was an adherent of
                    the Union cause, though I did not know it until the war came on, and I suppose I
                    was known as such to him, as we had frequent conversations. Everybody knew that
                    claimant was a loyal man, and I knew it too. Claimant did everything in his
                    power to aid the Union army. Early in '64 he went through the lines to keep from
                    aiding the Confederacy, and remained outside the Confederacy, and inside the
                    Union lines until the war closed. (P. 6). He did not belong to any church so far
                    as I know. He never contributed anything to aid the Confederate Govt. so far as
                    I heard. I can't be positive, from his reputation I haven't the least Idea that
                    he would under any circumstances. So far as he exerted his influences it was on
                    the side of what he thought which was on the side of the Union. So far as I know
                    he thought throughout the war that nothing ought to be done contrary to the
                    cause of the U. S. Govt.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Va. My father was a bred and born yankee from
                    Connecticut. During the war he was as good a secesh as any man in the state. I
                    was the only Union man in the family, and suppose I am yet. (P. 7). I didn't
                    particularly fancy seeing any body killed.. I didn't care
                    who they whipped so they kept the U.S. in a solid situation. I don't know that
                    the Confederates ever bought anything from the claimant except in the ordinary
                    way, like they bought whenever they staid here. I
                    don't know whether he ever got pay for anything or not. By the ordinary way, I
                    mean whenever he had anything to sell he would sell it to any one who would buy
                    it, but not with a view to help the army. Of course any man who raised anything
                    had to sell it to help his family along He didn't have anything much to sell at
                    that time, as he was most in general working by the day, or working sometimes by
                    the day and sometimes by the month and sometimes by the year, as well as I can
                    recollect. I don't think claimant worked for the army.. I
                    couldn't positively say, because I did not see claimant tale a trip once or twice while working for Mr. Bell, and haul for about
                    a week or so for the Confederate army.. (P. 8). I couldn't say positively
                    whether Mr. Bell did or did not send Mr. Gilbert with his teams. While I heard
                    Mr. Gilbert, the present claimant, make the statement that the claimant went
                    with Bell's teams once or twice to haul for the Confederate army, I couldn't say
                    I knew it. Robt. L. Lee was in the Confederate army. I saw him there, and he was
                    one of the finest looking men I ever saw too, on his big horse. I saw Stonewall
                    Jackson in the Confederate army. Never saw Jubal Early there. I don't know much
                    about Gen. McClelland I don't think he was in the Confederate army, unless he
                    was surrounded by rebels and was in the middle of it..
                    David Bell said he was the employer of Mr. Gilbert by the year. I did not hear
                    Mr. Gilbert say that his father, the original claimant, was employed by the year
                    as overseer by Mr. Bell I made some such observation as that myself. I heard him
                    say it, of course. I just judge from Bell's conversations with me that he was on
                    the Southern side. Their is no doubt about that. (P. 10). I reckon I stated he
                    was a secesh and a good one. (P. 11).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners rejected this claim partly on merits, as well as doubts as to
                    loyalty. They found that he had no relatives in either army; that he did not
                    vote on secession; that in May '64 he left Va. to avoid conscription, and went
                    to Md., and they add "all this indicates neutrality." Whereas upon the finding
                    of these facts the claimant should have been held loyal.</p>
                <p>The claimant resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the war engaged in farming,
                    until May 4th, '64 when he went to Md. and remained until the war closed. He
                    never aided the Confederacy. Owned no Confederate bonds. He was for the Union at
                    the commencement, and says he has been for the Union all the time and expects to
                    remain so. Did not vote for the ordinance of secession. His witnesses testify to
                    his loyal expressions during the war and his loyal reputation. Was regarded as
                    loyal by his loyal neighbors.</p>
                <p>Witness Cleveland states, that every body knew claimant was a loyal man. That
                    early in '64 he went through the lines to keep from aiding the Confederacy, and
                    remained inside the Union lines until the war closed.</p>
                <p>This testimony is certainly conclusive as to claimants loyalty throughout the war
                    and the Court should so find.</p>

                <p>David M. Kerr, Adm'r. Thos. J. Gilbert, dec., vs. The United States No. 8645 Cong.</p>
                <p>MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>In this case petition and letters cf administration were filed on Jan. 15th,
                    1896.</p>
                <p>On Dec. 10th, 1896 the case was submitted on briefs.</p>
                <p>Jan. l8th, 1897 case dismissed, loyalty not found. This motion for a new trial is
                    based upon error of fact.</p>
                <p>Mr. Gilbert is shown to have been loyal throughout the war by the testimony.</p>
                <p>The following are the facts in proof:</p>
                <p>Claimant lived in Augusta Co., Va., during the war. up to May '64. Then he went
                    to Md. and remained until the war closed. He never gave any aid to the
                    rebellion. He was opposed to secession from the commencement to the close of the
                    war. He was regarded in the community where he lived throughout the war as a
                    Union man and loyal citizen. He was ordered to join the Confederate army, and
                    rather than do so he left his home and went to Md. His expressions throughout
                    the war were in favor of the U.S. Govt. The fact of his leaving home, and
                    seeking protection inside the Union lines in connection with the fact that he
                    never aided the rebellion should conclude the question of loyalty in his favor.</p>
                <p>Upon the foregoing facts not controverted loyalty should have been found.</p>
                <p>Affidavits are expected, and will be filed in support of this motion.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Brief on Motion for a New Trial on Loyalty</b>
                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS, DECEMBER TERM 1898-99.</p>
                <p>THOMAS J. GILBERT, Executors, etc., vs. The United States No. 8645 Cong.</p>
                <p>Claimant's Brief on Motion for a new trial on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>In support of this motion there are filed affidavits of Robert W. Johnson and
                    Thomas J. Gilbert. R.W. Johnson, himself a secessionist, deposes that he had
                    frequent conversations with claimant during the war, and that claimant differed
                    with him widely, steadily declaring himself for the Union; that deceased
                    claimant bore the reputation in that community of a "loyal" Union man. This is
                    the first the Court has heard of these peculiarparticular
                    conversations with deceased claimant. If a new trial should be allowed, formal
                    and full proof will be made of them, including all such particulars as the
                    Attorney for the Government may choose to bring out.</p>
                <p>The deponent Gilbert is a son of the deceased claimant and resided with him
                    during the War. Like the former witnesses, he tells of his father's leaving his
                    home and going within the Federal Lines in Maryland and remaining there until
                    the end of the War; also, in general terms, of his consistent
                    loyalty.</p>
                <p>Such evidence as was before the Court on the submission of the case was all in
                    claimant's favor. There was no conflict in it, no inconsistencies even.
                    Evidently it failed to satisfy the Court merely because there was not thought to
                    be enough of it. It appears now that on a new trial important new proof of new
                    facts would clearly show that the deceased claimant was loyal.</p>
                <p>On the former evidence, indeed, the loyalty of deceased claimant was not denied
                    by the Attorney for the Government. All that he said was that the testimony was
                    correctly presented in my brief.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Claimant's Motion for a New Trial on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES. December Term, 1898.</p>
                <p>Estate Thomas J. Gilbert v. The United States No. 8645, Congressional.</p>
                <p>Defendants' Brief on Claimant's Motion for a New Trial on Loyalty</p>
                <p>The claimiant in support of his motion files the affidavit of his local attorney
                    to the effect that the evidence submitted in the affidavits accompanying could
                    not have been obtained before the hearing of the case by the exercise of
                    ordinary diligence.</p>
                <p>Two other affidavits are filed, one by Robert W. Johnson who says that he had
                        three conversations with the claimant on the subject of
                    secession, but does not say when. From the fact, however, that affiant says he
                    subsequently went into the Confederate army, it is presumed that the
                    conversation took place before the war, or at least at its outbreak. No new fact
                    is set forth in Johnson's affidavit.</p>
                <p>The third affidavit is supplied by the son of the claimant who says his father
                    was a Union man and that he went to Maryland to avoid conscription into the
                    Confederate army. This alleged fact was fully presented when the case was heard
                    before.</p>
                <p>It is respectfully submitted that the evidence presented in support of the motion
                    for a new trial is cumulative at best and that the motion should be denied.</p>
