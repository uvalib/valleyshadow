                <p>Mr. Landes was a young man engaged in farming in Augusta Co. Virginia, when the war broke out in 1861. He voted for union
                    delegates to the convention-was opposed to secession &amp; did not vote on
                    the ordinance. He avoided conscription, lay out in the woods for that purpose
                    &amp; aided union men to escape service in the
                        unionConfederate army. He was known &amp; reputed
                    to be a union man during the war. He gave no aid to the confederacy whatever
                    &amp; our agent who investigaated the claim on the spot, reports favorably
                    as to his loyalty.</p>
                <p>A mare was taken from him by Gen. Hunter's forces in
                    June 1864, soon after the battle of Piedmont.</p>

                <p>Deposition of W<sup>m</sup>. A. Houff</p>
                <p>Ans. to first question My name is William A. Houff, my age 50 years, residence
                    near Staunton, my occupation a farmer. I am not related to the claimant, and
                    have no interest in the claim. I was present and saw the claimants Mare taken.</p>
                <p>3 Ans. The Mare was in pasture in a field of W<sup>m</sup>.
                    Link, and about 1/2 dozen soldiers engaged in catching the Mare, after cathcing
                    her, they took her out of the field and started leading her off in the direction
                    of Staunton. They were probably a regiment of Soldiers a short distance around.</p>
                <p>4 Ans. The Mare was taken from a field, about 12 or 12 Oclock, on Thursday after
                    the Piedmont fight in June 1864. They were only a few minutes in the field.</p>
                <p>5 Ans. There was no one present with me.</p>
                <p>6 Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not.</p>
                <p>7 Ans. The Mare was caught in the field, and lead off. I
                    heard them say they had gotten to good ones, (the other being the Mare of James
                    Y. Quick)</p>
                <p>8 Ans. The Mare was led from the field by a soldier who was mounted.</p>
                <p>9 Ans. They left in the direction of Staunton, I did not follow to see.</p>
                <p>10 Ans. I never saw the Mare after that time, and do not <sup>know</sup> for what she was used.</p>
                <p>11 Ans. I know of no complaint being made. Nor of no voucher being given or asked
                    for.</p>
                <p>13 Ans. The Mare was taken in day time, about 11 or 12 oclock</p>
                <p>14 Ans. I knew of no Camp nearer than Staunton, about 7 miles off. General David
                    Hunter commanded the Army. I understood they got to Staunton on Monday, some 3
                    days previous to taking the Mare, I heard they left Staunton on Friday. The
                    battle at Piedmont took place on the Sunday previous. I knew no officer
                    connected with the Army.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The Mare was a bay. I suppose about 7 years old, of good size, she was a
                    fine condition, perfectly sound as far as I knew. She was well broken to harness
                    and saddle. I would have been willing to give $175. in good money for her. I
                    have never consulted with the claimant about the value of the Mare. He never
                    received any pay that I knew of.</p>

                <p>13 Ans. The Mare was taken in the day time I suppose about 10 to 12 Oclock.</p>
                <p>14 Ans. The nearest camp was at Staunton about 7 miles. The Army camped there was
                    commanded by Gen<sup>l</sup>.
                    Hunter. They remained in Camp about 4 days. I knew no officer in the Army.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The Mare was a bay, she was not old, of good Medium size. She was sound
                    as far as I know. She worked well and rode tolerably I think she would have been
                    cheap at $150- and would have brought more I think where she was known. I do not
                    think I ever talked with the Claimant about the value of the Mare.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Same witness as to the loyalty of the claimant.</p>
                <p>Ans. I have known the claimant 15 years. I was intimate with him during the War,
                    we lived about 300 yards a part, we talked together about the war nearly every
                    day. He was very bitter against secession. We have talked in presence of others,
                    and he was always firm for the Union. His neighbors all had confidence in his
                    integrity as a Union Man. He regarded me as a Union man. I never knew him to do
                    anything for the Confederacy. I knew that he assisted all he could in feeding
                    and keeping men out the rebel Army. This was in the two first years of the War,
                    and the last he was hiding and escaping himself. I am sure that he could not
                    have proven any loyalty to the Confederate States, had they gained their
                    independence.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Josiah W. Sheets.</p>
                <p>Ans. My name is Josiah W. Sheets, my age is 30 years. My residence is near M<sup>t</sup>. Sidney. My occupation a laborer. I have known the
                    claimant some 14 years. We were intimate during the war, I lived about one mile,
                    from the claimant. I was with him a great deal during the War. When I was hiding
                    he sent for me to come to his house, he fed me, and helped me me all he could in
                    keeping out the clutches of the rebels. He knew I was a Union. I have no
                    recollection of hearing him talk in the presence of others. His Union neighbors
                    had confidence in him as a Union man. I never knew him to do anything for the
                    rebels in any way. I know that he fed and lodged Union men who were escaping the
                    rebel service. I went North in 1863 April.</p>
                <p>I would not have testified to his being at all loyal to the Confederate
                    Government nor could he have proven by any of his neighbors, if the Confederates
                    had gained their independence.</p>

                    County, Va. I am not related the claimant. I have
                    known the claimant about 14 years, I lived about 1/2 mile from him during the
                    war. I was intimate with him, I talked a great deal with <sup>him</sup> about the War. He was always opposed to secession. I heard him
                    express himself to others, and he never changed, he knew my sentiments. The
                    general opinion of the neighborhood was that he was a Union loyal man. I know of
                    nothing that he ever did for the rebel cause. I knew him him to use
                    his influence to keep men out of the rebel Army, and he fed and lodged many, who
                    were escaping from the rebel service. The last part of the War, he was hiding
                    himself. He could not shown any loyalty by witnesses in his own neighborhood. I
                    am satisfied from what I know of the claimant that he was and is a true friend
                    to the Union cause.</p>

                <p><u>Abraham Cline</u> being sworn deposes &amp; says:</p>
                <p>I am 55 years old, farmer, &amp; live on Middle River about 7 miles from
                    Staunton, &amp; about 1 1/2 miles from where claimant lived during the war.
                    I have known him ever since about 1852. During the war there were two little
                    farms between us. I had to pass right through his place to go to Cline's
                    Merchant mill, and would nearly always see him then, and I often met him at
                    other times &amp; places, &amp; the most of our conversation in those
                    days was about the war. I do not know how he voted, or whether he voted at all
                    on the ordinance, but I remember that I went to Mt Sidney that day intending to
                    vote against it, but I found the excitement so great that I went home without
                    voting. I cannot now recall any particular conversation that I had with Mr
                    Landes in 1861 or at any other time during the war, but I know that I thought he
                    was a union man all the time, and his neighbors thought so too. I heard some of
                    the neighbors abuse him for not going into the rebel army or service. As early
                    as February 1863 the conscript officers got after us, and I left house the 15th
                    of February &amp; went west, and was gone about 6 months, paid my fine as a
                    Dunkard &amp; then came home &amp; staid
                    there. After that I knew that Mr Landes &amp; some others were hiding out in
                    the cliffs along the river. Their head-quarters was a part of the
                    time were on the hill near my house. They would stay there in the day time and
                    go other places &amp; stay at night. From that time on to the end of the war
                    I know Mr Landes was hiding out whenver there was any danger from conscript
                    officers. I know that he hid Jo Sheets in his own house for several weeks, and
                    this was before I went west. Geo. White was with Jo Sheets, and they were hiding
                    together. Mr Landes did not go into the Rebel Service at all as I know of, and I
                    never knew of his doing any thing for the rebels, and don't believe he ever
                    sympathized with the rebel cause.</p>

                    office &amp; it was my duty to go after conscripts &amp; look up
                    deserters. I went into Mr Landes' neighborhood after him and 6 or 7 others. Mr
                    Landes was pointed out to me. He saw me and ran. I pursued him and hallooed
                    "halt." He wouldn't halt. The I shot at him &amp; got down off my horse
                    &amp; took after him, but he escaped. I continued to look after him up to
                    the surrender but never caught him. I was told all the time that he was a Union

                <p>I am the claimant in this case, am now 43 years old, &amp; live now in
                    Staunton. I was a democrat before the war, &amp; voted for Stephen A. Douglass for President in 1860. I never believed in the
                    doctrine of secession, nor in the Virginia doctrine that it was my duty to go
                    with my State. I beleived that my first allegiance was due to the National
                    Government. I think I voted for the Union candidates for the Convention; if I
                    voted at all I voted for them. On the day the vote was taken on the Ordinance, I
                    did not go to Mt Sidney at all, which was the voting place of any precinct. But
                    I came here to Staunton and was here in front of the voting place at the Court
                    House. My neighbor, Peter Houff, tried to persuade me to vote for the Ordinance.
                    At that time I could have voted at the Court House. But I refused, and did not
                    vote at all. My name is not on the Staunton poll-book, &amp; it ought not to
                    be <sup>on</sup> any book, and I have not seen it on any book.
                    The names of D. Landes, and David Landes that appear on any of these poll-books
                    are the names of other persons, and all relatives of mine. I was a Union Man
                    from the beginning to the end of the war, was always opposed to secession, and I
                    always wanted the Union causee to succeed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Washington, Oct. 21, 1879</p>
                <p>I saw the claimant in Staunton, Va., where he now
                    lives on the 15th instant, and took the deposition of Abraham Cline, a former
                    neighbor, who happened to be in town that day, and who testified to Claimant's
                    loyalty. I also took the deposition of W<sup>m</sup> D. J.
                    Riley, who was a conscript officer for the Confederates, and testified that he
                    got after claimant at one time and shot at him because he would not "halt," and
                    says that he continued to look after him till the Surrender.</p>
                <p>I also took the deposition of claimant mainly for the purpose of having him
                    explain fully as to his voting or not voting on the ordinance. He said that he
                    left his home precinct (Mt Sidney), and went to Staunton that day, and did not
                    vote at all any where. I went with him and his attorney, A. H. Fultz, Esqr, and
                    examined the poll books in the Clerk's office containing the Votes on the
                    Ordinance in May 1861. I took particular care in reading the names on the Mt
                    Sidney and Staunton poll boooks, and several others, and did not find the name
                    of David W. Landes on either of them. Mr Landes is carrying on a grocery
                    &amp; provision store in Staunton, and seemed to me to be a substantial
                    business man, straightforward + truthful. I beleive
                    he was loyal to the cause and governmet of the Union throughout the entire war.</p>
