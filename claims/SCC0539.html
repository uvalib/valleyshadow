                <p>Margaret A. Pforr, a witness interviewed by Claimant to prove the taking of the
                    property named in the petition, being duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Ques. 1st Witness says, I am 33 years old. I reside in Staunton, Va. and am a
                    house keeper. I did not see the property taken, but the property of the claimant
                    was at his house when the Union troops came in, and was missing after they left
                    and not seen afterwards. I do not know, who took the property but believe it was
                    taken by the United States soldiers, then encamped at Staunton, and belonging to
                    the command of Genl. Hunter.</p>
                <p>15th Witness says, the horse was in a good condition and fine looking.
                    I think he was worth what is charged in claimants petition. The Cow, was very
                    fat and worth fifty dollars. There must have been over three (300) hundred
                    pounds, I suppose it was worth twelve &amp; a half cents a pound.</p>
                <p>19th Witness says I think it was taken for the use of the United States soldiers.</p>
                <p>22d Witness says I think it would be right for the Government to pay for it, as I
                    have no doubt they needed it and used it.</p>
                <p>23d Witness says I cannot say that the property was taken by persons authorized
                    to do so.</p>
                <p>Further this deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>Margaret A. Pforr introduced to prove the loyalty of claimant being duly sworn
                    answers as follows</p>
                <p>Ques. 1st Witness says I am 33 years old, I reside in Staunton, Va. by occupation
                    a housekeeper. I have known the claimant all my life. I live near him. I did not
                    see him often during the war, as he went to the North. I believe him to have
                    been a loyal to the United States Government and he was so regarded
                    by his neighbors. He done nothing for the Confederacy except what he was obliged
                    to do, and was arrested by the Confederate Government for his Union sentiments
                    and kept in prison for 8 or 9 months. I am satisfied that he could not have
                    established any claim to loyalty to the Confederacy.</p>
