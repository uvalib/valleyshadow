<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John R. Buchanan,
                            September 14, 1871, Claim No. 6893</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Buchanan's claim for one horse was disallowed because the Commissioners believed
                    that Buchanan, as a minor during the war, could not have owned the horse
                    outright.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>If he gives his age correctly, the claimant was born in 1844 &amp;
                    consequently was but 20 years of age when the horse was taken in 1864. In the
                    year 1863 he left as he says to avoid the rebel conscription &amp; went to
                    Ohio &amp; remained until after the war. The horse was taken by Gen. Hunters
                    command while the Claimant was in Ohio. He says nothing about ownership.</p>
                <p>David Buchanan is called as a witness - says he is 68 years of age resides in
                    Augusta Co. &amp; the property was taken from his farm in June 1864. He says
                    nothing about the claimant's owning the horse nor whether he is any way related
                    to the claimant. How this claimant then a boy became the owner of the horse
                    should have been shown by the most conclusive proof. We suspect David Buchanan
                    is the father of the claimant &amp; that he was the real owner of the horse.
                    We are not willing to report favorably upon the claim as the proofs now stand.
                    It is rejected.</p>
