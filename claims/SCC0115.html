<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Richard Anderson,
                            September 8, 1871, Claim No. 1725</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Anderson's claim for horses and farm supplies was disallowed in 1872 because the
                    commissioners were not satisfied that he was loyal to the Union during the war.
                    His heir, John Fauver, filed several appeals of this decision with the
                    Congressional Court of Claims beginning in 1902.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>This claim is rejected.</p>
                <p>Mr. Anderson testifies to his own loyalty generally in reply to questions 33
                    &amp; 34. He has two witnesses-one of whom "took him to be loyal"-the other
                    says "so far as I could tell he was loyal &amp; so regarded." The names of
                    the witnesses are on the poll list as all for ratifying the ordinance of
                    secession.</p>
                <p>Mr. Anderson says-"I was once impressed to haul supplies"-he does not tell when
                    this was-how long he was so employed in aid of the rebels, nor all of the
                    Circumstances. He always resided in a rebel Community, was never threatened or
                    molested, never did anything at any time for the Union Cause refers to no Union
                    man or Military officer to sustain him. -The circumstances are all against him.
                    -His service for the rebels was disloyal &amp; is not explained. -We can not
                    find his loyalty satisfactorily established &amp; therefore reject his
                    claim.</p>

                    Never gave aid or comfort to Rebellion. Never engaged in making raids into U. S.
                    from Canada, nor in destruction of U. S. commerce. Never held prisoners of war
                    taken from U. S. army. Never a member of any society for persecution of those
                    loyal to U. S. Never was a paroled U. S. prisoner. Never in army or navy of U.
                    S. Never had or asked any Confederate Pass. Never under disabilities imposed by
                    14 the Amendment. I sympathized all the time with Union cause. Did not vote on
                    Ordinance of (P3) Secession. After adoption of ordinanoe remained with Union
                    cause and did not go with my State. Solemnly declare that I was at all times
                    willing to aid Union cause so far as in my power.(P 4).</p>

                    farmer. Have known claimant 18 years. Reside near him. Saw him often during (P.
                    6) War. Talked with him frequently. Took him to be loyal to the U. S. Government
                    during War; he was so regarded by his neighbors. I think he was too loyal to the
                    U. S. Government to have been considered loyal to the Confederacy had it
                    succeeded. (P. 7).</p>

                    farmer. Lived here during War, near claimant. Saw him quite often; talked with
                    him about the War. So far as I could tell helms certainly loyal to the U. S.
                    Government, and he was so regarded by his neighbors. I am of opinion that he was
                    too loyal to the U. S. (P. 7) Government to have been loyal to Confederate
                    Government had it succeeded. (P.8).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken Oct. 21, 1902, at Staunton, Va., under the
                    rules of this court.</p>
                <p>J. S. Engleman testifies: Occupation farmer. Age 54 years. Residence Middlebrook,
                    Va. Not interested or related. During 1864 lived with my father, close to
                    Middlebrook, where I live now. Father was John Engleman; he was a Union man. (P.
                    1). I knew claimant well during War; lived on adjoining farm. He was considered
                    a Union man during war. He was a Union man by his conversations throughout the
                    war. I was at his house frequently during War - two or three times a week. I
                    knew of his hiding Union men during War - W. W. Casson and R. A. Helms; Mr.
                    Casson and Mr. Helm were Union men. Claimant's property was taken in June, 1864,
                    by Crook and Averill, of Hunter's Division. Claimant harbored Union men and
                    aided all he could. (P. 2). Claimant was not in Confederate service; he was too
                    old. He never furnished supplies of any kind to Confederacy that I know of. He
                    hauled for Confederacy, in fall of 1861; he was pressed to do so; he was
                    bitterly opposed to doing it. "He rared about it, and swore and went on
                    terrible, but he was forced to do it." Can't tell just how long he was gone on
                    the trip - about a week or 10 days - just from Staunton to Monterey. Of course
                    it was unsafe for a man to do open acts for Union, but he did not care for that;
                    he expressed his opinion anyway. There were a good many Union people in this
                    neighborhood and a good many more who were afraid to express their opinions. (P.
                    3). Some were injured by being threatened and by property being taken from them.
                    They were Union men and Confederates took their property. Can't just name these
                    Union men. Their property was pressed through Commissaries of Confederates.
                    Union authorities might have taken property from Confederate sympathizers but
                    did not - there was but the one raid. Of course a raid passing through takes
                    property as it goes. (P. 4). I was not present when claimant's team was
                    impressed by Confederates. Tom Shumate impressed the team. Heard claimant say
                    that Shumate had impressed his team. Heard him say so the same evening. All I
                    know about it is what claimant told.</p>
                <p>W. W. Casson testifies: Occupation farmer. Age 74 years. Live near Arbor Hill,
                    Augusta County. Not interested or related. I knew claimant during War and he was
                    as good a Union man as you would find in the Northern states anywhere. I staid
                    with him I suppose a month and a half during that time; I did a good deal of
                    shoe-making there. I was a Union man; that was the reason I was hiding around; I
                    staid there awhile and then went to the mountains. He was hiding and protecting
                    me because I was a Union man; if I had been a Secession man he would have driven
                    me off. (P. 6). Five of McCausland's Cavalry rode down there; said they had had
                    nothing to eat for 3 or 4 days, and wanted to get some hay and corn to feed
                    their horses. He asked their command and When they told him he said "Get up the
                    road; we have got nothing here for you." They looked into the hay mow and saw
                    some hay; one of them said "There is hay here, we'll get some". Claimant said
                    "If you go in there you wont get out". He went after my Colts revolver and as
                    soon as they saw that they got out. Union army got some hay and grain and grub,
                    too. He made no ado about it; they were the right stripe. Don't recollect to a
                    certainty about claimant's team being impressed by Confederates; Union forces
                    did not impress anything; I don't know about (P.7). Confederates. I was present
                    when MoCausland's men came there. Claimant voted against Secession; he told me,
                    and several gentlemen told me. Am sure he told me so. (P. 8).</p>

                    interested or related. Knew claimant during War; lived within about a mile of
                    him. He was a Union man. He was counted as a Union man in the neighborhood
                    generally. Don't know of anything showing his Union sentiments more than he
                    talked in favor of the Union and expressed his sentiments that way. I was a
                    Confederate,and he was recognized by Confederate soldiers as a Union man. (P.
                    9). I entered Confederate army in March, 1862, and was discharged in Feb. 1863.
                    Can't tell how often I saw claimant daring War- right frequently. Can't say
                    whether I was at his house while I was in army. He had no sons in Confederate
                    army. I talked with claimant during War and he expressed himself as in favor of
                    Union army. (P. 10).</p>
                <p>D. E. Beard testifies: Occupation farmer. Residence Middlebrook. Not interested
                    or related. Knew claimant during War; lived about 1 mile from him. He was
                    regarded in the community as a Union man. He always talked favorably to the
                    Union side. I was in Confederate service about 11 months in last year of the
                    War. I think he was considered a Union man by everybody that knew him. (P. 11).
                    His team was pressed to make a trip out about McDowell or Monterey, but I don't
                    know by whom. About that time a great many teams were impressed for hauling in
                    direction of Monterey. I was not present when his team was taken. Heard claimant
                    say it was impressed into service of Confederates. He was a farmer. There were
                    no other Richard Anderson's in this vicinity during
                    War, that I know of. I was not at his house while I was in the army but have
                    been in his house frequently. He was opposed to his team being impressed. (P.
                    12).</p>
                <p>W. D. Hemp testifies: Occupation farmer. Age 73. Residence Middlebrook, Va. Not
                    interested or related. Lived less than 2 miles from claimant during War; knew
                    him. It was generally said of him that he was a Union man. I talked with him a
                    good many times about the War, and as a general thing he was cursing the
                    Confederacy. I was not with him all the time; I could not say what he did. I
                    only know what he said and that he did nothing for Confederates only what was
                    impressed. (P. 13). I was a Union man. I did not vote at all; they said if a man
                    didn't vote for Secession he couldn't vote at all. Claimant's team was impressed
                    by Confederates to do some hauling. He was not willing for them to use it. Union
                    men had to be careful; they had to keep back; they couldn't be bold in what they
                    had to do or say. I was not present when his team was impressed. I know it was
                    impressed because a man named Shumate was around impressing the teams and came
                    from there over to our house and pressed our team; he said he had pressed Mr.
                    Anderson's and Mr. Beard's and several others. Shumate wanted to furnish a
                    Government driver but claimant would not let his team go (P. 14). with a
                    Government driver. The team was taken second year of the War and was gone about
                    10 days. (P. 15).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Claimant testifies that he sympathized with the Union cause; that he did not vote
                    on ordinance of Secession; that he did not go with his state after
                    the adoption of the Ordinance of Secession, but continued to adhere to the
                    Union. Concerning the testimony of the claimant and of his witnesses taken
                    before the Special Commissioner, we have to state that the extreme brevity of
                    the answers would seem indicative of a desire on part of the Commissioner to
                    complete his task as quickly as possible rather than a wish to draw out material
                    facts. A casual reading of the testimony so taken will show beyond any doubt
                    that the answers were cut very short as they were taken down. The original
                    claimant is now dead, which accounts for our failure to have him testify before
                    the Court. We make this explanation at this point in order that the Court may
                    understand claimant's apparent failure to testify to very much in his own
                    behalf.</p>
                <p>JAMES E. BEARD testifies that he saw claimant frequently during the war and
                    talked with him, and took him to be loyal; that witness, thinks claimant was too
                    loyal to U. S. to have proven loyalty to Confederacy.</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testifies to the same effect and states that claimant was regarded
                    by his neighbors as a loyal man.</p>
                <p>J. S. ENGLEMAN testifies that claimant was considered a loyal man; that his
                    conversations during the war showed his loyal sympathies; that he harbored Union
                    men; that he "rared about" having his team impressed for service by
                    Confederates. That it was unsafe for one to do anything openly for the Union but
                    that claimant expressed his opinion notwithstanding. Heard claimant say that Tom
                    Shumate impressed his team.</p>
                <p>W. W. CASSON testifies that he knew claimant during War and that claimant was as
                    good a Union man as could have been found in the Northern states anywhere.
                    Witness staid with him for a month and a half during that time, while he was
                    hiding around; that claimant was hiding and protecting witness because witness
                    was a Union man; that witness would have been driven off by claimant had he been
                    a Secession man; that claimant drove off 5 Confederate Cavalrymen who stopped at
                    his place for supplies; that claimant told witness he voted against Secession
                    and other men told witness the same thing about vote of claimant.</p>
                <p>J. B. CALE testifies that he lived within a mile of claimant during War; that
                    claimant was counted in the neighborhood generally as a Union man; that he
                    showed his sentiments by his conversations, and was recognized by Confederates
                    as being a Union man. Witness talked with claimant during War and claimant
                    expressed himself as a Union man, in favor of the Union army.</p>
                <p>D. E. BEARD testifies that he lived about a mile from claimant during War and
                    knew him; that claimant was regarded in the community as a Union man and always
                    talked favorably to Union side; he was considered a Union man by all who knew
                    him. Heard claimant say his team had been impressed by Confederates; about that
                    time many teams were impressed for hauling. Claimant was opposed to this use of
                    his team.</p>
                <p>W. D. HEMP testifies that he lived within 2 miles of claimant during War and knew
                    him; that it was said generally of claimant that he was a Union man; that
                    witness talked with him a good many times and as a general thing claimant was
                    cursing the Confederacy; that claimant did, nothing voluntarily for
                    Confederates; that witness was a Union man but did not vote at all; that they
                    said if a man did not vote for Secession he could not vote at all. At time
                    claimant's team was impressed by Shumate, for Confederates, witness' team was
                    also impressed by Shumate.</p>
                <p>From all the foregoing it is apparent that from the beginning until the end of
                    the War claimant expressed himself as an adherent of the Union cause, and gave
                    no voluntary aid to the Confederates. The failure of claimant to vote on the
                    question of secession is explained by the testimony of Mr. Hemp, referred to on
                    this page, from which it appears that it was stated that those who would not
                    vote for Secession could not vote at all. It is reasonable to suppose that the
                    witness Mr. Casson confused claimant's <u>not</u> voting for
                    Secession with a positive vote against it, or else referred to the first
                    election.</p>
                <p>It is seen that claimant assisted Union men to hide from Confederate conscript
                    officers and that this assistance was given as a matter of principle; that he
                    drove from his place Confederate soldiers who came there for supplies; that he
                    was considered as a Union man by the Confederates. All these facts, in
                    connection with the further fact that not one fact or circumstance appears
                    tending to show in the remotest degree anything at all unfavorable to claimant's
                    loyalty, go to show beyond question that this claimant should be found loyal. In
                    view of the extreme meagerness of the testimony submitted on loyalty before the
                    Commissioners we can express no surprise at their unfavorable finding, but the
                    testimony taken before this court puts an altogether different aspect upon the
                    case and shows that an injustice was done claimant in the former case.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt but that this claimant was loyal and the finding of this
                    Honorable Court should be to that effect.</p>

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Estate of Richard Anderson, deceased, v. The United States. No. 6835 Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p><u>Statement</u>.</p>
                <p>This claim is for property alleged to have been taken on the 7th day of June 1864
                    by command of Genl. Crook, from decedent's place in the vicinity of Middlebrook,
                    Augusta County, Va.</p>
                <p>The claim was presented to the Southern Claims Commision and by it disallowed
                    upon the following ground:</p>
                <p>Mr. Anderson testifies to his own loyalty generally in reply to questions 33
                    &amp; 34. He has two witnesses-one of whom "took him to be loyal"-the other
                    says "so far as I could tell he was loyal &amp; so regarded." The names of
                    the witnesses are on the poll list as all for ratifying the ordinance of
                    secession.</p>
                <p>Mr. Anderson says-"I was once impressed to haul supplies"-he does not tell when
                    this was-how long he was so employed in aid of the rebels, nor all of the
                    Circumstances. He always resided in a rebel Community, was never threatened or
                    molested, never did anything at any time for the Union Cause refers to no Union
                    man or Military officer to sustain him. -The circumstances are all against him.
                    -His service for the rebels was disloyal &amp; is not explained. -We can not
                    find his loyalty satisfactorily established &amp; therefore reject his
                    claim.</p>
                <p>The Confederate Archives of the Treasury Department disclose no evidence touching
                    the loyalty or disloyalty of decedent. The archives of the War Department show
                    two vouchers signed Richard Anderson by his mark, one dated at Staunton, Va. for
                    hay and the other at Richmond for lumber, hardware etc.</p>
                <p>The evidence appears to have been correctly abstracted.</p>
                <p><u>Argument</u>.</p>
                <p>While the claim was pending before the Southern Claims Commission decedent
                    testified that he lived in Augusta Co., during the war; never passed the
                    military lines; took the amnesty oath in 1865 in Staunton; he was once impressed
                    to haul supplies for the Confederates; did not leave the Confederate States
                    during the war; <sup>confederate</sup>commands took
                    hay but he received no pay for it; that he contributed nothing to the
                    Government; that he sympathized with the Union cause; did not vote either for or
                    against the ordinance and after its adoption remained with the Union.</p>
                <p>James E. Beard testified that he "took him to be loyal to the United States
                    Government during the war," referring to claimant; that he was so regarded by
                    his neighbors.</p>
                <p>Since the case was referred to this Court J.S. Engleman testified that decedent
                    was considered a loyal man; that he hauled harbored Union men during
                    the war; that claimant hauled for the Confederate Army in the fall of 1861; that
                    he was required to do so by the Confederates; that he was bitterly opposed to
                    doing it, swore and went on terrible; that he was engaged about a week or ten
                    days upon this trip; witness was not present when decedent's teams were pressed
                    into the service; that he merely heard of the transaction.</p>
                <p>W. W. Casson testified that decedent hid witness because he was a Union man; that
                    decedent ordered five Confederate Cavalry to leave his place when they came for
                    supplies; that he went after his revolver to force them to leave when they got
                    out; that the Union troops got supplies; does not recollect certainly as to
                    impressment of decedent's team into the Confederate service; that decedent told
                    him that he had voted for the Union.</p>
                <p>J.B. Cahill testifies that decedent was recognized as a Union man; that witness
                    was in the Confederate Army; that he saw decedent during the war; that decedent
                    always expressed himself in favor of the Union.</p>
                <p>D.E. Beard testified that decedent was regarded as a Union man; that witness was
                    in the Confederate service about 11 months; that decedent was considered a Union
                    man by everyone; that decedent's team was pressed into the Confederate service;
                    that he heard that it was; that there was no other Richard Anderson in his
                    neighborhood during the war; that he saw decedent frequently.</p>
                <p>W.D. Hemp testified that decedent was loyal and reiterates what the other
                    witnesses have stated about merely hearing that decedent's teams were pressed
                    into the Confederate service.</p>
                <p><u>Conclusion</u>.</p>
                <p>Decedent lived in the hot bed of rebellion during the war; he appears to have
                    been unmolested or uninjured and while attempt is made to show that he was a
                    Union man it also appears that others who were Union in sentiment were compelled
                    to hide in his house. If others were required to hide because of their
                    sympathies certainly it would seem that decedent's sympathies must have been of
                    such indifferent character as to enable him to deceive the confederates and thus
                    keep open house. Furthermore it appears that decedent used his teams in the
                    service of the Confederacy and outside of certain heresay testimony there is
                    nothing before the court which would show that such service was not voluntary.
                    The statement that decedent refused to feed five Confederate Cavalrymen because
                    of his loyal sympathies and drove them off at the point of a revolver, is too
                    improbable for consideration. As giving an idea of the value of the testimony,
                    Casson, one of the witnesses, testifies that decedent told him that he voted for
                    the Union, while decedent, who testified shortly after the war, says that he did
                    not vote at all.</p>
                <p>It is submitted that in the absence of any evidence showing any loyal sympathies
                    to the Federal Army and with the evidence that he rendered service to the
                    Confederacy as well as sold them hay, that this court should not find him loyal
                    throughout the late war of the rebellion.</p>

                <b>Claimant's Reply Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1901-1902.</p>
                <p>Estate of Richard Anderson, Deceased, vs. THE UNITED STATES. No. 6835
                    Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>This reply is addressed to the brief filed herein by the defense on December 12,
                    1902.</p>
                <p>A greater portion of defendant's brief consists of excerpts from the testimony,
                    which testimony has already been fully abstracted and presented in our original
                    brief. We have no criticism to pass upon defendant's brief except the conclusion
                    thereof, which is entirely erroneous.</p>
                <p>It clearly appears in the testimony that Claimant harbored Union men on his
                    place, while they were endeavoring to evade service in the Confederate army. It
                    would seem that such action as this would point very strongly to Claimant's
                    loyalty, but learned counsel for the defense maintains that this circumstance
                    points exactly in the opposite direction and that the mere fact that Claimant
                    was permitted by the Confederate authorities to remain upon this earth and enjoy
                    the blessings of good health, is almost conclusive evidence that he was disloyal
                    to the Union. We leave it to this Honorable Court to trace, if possible, the
                    logic of this conclusion at which opposing counsel arrives.</p>
                <p>The defense also lays great stress on the fact "that decedent used his teams in
                    the service of the Confederacy", and asserts that outside of certain hearsay
                    testimony, there is nothing before the Court, showing said service to be
                    voluntary. Let us see what the facts are concerning this.</p>
                <p>The Claimant himself testifies that he was once <u>impressed</u> to haul supplies. J.S. Engleman, who lived on an adjoining farm,
                    testifies of this occurence, that "he rared about it, and swore and went on
                    terrible, but he was forced to do it"; that the Claimant told witness, Thomas
                        Shoemate had impressed his team. D.E. Beard, who
                    lived near Claimant, testifies that at the time Claimant's team was impressed, a
                    great many other teams were also impressed in that vicinity. W.D. Hemp testifies
                    that the Confederate officer Shoemate came to
                    witness's house, pressed the team of witness and told witness at that time that
                    he had impressed Claimant's team with others. This evidence is not hearsay, and
                    opposing counsel is well aware of this fact. The fact that testimony concerns
                    statements made by others, by no means constitutes that testimony hearsay. The
                    statement made by Claimant, we submit, be admitted in evidence as part of the
                        <u>res</u><u>gestae</u>, and the
                    evidence that other teams were impressed at the same time and place, and that
                    the Confederate officer Shoemate stated that he had
                    just impressed Claimant's team, all constitute proper evidence as tending to
                    throw the light of surrounding circumstancess upon the transaction in question.</p>
                <p>Counsel for the defense attacks the weight of the testimony of W.W. Casson
                    because witness testifies that decedent said he voted for the Union, while
                    decedent says that he did not vote at all. It will be observed that the defense
                    endeavors to make a flat contradiction here. There is absolutely no
                    contradiction, however, in the testimony if it is carefully and properly read.
                    Let us examine the record upon this point.</p>
                <p>Claimant says that he did not vote on the Ordinance of Secession. Mr. Casson says
                    that Claimant told witness that he voted against Secession. Where is the
                    contradiction between these two statements? There were two elections upon the
                    matter of Secession, and Claimant's statement that he did not vote at the second
                    election certainly does not negate a statement that he voted for Union
                    candidates at the first election.</p>
                <p>Counsel for the defense dismisses with a slighting remark the testimony showing
                    that Claimant refused to furnish suplies to Confederate cavalry men and drove
                    them from his place, but we submit that the testimony concering this happening,
                    not being impeached in any way, this circumstance cannot be brushed aside with a
                    wave of the hand. The fact that this Claimant declined to aid these Confederates
                    and drove them from his place is very strongly corroborative of the other
                    testimony in the case, relative to Claimant's sympathies. We did not expect
                    counsel for the defense to elaborate upon this portion of the record, in view of
                    the fact that it is strongly in favor of Claimant's loyalty.</p>
                <p>Every act and word of Claimant, from the beginning until the end is indicative of
                    nothing but constant loyalty to the Union cause. Nothing can be made out of a
                    small voucher for hay taken by the Confederates. Claimant testifies years ago
                    that the Confederates took hay from him, and made this statement at a time when
                    he had no knowledge of any such voucher. There is absolutely nothing disclosed
                    in this record against Claimant's loyalty, while the testimony of Claimant and
                    of seven other witnesses shows beyond any reasonable doubt that Claimant was a
                    Union man during the entire war. We simply ask that this Honorable Court give
                    careful consideration to the testimony in the case, resting confident that but
                    one conclusion can be reached upon the record, and that conclusion must be in
                    favor of Claimant's loyalty.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner, John R. Fauver, respectfully represents to this Honorable Court:

                    that during the late war for the suppression of the rebellion said Richard
                    Anderson was a resident of the County of Augusta, State of Virginia; that during
                    said war, the Military Forces of the United States, under proper authority, took
                    from said Decedent, for the use of the United States Army, quartermaster stores
                    and supplies, of the kinds and values below stated, to-wit:</p>

                <p>That the claim of said Decedent for said stores and supplies was presented to the
                    Southern Claims Commission but was by said Commission rejected for the reason
                    that said Commission was not satisfied of claimant's loyalty; that your
                    petitioner, knowing said decision to be unjust, petitioned the Congress of the
                    United States for relief, and said claim was referred to this Honorable Court on

                    Representatives, for a finding of facts in accordance with the provisions of the
                    Act approved March 3, 1883, commonly known as the Bowman Act;</p>
                <p>That said Decedent, Richard Anderson, was during said war loyal to the Government

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1902-1903.</p>
                <p>Heir of Richard Anderson, decd., vs. THE UNITED STATES. No. 6835 Congressional.</p>
                <p>This claim, for stores and supplies alleged to have been taken by Federal troops
                    from Richard Anderson, now deceased, arose in the County of Augusta, State of
                    Virginia. It was presented to the Southern Claims Commission, but was by said
                    Commission rejected, as the Commissioners were not satisfied with proof of
                    Claimant's loyalty. It was referred to this Court under the provisions of the
                    Act, approved March 3, 1883, commonly known as the Bowman Act. Upon the usual
                    preliminary inquiry, the Claimant, Richard Anderson, deceased, has been held
                    loyal by the Court and the case is now before the Court upon merits.</p>
                <p>The real party in interest at the present time is John R. Fauver, who claims as
                    sole representative and also as residuary legatee of said Richard Anderson,
                    deceased. The title of Fauver will appear from the record.</p>
                <p>The claim as presented in the petition now before the Court is for the following
                    property:- 3 Horses at $150.00 each, $450.00. 2000 Chestnut rails, 20.00. Total
                    $470.00.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken at Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia,
                    September 8, 1871, while the claim was pending before the Commissioners of
                    Claims:-</p>
                <p>JAMES BEARD testified: Age: 50. Residence: Augusta County, Virginia, where I was
                    born and raised. Occupation: Farmer. Lived here during the war. Saw two horses
                    mentioned in Claimant's petition taken. They were taken June 7, 1864, from
                    Claimant's farm by soldiers of General Crook's army. There were officers
                    present; don't know their ranks or commands. The property was removed by
                    soldiers, the horses being led. The property was taken to the camp. Don't know
                    what use was made of it or that any complaint was made. No receipt was asked for
                    (P. 5) and none given that I know of. The property was taken about 3 o'clock in
                    the day. The horses that I saw taken were in good condition; don't know their
                    ages; suppose they were worth $150.00 each. Don't know for what they were taken.
                    I saw no other property taken. If the Government used them, they should pay for
                    them. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testified: Age: 60. Residence: Augusta County, Virginia, where I
                    lived during the war near Claimant. Occupation: Farmer. (P. 7). Did not see the
                    property taken. I am certain that it was taken by United States soldiers under
                    the command of General Crook, about June 7, 1864. One brown mare, 9 years old,
                    was worth $120.00. One sorrel mare, 4 or 5 years old, was worth $135.00. One bay
                    horse 4 or 5 years old, was worth $125.00. Did not see the rails taken, but saw
                    where they had been taken and burned. Know nothing about the taking of any other
                    property. I believe that the property was taken for the use of the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>Depositions were taken at Staunton, Viriginia. October 21, 1902, under the rules
                    of this Court, which relate principally to the loyalty of the deceased claimant,
                    Richard Anderson, but in which some statements were made relative to the taking
                    of the property. These statements are below presented.</p>
                <p>J.S. ENGLEMAN testified: Occupation: Farmer. Age: 54 years. Residence: Middle
                    Brook, Virginia. Not interested or related. During the war, lived with my father
                    John Engleman near Middle Brook. (P. 1). Lived on adjoining farm to Claimant.
                    The property was taken June 7, 1864, by Generals Crook and Averill, Hunter's
                    Division. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>W.W. CASON testifies: Knew Claimant during the war and stayed with him about 1
                    1/2 months. (P. 6). The Union army got hay, corn and grup from the Claimant. He
                    made no ado about it; they were the right stripe. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>Since the reference of the case to the court the following testimony was taken at
                    Staunton, Va., February 5, 1903:</p>
                <p>J. S. Engleman, testifies; age 54; residence Middlebrook, Va., not interested or
                    related. I was acquainted with the claimant, Richard Anderson, during the war
                    and am the same witness that testified on loyalty in October last. (p. 1).
                    During the war I lived about a quarter of a mile from the claimant. At the time
                    his property was taken by the Federal forces, I was sitting on my father's porch
                    and saw three horses taken out of claimant's field. They were in tolerably fair
                    condition, one brown mare about nine years old, one sorrel mare about three or
                    four years old, one bay horse about the same age. I do not know that there was
                    much difference in the horses; they were worth $150 each. One was older than the
                    others but was worth as much. I also saw two thousand rails taken from
                    claimant's place worth about $1.25 a hundred. I heard that flour and bacon had
                    been taken, but did not see it. Crook and Averill were in command when the
                    property was taken. The men taking the property were dressed in the uniform of
                    Federal soldiers. They came right out of a Union camp and took the horses into
                    camp, as far as I could see. They went around the hill, and I could not see them
                    further. (p. 1). My father's farm adjoined that of claimant. My father lost
                    property at the same time at the hands of the Federal forces. Claimant died some
                    years after the war and his wife Rebecca Anderson some years later. Mr. John R.
                    Fauver who is present to-day is a grandson of Richard Anderson and the person
                    mentioned in the will of Richard Anderson as residuary legatee after the death
                    of the widow. Claimant died leaving one child, a daughter, the mother of John R.
                    Fauver, and her husband is also dead.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I was about a quarter of a mile away when I saw the horses taken, but could see
                    them taken and recognized them as claimant's. I have not had the best of
                    eyesight all my life, am nearsighted.</p>
                <p>Re-direct examination.</p>
                <p>The horses when taken were between claimant's house and my father's, about half
                    way between the two houses. I could certainly see these horses taken and I knew
                    they were claimant's horses. (ps. 3 &amp; 4).</p>
                <p>Later this witness was recalled and testifies as follows: Claimant's property was
                    taken on the 7th of June 1864, about three o'clock in the evening.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>There were no Confederate troops camped in claimant's neighborhood shortly before
                    the taking of the property. They camped there several days afterwards. (p. 8).
                    No portion of the Confederate Army had to my knowledge passed through claimant's
                    neighborhood within 30 days before the 7th of June 1864. During the war,
                    claimant resided near Middlebrook, about nine miles from Staunton and
                    twenty-three miles from Piedmont.</p>
                <p>John P. Cale, testifies; are 61; occupation, farmer; not interested or related. I
                    lived about two miles from claimant during the war; was acquainted during that
                    period. The morning after the property had been taken, I was on the place and
                    saw where they had taken the rails and burnt them. Anderson, the claimant, told
                    me then they had also taken his Horses. There were about two thousand rails
                    taken. Also heard that some flour and bacon was taken. (p. 5).</p>
                <p>W. D. Hemp, testifies; age 74; farmer; not interested or related. I lived about a
                    mile and a half from claimant during the war and was well acquainted with him.
                    Some of his rails were burned. I did not see them burning. I saw that the fence
                    which had been there a few days before was gone and saw the ashes. Did not see
                    them taking the horses. He had the horses at his home a day or so before the
                    army came there and the next day after the army passed he did not have any and
                    he told me they had taken them. I don't know about the flour and bacon but I
                    heard them say the next day after the army camped there that they had taken a
                    lot of flour and bacon. (p. 7) It was taken by the army under Crook and Averill
                    in June 1864, but I do not know the exact date. They put the number of rails
                    down at 2,000.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>All I know about the taking of this property is what some one told me. The army
                    came one right to claimant's neighborhood and left the next morning. The
                    Confederate Army was not in that vicinity either shortly before or after the
                    taking.</p>
                <p>J. R. Fauver, testifies; age 40; residence, Middlebrook, Virginia, farmer;
                    grandson and sole heir of claimant. I am the grandson of Richard Anderson, the
                    claimant, and am the same grandson mentioned in his will and am claiming the
                    benefit of this claim if allowed. Rebecca Anderson, widow of Richard Anderson,
                    died sometime about 1884 or 1885 and Richard Anderson died about 1880. My mother
                    was the only child of Richard Anderson and she died when I was about six years
                    old. My father died about eight years ago and I am now the sole heir of my
                    mother and the sole heir and devisee of my grandfather Richard Anderson, the
                    claimant.</p>
                <p>(Note). Attached to the testimony of J. R. Fauver and marked exhibit "A" will be
                    found a duly certified copy of the last will and testament of Richard Anderson,
                    deceased, which reads as follows:</p>
                <p>First: I direct that all my just debts, and funeral expenses he paid as soon
                    after my decease as possible.</p>
                <p>Second. I will and bequeath that all my property, both real and personal is to be
                    held by my wife, Rebecca Anderson during her lifetime, and at her decease to go
                    to my grandson John R. Fauver, to he held by him and his heirs forever.</p>
                <p>Following the will will be found a certificate of the Clerk of the Court showing
                    that the above will was duly filed and probated</p>

                <p><u>H0RSES</u>.</p>
                <p>3 Horses at $150.00 each, $450.00.</p>
                <p>JAMES BEARD testified: Saw two horses taken from Claimant in June, 1864, by
                    soldiers of General Crook's army; officers were present; horses taken to camp.
                    Horses in good condition. Suppose they were worth $150.00 each. (P. 1).</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testified: Did not see property taken, but am certain it was taken
                    by soldiers under General Crook, about (P. 1) June 7, 1864; one brown mare worth
                    $120.00, one sorrel mare worth $135.00 and one bay horse worth $125.00. Believe
                    that they were taken for the use of the army. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>J.S. ENGLEMAN testified: The property was taken June 7, 1864, by Generals Crook
                    and Averill. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>J.S. ENGLEMAN testified: Lived about one-fourth of a mile from Claimant. Was
                    standing on my father's porch and saw three horses taken. They were in fair
                    condition. One brown mare, one sorrel mare and one bay horse, worth $150.00.
                    Crook and Averill were in command when property was taken. The men, taking the
                    property were dressed in Federal uniforms, came from the Union camp and took the
                    horses into camp, so far as I could see. Was living on place adjoining that of
                    Claimant. (P. 3). Was about one-fourth of a mile away when I saw horses taken,
                    but could see them taken, and recognized them as Claimant's. The horses were
                    taken about one-half way between Claimant's house and my father's house. I could
                    certainly see the horses taken and knew they were Claimant's horses. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>W.D. HEMP testified: Did not see the horses taken. Claimant had the horses a day
                    or so before the army came and the day after the army passed, he did not have
                    any, and he told me that they had been taken. The army came one night and left
                    the next morning. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>From the evidence, it is clear that three horses were taken from Claimant, and it
                    would seem that they were reasonable worth the price charged $150.00, but we are
                    aware of the fact that the Court will guided in estimating the amount to be
                    allowed by the prices then being paid by the Quartermaster Department.</p>
                <p>We think, therefore, that the item of this claim should be correctly stated as
                    follows:- 3 Horses at $150.00 each, $450.00.</p>
                <p><u>RAILS</u>.</p>
                <p>2000 Chestnut Rails, $20.00.</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testified: Did not see the property taken, but am certain it was
                    taken by troops under command of General Crook (P. 1) about June 7, 1864. Did
                    not see the rails taken but saw where they had been taken and burned. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>J.S. ENGLEMAN testified: I saw 2000 rails taken from Claimant's place worth 1.25
                    per hundred. The men taking the property were in Federal uniforms and came from
                    the Union camp. (P. 3).</p>
                <p>JOHN P. CALE testified: Lived about two miles from Claimant. (P. 4). The morning
                    after the property had been taken, and I saw on the place where they had been
                    taken and burned. There were about 2000 rails taken. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>W.D. HEMP testified: Some of Claimant's rails were burned; I did not see them
                    burning, but saw that the fence which had been there a few days before was gone
                    and saw the ashes. They put the number of rails down at 2000. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>It is evident that the rails were taken as charged for and used as fuel by the
                    Federal troops, and this item of the claim is therefore correctly stated as
                    follows:- 2000 rails (Chestnut), $20.00.</p>
                <p>The items of the claim should therefore be correctly stated as follows, to-wit:-
                    3 Horses at $150.00 each, $450.00. 2000 Chestnut Rails, 20.00. Total, $470.00.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                <p>Heirs of Richard Anderson, dec'd., v. The United States No. 6835 Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON MERTIS</p>
                <p><u>Statement</u>.</p>
                <p>This claim is for the value of three horses and 2,000 chestnut rails, amounting
                    to $470, alleged to have been taken from decedent on or about the 7th day of
                    June 1864, by soldiers under the command of Generals Crook, Averill and Hunter.</p>
                <p>The claim was presented to the Southern Claims Commission and by it disallowed on
                    the ground of failure in the proof of loyalty.</p>
                <p>Subsequently the claim was presented to the House of Representatives and referred
                    to this court pursuant to the provisions of the Bowman Act. Thereafter the claim
                    was presented to this court and decedent found loyal.</p>
                <p>There is nothing in the papers to show that letters of administration had been
                    taken out on decedent's estate.</p>
                <p><u>Argument</u>.</p>
                <p>3 horses at $150 each, $450.</p>
                <p>Beard testifies that he saw two horses taken on June 7, 1864, from decedent's
                    place, by soldiers of Gen. Crook's army; they were in good condition and
                    supposed they were worth $150 each.</p>
                <p>John Engleman testifies that he didn't see the property taken and accordingly his
                    testimony as to the same is irrelevant.</p>
                <p>J. S. Engleman testifies that the property was taken June 7, 1864 by Generals
                    Crook and Averill of Hunter's division but when cross-examined said that he
                        heard that it was impressed. Subsequently this witness testifies that
                    he was standing on his father's porch and saw three horses taken out of
                    decedent's field. They were in fair condition, worth about $150 each. The horses
                    were taken into camp; that he was about a quarter of a mile away when he saw the
                    horses taken but was able to recognize them.</p>
                <p>Cason testifies but to property not claimed in the petition.</p>
                <p>Neither Cale nor Hemp saw the horses taken.</p>
                <p>As to this item, while a number of witnesses have given testimony, Beard and J.
                    S. Engleman alone testify as to the taking. The other witnesses merely testify
                    as to what they heard. The property was doubtless taken though the evidence is
                    not clear as to the command that took the same nor as to the value, which seems
                    to be greatly exaggerated.</p>
                <p>2,000 chestnut rails, $20.</p>
                <p>As to this item J. S. Engleman testifies that he saw 2,000 rails taken from
                    decedent's place and they were worth $1.25 per hundred. Three other witnesses
                    testify in a general way as to this property but none of them actually saw them
                    taken and merely speak from hearsay. Accordingly, in the absence of any
                    corroborative evidence this item should be disallowed.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Reply Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1902-1903.</p>
                <p>HEIR OF RICHARD ANDERSON, DECD. vs., THE UNITED STATES. No. 6835 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>This brief is in reply to that filed herein by the Defense on March 12, 1903.</p>
                <p>To those statements contained on page 1 of Defendant's brief we can take no
                    exceptions.</p>
                <p>Referring to the statement at the top of page 2 that there is nothing to show
                    that letters of administration should be taken out on decedent's estate, we
                    invite attention to the fact that the original claimant died testate, by reason
                    of which fact, in the ordinary course of events, letters of administration would
                    not be issued.</p>
                <p><u>H0RSES</u>.</p>
                <p>Referring to the testimony of J.S. Engleman who witnessed the actual taking of
                    three horses, we would direct attention to the fact that Mr. Engleman states
                    that he lived about one-fourth of a mile from Claimant, and that the horses were
                    taken from a point midway beyween his house and
                    Claimant's house, and that he certainly saw the horses and knew that they were
                    Claimant's horses. While it is true that the witness W.D. Hemp did not see the
                    horses taken, he says that he knew that Claimant had the horses at his place
                    just before the army came and that after the army passed, the horses were gone.
                    Certainly the disappearance of these horses simultaneously with the passage of
                    the troops is strong circumstantial evidence to show that the troops and horses
                    disappeared together, in which case the presumption is that the horses were in
                    charge of the troops. On page 3, Defendant's counsel concedes that the property
                    was doubtless taken, but alleges that the value claimed $150.00 each, would seem
                    to be greatly exaggerated. During the war and especially in 1864 at which time
                    this property was taken, almost anything in the shape of a serviceable animal
                    was worth the price charged, which we do not think to be an exaggerated price by
                    any means.</p>
                <p><u>RAILS</u>.</p>
                <p>As to the taking of these rails as fuel, we have the testimony of one eye-witness
