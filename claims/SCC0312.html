<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The Proofs in this case will not warrant in finding that the property was taken
                    for the use of the Union Army. But one witness gives any evidence on this branch
                    of the claim. He says he "did not see the horse taken from the field, but saw it
                    led away" &amp; further says it was taken from the farm of the claimant in
                    June 1864 by soldiers of the Union army under Gen. Hunter - no officer present
                    only soldiers - taken in the day time - The Army was not encamped near - no
                    skirmish nor battle near - They told me they were ordered to take it - excepting
                    the opinions &amp; conclusions of the witness, such is the substance of all
                    the testimony given by the witnesses - Soldiers pillaging or stealing if
                    discovered always said they were ordered to do it.</p>
                <p>If the property was taken legitimately &amp; regularly for
                    the use of the Army it is not proved &amp; the claim must be disallowed.</p>
