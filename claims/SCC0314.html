<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of George W. Furr,
                            August 22, 1871, Claim No. 5710</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                George W. Furr filed this claim August 22, 1871, for $140, claiming that Union
                    troops confiscated one bay mare on June 8, 1864, from his farm near Staunton,
                    Augusta County, Virginia. The claim includes the voucher Furr received when his
                    horse was taken, signed by J. M. Wiggins of the 20th Ohio Cavalry. The Claims
                    Commission did not find J. M. Wiggins in its records and thereby determined that
                    the claimant was "imposed upon" by someone taking the horse for non-Army
                    purposes; the claim was disallowed in 1872.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claim rejected.</p>
                <p>The receipt purporting to be given by J.M. Wiggins of the 20th Ohio Cavalry is in
                    an unusual form &amp; such as would excite suspicion - "The United States
                    Gov't will pay to the bearer $140 on demand for a bay horse taken this day."</p>
                <p>On inquiry of the Third Auditor we are informed that no account of returns of
                    J.M. Wiggins are on file - neither does his name appear - nor is the
                    organization to which he is reported to have belonged mentioned in the Official
                    Army Register."</p>
                <p>We have no doubt that the claimant was imposed upon by some one - &amp; that
                    the horse was not taken for the use of the Army.</p>

                <p>Quest 1 Witness says - I am fifty one years old. I reside in Augusta County Va.
                    by occupation a farmer. I have known the claimant from a little child the
                    claimant is very deaf. I reside near him and saw him often during the war. He
                    was loyal to the United States during the war and was so regarded by his
                    neighbors. I never knew him to do anything for the Rebel Government. I never
                    knew him to do anything for the United States Government he had no opportunity.
                    I think he was too loyal to the United States Government to have been considered
                    loyal to the Confederacy if it had succeeded he used to hide himself in the
                    brush to keep out of the Confederate service and further the deponent saith not

                <p>Quest 1 Witness says - I am sixty one years old. I reside in the County of
                    Augusta Va. by occupation a farmer. I am certain that the horse mentioned in the
                    claimant's petition was taken by soldiers under the command of Genl Hunter I
                    think there was an officer present at the taking. The horse was carried off by
                    soldiers. I don't know but I suppose it was taken to Genl Hunter's Head
                    Quarters.</p>
                <p>12 Witness says - There was a receipt given for the horse.</p>
                <p>13 Witness says - The property was taken in the day time it was not taken
                    secretly.</p>
                <p>14 Witness says - When the horse was taken the army was encamped near Staunton
                    Virginia, about five miles from where the horse was taken</p>
                <p>15 Witness says - The horse was in good condition. I think she was five years old
                    and I think she was worth one hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
                <p>19 Witness says - I think the horse was taken for the use of the Army and not for
                    private use.</p>
                <p>21 Witness says - I think it was taken for the use of the Army because they gave
                    a receipt for it.</p>
                <p>22 Witness says - I think the Government after taking the horse for the use of
                    the Army ought to pay for it.</p>
