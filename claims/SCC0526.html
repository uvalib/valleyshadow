                    at all, I did not vote at all on ratification of the ordinance of secession.
                    After the ordinance of secession was adopted in Va, I still adhered to the Union cause and did not "go with the State."</p>
                <p>To Question 41, he says I do make that declaration.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the Com<sup>sr</sup>. as to the property charged.</p>
                <p>The horse was taken, which is charged in the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    item, on the 7<sup>th</sup> of June by a squad what
                    of Genl Hunter's command, that came down from
                    Staunton to get some wounded soldiers from the Hospital near Piedmont. It was an
                    ambulance train, I can't say whether any officers were present or not. They took
                    the horse from me at Piedmont. The horse was hitched in side of a lot at
                    Piedmont. They took the ride-saddle off and threw it down and said
                    the me who took him said he wanted to ride, I don't think he
                    said anything else. This was a blood bay, 5 years old, a good size horse-sound,
                    and worth at that time $150.00 I bought him the year before this was and gave
                        <sup>for</sup> him $153. The battle of Piedmont was fought
                    on the 5<sup>th</sup> of June 1864. He was past two years old
                    when I bought him I bought him a little about harvest time.</p>
                <p>The horse charged in this (2<sup>d</sup>) item was taken 29<sup>th</sup> of September 1864 out of my stable, in the day
                    time by some of Gen<sup>l</sup>
                    Sheridan's Army. I was present, I don't think any officers were present at the
                    place where the horse was taken from there was one on the other side of the
                    barn, where they came I was asked if I had any horses and where they were. I
                    told him what I had and where they were. No reason was given me for
                        ittaken the horse, I never saw the
                    horse afterward, the army was passing at the time. This was a light bay horse,
                    about 6 yrs old, sound about 16 hands high, worth at that time $175.</p>
                <p>All the other property charged were taken at the same time by the same troops, on
                    the same day. I was present and under the same circumstances the horse last
                    mentioned was taken. They took 8 cows, in all, 1 Steer which I had fattened for
                    market and 3 young cattle, I heard nothing said about the taking of the cattle.
                    Two of the cows were of blooded stock and were worth $30 a peice, on the hoof.
                    The others were worth about $25 a peice. The Beef was was worth $30. It was a
                    good steer and fat. It would have weighed 500 lbs dressed. But I don't know what
                    the beef was worth at that time. It was high. The young cattle were worth about
                    $10, a peice, I got no receipts for any of the property. There was no camp in
                    the neighborhood at the time. It was Gen<sup>l</sup> Sheridan's Army but I never learned the
                    name of the commander that took the cattle. Further saith not.</p>

                <p>I am 23 years old and reside near New Hope, Augusta County, Virginia. I am a
                    farmer. I am a son of the claimant. I have no interest in his claim. I saw two
                    horses, eight cows and 4 young cattle taken from the claimant by the Union
                    troops during the war. The bay horse was taken June 7, at the time of the
                    Piedmont fight. One of the claimant's daughters rode the horse to the camp at
                    Piedmont and came back without the horse. I did not see this horse taken. He was
                    five years old and was sorth about $140. The other bay horse and the cows and
                    young cattle were taken September 29, at the time of Sheridan's Burning Raid, by
                        Gen. Sheridan's army. The horse was in the
                    stable and three or four soldiers go him and led him away. They said nothing at
                    the time. This horse was six years old + was worth about $150. The cows and
                    young cattle were all together in the field and were driven away with the drove
                    with the army. I heard nothing said at the time. I did not see any officers
                    immediately present when any of this property was taken. There were plenty of
                    officers about. There was great excitement and amid it I could not distinguish
                    officers from men. I never made any effort to recover the cattle. I do not know
                    how much beef the cows or young cattle would have made. I do not know what the
                    cows were worth about $10 per head. This is all I know about it. Further
                    deponent saith not.</p>

                    Sheridans army on September 29, 1864. The horse was in the stable and was led
                    away by some Union soldiers. He was a light bay six years old &amp; was
                    worth $175 I suppose. I heard one whom I supposed was an officer say he would
                    have to take the horse. The cattle were all together in the field, and were
                    driven away with a drove which the soldiers were driving along the road. I did
                    not hear them say anything about the cattle. I do not know whether there were
                    any officers present when the horse and cattle were taken. I do not know how
                    much beef these cattle would have made. I suppose the whole lot would have been
                    worth $275. I dont know anything about the taking of
                    the first horse (charged as Item No. 1), but I knew his value and he was worth
                    $155. This is all I know about it, and further say not.</p>

                    in this claim. I rode my father's large bay horse to the battle-field at
                    Piedmont on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of June 1864. I got off the
                    horse and hitched him in the yard near the battlefield and a soldier came along
                    and took the horse. There were a number of persons present who asked the soldier
                    not to take the horse, but I do not remember what he said. I think the army had
                    left. The horse was five years old. I judge he was worth from $150 to $155. The
                    horse was about a mile and a half from my father's house when he was taken.

                <p>Gentlemen</p>
                <p>Samuel D. Humbert claimant to 2553 living near New Hope Augusta Co. I think was a Union man and loyal to the USGovt during
                    the war. I find that he had the reputation of being true, and I have made
                    careful enquiry in his case and cannot find it contradicted.</p>
                <p>I enclose with this the statement of David Beard a prominent man living in his
                    neighborhood, who knew him well during the war.</p>
                <p>Very Respectfully Yours</p>
                <p>S.E. Chamberlin Special Agent</p>
                <p>I am 40 years of age, and by occupation a farmer. I am personally acquainted with
                        Saml D Humbert. I have always lived here within
                    a mile and a half of his place. I knew him during the war, and saw him
                    frequently during that time. I always considered him a good Union man and he was
                        <sup>known</sup> generally through the neighborhood as
                    such. I never heard any one say that he was not a union man at all times, and
                    under all circumstances. My own sympathies were with <sup>the</sup> south.</p>
