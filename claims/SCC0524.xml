                <p>William W. Hailey filed this claim in 1875 for $215, claiming Union forces under
                    General Hunter took two horses and a saddle in 1864. William was 74 year old
                    farmer near Sherando. In 1863, Confederate soldiers from Georgia carried him 10
                    miles from home and threatened to hang him before turning him loose. He helped
                    his sons hide in the mountains and eventually flee to the Union in order to
                    escape Confederate Service. The commission allowed $200.</p>

                    a skirmish in about three miles of my house.</p>
                <p>79 Ans. One horse was a bright bay, five years old, in pretty good order, about
                    15 hands high. Worked well, but not much of a riding horse. I really would not
                    have taken $150 in gold for him. The Mare was a dark bay. Eight years old, in
                    good order, of good size, worked well and also rode well. I would <hi
                        rend="super">not</hi> have taken a hundred dollars for her. The Saddle
                    was not much worn. I paid $19.<hi rend="super">50</hi> for it.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Joseph H. Rankin</p>
                <p>My name is Joseph H. Rankin, my age is 33 years, my residence near Stuart's Draft
                    in Augusta County. I am a farmer. I am not related to the claimant, and have no
                    special interest in the claim, except as a neighbor. I testify in behalf of the
                    claimant.</p>
                <p>53 Ans. I have known the claimant twenty or twenty five years. I have known him
                    intimately all that time.</p>
                <p>54 Ans. I lived about 1/4 mile from him during the war.</p>
                <p>55 Ans. We met often, sometimes every day.</p>
                <p>56 Ans. I often conversed with him about the war. I have heard him say that he
                    did not care how soon the Union Army would come, and that he hoped they <hi
                        rend="super">(or it)</hi> would come. And he was invariably opposed to
                    the rebellion and secession.</p>
                <p>57 Ans. I know that he kept his sons out of the Confederate Army, by hiding them
                    in the Mountain, and finally sent them through the lines.</p>
                <p>58 Ans. I never knew him to do anything against the Union cause.</p>
                <p>59 Ans. I never heard anything said against his loyalty to the Union.</p>
                <p>60 Ans. His reputation was that of a Union man. I never a word to the contrary. I
                    know his sentiments by my often talking with him on that subject, and also
                    hearing from his neighbors.</p>
                <p>61 Ans. My father David Rankin, Henry Dedrick &amp; Jacob Furr. They could
                    all testify to his loyalty.</p>
                <p>62 Ans. I was an adherent of the Union cause, and so regarded by the claimant.</p>
                <p>63 Ans. I heard of treats. he was arrested at one time by some rebel soldiers and
                    carried away <hi rend="super">a</hi> short <del hand="h1">time</del> distance and
                    then turned loose.</p>
                <p>64 Ans. He never could have proved any loyalty to the Confederacy by me.</p>
                <p>I know nothing of the taken of the property charged. I know that the claimant was
                    the rightful owner and that they horses were good and valuable. I think they
                    were worth more than he has charged for them. The Saddle was good one, and worth
                    $15 or $18.<hi rend="super">00</hi>.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Martha S. Hailey</p>
                <p>My name is Martha S. Hailey, my age is 27 years. I reside near Sherando. I am the
                    daughter of the claimant.</p>
                <p>72 Ans. I was present when the property was taken, and saw them when taken. There
                    were a large number of Soldiers present. The horses were taken from the field,
                    and Saddle from the house. The horses were rode away. They were marching toward
                    the mountain and came from the direction of Staunton. I did not hear any
                    officers name mentioned.</p>
                <p>73 Ans. It was about 2 or 3 Oclock in the evening. I heard nothing said at all
                    about the taking of the property. They were <del hand="h1">Cal</del> Cavalry and
                    Artillery.</p>
                <p>74 Ans. There was no complaint made, that I heard.</p>
                <p>75 Ans. I heard of no receipt.</p>
                <p>76 Ans. My father has never received anything in payment for the property. This
                    is the only claim that he has ever presented.</p>
                <p>77 Ans. There was no encampment. They were marching. There was a skirmish two or
                    three miles from our house. They told us they had a fight at Piedmont a few days
                    before.</p>
                <p>79 Ans. The bay horse was a good animal and so was the Mare, and the Saddle was a
                    little worn. I do not knwo what they were worth.</p>

                    the daughter-in-law of the claimant.</p>
                <p>72 Ans. I was present and saw the property taken. The two horses were taken from
                    the field, which was in full view of the house, and the Saddle was taken from
                    the house. The horses were rode off. There were a very large number of Soldiers
                    present. I heard no officer named.</p>
                <p>73 Ans. The horses and saddle were taken in the afternoon. There was no secrecy
                    shown at all.</p>
                <p>74 Ans. I heard no complaint made.</p>
                <p>75 Ans. No receipt asked for or given that I heard of.</p>
                <p>76 Ans. I never heard of any payment being made or asked for except by the
                    present claim.</p>
                <p>77 Ans. The troops were marching at the time the property was taken. They came
                    from the direction of Staunton, and went on in the direction of the mountain. I
                    heard them say they had a little brush not far off.</p>
                <p>79 Ans. The horses were both in good condition, and the saddle not much worn. I
                    do not know anything of their true value.</p>
