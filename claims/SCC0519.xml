                <p>John Brown filed this claim in 1879 for $250, claiming the Union army took two
                    horses in 1864. John was a 41-year-old farmer. His dislike of the Confederacy
                    forced him to seek refuge in the mountains after he was unable to reach Union
                    lines due to an injury. He was threatened by Confederates and had a
                    brother-in-law in the Union Army. The commission allowed $210.</p>

                    he would not get him to do any more work for him that he would rather hang him
                    than give him work to do." -Three witnesses testify to his loyalty. He had a
