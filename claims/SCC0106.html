<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of William Stickley,
                            September 5, 1871, Claim No. 977</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Stickley's claim for the value of one horse was disallowed by the Commission for
                    insufficient proof of loyalty. His daughters appealed this decision to the Court
                    of Claims in 1903.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the sufficiency of the evidence of loyalty of Claimant.
                    There are no answers to printed questions bewteen 7 and 17. Claimant voted he
                    says neither for nor against the Ordinance of Secession, but his sympathies were
                    with the Union. He calls only one witness to his loyalty, and that wintess, who
                    "thinks Claimant was loyal to the United States Government, he was so regarded
                    by his neighbors."</p>
                <p>This is very weak testimony for loyalty, and utterly unsatisfactory. We reject
                    the Claim.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS, December Term, 1902-1903.</p>
                <p>William Stickley, vs The United States. No. 8,747 Congressional.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta County, Virginia, during the war,
                    where his claim originated. The claim is for one horse valued at $125.00, and
                    was disallowed by the Commissioners of Claims because they were not satisfied
                    with the proof as to loyalty. Claim is now before the court under the Bowman
                    Act.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in 1871 while the case was pending before the
                    Commissioners of Claims:</p>
                <p>Mr. Stickley, the claimant, testifies: Age 59; residence Augusta Co., Va.; have
                    lived there for 20 years. Never took an oath to the Confederate States nor
                    passed the military lines of the United States into the rebel lines. Took the
                    amnesty oath after the war (p. 1). Never was in the service of the Confederate
                    States, civil or military. Never arrested by the Confederate States nor the
                    United States. Rebels took hay and four or five horses from me. Was paid for
                    part. Never threatened or molested. Never did anything for the United States.
                    Had no near relatives in either army. Owned no Confederate bonds. Was with the
                    Union cause from the beginning and not with the Confederacy. Voted neither for
                    nor against the ordinance of secession; was with the Union all the time (p. 2).
                    Was ready and willing at all times to do what I could for the Union cause (p.
                    3).</p>
                <p>John Bumgardner, testifies: Age 61; known claimant 14 years; reside one mile from
                    him. Talked with his repeatedly during the war. Think he
                    was loyal to the United States, so regarded by his neighbors. Never knew him to
                    do anything for the U.S. soldiers. He fed Union soldiers whenever they came to
                    his house. Never knew him to do anything for the rebel movement. Think he was
                    too loyal to the United States to have been true to the rebel government had it
                    been successful (p. 4).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    court, in February, 1903:</p>
                <p>Mrs. R.S. Dinkle, testifies: Age 59; daughter of claimant. I lived in Augusta
                    County, Va., with my father during the Civil War. He was a Union man and
                    continued to be throughout the war (p. 1). In conversation with Union people he
                    always expressed himself as favorable to the Union side; he was generally known
                    by the people of the neighborhood to be one of their number. He belonged to the
                    German Baptist or Dunkards. He was a man of quiet habits; was not safe for a man
                    to take a very active part on the Union side at that time. He always threw his
                    influence on the Union side so far as it was safe to do so.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>He could not do much to help the Union cause. He was there penned down and could
                    not say much or do much. I don't know especially anything he did for the Union
                    cause. He was there between the Union and Confederate sides. Did nothing for the
                    Confederate side except what he was forced to do. (p. 2).</p>
                <p>Sarah M. Evars, testifies: Age 61; daughter of claimant. I was living and working
                    in Rockingham County during the Civil War. I was back and forth at the house of
                    claimant and saw him frequently. In talking with me and the other members of his
                    family he always expressed himself favorable to the Union cause. He continued to
                    be loyal to the Union cause throughout the war. He belonged to the Dunkard
                    church and the members of that church were generally opposed to secession (p.
                    3). It was not safe for a Union man to be active in that neighborhood. He was
                    surrounded by secessionists. He was a Union man in all his talk, as well as I
                    know. He was known by the Union people of the community as a Union man. Don't
                    know of his doing anything to help the Confederate side.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>Don't know of his doing anything to aid the Union side. Don't know of his taking
                    part on either side. He was surrounded by secessionists and never could express
                    himself. I lived about ten miles from father during the war. Don't know of his
                    contributing any money to the Confederate States or owning bonds (p. 4).</p>
                <p>Mrs. Susanna Stickley, testifies: Age 65; no interest except as wife of
                    claimant's son. I lived on the adjoining farm to the claimant and saw him often
                    during the war. He always talked in favor of the Union, was a Union man all the
                    time. All the neighbors knew he was a Union man. It was not safe to be active on
                    the Union side there then.</p>
                <p>Q. "Is it not a fact that the Confederates were very bitter towards Union people
                    and it was necessary for them to keep quiet?"</p>
                <p>A. "Well, they were around there, but I don't know whether they did anything so
                    powerful mean or not (p. 5)."</p>
                <p>I reckon the Union man had to keep their Union sentiments to themselves in order
                    to be safe. I don't know of anyone on the Union side that took any active part
                    in that neighborhood. Claimant stayed at home and attended to his own business.
                    From my knowledge of the claimant and the way he expressed himself and his
                    family, he was always a Union man.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I can't tell whether father helped the Union side or not during the war. Never
                    heard of any other Mr. Stickley in this section during the war. Never heard of
                    father depositing any money in the Bank of Rockingham during the war. Father had
                    no substitute in the Confederate army (p. 6).</p>
                <p>Mr. A.P. Anderson, testifies: Age 60; no interest. The claimant's and our farm
                    adjoined during the war; was well acquainted with him. He was regarded as a
                    Union man in that neighborhood. I was in the Confederate army, and when I would
                    be at home on furloughs, my father, Alexander Anderson, who was an
                    uncompromising Union man always told me that William Stickley was true to the
                    Union side and was sticking to him. The claimant belonged to the Dunkard church
                    and was a quiet man. From his reputation in that community, I looked on him as a
                    Union man throughout the war (p. 6 1/2). They considered it the safest by Union
                    men not to be too conspicuous in taking a part on the Union side, except my
                    father, who never considered that way.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I was in the army four years. I saw Mr. Stickney
                    often at my father's house during the war. He was a blacksmith and did father's
                    blacksmithing. I was not at home enough to state what Mr. Stickney did during the war to lead me to believe that he was a
                    Union man. My father would tell me that he was a Union man (p. 7).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>William Stickley, the claimant in this case, was 49 years of age at the
                    commencement of the war, consequently he was about conscript age during the
                    entire war. He never served in the Confederate army or militia; had no near
                    relatives in either army; was with the Union cause from the beginning, not with
                    the Confederacy; with the Union all the time; voted neither for nor against the
                    ordinance of secession, but was willing at all times to aid the Union cause.</p>
                <p>John Bumgardner testifies, talked with the claimant repeatedly during the war and
                    he was loyal to the United States; so regarded by his neighbors.</p>
                <p>Mrs. R.S. Dinkle, testifies that she lived with her father during the war, that
                    he in conversation with Union people always expressed himself favorable to the
                    Union. (ps. 1 &amp; 2). He was generally known by the Union people to be one
                    of their number. He was a man of quiet habits, always threw his sentiments on
                    the Union side.</p>
                <p>Sarah M. Evars testifies, also daughter of claimant; father was a Union man in
                    all his talk. He was known in the community as a Union man (p. 3).</p>
                <p>Mrs. Susanna Stickley says, the claimant always talked in favor of the Union with
                    her and Union men all the time; all the neighbors knew him to be a Union man (p.
                    3). From my knowledge of the claimant and the way he expressed himself and his
                    family he was always a Union man (p. 4).</p>
                <p>A.P. Anderson testifies, well acquainted with claimant during the war. He was
                    regarded as a Union man in the neighborhood. Looked upon him as a Union man
                    throughout the war. He was a blacksmith and did father's blacksmithing. Saw him
                    often at my father's house. (p. 5).</p>
                <p>This testimony is all favorable to loyalty. It shows loyal expressions throughout
                    the war, no change in sentiment and that he bore the reputation of a Union man.
                    The decision of the Court should be favorable.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>William Stickley, v. The United States. No. 8747 Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>This claim is for certain supplies alleged to have been taken from claimant in
                    Staunton Co., Va., in June 1864.</p>
                <p>The claim was presented to the Southern Claims Commission and by it disallowed on
                    the ground that claimant was not shown to have been loyal.</p>
                <p>The claim was subsequently presented to the House of Representatives and by it
                    referred to this court pursuant to the provisions of the Bowman Act.</p>
                <p>The Confederate Archives of the War Department show that one William Stickley
                    purchased a wagon at public auction at Staunton, Va. for which he paid $135.
                    There are also five other vouchers signed by William Stickley for forage at
                    various other places in the state of Virginia.</p>
                <p>The Miscellaneous Division of the Treasury Department shows the name of claimant
                    on p.8 of a list of certificate, issued by the Bank of Rockingham, Confederate
                    States Depositary.</p>
                <p>Argument.</p>
                <p>While the claim was pending before the Southern Claims Commission claimant
                    testified that he took the amnesty oath at Staunton; that he was never arrested
                    by the Confederates or the Federals; that he was never threatened or molested on
                    account of his Union sentiments; that he was with the Union cause at the
                    beginning of the war but voted neither way.</p>
                <p>Baumgardner testifies that he thinks claimant was
                    loyal and that he was so regarded by his neighbors; never knew of him doing
                    anything for the Federal soldiers except feed them whenever they came to his
                    house.</p>
                <p>Since the reference of this claim to this court Mrs. R. S. Dinkle testified that
                    she is a daughter of claimant; that her father was a Union man and continued so
                    throughout the war; that he was regarded as a Union man; that he was a Dunkard;
                    that he threw his influence on the Union side so far as it was safe; does not
                    know that he did anything for the Union cause; that he didn't do anything for
                    the Confederate side except what he was forced to do.</p>
                <p>Sarah M. Evans testifies that she is a daughter of claimant and substantially
                    reiterates the testimony of her sister; that she does not know that he took part
                    on either side; doesn't know whether her father contributed any money to the
                    Confederate States Loans or bought bonds.</p>
                <p>Susanna Stickley testifies that she is a daughter-in-law of claimant; that
                    claimant always spoke in favor of the Union; never heard of claimant depositing
                    money in the Bank of Rockingham.</p>
                <p>A. P. Anderson testifies that claimant was regarded as a Union man; that witness
                    was in the Confederate Army and that when at home his father told him that
                    claimant was true to the Union; that his reputation was that of a Union man.</p>
                <p>Conclusion.</p>
                <p>There is certainly nothing whatever in the evidence submitted in this case that
                    would prove claimant loyal to the Union cause. Certainly his inactivity is not
                    evidence of loyalty and can not be so construed. In addition to this fact it is
                    more than evident that William Stickley who was a depositor at the Bank of
                    Rockingham is the claimant as well as the same party who purchased the wagon
                    from the Confederate authorities at Staunton, Va.</p>
                <p>A tracing has been obtained from the archives of the War Department of the
                    signature of William Stickley to the various vouchers and is it quite evident
                    that the claimant is the party who signed these various vouchers.</p>
                <p>It is respectfully submitted that the claimant was not loyal to the Government of
                    the United States, and the petition should be dismissed.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Reply to Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term, 1902-1903.</p>
                <p>William Stickley, vs. The United States. No. 8747 Congressional.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The reference to the Confederate Archives by defendant's counsels as showing that
                    the William Stickley, referred to in all these vouchers, locating transactions
                    at remote distances from where he resided, is without the slightest
                    justification. He must know that William Stickley, claimant in this case, could
                    not have signed all those vouchers. Furthermore the signatures are different,
                    showing that the five signatures were not all written by the same man, and none
                    of them so strongly resembles the signature of the claimant as to justify the
                    conclusion that he signed them. But supposing he did, supposing he signed some
                    of them, could not have signed all, they are for trifling amounts and just what
                    would necessarily be taken by a small scouting party of Confederates, to which
                    no disloyalty can attach. There is nothing to show that William Stickley went
                    into the market, offered his produce, offered whatever he had to the
                    Confederates, at the market value or any other value. The conclusion is
                    irresistable, that what they appropriated, was taken without his approval. There
                    is nothing in the report of the War Department to show when these vouchers were
                    made, or the various places in Virginia, where forage, etc., was paid for, in
                    Confederate vouchers to one Willaim Stickley, hence these vouchers, until they
                    are brought into Court, otherwise proven to have been signed by this claimant,
                    can have no weight and are not entitled to the slightest consideration.</p>
                <p>Again, we have the expressionassertion of Defendant's
                    counsel, which is as usual, and quite as logical, as in all his briefs, that
                    there is "Nothing whatever in the evidence that would prove the claimant's
                    loyalty to the Union cause." Nothing in the proof in this case to show loyalty!
                    What lack of comprehension of the force of testimony is illustrated in this
                    remark. The proof shows, and shows conclusivelv that this claimant was for the
                    Union cause from the beginning to the end of the war. He never did favor the
                    cause of the Confederacy, but was for the Union all the time. No less than five
                    witnesses have been called, all of whom were familiar with the claimant's life
                    during the war period, and testify that they conversed with him repeatedly
                        aboutduring the war and before the war and that in all
                    his conversations he expressed himself favorable to the Union and was opposed to
                    secession, and that he was generally known by the Union people to be one of
                    their number. Who, pray, could you find who were more reliable judges of the
                    loyalty of their neighbors than those who themselves were Union men? It is safe
                    to say, and proper to urge upon the attention of the Court that where-ever you
                    find a man in an insurrectionary territory who stood well with his loyal
                    neighbors, was considered by them as one of them, one whom they could trust and
                        confideingin during the insurrection, that such a man
                    should he found loyal by the Court. Active loyalty has never been required, and
                    very seldom can you prove active loyalty, no matter how devoted a man was to the
                    Union, because he had no opportunity, living midst the surroundings that he did,
                    to aid the Union cause, except by his voice, influence, and General conduct. The
                    claimant did all this. He could not have been more loyal, living where he did
                    and midst the surroundings. I can see no reason, in again carefully reviewing
                    this testimony, why the decision of the Court should not be favorable on the
                    question of loyalty. Certainly there is nothing in the defence that deserves the
                    slightest consideration, as I have endeavored to show.</p>

                    Claimant.</p>
