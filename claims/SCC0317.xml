                <p>William and Alexander Gibson, sons of William Gibson (deceased) and executors of
                    his estate, claimed that Union troops confiscated 9000 pounds of beef and 2
                    horses from their father's farm near Arbor Hill, Augusta Co., Va. The testimony
                    reveals that the "fresh beef" were actually live cattle. The Claims Commission
                    ruled that a portion of the claim had already been paid ($210) and that the
                    remainder of the claim was unsubstantiated; thus the claim was disallowed in
                    1874.</p>

                <p>The deceased William Gibson lived in Augusta Co. Va. - The <abbr
                        expan="Executors">Ex<hi rend="super">rs.</hi></abbr> are his sons.</p>
                <p>The son <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> says he was conscripted in '62, after the
                    Conscript law was passed, into the rebel army &amp; remained in the service
                    till some time in 1863 when he was discharged. He does not give the dates of his
                    entry or discharge. He probably was in the rebel Army over a year. He says his
                    service was "involunteer" - "was conscripted." There is nothing to show this but
                    his <unclear>pan</unclear> assertion - no facts or circumstances stated so that
                    we can judge whether voluntary or not. The third Auditor it seems has allowed a
                    voucher for $210. worth of beef. Whether he knew of his service in the rebel
                    army does not appear - but it is probable that he was not informed of it.</p>
                <p>As to the other heir of the father the proof of loyalty might be deemed
                    sufficient.</p>
                <p>But it appears that the items 1 &amp; 2 charged as beef were really 18 head
                    of cattle all taken at one time; that the deceased soon after, perhaps the same
                    day, got a receipt for $210 - it is clear that he would have got a receipt for
                    the whole, as well as for a part, if the whole number 18 were really taken or,
                    were not in part paid for at the time. No one can give any reason why a receipt
                    for the whole was not given; &amp; we are satisfied that either a part was
                    paid for; or that a part did not come to Army use; or that the number or value
                    are much exaggerated and that the whole were not worth over $210. - The $210 has
                    been paid.</p>
                <p>The horses were taken "after dark" by "several" soldiers. No officers were
                    present. They said they were needed for the Army. There had been skirmishing
                    near there that day. - These, are all the circumstances of the taking &amp;
                    they indicate lawless rather that lawful taking - Claim rejected.</p>

                    the Confederacy. And he nor I ever give any aid voluntarily to the Confederacy.</p>
                <p>Ques. 26th Witness says I never was engaged in making raids into the U.S. from
                    Canada nor on the Lakes or rivers adjoining Canada.</p>
                <p>Ques. 27th Witness says My father never was engaged directly or indirectly in
                    doing anything to aid or abet the Confederacy. I have given <abbr expan="United"
                        >U.</abbr> States soldiers, held as prisoners by the Confederacy provisions.
                    He nor I never were members of any society or association whatever in connection
                    with the rebel Government or its authorities.</p>
                <p>Ques. 29th Witness says, No.</p>
                <p>Ques. 30th Witness says No.</p>
                <p>Ques. 31st Witness says I have received passes from Confederate
                    <unclear>Surgeons</unclear> to go home, but never took any oath.</p>
                <p>Ques. 32nd Witness says I was under no diabilities neither was my father. I was a
                    Registrar and took the so called "Iron clad" oath.</p>
                <p>Ques. 33rd Witness says At the beginning I sympathized with the Union cause and
                    used my influence as did my father in favor of the Union. Neither my father nor
                    myself voted for or against the ordinance of Secession. After the ordinance of
                    Secession was passed we both adhered in our sympathies to the Union.</p>
                <p>Ques. 34th Witness says I solemly declare that myself and father from the
                    beginning of hostilities against the United States to the end thereof our
                    sympathies were constantly with the cause of the United States, that we never of
                    our own free will and accord did anything or offered or sought to do anything by
                    word or deed to injure said cause or retard its success, and we were at all
                    times ready and willing if called upon to aid and assist the cause of the Union
                    so far as our means, and power and the circumstances permitted.</p>
                <p>Questions by the Commissioner</p>
                <p>Ques. 1 How old are you, where do you reside and what is your occupation and when
                    did your father William Gibson die.</p>
                <p>Answer. I am about 40 years old, I reside in Augusta Co. Va. My occupation is a
                    farmer. My father died April 10th 1869, aged about 84 years.</p>

                <p>Alexander Gibson, a witness introduced to prove the taking of the property of

                            rend="super">d</hi></abbr> being duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Ques. 1st Witness says, I was present when the property was taken, I saw them all
                    taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4th Witness says the cattle was taken on the 7th of June 1864, and the
                    horses taken on the 10th June 1864, from the farm of the Executors then William
                    Gibson, now deceased. Henry Demasters and others were present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6th Witness says that he does not know whether there was any officer
                    present or not.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7th Witness says. The Cattle were drove off and the horses rode. The
                    soldiers said they were ordered to take the property for the use of the Army.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9th Witness says the Cattle were removed to Staunton, Va. and the horses
                    were taken when the Army was moving to Lexington Va.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10th Witness says I suppose the cattle were taken for beef, as they were in
                    good order, but do not know the <del hand="h1">less</del> use the horses were taken for.
                    My father complained at the time, but the soldiers said they had orders to do
                    so.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12th Witness says. My father asked for a receipt, and did get a receipt for
                    a part of the cattle, which was signed by Capt. Ash and countersigned by Gen<hi
                        rend="super">l</hi>. Custer, which is filed with the Claimants
                    petition. I do not know why a receipt was not given for the other property. The
                    Cattle were taken in the day time in the forenoon, and the horses about dark.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14th Witness says. There was no regular encampment in that vicinity, only
                    for the night - The army was in Command of Gen<hi rend="super">ls</hi>.
                    Crook &amp; Averill. There had been a battle at Piedmont by Gen<hi
                        rend="super">l</hi>. Hunter's Army about 20 miles off. There was a
                    skirmish about 3 miles away, on the day the horses were taken I know no officer
                    of any rank.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15th Witness says. The Cattle and horses were in good condition when taken,
                    and worth all that is charged in the petition.</p>
                <p>Ques. 19th Witness says I believe all the property was taken for the use of the
                    Army, and not to gratify the wish of soldiers, or officers and that it was
                    necessary for them to have them.</p>
                <p>Ques. 20th Witness says I do not know them, but suppose the property was taken
                    because it was needed so necessary as to justify the Officers in ordering it to
                    be taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 22nd Witness says I do suppose that it was so necessary for them to have it
                    &amp; that is was so useful as to warrant and require the Government to pay
                    for it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 23rd Witness says I believe it was taken by the order of an officer or
                    officers having authority, as the soldiers said they were acting by order.</p>
                <p>Questions by Commissioner</p>
                <p>Ques. 1st How old are you, Where do you reside and what is you occupation?</p>

                <p>In answer to the First General Interrogatory, the Deponent says: My name is
                    William T. Fauber, my age 48 years, my residence Near Arbor Hill, Augusta, in
                    the State of virginia, and my occupation a Farmer; I am not related to the
                    claimant, and have no beneficial interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2 Ans. I have known <abbr expan="William">W<hi rend="super"
                    >m</hi></abbr> Gibson <abbr expan="deceased">dec'<hi rend="super"
                    >d</hi></abbr> from my boyhood, and resided about one mile from him during the
                    War. I saw him once and twice a week during the war. I had frequent and free
                    conversations with him about the war, and always found him opposed to the War.
                    He said that the attack on Ft. <orig reg="Sumter">Sumpter</orig> was the worst
                    thing the South could have done, that the war was unjust and would not succeed.
                    I am satisfied that he never did anything in aid of the rebellion voluntarily. I
                    have heard him say "The South could not be whipped, any too soon to please
                        <del hand="h1">me</del> him." I have heard him express himself freely to others
                    besides myself. The Union men of his neighborhood had full confidence in his
                    loyalty to the Union and its cause, and were free in telling him all they knew.
                    I am satisfied that if the South had succeeded as an independent Government that
                    the deceased could not have shown any loyalty to it. He thought that in that
                    event he would have to leave.</p>
                <p>I am also intimately and well acquainted with the legatees, and was during the
                    war. William and Alexander are the executors. John Gibson and the widow now
                    deceased are the legatees by virtue of the Will of the deceased W. Gibson. The
                    daughters were provided for by specific item in said Will and are not
                    beneficiaries in the claim against the United States. The family from the oldest
                    to the youngest were strictly and thoroughly loyal to the United States. I never
                    heard any of them express a disloyal sentiment or do a disloyal act. John Gibson
                    told me <add hand="h1" place="inline">he</add> voted against the ratification of the Ordinance of
                    Secession. I know that neither of them could show the slightest loyalty to the
                    South or its cause.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Henry Demasters</p>
                <p>My name is Henry Demasters, my age is 64 years, my residence near Lexington
                    Nelson Co. Va. My occupation a laborer on a farm. I resided on the farm of the
                    claimants during the War, and knew their feeling and sentiments well in relation
                    to the war and its cause, and I know that they all were bitterly opposed to the
                    War and secession. I never knew them to say or do anything in aid, or favor of
                    the rebellion. My sympathies were with them, hence always conversed with them
                    without reserve. The Secessionists of the neghborhood regarded them as disloyal
                    to the South. I helped the claimants to hide grain and other property to keep
                    the Confederates from getting it and also know that there was a large quantity
                    kept in the straw until after the surrender. I am satisfied, that neither one of
                    them had any sympathy with the rebellion. I was present and saw the Cattle 18
                    head drove out of the field by the Union soldiers, under the command of Genls.
                    Crook and Averill. I do not know the name of any officer engaged, there were a
                    large number engaged. The Army had encamped the night previous about 3 miles
                    from the Claimants, and on the day the Cattle were taken the Army of Genls.
                    Crook &amp; Averill was marching to Staunton and joined Genl. Hunter at that
                    place. The Cattle were taken in the forenoon, in the month of June 1864. I do
                    not recollect the day of the Month, but a few days after Genl. Hunter's battle
                    at Piedmont. Genls Crook &amp; Averill had had no battle near. I did not
                    hear anything said about the taking of the Cattle. I was present when a receipt
                    was given for the Cattle. I do not remember the name of the Officer who gave the
                    receipt. The receipt was given to <abbr expan="William">W<hi rend="super"

                    Cattle, all in pretty good order, generally young, 3 and 4 year old - 6 of them
                    would have weighed upwards of 1000 gross, I think 600 <orig reg="net"
                    >nett</orig>, and the remainder 12 would have netted 300 and 400. I think from
                    my recollection of the Cattle that they would have exceeded in <orig reg="net"
                        >nett</orig> beef 9000 lbs as charged. I think seven cents is a low as beef
                    could have been bought at in good money. I saw the two mares charged in their
                    possession when the Army was marching to Lexington, it was in the Night, and the
                    Army was marching on two different <orig reg="parallel">paralel</orig> routes.
                    They were leading the Mares when I saw them, I suppose it was a Cavalry command
                    as the Soldiers were all mounted. I heard nothing said in relation to them.</p>
                <p>The Mares were young, in color bays, a small white star in their faces, in fine
                    order, well broken and good matches. I think they would have been well worth
                    $160 each, or $170.</p>

                    no beneficial interest in the claim, as my father by his will bequeathed me a
                    specific sum. I was present and saw the Cattle charged in the account taken,
                    there were 18 head. They were taken in June 1864, near the first of the month,
                    by the Army commanded by Genls Crook &amp; Averill, then on their to
                    Staunton. The Cattle were taken in day light, about 10 Oclock A.M. The Army had
                    camped the night previous about 3 miles from my fathers. I do not know how many
                    men were engaged in driving the cattle. I did not hear the name of any officer.
                    My father went to Staunton, and got a receipt for a part of the Cattle, the
                    amount of beef I do not recollect. I believe the receipt (Duplicate) was filed
                    with W.G. Riley, a former Special Commissioner, and I heard my brother say that
                    he had given the original to Senator J.F. Lewis (see his letter filed herewith
                    &amp; marked <hi rend="underline">B</hi>). When the horses were taken, it
                    was after dark. I saw several soldiers, they said they belonged to the Union
                    Army. This was two or three days after the cattle were taken, and as the Army
                    was on its way to Lexington. They said they needed the horses and were obliged
                    to have them. They were skirmishing near to our house the evening that the
                    horses were taken. No regular battle except the one at Piedmont several days
                    previous.</p>
                <p>The Cattle were in good condition. I am <add hand="h1" place="inline">not a</add> judge of Stock and

                <p>The horses were about 5 &amp; 7 years old, in good condition, and well

                    were in good order. The estimate made at the time I recollect was 9000 lbs. They
                    were taken in different lots, 6 of them were large, and the others medium size.
                    I saw the horses taken, they were taken about dark. There were 3 soldiers who
                    said they belonged to the Union Army. This was several days after the Cattle
                    were taken. The Army then was on its way to Lexington. I think the horses then

                <p>Ques. 1st Questions by the Commissioner.</p>
                <p>How old are you, where do you reside, and what is your occupation?</p>
                <p>Answer. I am about 25 years old, I reside in Augusta Co. Va. My occupation is a
                    house keeper. I have known the deceased William Gibson and the Claimants all my
                    life. I saw them often during the war. They were at all times loyal in their
                    sympathies to the Union Cause and were so regarded by their neighbors. They had
                    no opportunity to contribute to the support of the United States.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2 Do you know of any act done, or language used that would have prevented
                    either of the parties named in the petition from establishing his loyalty to the
                    Confederacy, had it <add hand="h1" place="inline">been</add> maintained as a <orig reg="separate"
                        >seperate</orig> Government.</p>
                <p>Answer. I do not think that they could have established any loyalty to the
                    Confederacy.</p>
                <p>Further this witness saith not.</p>

                <p>Henry Demasters, a witness introduced by Claimants to prove loyalty to the United
                    States, being duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Questions by Commissioner</p>
                <p>Ques. 1st How old are you, where do you reside, what is your occupation?</p>
                <p>Answer - I am 62 years old, I reside in Augusta Co. Va. My occupation generally a
                    farmer. I have known the Claimants since 1862. I saw them often during the War.
                    They were strong Union men, often heard them talk in opposition to the
                    Confederacy, and in favor of the Union. I think their neighbors all regarded
                    them as Union men and hated them for it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2nd Do you know any act done or language used by either of the Claimants
                    that would have prevented them on either of them from establishing his loyalty
                    to the Confederacy, had it been maintained as a <orig reg="separate"
                    >seperate</orig> Government.</p>
                <p>Answer. I do not know that they could.</p>
                <p>Further this witness saith not.</p>
