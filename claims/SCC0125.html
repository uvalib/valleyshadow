<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of David Sansabaugh,
                            September 14, 1871, Claim No. 6904</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Sansebaugh's claim for two horses was disallowed by the Commissioners in 1872
                    because his name was listed on Augusta County poll books as having voted for the
                    Ordinance of Secession. Sansebaugh appealed this decision to the Congressional
                    Court of Claims in 1896 and again in 1898.

                <p>While the claim was pending before the Commissioners the following testimony was
                    taken in Sept. '71.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT testifies: Age 44; residence Augusta Co., Va., Farmer. Resided at the
                    same place all the time prior to April 1st, '61, and remained there during the
                    war, until '64, I went through the lines to the North, where I remained until
                    about the 1st of June '65. I did not pass beyond the military or naval lines of
                    the U.S. and enter the rebel lines. Never took any oath to the Confederate
                    states. Took the amnesty oath to the Confederate states. Took the amnesty oath
                    at Staunton, Va. in '65. Never asked for a pardon. Never connected in any way
                    with the civil service of the Confederacy. (P. 2). Never held any office under
                    the Confederacy. Never an officer, sailor or soldier. Never furnished a
                    substitute. Never in the employment of the Confederate Govt. Never gave any aid
                    or information to the Confederacy. Never engaged in the manufacture of any oggds or stores. Never in the employment of the
                    Confederacy. (P. 3). Never engaged in Blockade running. I left the Confederate
                    states in '64 and went to Clarksburg, W. Va., and was employed by Capt. Wm.
                    Cooney, as cook in the U.S. Army, and returned to my home in Augusta Co., in
                    '65, after the close of the war. Had no interest in any boat or vessel running
                    in any of the waters of the Confederacy. I was arrested four times by the
                    Confederates. I took no oath to get my release. but each time run away. I never was arrested by the U.S. I had some grain and hay
                    taken, also bacon. Received no pay. My wife was threatened with imprisonment for
                    feeding deserters. (P. 4). This was when I was in the Union army. I never was
                    otherwise molested or injured. I never contributed anything to the U.S. I never
                    done anything, except my own service in the Union army, and my wife sheltered
                    and fed men who were keeping out of the Confederate army. I had a brother in the
                    Confederate army for awhile and then he went North. I had no relatives in the
                    Union army. I never owned a Confederate bond, or did anything to support the
                    credit of the Confederacy.. I never give aid or comfort
                    to the rebellion. I never was enaged in making raids into the U.S. from canada,
                    Never engaged in holding in custody any person taken as prisoner of war by the
                    Confederates. (P. 5). I never belonged to any society for the persecution of any
                    person because of their loyalty to the U.S. I never was a paroled prisoner of
                    the U.S. Never held any office in the U.S., Never received a pass from the
                    Confederate Govt. Under no disabilities, and have held no office since the war.
                    At the beginning of the war my sympathies were with the Union. I did not vote
                    for or against the ordinance of secession. I adhered to the Union all the time.
                    Declare from the beginning of hostilities against the U.S. to the end my
                    sympathies were constantly in favor of the Union. I was at all times ready and
                    willing to aid the Union cause so. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>JOHN R. BUCHANAN testifies: Age 28; residence Augusta Co., Va., farmer. I have
                    known the claimant all my life. Lived near him. Saw frequently during the war. I
                    leave no doubt from his acts and language of his loyalty to the U.S. and all his
                    neighbors so believed him. He never done anything for the rebellion. He was in
                    the service of the U.S. Army in W. Va. He could not have remained in the
                    Confederacy, had it been successful. I know claimant was badly treated for his
                    Union sentiments, and that his wife in his absence was very badly treated in
                    various ways. (P. 10).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court, in Nov. 1895.</p>
                <p>T.A. GREGORY testifies: shoemaker; age 67; residence Moffatt's Creek, Va., Not
                    related or interested. (P. 1). I have been acquainted with the claimant about 38
                    years. Knew him during the war. We refugeed together during the war. I saw the
                    claimant often, and had conversations with him, and he expressed himself as
                    opposed to the war. I lived a portion of the time on his farm, and a portion of
                    the time within two or three miles of him. His reputation in the neighborhood
                    was good as to Union sentiments. I think all the neighbors knew him to be a
                    Union man. I had a good many conversations with him during the war, and he
                    always expressed himself as in favor of the Union to me. Claimant refused to go
                    into the army of the South, and refugeed and left his home to keep from going
                    into the Southern army. Claimant was arrested by the Confederates, and shot at
                    while trying to make his escape. (P. 2). I was with him when he was shot at. He
                    frequently concealed Union man and extended aid to those
                    trying to escape from the Confederate lines. Claimant never did anything that I
                    know of to aid the Confederate Govt. Witness' attention is called to the fact
                    that the records show that David Sensibaugh voted for secession, and states
                    There was another man named David Sensibaugh living in the neighborhood. He had
                    sons in the Confederate army, and I think he voted for secession. I think the
                    claimant was a Union man throughout, from the commencement of the war to the
                    winding up. He could not have established his loyalty to the Confederacy, had it
                    succeeded.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I think almost all of his neighbors accused claimant for being a Union man, and I
                    think it was right. I heard Mr. Geo. Clemer say he was a Union man. I heard Mr.
                    James Buchanan say he was a Union man, (P. 3). During the war. In speaking of
                    Mr. Sensibaugh during the war, as to his transactions, etc., in not going into
                    the war, and sometimes I met with those at different places. One of the places
                    was at my own home. I was a shoemaker by trade, and talked to a great many
                    persons at that time. I frequently met men on the road, and they would speak of
                    him as a Union man. I could not recall the times I met Clemer and the other men,
                    nor what was said at those times. I can swear that during conversations with
                    Clemer, Buchanan, and others the claimant's name was mentioned particularly. I
                    was well acquainted with the claimant, and have been a good many years. (P. 4).
                    He left his home in '64. I hwas with him, Mr. Buchanan, Wm. Jackson, and several
                    others were along. Names them. I think it was about the 1st of Nov. Can't
                    remember the day exactly. The last of Oct. or the 1st of Nov. We went to
                    Beverly, the first place, then to Buchanan, and took the oath there at Buchanan.
                    Then they went to Clarksburg, but I only went a part of the war. That is all I
                    knew of Mr. Sensibaugh the balance of the war. I have not a claim against the
                    Govt. I lived about six miles from the claimant, I suppose. Then in '62-63 I
                    moved to about three miles from him. Then in '64, I lived within call of his
                    house, living on his farm. We did not vote at the same precinct in '61. He was
                    conscripted, but I don't think he was in the army more than 10 days. (P. 5). He
                    was in the army the last of the war. I have most forgot. He had a brother in the
                    army awhile, but not a father. I don't know that he had any uncles in this
                    Country. I suppose claimant deserted. He deserted when he got ready. Claimant's
                    voting precinct in '61 was Newport, Augusta Co. Suppose the claimant kept out of
                    the army till '64, by hiding himself out in the woods. I knew very little about
                    his movements till '64, except that I knew him as a Union man. He came to my
                    shoe shop or house before I moved to his farm, and we frequently had
                    conversations about the war. I think he never said how he voted. Claimant has
                    been in this room this morning while I am being cross-examined. Claimant came
                    about 18 miles to be present at this hearing. (P. 6). I don't remember that he
                    ever told me he wanted to see the south beaten during the war. He wasn't
                    detailed to work for the Confederates in their shop. I don't remember about any
                    other David Sensibaugh voting at Newport in '61. Claimant has no middle initial.
                    I couldn't say if there was any other David Sensibaugh's in the neighborhood who did not have any middle initials.
                    (P. 7).</p>
                <p>JOHN R. BUCHANAN testifies: Farmer; age 52; residence Moffatt's Creek, Va. Not
                    interested or related. (P. 8). I have known the claimant all my life. He
                    expressed himself against the war. I saw him often, lived about a half mile from
                    him. I was a Union man. He was regarded by every body in that neighborhood as a
                    Union man. He never made any secret of his Union sentiments. He was threatened
                    and shot at by the Confederates several times; don't know about his being
                    arrested. He went through the lines to avoid fighting against the Union. I don't
                    think he voted at all. (P. 9). There was another man named Davis Sensibaugh
                    older than claimant living in that community at that time. Suppose that man was
                    a Confederate. His voting place was Newport. He concealed and fed men trying to
                    escape from the Confederate lines, and Union men were arrested by the
                    Confederates at his house. He did not do anything to aid the Confederate side.
                    He was conscripted and remained eight or ten days, and deserted at the first
                    opportunity. He was forced into that service, and taken from his home. I don't
                    think claimant could have established his loyalty to the Confederacy, had it
                    succeeded.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I lived within a half mile from claimant in '61, and all of the war. I was a
                    farmer. (P. 10). I lived with my father, he owned a farm. I don't know that the
                    other Mr. Sansibaugh had any middle name. He was a distant relation to claimant.
                    I am not positive about the other Mr. Sansibaugh voting at Newport. He lived
                    right there, and I don't know where else he ould have
                    voted. Claimant lived 2-1/2 miles from Newport in '61, that is the walking way,
                    and about three miles around by the road. He lived about seven miles from
                    Middlebrook. The other David Sansibaugh lived about three miles from Newport, in
                    the other direction from the claimant., and I expect 10 miles from Middlebrook.
                    The other Davis Sensibaugh is dead. Died about three
                    years ago. Names the Union men the claimant concealed from the Confederates.
                    This was about '64 I guess. This was not long before they went to W. Va. (P.
                    11). We were all straight Union men.. Claimant deserted around. He flanked the
                    recruiting officers. I have just heard you ask the claimant's attorney to put
                    claimant on the stand, and heard him decline, and I have also heard you ask the
                    claimant to allow you to cross-examine him, and he declined. I never heard
                    claimant says he voted for secession. Claimant was threatened and shot at when
                    he had the other deserters at his house. Some of the deserters were friends of
                    his, and some were from a distance.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I have heard the attorney for claimant state that he didn't put claimant on the
                    stand, because his deposition was already on file. (P. 12).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims doubted the justness of the claim The only allegation
                    of disloyalty they make in their report is that the claimant voted for the
                    ordinance of secession. This was a mistake.</p>
                <p>The claimant says at the beginning of the war his sympathies were with the Union.
                    That he did not vote for or against the ordinance of secession, that he adhered
                    to the Union all the time.</p>
                <p>The testimony taken since the reference of the claim to the Court shows that
                    there was another man by the same name living in Middlebrook, who had sons in
                    the Confederate army. This was doubtless the man who voted for the ordinance of
                    secession.</p>
                <p>The affirmative facts of loyalty in this case are very convincing.</p>
                <p>The claimant was 34 years old in '61. Farming in Augusta Co., Va., In '64 he went
                    through the lines to the North where he remained until June '65. While inside
                    the Union lines he was engaged for sometime in working for the U.S. He was not
                    connected with the Confederate service. He fed deserters from the rebel army and
                    aided them in getting through the lines. He also aided Union men. His
                    expressions throughout the war were at all times in favor of the Union cause and
                    as desiring its success. His reputation was that of a consistent Union man.
                    These facts certainly justify a favorable finding on loyalty.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1896.</p>
                <p>David Sensibaugh, vs. The United States. No. 8610, Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The evidence is correctly abstracted in claimant's brief on loyalty.</p>
                <p>The poll lists of Augusta County, Va. show that a person of claimant's name voted
                    at Newport (claimant's voting place) for the ordinance of secession. Claimant
                    has attempted to meet this by producing evidence that there was another person
                    of his name whose voting place was Newport and who was a secessionist. The C.S.
                    Archives show that a person of claimant's name enlisted in the confederate army.
                    Claimant has produced evidence tending to show that he was conscripted and
                    deserted. If the court shall consider these explanations sufficient, I see no
                    objection to his being found loyal, otherwise the case should be dismissed.</p>

                <b>Claimant's Reply to Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1895-96.</p>
                <p>David Sensibaugh, vs. The United States No. 8610 Cong.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Directing the attention of the Court to the first point made by defendant's
                    counsel as to the claimant having voted for the ordinance of secession., it is
                    contended that the proof as to his not having voted for said ordinance is
                    absolutely conclusive.</p>
                <p>Claimant himself testifies that at the beginning he was opposed to secession and
                    did not vote for or against the ordinance of secession and that he adhered to
                    the Union all the time.</p>
                <p>Mr. Gregory testifies that there was another man named David Sensibaugh who lived
                    in that immediate neighborhood and who had sons in the Confederate army, and
                    witness thinks he voted for secession..</p>
                <p>Mr. Buchanan also testifies that there was another man named David Sensibaugh who
                    was older than the claimant and who lived in that community at that time and
                    whose voting place was the same as that of the claimant. That this man, he
                    supposes was a Confederate. Witness is not positive that this other Sensibaugh
                    voted at Newport, but says that he lived right there and he don't know where
                    else he could have voted. This man is dead.</p>
                <p>In view of the threats made against claimant on account of his Union sentiments,
                    it is reasonable to believe, aside from the positive testimony on that subject
                    that he did not vote for the ordinance of secession because of fear.</p>
                <p>As to the service of the claimant in the Confederate army referred to by
                    defendant's counsel we have the positive testimony of the claimant that he was
                    not in the service.</p>
                <p>Other witnesses testify that he was arrested by the Confederates, but made his
                    escape. One of these witnesses says that he was conscripted and remained eight
                    or ten days and deserted. At all events the proof shows very conclusively that
                    the claimant was not a soldier in the Confederate army.</p>
                <p>The proof is very strong and conclusive on loyalty in this case. In fact the
                    claimant was actively loyal.</p>

                <b>Claimant's Motion for a New Trial on Loyalty</b>
                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1896-97.</p>
                <p>David Sensibaugh, vs. The U.S. No. 8610 Cong.</p>
                <p>MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>This case was submitted on loyalty without argument Dec. 17th, 1896. Loyalty not
                    found, case dismissed. Petition filed Sept. 2nd, 1896. Claimant's attorney,
                    Gilbert Moyers, moves this Honorable Court for a new trial on loyalty. There is
                    no room for doubt that the Court erred in not finding the claimant loyal.
                    Defendant's counsel even offers no defense.</p>
                <p>The facts are as follows:--Mr. Sensibaugh was 34 years of age in '61. He lived in
                    Augusta Co., Va. He was not in the Conf. service. Did not aid the Confederacy.
                    He left the Confederate states in '64, and was employed as a cook in the U.S.
                    Army. He was repeatedly arrested by the Confederates. His wife was threatened
                    for feeding deserters. He was for the Union in '61. Adhered to it throughout.</p>
                <p>His witnesses corroborate his statements. Furthermore testify that he always
                    talked as a Union man. Reputation that of a Union man.</p>
                <p>Upon oral argument of this case I think it can be demonstrated conclusively that
                    the Court is in error, and loyalty will certainly be found.</p>
                <p>Respectfully Submitted, Gilbert Moyers Atty.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Claimant's Motion for a New Trial on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES. December Term, 1897.</p>
                <p>DAVID SENSIBAUGH vs. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8610, Cong.</p>
                <p>Defendant's Brief on Claimant's Motion for a New Trial on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>This case was submitted on loyalty Dec. 17, 1896, and the court found caaimant<u>not loyal</u>.</p>
                <p>On Aug. 28, 1897, claimant's attorney filed motion for a new trial on loyalty,
                    alleging that the court erred in not finding claimant loyal.</p>
                <p>No new evidence has been submitted, claimant's attorney evidently relying on the
                    evidence on which claimant has once been found disloyal.</p>
                <p>The testimony shows that claimant lived in Augusta County, Virginia, during the
                    war (p. 1, claimant's brf.), and that his voting place in 1861 was Newport,
                    Augusta County, Virginia (p. 6, clmt's brf.).</p>
                <p>The evidence in the case does not warrant any other conclusion than that arrived
                    at by the court when it found claimant not loyal.</p>
                <p>The poll lists of Augusta County, Virginia, show that a person of claimant's name
                    noted at Newport for the ordinance of secession; and the C. S. Archives show
                    that a person of claimant's name enlisted in the Confederate army from that
                    locality.</p>
                <p>Claimant has attempted to meet these evidences of disloyalty by the testimony of
                    two witnesses, T. R. Gregory and John R. Buchanan, to the effect that there was
                    another person of his name whose voting place was Newport, and who was a
                    secessionist; and that claimant was conscripted into the Confederate service and
                    deserted; but their testimony is very unconvincing:</p>
                <p>They testify that there was another David Sensibaugh living near Newport, and
                    that they "<u>think</u>" and "<u>suppose</u>" he was a secessionist. They are "are not positive"
                    that he voted at Newport, or that any other David Sensibaugh than claimant voted
                    at Newport in 1861, but <u>suppose</u> he did.</p>
                <p>Their entire testimony conveys the impression that they were treading on
                    "uncertain ground" and were not prepared to enter into particulars.</p>
                <p>Claimant testifies (p. 2 clmt's brf.) that he had a brother in the Confederate
                    army. Says (p. 3 clmt's brf) that he did not vote against secession.</p>
                <p>T. A. GRegory, for claimant, says (p. 4, clmt's brf) that claimant "expressed
                    himself as opposed to the war." Says (p. 6, clmt's brf) that he doesn't know of
                    claimant ever saying he wanted the South beaten during the war.</p>
                <p>Claimant was present at the examination of the witnesses, Gregory and Buchanan,
                    and was requested by the attorney for the Government to testify, but positively
                    refused to do so, (See dep, of John R. Buchanan, p. l ).</p>
                <p>The record is quite brief, and does not warrant a finding of loyalty.</p>
                <p>The court did not err in finding claimant <u>not loyal</u>;
                    and in the absence of additional evidence of claimant's loyalty, the motion for
                    a new trial should be dismissed.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Chas. F. Kincheloe, Assistant
                    Attorney.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Claimant's Reply to Defendant's Brief</b>
                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS, DECEMBER TERM 1898-99.</p>
                <p>DAVID SENSIBAUGH vs. THE UNITED STATES No. 8610 Cong.</p>
                <p>Reply to Defendant's brief on Claimant's motion for a new trial for loyalty.</p>
                <p>It is true that when the Government's brief on this motion was filed, there was
                    no new evidence. No evidence had been filed, and noon
                    suggestion of new evidence was made by me in support of the motion. Since then,
                    two affidavits have been filed, showing that very strong additional proof of
                    claimant's loyalty may be made, if opportunity be given. One of the persons from
                    whom these affidavits have been taken is a brother of the Claimant. He deposes
                    squarelly and strongly to the effect, that claimant was a consistent union man
                    throughout the war. The other person deposes that he lived with claimant during
                    the war and had frequent conversations with him, and that claimant always
                    expressed himself in favor of the Union and opposed to secession. Both say, as
                    claimant and former witnesses say, that claimant left his home during the war
                    and went with him to the Federal Lines.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that the claimant testified not merely that he went inside
                    the Federal Lines, but that he was there employed and served as a cook in the
                    Federal Army. All the original witnesses say that he systematicallly helped to
                    keep men out of the Confederate Service. It even appears that Union men were
                    arrested by Confederate Officers at his house. The witness John R. Buchanan,
                    gives the names of four Union men whom claimant concealed, and intimates that
                    there were others whom he could not at the moment recall. From these two
                    affidavits, together with the former proof, it would seem that on another
                    hearing, affirmative loyalty of the claimant will be shown to the entire
                    satisfaction of the Court. The facts tending to impeach his loyalty, put in
                    evidence by the Government, are all sufficiently explained, and this new
                    positive proof of loyalty will abundantly entitle claimant to a finding.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Supplemental Brief on Claimant's Motion</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>David Sensibaugh v. The United States No. 8610, Congressional.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANTS' SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON CLAIMANT'S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>We merely wish to call the attention of the court to the fact that claimant's
                    motion for a new trial on loyalty is based solely, as appears from said motion,
                    upon alleged error of fact, and to object to the consideration of the affidavits
                    which have been filed by claimant in support of the motion.</p>
                <p>The motion does not allege, as a ground for asking a new trial on loyalty, the
                    discovery of new evidence of loyalty not within the knowledge of the claimant at
                    the time of the former trial, hence these affidavits can not be admitted as
                    evidence on the motion at bar and should be utterly disregarded by the court in
                    its consideration of said motion.</p>
                <p>It is true that in defendants' former brief on the motion the following statement
                    occurs: "No new evidence has been submitted, claimant's attorney evidently
                    relying on the evidence on which claimant has once been found disloyal."
                    However, the use of this language was due to an oversight on the part of counsel
                    for defendants as to the ground on which the motion for a new trial was based
                    and consitutes no reason why counsel for claimant should have introduced said
                    affidavits as evidence on a motion based wholly upon alleged error of fact.</p>
                <p>It is respectfully submitted that the said affidavits must be disregarded by the
                    court and the motion decided upon the record as it stood at the trial of the
                    case on the question of loyalty.</p>

                <p>DAVID SENSIBAUGH VS. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8610 Congressional.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANTS' SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON CLAIMANT'S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON
                    LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The contention of defendants' counsel in his supplemental brief on claimant's
                    motion for a new trial on loyalty that the affidavits taken in support of said
                    motion should not be used, because they are not referred to in claimant's motion
                    for a new trial, is far fetched and not based upon any legal grounds. Affidavits
                    can be used in support of a motion for a new trial even though not filed until
                    the day that the motion is heard and submitted for the consideration of the
                    Court. They can be filed at any time while the motion is pending before it is
                    decided, providing there is an affidavit showing that the evidence set forth in
                    this is newly discovered. This principle is so well settled that I am surprised
                    that a lawyer of the experience of the counsel for the defense in this case
                    should raise any objection to the use of these affidavits for the purpose for
                    which they are filed.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>
