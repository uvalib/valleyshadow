<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of James F. Davis,
                            September 6, 1871, Claim No. 2135</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Davis' claim for one mule was rejected for the vagueness of testimony on both
                    loyalty and taking of property. He unsuccessfully appealed this decision to the
                    Congressional Court of Claims in 1892.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>This claim is rejected.</p>
                <p>I. Mr. Davis says, "He was forced into the rebel service but only remained a
                    short time." How long? He does not say. He says "he was arrested, carried to
                    Richmond, kept in Castle Thunder, released and put into the service."</p>
                <p>For this we have nothing but his own statement, nothing to sustain him. The two
                    witnesses say nothing about it &amp; testify in a loose general way of no
                    value.</p>
                <p>II. The evidence of the taking is not satisfactory either as to the authority or
                    necessity of the taking, or as to the use by the Army.</p>
