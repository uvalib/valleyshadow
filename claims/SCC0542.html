<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimant was a merchant and took Oath of Allegiance to the Confederacy. Had a
                    nephew in the Confederate Army till he got him across the lines. His Sympathies
                    were for the Union - Such is the Substance of his Statement. The only Witness he
                    calls to his loyalty is his son who was Nine Years old when the War commenced,
                    and who swears to his loyal talk etc.</p>
                <p>When a Man takes the Oath of Allegiance to the Confederate States, it is
                    presumptive evidence that he intends to keep it and the act is an act of
                    unquestionable disloyalty to the United States, and inconsistent with the
                    Character of a loyal adherent to the Cause of the Union and the Government of
                    the United States, when such oath is taken voluntarily.</p>
                <p>There is nothing to show in this case that Claimant did not take the oath and did
                    not bear true faith and Allegiance to the Confederacy, except the casual aid he
                    may have given to his nephew to escape into the Union lines. But this aid may
                    have been inspired by other motives that those of hostility to the Confederacy -</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the evidence of loyalty and therefore reject the Claim.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John W. Shumake to prove the taking of the Horse mentioned in
                    petition.</p>
                <p>Ques 1. Answer. Witness Says - I am 19 years old I reside in Augusta Co. Va. I am
                    a clerk - I was present and saw the horse charged in the petition was taken -</p>
                <p>4 Witness Says. The horse was taken in the fall of 1864, from the claimants
                    premises, by a officer and soldier, belonging to Genl. Sheridan's command. I did now know the name of the officer, or
                    rank.</p>
                <p>12 Witness Says. There was no receipt given or asked for that I know of. The
                    horse was taken in the day time, about 2 o'clock P.M.</p>
                <p>12 Witness Says. The horse was in good condition, he was I think about 9 years
                    old, I think the horse was low at $75.00</p>
                <p>19 Witness Says. the horse was taken for use of the Army. The Army had no Camp
                    near there at that time. It was on a raid.</p>
                <p>22 Witness Says. I think there was a great necessity for horses in the Army and
                    they were justified in taking the horse, and suppose they had orders to take
                    property. I believe the Government ought to pay for the horse.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John W. Shumake to prove loyalty of the Claimant</p>
                <p>Question 1st Witness Says - I have known the claimant all my life, and was with
                    him during the War, I heard him talk about the War, and he was all the time
                    opposed to the rebellion and in favor of the Union. He was regarded by all who
                    knew him to be a Union man, I have heard rebels abuse him because of his
                    opposition to the rebellion. I never knew him to do anything for the United
                    States, except to assist persons in getting to the Union lines - He done nothing
                    in aid of the Confederate States. He could not have established any claim of
                    loyalty to the Confederacy had it succeeded.</p>
