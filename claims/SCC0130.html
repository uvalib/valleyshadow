<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of William V. Strough,
                            July 20, 1874, Claim No. 17,938</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                The Commissioners disallowed Strough's claim for one horse, despite evidence of
                    his loyalty to the Union, because the Union Army had not taken his horse for
                    military purposes, but rather as part of the destruction of the Valley in
                    October, 1864.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The mare for which this claim is made was taken by the army under Gen. Sheridan
                    in Oct. 1864 in what was called the "burning raid"--taken not for army use, but
                    in pursuance of an order to lay waste the Valley of Virginia. Horses mules
                    cattle &amp;c taken by Gen. Sheridan at this time were driven out of the
                    state &amp; sold and the proceeds paid into the Treasury.</p>
                <p>The claim is disallowed.</p>

                <p>45 Ans. I did not belong to any Committee, or home guard, or anything to suppress
                    the Union.</p>
                <p>46 Ans. I was called out as a Conscript detail &amp; first as a Malitia in July 1861. and as a detail in 1864. I was in

                    duty as a detail about six days during which time the Piedmont battle took
                    place. I was conscripted by a law of the Confederate Congress, and notified by,

                    at Staunton. I put in the substitute because I did not wish to fight against the

                <p>79 Ans. The Mare was black, about 3 1/2 years old. When I left her at Jacob
                    Wine's she was in good condition, of medium size, well formed and fine style and
                    well broken to the saddle - I think she was well worth the price I have charged,
                    one hundred and twenty five dollars.</p>
                <p>I have never filed an application for the benefit of the Bankrupt law.</p>

                <p>Taking of the Property</p>
                <p>Deposition of Jacob Wine</p>
                <p>My name is Jacob Wine, my age 72 years. I am a farmer by occupation. My residence
                    near Mossey Creek, Augusta Co. Va.</p>
                <p>I am not related to the Claimant and have no interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>Ques. 72 Ans. I did not see the Mare charged by Claimant taken out of the stable,
                    but saw her in possession of Soldiers a short distance from the Stable.</p>
                <p>73 Ans. The mare was taken about 10 o'clock A.M.</p>
                <p>74 Ans. There was no complaint made by any one to any one.</p>
                <p>75 Ans. No vouchers or receipts asked for or given.</p>
                <p>76 Ans. No payment made that I know of.</p>
                <p>77 Ans. There was no encampment, but what might be called a raiding party, under
                    command of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan. There had been a skirmish
                    at Bridgewater, some few miles distant. There were fifteen or twenty soldiers
                    together when the Mare was taken. I did not hear the name of any officer.</p>
                <p>78 Ans. The color of the Mare was black, and young. She was in good order and
                    well built, and fine looking, and of fine life. I think she was cheap at one
                    hundred and twenty five dollars. I do not know anything about her working
                    qualities, but first rate for the Cavalry service, and the army was as far as I
                    saw it was of that service. The Mare had been left with me to keep by the
                    Claimant, and had been in my possession about two weeks or probably longer. Mr.
                    Strough left the Mare with me for fear the Confederates would take it, as he was
                    then on his way through the lines, which was in 1864, and the Mare was taken
                    about the first of October 1864. I live about 16 miles from the Claimant.</p>

                <p>Question in General as to the loyalty of the claimant W.V. Strough</p>
                <p>Ans. My name is Hugh G. M<sup>c</sup>Causland. My age is 47
                    years, I reside near New Hope in Augusta County. My occupation is a farmer. I am
                    not related to the claimant. I have known the claimant about 26 years. I resided
                    about 1/2 mile from him during the War, and saw him every few days up to the
                    time he went North. We conversed frequently and freely about the War, and I
                        was always found him opposed to it. He said that the war was
                    unjust, that the South had no right to secede, and that before he would
                    participate in the rebellion he would leave his family and go through the lines,
                    which he did (I think) in 1863. He was not at all reserved in his opposition to
                    the War when with his loyal neighbors. His Union neighbors had confidence in his
                    loyalty. He knew my sympathies were with him - if the South had gained its
                    independence he could not have proven any loyalty to it. </p>

                <p>Answer to general question -</p>
                <p>My name is Henry K. Eakle, my age is 55 years, I reside near New Hope in Augusta
                    County. I am a farmer. I have known the Claimant for 15 or 20 years. I resided 3
                    miles from him during the War, I saw him frequently and conversed with him about
                    the War, and always found him very bitter against Secession. He went through the
                    lines - I do not recollect what year. He was always bold and fearless in
                    expressing him self, even at times to those who favored the rebellion. His Union
                    neighbors always had the utmost confidence in his loyalty to the Union. He could
                    not have proven any loyalty to the Confederacy had it succeeded. My own
                    sympathies were with him, which he knew.</p>
