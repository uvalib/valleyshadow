                <p><u>Joseph Flory</u> a witness introduced to prove the taking
                    of a part of the property named in petition, being first duly sworn answers.</p>
                <p>1st Witness says. I was present, and saw the bacon, and one horse taken.</p>
                <p>4th} Witness says the property was taken on the 6th day of June 1864, and taken
                    from the Claimants farm, by a regiment of Cavalry, belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army.</p>
                <p>6th} Witness says I suppose there were officers present, but I knew no one</p>
                <p>7th. Witness says The horse was taken from me, and rode off by a soldier, whose
                    horse was wounded. He said he wanted the horse and took him from me.</p>
                <p>9th. Witness says the Army was marching in the direction of Staunton Va. I did
                    follow next day, but the guard refused to let me pass into the Camp, then at
                    Staunton.</p>
                <p>10th. Witness says the horse as they said was for the Cavalry service, and I
                    presume they eat the Bacon, I never saw the property after it was taken. I
                    complained to an Officer about the taking of two horses which had been taken
                    from the stable, and he advised me to follow, and probably I could get them
                    back. I did so, but only proceeded a short distance, when the Cavalry regiment
                    took the one I was there riding.</p>
                <p>12th} Witness says ther was no voucher or receipt asked for. The property was
                    taken in the day time about noon, or after. It was not taken secretly.</p>
                <p>14th Witness says the whole army were marching, the battle of Piedmont was fought
                    the day before. I did not know any officer at all.</p>
                <p>15th} Witness says The property was in good condition. The horse was about 6
                    years old. I think he was fully worth what is charged $125.00</p>
                <p>19th} Witness says I suppose the property described in each item was taken for
                    the actual use of the Army and not to gratify of soldiers or officers.</p>
                <p>20th Witness says I do not know what the condition of the Army was, but know that
                    had lost horses in the battle at Piedmont and suppose horses were needed to
                    supply the Army, and which loses justified them in taking others.</p>
                <p>22d. Witness says I believe that the property was so needful as to warrant the
                    Government in paying for it. I suppose these must have been a necessity, and
                    were I presume general orders for taking property.</p>

                <p>1st Witness says I am 22 years old, I reside in Augusta Co. Va. I am a farmer. I
                    saw one stallion taken, named in the petition, and know they took <u>the mare</u> and believe they took the <u>Saddle</u> and also the <u>Bacon</u>.</p>
                <p>4th} Witness says. It was taken the day after the Piedmont battle, the property
                    was taken off the premises of the Claimant by officers &amp; soldiers
                    belonging to Genl Hunter's Army - I do not know if there were any officer
                    present or not.</p>
                <p>7th} Witness says the stallion was rode away by a Soldier, and all the property
                    was removed by soldiers, I guess the property was taken for the use of the Army.</p>
                <p>11th} Witness says there was no complaint made on account of such taking.</p>
                <p>12th} Witness says There was no receipt taken or asked for, the property was
                    taken in the day time about noon, none taken secretly.</p>
                <p>14th} Witness says the Army was marching in the direction of Staunton. They were
                    encamped at Piedmont. The night before, a battle had been fought at Piedmont the
                    day before.</p>
                <p>15th} Witness says the <u>saddle</u> was nearly new, <u>the horses</u> were in good condition, the <u>Mare</u> was 4 years old, <u>Stallion</u> 3 years old, and the <u>horse</u> about 6
                    years old. I think the horses were worth what the claimant had charged in his
                    petition.</p>
                <p>22d. Witness says they took the property for the use of the Army, and I think
                    they ought to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23d. Witness says I suppose they were jsutified in taking or ordering it to be

                    as much as any body I knew, and they were so regarded by their neighbors. I
                    never heard anything else they never had any opportunity to aid the U.S. until
                        Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army came, and then
                    they got their stock. I knew them to do nothing for the rebel Government except
                    what they were compelled. I think they were too loyal to the United States to
                    have been considered loyal to the Confederacy, had it been maintained as a seperate Government.</p>
