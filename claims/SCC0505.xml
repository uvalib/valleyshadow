                <p>Samuel Glick filed this claim in 1872 for $320, claiming the Union army took
                    three horses in 1864 during Sheridan's burning of the Shenandoah Valley. Samuel
                    was a 48 year old farmer who served for a few weeks in 1862 in the Virginia
                    State Militia. The claim was disallowed.</p>

                <p>Claimant says they had me in the State Militia at Staunton the Second year of the
                    war about five weeks. I had to pay 100$ to assist in raising troops in order to
                    get the Militia disbanded. It was probably prior to that in 1862 that he was
                    arrested and confined in the Guard House at Richmond four or five days until he
                    paid five hundred dollars and was released.</p>
                <p>Two witnesses swear to Claimants loyalty; but we regard his service as
                    inconsistent with loyal adherence to the Cause of the Union and the Government
                    of the United States during the war; and that the payment of one Hundred dollars
                    to raise troops was evidently giving aid and encouragement to the insurgency.</p>
                <p>We reject the claim.</p>

                <p>To question No. 2 he syas I resided in Augusta County on my own land. My farm
                    contained 108 acres, about 46 or 48 acres of which was woodland, the balance was
                    all under cultivation. I did not change my residence or occupation during the
                    war.</p>
                <p>To question 3 to 10 inclusive he answers <hi rend="underline">no</hi> to each and
                    every question severally put.</p>
                <p>To question 11 he says, They had me in the State <orig reg="militia"

                    about 5 weeks off and on. They had us arraigned up there until they got their
                    quota of men. I had to pay $100 to assist in raising troops so as to get the
                    militia disbanded; I left in 1862. I was not in service they mustered us once a
                    day sometimes, I was in Capt. C. Shaver's Company.</p>
                <p>To question 24 he says Yes sir I was arrested about a mile on the other side of
                    Petersburg in <unclear>Harley</unclear> County now located in West Virginia, in
                    March 1862, I was taken to Richmond and imprisoned in the guard house about 5
                    weeks. I paid $500 in Confederate and Virgina money as a fine, which had to be,
                    and was, paid to pass before I was released. I took no oath of any kind to get
                    released. I was never arrested by the <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr></p>
                <p>To question 25 he says <del hand="h1">Yes 3 horses and a Colt</del> No except a horse

                <p>To question 30 he says yes I had a brother and a brother's sons in the

                    Glick is yet living in Rockingham Co. near Sparta. The other is dead, I did not
                    furnish either of them with any thing while in the service.</p>
                <p>To Question 31 he says I owned some tax paying bonds. I invested <add hand="h1" place="inline">in
                    them</add> some $300 or $400 in Confederate <del hand="h1">bonds</del><add hand="h1" place="inline">Money</add>, I
                    was assured that these bonds would pay my taxes and bought them for that
                    purpose, but they were refused and I think I got them yet.</p>
                <p>To Question 32 to 39 he answers <hi rend="underline">No</hi> to each and every
                    question severally put.</p>
                <p>To question 40 he says, with the Cause, I felt that <del hand="h1">that</del> the rebellion
                    was wrong that it was wrong to secede. I exerted my influence for the Union, I
                    did not vote all, went to the polls for the purpose of voting against the
                    ratification of the ordinance of secession. No one else had voted before I got
                    there against <add hand="h1" place="inline">it</add> and I was persuaded to vote for it but I refused and
                    because I was not allowed to vote without hindrance my own sentiments I did not
                    vote at all. After the Ordinance of secession was accepted in Virginia I still
                    adhered to the Union Cause and did not "go with the State"</p>
                <p>To Question 41 He says I do make that solemn declaration.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the <abbr expan="Commissioner">Comr.</abbr> as
                    to the property charged. I was at home and saw all the property charged taken.
                        <add hand="h1" place="inline">Items 1 &amp; 2</add> The stallion and Dun Mare were taken two days
                    before the burning of the barns in the neighborhood, in the year 1864, by
                    Sheridan's Army from my Stable, two soldiers came for the Mare explaining by
                    there were around three going through the field. I wanted the soldiers to leave
                    them but they would have them. They said they had use for them. They said they
                    wanted to ride them, they were Cavalry soldiers. They did not give me any
                    receipt. I did ask for any, I do not know their names. I don't know what company
                    or <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> they belonged to. They were riding
                    tolerantly good horses. They did not leave any horses in their places. The
                    stallion was a roan betwen 4 &amp; 5 years old. I think he was about 16
                    hands high, sound and in good condition. He was worth about $150. The Dun Mare
                    was about 10 <abbr expan="years">yrs.</abbr> old. She was sound, and was worth
                    $100 but I put her at $80 I think.</p>
                <p>3d Item. The Bay mare was taken the day of the burning by the same army and of my
                    yard. The women were hanging to her but they <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> loose. She had a sucking
                    Colt at the time which they also took. There was but was but one soldier took
                    the Mare and Colt but there were many others near by. I did not hear him say any
                    thing, they had just set my Barn on fire and I had been down there trying to
                    save some things and he was going off with her as I came up. The mare and Colt
                    was worth $125. I did not charge for the Colt because the I was advised the
                        <abbr expan="Government">Govt.</abbr> had no use for Colts. The mare was
                    about 12 years old. She was sound, I did not get any receipt. I asked for none.

                <p>I am 38 years old, a resident of Augusta County, a farmer by occupation. I am a
                    1st cousin to the claimant Mr. Glick, I have no interest in his claim. I lived
                    about a mile from him during the war, I saw him frequently sometimes once,
                    sometimes as high as twice a week. I talked with him a good deal about the war,
                    I knew his political sympathies and opinions, through the conversations we had.
                    I was a Union man and he so regarded me. He always was opposed to the rebellion
                    thought it was wrong about the most I can recollect now of what he said to me
                    during the war is that if the south gained independence we couldnt stay here and
                    wouldnt want to stay. I can't say positively that I heard him express Union
                    sentiments in the presence of others. I knew his general reputation for loyalty
                    through the neighborhood, he was regarded by both parties as a Union man. He was
                    regarded by his loyal neighbors as a loyal man. I don't think I remember

                <p>I saw two horses taken from the Claimant about the time of the Burning in the
                    neighborhood. They were taken by some soldiers under Sheridan's Command. I saw
                    two of the soldiers leading the horses of the Claimant through my place. I was
                    not present when they were taken. There were a great many other soldiers around
                    at the time. The army was moving at the time. I did not speak to the soldiers
                    about the matter. I was not very close to them but close enough to know the
                    horses. One was a young roan Stallion, The other was a Dun Mare. I had known the
                    young Stallion from a Colt, I had known the Dun Mare about a year. The Stallion
                    was rising 5 years old. The Dun mare's age I don't know. They were in good
                    order, of good size, not large nor small. The Stallion was worth at that time
                    $150, he was a fine traveller, he was broke. The mare was worth at that time
                    about $75. I did not notice whether the soldiers who had them were riding good
                    horses or not. <del hand="h1">I did</del> They camped that night about 2 miles east of my
                    house. I don't know anything about the taking of the <del hand="h1">after</del> active
                    mare. Thats all I know about the stock. Further saith not.</p>

                    sympathies and opinions from what he said to me about the war. He said we would
                    have to leave if the <del hand="h1">South if the</del> Confederacy succeded. I was a Union
                    man during the war. I reckon he so regarded me I don't know that I ever heard
                    him express Union sentiments in the presence of others. I knew his general
                    reputation as to loyalty, he was generally regarded a loyal man. His loyal
                    neighbors regarded him very well as a loyal man. I never knew him to contribute

                    stable the other and the Colt were taken from the yard near the house. Two
                    soldiers took the first 2 and one took the other 2, I did not see any officers
                    about when the horses and Colt were taken. One of the horses was a roan, one was
                    a Dun the other was a Bay, The Colt was a kind of a roan, It was a sucking Colt.
                    Two of them were <unclear>mares</unclear>. They mare that had the Colt was about
                    15 years old. The others were young, I don't know their ages I think the roan
                    horse was worth $150, no one told me that that was his value, I fixed that sum

                    army was passing the road about 50 yards from the house at the time. No receipt
                    was left for them, I tol him to leave her, she was so old, she would do them no
