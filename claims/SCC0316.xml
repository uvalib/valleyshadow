                <p>Reuben A. Garber filed this claim September 5, 1872, for $300, claiming that
                    Union troops confiscated two horses from his farm southeast of Mount Sidney,
                    Augusta Co., Va., on September 29, 1864. The horses were taken during the
                    Burning of the Valley of Virginia. The claim was disallowed December 9,
                1872.</p>

                    adoption of the Ordinance, but if he did he voted against it. The Record of the
                    Election shows that he did vote and that he voted for the Ordinance of
                    Secession. He was pressed with his team, and worked several days for the Rebel
                    Army and received pay therefor. His father he says employed a substitute for him

                <p>In answer to the First General Interrogatory the Deponent says: My name is Reuben
                    A. Garber, my age 36 years, my residence M<hi rend="super">t</hi>. Sidney
                    Augusta Co., in the State of Virginia, and my occupation a; I am the claimant.</p>
                <p>To question 2 He says near Mt. Sidney in Augusta County Virg<hi
                        rend="super">a</hi> on my own land. My farm contained 87 acres about 8
                    or 10 acres of which was woodland. I did not change my business or
                        <del hand="h1">occupation</del> residence during the war.</p>
                <p>To Questions 3 &amp; 4 he says No.</p>
                <p>To Question 5 he says, I took an oath to the United States but I don't know
                    whether it was the oath of allegiance or the amnesty oath, I took it because
                    others done so and because I wanted to show that I was a Union man.</p>
                <p>To Question 6 to 13 inclusive he says No to each and every question separately
                    put.</p>
                <p>To Question 14, he says Yes, but it was done wholly against my will, I did not
                    furnish the substitute myself. My father did it for me to keep me out of the
                    rebel service. I had been drafted, my father paid him, I think about $1200 in
                    Confederate money. I did not intend to go into the army. I was going across the
                    lines, my father done it to keep me home.</p>
                <p>To Question 15 he says No.</p>
                <p>To Question 16 he says No.</p>
                <p>To Question 17 he says I was pressed with my two horse team to haul medical
                    stores from Staunton to Monterey in 1861, by Quartertmaster M.G. Harmon, I
                    think, I was employed about 8 to 10 days, I got paid for it.</p>
                <p>To Questions 18 to 28 inclusive he answers No fully to each question separately
                    put.</p>
                <p>To Question 29 he says <del hand="h1">he says</del> I aided the Union refugees to escape
                    from the rebels by furnishing them lodging and provisions.</p>
                <p>To Questions 30 to 39 inclusive he says no to each and every quesion separately
                    put.</p>
                <p>To Question 40 he says, I sympathized with the Union cause at the time. My
                    feelings were always for the Union and my language too, I exerted my influence
                    and cast my vote in favor of the Union, I don't remember whether I voted at all
                    on the ratification of the ordinance of secession, if I did vote it was against
                    the Ordinance. After the Ordinance was ratified I did not "go with the Vote" but
                    went with the Union.</p>
                <p>To Question 41 He says I do make that declaration.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the commissioner as to the property charged.</p>
                <p>There was two horses taken from my field near my barn by the Union Army, on the
                    29 day of Sept<hi rend="super">r</hi> 1864 by four men that belonged to
                        Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Sheridan's Army. I think, I don't know
                    whether one of them was an officer or not, I heard one of the men call another
                    Captain. They were both taken on the same day, I remonstrated with them, and
                    tried to get them to leave me at least <del hand="h1">our</del> the one which was the
                    favorite with my wife my they told me that they were ordered to take all the
                    horses <del hand="h1">in the valley</del> that they could find fit for service. One of my
                    horses was a Dun with black <orig reg="mane">main</orig> and tail, with a black
                    streak over his back a very heavy large horse about 7 1/2 years old perfectly
                    sound, worth about $150. - The other was a bay mare about 3 1/2 years old,
                    medium size perfectly sound and was worth about $150. - I never saw the horse
                    afterwards. They did not give me any receipt I did not ask for any. I didn't
                    think of it. No army was moving at that time. The one that was called Captain
                    talked with me a little while and he asked me <del hand="h1">which</del> why I was not in
                    the army. I told him that it was against my religious professions to fight
                        <del hand="h1">when he</del> being a Dunker. When he left me he shook hands and said
                    he wished all Virginians had been Dunkers.</p>

                <p>John W. Peters, witness to prove loyalty of claimant, being affirmed and examined
                    by the Commissioner says:</p>
                <p>I am 28 years old and reside near Mt. Sidney Augusta County, Virginia. I am a
                    farmer. I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in his claim. I
                    lived about three hundred yards from him during the war and saw him almost every
                    day. I talked with him in regard to the cause and progress of the war. He always
                    expressed himself as a Union man. I was a Union man and the claimant so regarded
                    me. I knew what his reputation was for loyalty. It was that of a loyal man. He
                    was so regarded a loyal man by his loyal neighbors. I never knew him to own
                    Confederate Bonds, or do anything to sustain the financial credit of the
                    Confederacy. I never knew him to be molested or injured on account of his Union
                    sentiments. I never knew him to render any assistance to the Confederate or
                    Union armies. He aided Union refugees to escape. His conversations with me and
                    his general cause during the war would have prevented him from proving his
                    loyalty to the Confederate government if it had succeeded in maintaining a
                    separate existence.</p>

                <p>Daniel Miller, witness to prove loyalty of claimant being affirmed and examined
                    by the Commissioner, says:</p>
                <p>I am 53 years old and reside near Mt. Sidney, Augusta County Va. I am a farmer. I
                    am a brother-in-law to the claimant. I have no interest in his claim. I lived
                    about three fourths of a mile from him during the war, and saw him pretty often.
                    I talked with him often in regard to the cause and progress of the war. He
                    always said if only the Union army could come through and stop the rebellion. He
                    spoke in favor of the Union cause. I do not remember whether I heard him express
                    himself in the presence of others. I was a Union man and the claimant so
                    regarded me. I never knew him to own any Confederate Bonds or do anything to
                    sustain the financial credit of the Confederate Cause. I do not know anything he
                    did in aid of the Confederate army or cause. I never knew him to be injured or
                    molested on account of his Union sentiments. His language used in my presence
                    would have rendered him unable to prove his loyalty to the Confederate
                    government if it had succeeded in maintaining a separate existence.</p>

                <p>Jacob Garber Sr. witness to prove property taken being affirmed &amp;
                    examined by the Commissioner, says: I am 71 years old and reside near Mt.
                    Sidney, Augusta Co. Va. I am a farmer. I am the father <del hand="h1">of the father</del>
                    of the Claimant. I have no interest in this claim. In the month of September
                    1864 the Union army came past my house, and I saw it have in its possession two
                    horses which I recognized as my son's horses. One was a dun horse, about 7 years
                    old. The other was a young mare about three years old. They were two noble
                    horses. I could not say as to their value <del hand="h1">I could not say</del>. I knew his
                    horses well, and am sure that I was not mistaken as to their identity. No
                    conversation took place in regard to the horses. The soldiers who had the horses
                    were cavalry soldiers and they were leading the horses. This was at the time of
                    Sheridan's Burning Raid. I do not know whether or not any officer was among the
                    men who had horses. Further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>Mary Garber, witness to prove property taken being affirmed and examined by the
                    Commissioner says:</p>
                <p>I am 36 years old &amp; reside near Mt. Sidney, Augusta Co.Va. I am the wife
                    of the claimant &amp; have no money interest in his claim. I was present and
                    saw the Union army under Gen. Sheridan take two of my husband's horses in the
                    month of September 1864. The horses were in the field when taken. One was a dun
                    seven years old &amp; one a bay, three years old. They were taken in
                    daylight by the soldiers. One claimed to be a Captain. I begged them to leave
                    the horses. They said they were compelled to have them. They led the horses
                    away. I think the horses were worth $150 each.</p>
