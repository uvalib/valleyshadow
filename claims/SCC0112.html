<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Franklin H. Myers,
                            August 15, 1871, Claim No. 12126</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Myers' claim for horses and oats was disallowed because he served in the local
                    militia. He unsuccessfully appealed this decision to the Congressional Court of
                    Claims in 1892.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The claimant is forty seven years old, he seems to have been subject to military
                    duty, he says he was called out on one occasion with the militia and served a
                    month or two and was then discharged. He says he did not vote on the question of
                    secession and swears to loyal sympathies, but to nothing more. Two or three
                    witnesses swear that he was too loyal to the Union to have proved loyalty to the
                    Confederacy. One of the witnesses testifies that he saw him on one occasion
                    during the war in charge of Confederate horses. It is probable as he fails to
                    explain how he kept out of the military service that he was thus employed.</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the supplied evidence in the support of his
                    loyalty and we therefore reject the claim.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Sallie J. Clark</p>
                <p>Answer My name is Sallie J. Clark, my age is 33 years. My residence is near New
                    Hope in Augusta County. I am a married lady and attend to the domestic affairs
                    of my family. I am not related to the claimant nor have any interest in his
                    claim.</p>
                <p>Ques. 72 Ans. I was not just at the stable, where the horses were taken, but was
                    in my fathers yard, about two hundred yards from the claimants, and in full
                    view, and saw them taken from the stable, one of which was rode and
                    the other led away.</p>
                <p>73 Ans. They were taken, I think in the afternoon, probably 2 or 3 o'clock, and
                    openly as though they had a right to do so.</p>
                <p>74 Ans. I know of no complaint being made.</p>
                <p>75 Ans. I know of no vouchers being given.</p>
                <p>76 Ans. I never heard of claimant receiving any pay.</p>
                <p>77 Ans. The horses were taken by troops then marching from Piedmont to Staunton.
                    The battle of Piedmont took place the day previous, about four miles from
                    claimants.</p>
                <p>79 Ans. The horses were in the claimants stable. His residence and my fathers are
                    on the main road leading from Piedmont to Staunton. There were a very large
                    number of troops, how many I cannot say, nor do I know whether there was an
                    officer at the stable or not, but I saw a number of troops at and around the
                    stable, and saw the horses when brought out of the stable, and taken away, in
                    the direction of Staunton, at which time the army moved on. One of the horses
                    was a sorrel and one a Roan. They were in good order, one about 12 years and the
                    other about 5 years old. The older horse was a good worker in harness, I do not
                    know about the younger, both were good riding horses. They were of medium size.
                    I am not able to say what their value. was. The army was in command
                    of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter, and
                    the battle of Piedmont was fought on the 5<sup>th</sup> day of
                    June 1864, and the horses were taken on the 6<sup>th</sup> the
                    day after. I have never heard of claimants going into Bankruptcy.</p>

                    occupation is an attendant at the Lunatic Assylum. I

                <p>Ques 72 Ans. I was present and saw the horses named in the claim were
                    taken.</p>
                <p>73 Ans. The horses were taken, I think at about 2 or 3 oclock P.M. there was no

                <p>74 Ans. There was no complaint made, that I know of at the time, but soon
                    complaint was made to other troops, and they replied that they were taken under

                    Staunton, on Monday, the day after the Piedmont battle. The battle of Piedmont
                    took place on the 5<sup>th</sup> day of June 1864, and the

                <p>Ques 78 Ans. I saw the sorrel horse and also the Roan, taken out of the stable.</p>
                <p>79 Ans. The Sorrel horse, was about twelve (12) years old, of medium size, in
                    good order, and sound every way. He was a well broken horse to harness and
                    saddle, and of good life. I would suppose that he was worth one hundred (100)
                    dollars. The Roan horse, was five (5) years old, he was not as large as the
                    sorrel, he was in good condition, and sound in every way. He had never been
                    broken to harness, but was well broken to the saddle, and had good gates. He was
                    gay looking and of fine mettle. I would think he was richly worth One hundred
                    (100) dollars.</p>
                <p>The Army was in command of General Hunter. There were a large number of soldiers
                    at and around the Stable. The claimants residence is on the main road leading
                    from Piedmont to Staunton. The Sorrel horse was rode and the Roan led away in
                    the direction of Staunton, where the Army moved in the direction of. I never saw
                    the horses after they were taken.</p>

                <p>Loyalty of Claimant</p>
                <p>Deposition of Thomas J. Gilbert</p>
                <p>My name is Thomas J. Gilbert, my age is 58 years. My residence near Staunton,
                    occupation a farmer. I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in
                    his claim.</p>
                <p>Ques. 53 Ans. I have known the claimant, Franklin H. Myers for 15 or 20 years,
                    and have been intimate friends all that time.</p>
                <p>54 Ans. I lived during the war, or until I left my home, and went through the
                    lines, about one and a half (1 1/2) miles from him.</p>
                <p>55 Ans. I cant say that I did meet him often.</p>
                <p>56 Ans. I did converse with him on one or two occasions about the war,
                    &amp;c. I do not remember the date, it was between our residences, I think,
                    he was then in charge of some horses belonging to the Confederates, he seemed to
                    me, to be dissatisfied said that he tried to keep out of the service, but was
                    forced, I think, he expressed himself, as opposed to the war, and from all I
                    know or heard him say I believe that he was opposed to secession and
                    in favor of the Union.</p>
                <p>57 Ans. Nothing but what I heard him say.</p>
                <p>Ques. 58 Ans. I never knew of his doing anything voluntarily or saying anything
                    against the Union cause.</p>
                <p>59 Ans. I heard nothing.</p>
                <p>60 Ans. His reputation in the neighborhood was that of a Union man. I have heard
                    Robert Whitlock speak of him, Whitlock is dead. James Wampler, Henry Sniteman,
                    and Jacob Myers, were well known Union men of that neighborhood.</p>
                <p>62 Ans. I was all the time and am yet, and the claimant knew it.</p>
                <p>63 Ans. I know of no threats being made.</p>
                <p>64 Ans. I knowing of nothing done or said that could have induced me
                    to testify in his behalf of any loyalty to the Confederacy.</p>
                <p>65 Ans. I know nothing except what I have stated.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>William Crosby</b>
                <p>Deposition of William Crosby</p>
                <p>My name is William Crosby, my age is 53 years, my occupation a farmer, residence
                    near Staunton, I married the claimants sister, but I have no interest
                    in the payment of his claim.</p>
                <p>Ques 53 Ans. I have known the claimant about 26 years, intimately all that time.</p>
                <p>54 Ans. We lived about seven miles apart.</p>
                <p>55 Ans. We met often, and were together a great deal.</p>
                <p>56 Ans. We conversed frequently and freely about the War, its cause &amp;C.
                    Our conversations were at different times and places, and by ourselves as it was
                    unsafe to converse in the presence of others. I know that he was decidedly
                    opposed to the war, and regretted the success of the rebel Army
                        ofin every such success that I heard him speak of, I
                    recollect the first Manassas or Bull run battle particularly.</p>
                <p>57 Ans. I do not know of anything, but I believe that if he had had an opertunity he would have done his share.</p>
                <p>58 Ans. I never knew him to say a word, or <u>do</u> anything
                    voluntarily against the Union cause. He was in the Quarter service in the
                    capacity of attendant, but was forced by the Conscript Act, to do that service
                    which he regretted, but was powerless.</p>
                <p>59 Ans. I never heard of his doing any thing against the Union, except what I
                    have stated, and in that he was compelled. I was in the same service myself, in
                    the same way.</p>
                <p>60 Ans. His reputation amongst the Union men of his neighborhood was good. So far
                    as I know, or heard there was no lack of confidence in his loyalty. Robert
                    Whitlock (now dead) &amp; Charles Batis, and others by reputation. Charles
                    Batis' P.O. is New Hope.</p>
                <p>61 Ans. I think that Charles Batis could, and his Union neighbors generally.</p>
                <p>62 Ans. I was an adherent of the Union cause and am yet. The claimant knew me by
                    my conversation. In 1862, I met three of my brothers at who belonged
                    to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Milroy's Army,
                    for protection at my house, who were sent out, to learn Stonewall Jackson's
                    whereabouts, and I informed them and they returned in time to save Milroy.</p>
                <p>63 Ans. I do not know of any threats.</p>
                <p>64 Ans. I could not have testified to his having any loyalty or sympathy for the
                    Confederacy.</p>

                    claims to be for loyalty to the Union and its cause. His service in the
                    Confederacy, was no doubt a compulsion, which occured to thousands during the
