                    as my means and power and the circumstances of the case permitted.</p>
                <p>I was not present when the horse was taken and will rely on the testimony of
                    others to prove that, the horse was taken in the fall of 1864, before my return
                    from the State of Ohio.</p>
                <p>I never received any pay for my horse.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John Landes</p>
                <p>Ques 1 My name is John Landes, my age 70 years. My residence is near Mnt. Sidney
                    in Augusta Co. Va. I am the father of the claimant, but have no interest in the
                    claim. I was in about 50 yards of the stable, and saw the horse taken.</p>
                <p>Ques 3 Ans. There was two soldiers, who come through the field, and passed the
                    stable, but hearing the horse neigh they went back to the stable and took him. I
                    do not know whether they had a bridle or halter.</p>
                <p>Ques 4 Ans. The horse was taken from my stable, at my own residence, he was taken
                    on the 26th of September 1864. Taken by two soldiers. There was a number come up
                    the road at the same time the two soldiers come through the field. I suppose in
                    all there were about a dozen of men, but only the two were at the stable. They
                    only remained a few minutes.</p>
                <p>Ques 5 Ans. My family was the only ones present, I did not know any of the
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ques 6 Ans. I do not know whether there were any officers present or not. The two
                    soldiers come through the field passed the stable, and they went back to the
                    stable and opened the door and took the horse out. I heard nothing said. I was
                    at my house about 50 yards from the stable - They had arrested my oldest son,
                    Erastus Landes, and put him on the horse, and rode off.</p>
                <p>Ques 9 Ans. They went in the direction of Staunton. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>Ques 10 Ans. I did not know what use they made of the horse, as I never saw him
                    afterwards - I made no complaint at all, I didn't speak to any of them - Their
                    was no receipt given or asked for. The horse was taken in day time, I reckon
                    about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The horse was taken as I have described.</p>
                <p>Ques 14 Ans. I do not think there was any camp near there, I heard of none. The
                    horse was in tolerable good order, a good work horse, but not a very good riding
                    horse. he was six years old, and I judge about 15 hands high. I think he was
                    worth about one hundred and fifty dollars. There was nothing paid on the horse.
                    There had been no battle or skirmish near, that I know of. I suppose the party
                    who took the horse belonged to Genl. Sheridan's Command, as at that time he made
                    a raid up the Valley.</p>

                <p>Ques 1 Deposition of Erastus Landes</p>
                <p>My name is Erastus Landes, my age is 42 years. I reside near Mount Sidney Augusta
                    Co. Va. My occupation is a farmer. I am a brother of the claimant. I was present
                    when the horse was taken, and was then a prisoner, he was taken out of the
                    stable, and I was ordered to mount him, which I did, and rode him to Staunton.</p>
                <p>Ques 4 Ans. The horse was taken from my fathers stable, near Mt. Sidney, on the
                    26th of Sept. 1864, I reckon. There was one soldier, who led the horse from the
                    stable to the road. I do not recollect how many were in the squad, but I suppose
                    there was 30 or 40 - I only one soldier come from the Stable. We only remained a
                    few minutes. I saw my father at the house.</p>
                <p>Ques 6 Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not. The squad
                    belonged to Genl. Sheridan's command. I heard nothing said at all about the
                    taking of the horse - then or afterwards - A Soldier brought the horse from the
                    stable to the road, about 70 yards I suppose. I was then ordered to mount which
                    I did - and rode him to Staunton.</p>
                <p>Ques 10 Ans. The horse was used by a Cavalry man, I saw him so used. There was no
                    complaint made that I heard.</p>
                <p>Ques 12 Ans. No receipt given or asked for that I know - The horse was taken
                    about the middle of the afternoon. There was no regular Camp. The night after
                    taking the horse we camped at Staunton, next day marched to Waynesboro and on
                    that night returned to Bridgewater in Rockingham Co. and then to Harrisonburg,
                    and then to Winchester.</p>
                <p>Ques 15 Ans. The horse was in good order, he was a splendid work horse and rode
                    tolerably well, he was about six years old, and a good size - I think he was
                    worth one hundred and fifty dollars. The claimant has asked me what I thought he
                    was worth, and I have told him I thought about one hundred and fifty dollars.
                    There never was anything paid that I know of.</p>

                <p>Ques 1 Ans. My name is Robt. E. Alexander my age is 30 years. I reside in the
                    vicinity of Mt. Sidney. Augusta Co. Va. The claimant married my sister. My
                    occupation is a farmer.</p>
                <p>I have known the claimant for 20 years, I was very intimate with him before and
                    during the war, during part of the war, we were together and all
                    lived within a mile of each other - I saw him every few days, we talked together
                    about the War, and he thought it was an unjust war on the side of the South. He
                    was tolerably bitter against Secession. He never believed that the rebel
                    government would succeed and always rejoiced over a Union victory - He generally
                    spoke freely in regard to the sympathy he felt for the Union cause. I know his
                    opinions, and feelings were all the time in favor of the Union, and in 1863 he
                    deserted the rebels and went to the West, and was gone about one year, when he
                    returned to his family, and kept hid until the surrender, I never knew him to be
                    threatened or molested for his being a Union man, nor his family either that I
                    know of. His reputation in the neighborhood was that of a Union man - He never
                    to my knowledge contributed anything to the confederate cause in any way - He
                    never owned any bonds to my knowledge nor did anything to countenance the
                    Confederates, except he did put in a substitute in the year 1862. He told me
                    that he hired the substitute in or to keep out of the army and he
                    told me that he never would bear arms against the United States. His loyal
                    neighbors all regarded him as a truly loyal man.</p>
                <p>His language and feelings were such that he could never have established loyalty
                    to the Confederate government had it succeeded, in getting its independence - My
                    opinion is that he would not have lived in this country.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Albert Sheets</p>
                <p>My name is Albert Sheets, my age is 33 years. I reside near Mount Sidney in
                    Augusta Co. My occupation is a farmer. I am not related to the claimant - I have
                    known the claimant about 15 years. I live about two miles from him. I knew him
                    well during the war. I saw him frequently, I do not recollect of ever talking
                    with him about the War, but I always heard he was a Union man. I know the
                    claimant always regarded me as adhering to the Union Cause. He went away during
                    the War, I believe in 1863, and when he returned I do not know what he did, as I
                    was in the State of Ohio. We both went through the lines together. I have heard
                    him converse on the subject of the war in presence of Union men. I do not
                    recollect names. I never knew the claimant to do anything to aid or countenance
                    the Confederacy. I know nothing of his hiring a substitute. I never knew him to
                    furnish anything to the rebels at all. I do not know that he ever owned any
                    Confederate bond. I do not think that he could have lived in the South, if it
                    had gained its independence. He told me that he would not live in the
                    Confederate States, if they succeeded. I never heard him give any information to
                    the Union Officers or Soldiers. Nor do I know that he ever give information to the rebels. I never knew him say or do anything
                    against the Union cause, nor in favor of the rebels. I have heard the Union men
                    of the neighborhood say they believed him to be a good Union Man.</p>
