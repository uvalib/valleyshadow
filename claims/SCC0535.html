<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The claimant was a resident of Augusta Co.Va. At the Commencement of the war he was drafted
                    &amp; sworn into the militia, but was exempted from service on a medical
                    examination. Says he took the oath fearing if he did not he would be sent to
                    jail. He gave no aid to the Confederacy &amp; swears that he was from the
                    beginning to the end of the war in sympathy with the Union Cause. He
                    unquestionably bore the reputation of a Union man. When the case was first
                    submitted no such facts were shown as would settle the question of loyalty
                    &amp; we caused an investigation to be made by an agent, whose report with
                    the accompanying testimony is decidedly in favor of claimants loyalty.</p>
                <p>The property was taken by Sheridans troops about the 1st of Oct. 1864 &amp;
                    for army use. No voucher was given or payment made</p>
                <p>We recommend the payment of $165.</p>

                    am a farmer. I was present &amp; saw the property mentioned in the claimants
                    petition taken. I saw one horse one saddle, one riding bridle &amp; one
                    blind bridle taken.</p>
                <p>4. Witness Says, The property was taken in 1864 from the farm of the claimant, by
                    Soldiers of the U.S. army under Genl. Sheridan</p>
                <p>6. Witness Says, There were no officers present when the property was taken, so
                    far as I know. Know neither the name rank or comd.
                    of any of them, but Genl. Talbot was in comd.</p>
                <p>10. Witness says, The property was taken for the use of the U.S.Govt.</p>
                <p>11. Witness Says, No complaint was made on account of the taking.</p>
                <p>12. Witness says, There was no receipt asked for &amp; none given</p>
                <p>13. Witness Says, The property was taken in the day time it was not taken

                    Item #3. Saw one riding bridle taken worth $2.00 Item #4. Saw one blind bridle
                    taken, was worth $1.00. Saw all the above property taken for the benefit of the
                    army.</p>
                <p>19. Witness says, I think the property was taken for the use of the U.S. army &amp; not for private use, the
                    horse was put into immediate service.</p>
                <p>22. Witness say, I think the property was taken for the necessary use of the

                    him. Saw him often &amp; talked with him about the war. I regard him as a
                    loyal man to the U.S.Govt. &amp; he was so regarded by his neighbors, he was called
                        abolishionist by the rebels. He did nothing
                    for the U.S.Govt so far as I know, don't know that he assisted any one to go with
                    the Union lines. I know he spoke favorably of it. Never knew him to do anything
                    for the rebel Govt. Did not know him threatened
                    or injured on account of his Union sentiments. I do not think he could have
                    lived here contented, had the South succeeded, he was too loyal to the U.S. I think he would have left the State of

                    was so regarded by his neighbors, &amp; some were very much against him on
                    account of it. He tried to get his brother through the lines to go North, he
                    would have gone himself if he had not been exempted. Never knew him to do
                    anything for the Confed.Govt. Never knew him threatened on account of his
                    Union sentiments. He said he did not expect to be allowed to stay in the South
                    if the Confederates succeeded, because he was a loyal man to the U.S. I have heard him speak often, favorably to
