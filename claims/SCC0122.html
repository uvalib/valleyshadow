<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John Price, September
                            14, 1871, Claim No. 6902</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Price placed his claim for horses and cattle in the fall of 1871, and the
                    Commissioners disallowed it in 1872, citing his vote in favor of the ordinance
                    of secession as evidence of disloyalty. Price's heirs appealed this decision to
                    the Court of Claims in 1895, and the case appears to have continued until 1904
                    without reaching any real resolution. Price's two daughters testified for the
                    first time in 1895.

                <p>Claim rejected.</p>
                <p>Mr. John Price lived in Augusta County through the war. He appears to have been
                    obnoxious to the rebels &amp; have suffered annoyances from them.</p>
                <p>His name is on the poll list voting for ratifying the ordinance of Secession,
                    though he says he did not vote. Sansabaugh the only witness for his loyalty also
                    voted for secession.</p>
                <p>The taking is only proved by a boy of the name of Will Price-then twelve years
                    old;-his testimony is far from Satisfactory.</p>

                    obnoxious to the rebels and have suffered annoyance from them. His name is on
                    the poll list voting for ratifying the ordinance of secession, though he says he
                    did not vote. Sansbaugh the only witness for his loyalty also voted for
                    secession.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners proceed to comment upon the testimony as to merits, and in
                    conclusion state: We reject the claimm".</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims Feb. 26th,
                    1892.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Sept. '71.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT testifies: Age 49; residence Augusta Co., Va. Wagon maker. Resided in
                    the county for the six months prior to April '61 and attended to my business.
                    Resided at the same place from April 1st, '61 to June 1st, '65. Never passed
                    beyond the naval and military lines of the U.S. and entered the rebel lines.
                    Never took any oath to the Confederate states. Took the amnesty oath in '65 at
                    Middlebrook, Augusta Co., Va.. Never asked for a pardon. Never connected with
                    the civil service of the Confederate states. Never held any office or place of
                    trust under the Confederate states. Never held any clerkship, agency or
                    employment for the Confederate states. Never in any capacity in the military or
                    naval service of the Confederacy. (P. 2). I was never an officer, soldier or
                    sailor in the Confederate states. Never furnished a substitute, nor connected
                    with any department or service of the Confederate states. Never had charge of
                    any stores supplies, etc., for the benefit of the Confederacy. I never was in
                    any capacity in the service of the Confederate Govt. Never furnished any stores
                    or supplies for the Confederate Govt. Never gave any information to any one
                    connected with the Confederate Govt. Never employed in the manufacture of any
                    articles whatever for the use of the Confederate army. Never employed in the
                    collection or impressment of supplies, etc., for the benefit of the Confederate
                    army. (P. 4). Never engaged in blockade running. I did not leave the Confederate
                    states at no time during the war. I never owned any interest in any vessel for
                    any use. Never arrested by the Confederate Govt. or any of its authorities.
                    Never arrested by the U.S. Govt. Had some forage taken by the Confederates,
                    never paid for it. Some Confederate soldiers threatened to shoot myself and my
                    wife. They drew pistols to do so and made an attempt to set fire to my house,
                    because of my Union sentiments. My premises were searched frequently and on one
                    occasion when my son was a corpse they annoyed the family very much. (P. 4). Had
                    one son in the U.S. Army, and a son a few weeks in the Confederate army, but he
                    did nothing at all. I never furnished either of them anything. Never owned a
                    Confederate bond, done nothing for the credit of the Confederate states. Never
                    gave any aid or comfort to the rebellion. Never engaged in making raids into the
                    U.S. from Canada. Never engaged in holding in custody any person taken as
                    prisoner of war by the rebel Govt. Never a member of any society for the impressment of any person on account of their
                    loyalty to the U.S. Never a paroled prisoner of the U.S. (P. 5). I never held
                    any office in the U.S. nor educated at any military or naval school of the U.S..
                    Never received any pass from the Confederate Govt. I had no disabilities imposed
                    by the 14th amendment. My sympathies were all the time for the Union and against
                    rebellion. I did not vote at all on the ordinance of secession. After its
                    adoption I went for the Union and against the state. I do declare that from the
                    beginning of hostilities against the U.S. to the end my sympathies were
                    constantly with the Union, and I never sought or attempted to do anything to
                    injure said cause, but was at all times ready and willing to aid the Union
                    cause. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>DAVID SAUSABAUGH testifies: Age 46; residence Augusta Co., Va., farmer. lived
                    about 1-1/4 mile from claimant, saw him frequently and talked with him about the
                    war, he was always opposed to the war, and so regarded by his neighbors. His son
                    was shot at in attempting to get through the lines to the North by the
                    Confederates and captured and died in Staunton a short time thereafter. (P. 9).
                    He never done anything for the Union cause, except having a son in the Union
                    army. He was engaged often in helping soldiers and men to get out of the rebel
                    lines. He never done anything in aid of the rebel cause. He was too loyal to the
                    U.S. to ever have been loyal to the Confederate States. (P. 10).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court. On Nov. 6th, 1895.</p>
                <p>MICHAEL WEAVER testifies: Farmer; age 69; residence Moffat's Creek, Va., Not
                    interested or related. (P. 1). I knew the claimant all my life, up to the time
                    of his death. I lived in sight of claimant andd saw him pretty much every day. I
                    could holler to him from his house to mine. That was from 1848 to to the time of
                    his death. Conversed with him about the war. He said the South would be whipped
                    and he would have nothing to do with it. He said he wanted to see the Union side
                    win. He was more of a Union man than 20 other men put together. He was known as
                    a Union man by every body. He made no secret of it. The Confederates all knew
                    him to be a Union man. They went to his house time and again and turned
                    everything upside down, searching for deserters. He took in Union men when they
                    were seeking to keep away fromm the Confederates, and warned them of the
                    approach of the Confederates. His house was a kind of a gathering place for the
                    Union men. He never was in the Confederate army. He was at home throughout the
                    war. (P. 2). He never owned any slaves He had one son in the Union army in the
                    West and he was killed at Shiloh. He kept his sons concealed in the woods to
                    keep them out of the Confederate service and they were shot at several times by
                    the Confederates He did not vote at all on secession. Claimant had a son by the
                    name of John who lived with him, and old enough to vote at that time, but they
                    paid no attention to the elections. Claimant could not have proved his loyalty
                    to the Confederacy about here, he would have had to go to some other country.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I heard claimant say he did not vote on secession. I was a Union man and the
                    claimant knew it. (P. 3). We were both as strong as Union men as could have
                    been. I was in the Confederate army, but not by my own wish. They came and took
                    me out of my own field and took me to the army. Was not in the army so long.,
                    about a year. Never in that long at a stretch. Would get away on a furlough or
                    at the hospital sick.. Of course I was bound to go back or desert to the
                    mountains, and finally I deserted to the mountains and kept out that way. I
                    don't know that he ever sold the Confederate QMs. anything. A Union man could stay in this neighborhood, if he did
                    not let it be known too much. We had to keep from giving any body provocation,
                    and we had to keep it to ourselves. A good many did leave the Confederate lines,
                    but claimant had a family and he was too old to go into service, and he staid at home, and followed his trade as wagon maker
                    when he got any work to do He was too old to be conscripted. Suppose he was 60
                    odd years old during the war. (P. 4). I reckon he would work whenever
                    any body came along on either side, for a man could not let it be known that he
                    worked for only one side of the soldiers. Then he was a good sort of a man
                    friendly disposed towards every body, and when a deserter came along he would
                    know where to get something to eat, as he gave to deserters from both armies if
                    he saw them in need. Claimant's son was in the Union army, was living in the
                    West, he had gone away from home about three years before the war had commenced.
                    He was killed at the battle of Shiloh. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>GEO. F. CARWELL testifies: Farmer; age 55; residence Moffatts Creek, Va. Not
                    interested or related. (P. 6). I knew the claimant from '58 till his death. I
                    lived within a mile and a half of him. I had conversations with the claimant
                    during the war, and he expressed himself as a Union man. He was generally known
                    in the community as a Union man, and always so considered. He concealed Union
                    men in his house, and helped them to get across to the Union lines. His house
                    was searched by the Confederates for deserters. There were two John Prices
                    living at Newport the voting precinct and both were old enough to vote, but I
                    don't know whether either of them voted or not. (P. 7). John Price was never in
                    the Confederate army. He never owned any slaves. He could not have proved his
                    loyalty to the Confederacy, if it had succeeded.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I know the other John Price was married before the war, and I know he was married
                    after he was 21 years old. He was claimant's son. Claimant's namme is John F.
                    Price, and his son's name was John D. Price. Claimant was a cripple during the
                    war, and I suppose he was forty five about the middle of the war.. I think his
                    son was married in '58, but I won't be positive. I was a Confederate soldiers,
                    served for4 years in the Stonewall Brigade. Claimant and I
                    would often talk about the war and its causes. We were good friends. During the
                    war when I was at home, wounded or on furloughs, I have been at his house often,
                    and we would have our talks. ((P. 8). I would argue for the
                    Confederacy, and he was against it. I don't think I ever heard him mention Stomewall Jackson, but I don't think he admired him.
                    I had no home, was a poor boy and would stay at claimant's some, when home on
                    furlough or wounded. He was always kind to me whenever I would go to see him. I
                    lived in his neighborhood when the war broke out, consequently would go back
                    there on my furlough during the war, and stay around with my friends. I did not
                    hear the claimant abuse the South nor speak in favor of it.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>I suppose he was friendly because I had been a neighbor boy raised up in the
                    neighborhood. He had no feeling against Confederate soldiers as individuals but
                    wanted to see the Union win. (P. 9). He had a son in the Union army, he was
                    killed at Nashville. He enlisted from Ind. having
                    gone West before the war. He helped two of my brothers through the Confederate
                    lines. (P. 10).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Claimant in this case was 29 years of age in '61. Resided in Augusta Co., Va.,
                    during the war, and was a wagon maker. Never took any oath to the Confederacy.
                    Was not in the Confederate service. Confederates took his forage, but did not
                    pay him for it. Confederate soldiers threatened to shoot him and his wife.
                    Attempted to set fire to his house because of his Union sentiments. Had a son in
                    the Union army. Never owned Confederate bonds. Gave no aid or comfort to the
                    rebellion. In '61 he was for the Union. Did not vote on the ordinance of
                    secession.</p>
                <p>His witnesses corroborate the foregoing facts and that in Conversation he always
                    expressed Union sentiments, and that he was known as a Union man by every body.
                    That he aided Union men in avoiding rebel conscription. He kept his sons
                    concealed in the woods to keep them out of the Confederate service.</p>
                <p>The proof is absolutely conclusive as to this man's loyalty throughout the war,
                    and there are no grounds whatever upon which to base an adverse decision on the
                    question of loyalty.</p>

                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected the claim because they were not convinced of

                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, Feb. 26th,
                    1892.</p>

                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners of Claims, in Sept. 1871.</p>
                <p>WM. PRICE testifies: Age 20; residence Augusta Co., Va., farmer. I have known the
                    claimant all my life I was present and saw the property specified in the
                    petition taken. Taken in '64, June., by soldiers belonging to Gen. Averill's
                    command. I don't know whether there were any officers present or not, think
                    there was an officer present, don't know his rank. I think there were officers
                    and soldiers engaged. The horses were rode away. (P. 7). Cattle drove. Property
                    removed in the direction of Lexington, Va. I did not follow or see any portion
                    of it afterwards.. Property taken for the use of the army. Did not see the
                    property after it was taken. No complaint made No receipt asked for. The
                    property was taken about 12 o'clock in the day. There was no encampment near
                    there, nor had there been any battle or skermish. I
                    knew no Q.M. The horses were in pretty good condition, and the cattle in first
                    rate order. The grey stallion was 5 years old and worth $250. or $26O.. (P. 8).
                    The bay horse was 7 years old and worth $175. One heifer 3 years old, worth $20,
                    5 head cattle, worth $15 apiece, $75.00 The property was taken for the use of
                    the army, and I think the Govt. should pay for it. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court in Jan. 1897.</p>
                <p>MARY J. TAYLOR testifies: housekeeper; Age 53; residence Augusta Co., Va.,
                    Interested. Claimant's daughter. (P. 1). I was living with the claimant at the
                    time and saw the property taken. Property carried away by Union troops in
                    Uniform. There was an officer with the party. The officer said it would be all
                    paid for. Property never returned or paid for. The Union army did not go into
                    camp until evening some distance from there, but passed and took the property
                    about the middle of the day. The horses and cattle were in good condition. I
                    think the amount stated is a fair value for each of the articles charged for.
                    (P. 2).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I would say the stallion was worth $250 at the time it was taken. Another bay
                    horse, some cattle, six in number, one heifer and five other cattle were taken.
                    The bay house was valued at $150.00 John Price was the legal owner of this
                    property. Union soldiers took the property. Don't know their names. Never heard
                    the name of the officer. Any body could tell he was an officer. That is what
                    they called him. I don't know whether he was an officer or not. All the rest
                    that came with him called him an officer, and he looked different from the
                    others I don't know exactly how many soldiers cams for the cattle, a good many.
                    Mr. Price's house was along side the road, and when the army came by some
                    soldiers left the ranks and took the stock. (P. 3). The men that came after
                    these cattle, horses, etc., were in front of the army, and after getting the
                    things they went on. I don't know whether they went into the ranks of the army
                    or not. I don't know anything about the burning. These men belonged to the army.
                    They didn't belong to the ranks. They were in front of the army. I don't
                    remember what year of the war this was. I don't know who was in command, it was
                    the Union army though. The men who took the cattle, horses, etc., had other
                    cattle, horses, etc, along with them when they stopped at the house. I don't
                    know how many. Didn't count them. It was a good many. Don't know how many came
                    to the house after the cattle. There were as many as five there was a good many
                    along, but I don't know how many. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>An officer was not directly with the party, but he told father he would get pay
                    for his horses.</p>
                <p>RE-CROSS.</p>
                <p>This man was in front of the army, but was with it. He told father that he would
                    get pay. I heard this conversation myself. Father did not try to get him to pay
                    for these things. Never went to him for pay or to find out how to get pay. I
                    reckon he thought it was no use.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>(P. 5). The army went on shortly after this man had told my father about the
                    paying for it, and no, I don't reckon my father knew where to go to see this
                    man.</p>
                <p>RE-CROSS.</p>
                <p>Large army following these things. I reckon my father knew the army camped some
                    place, but didn't know how far. They camped about 15 miles from our house, Don't
                    know how long. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>SARAH A. TROXELL testifies: Housekeeper- age, 48; residence Rockingham Co., Va.,
                    Interested. Daughter of claimant. (P. 7). I was living with my father and saw
                    the property in question carried away by Union troops. Carried away by regular
                    soldiers, by the Union army. The cattle were in good condition and were young.
                    Also the horses. Property taken by soldiers of the regular army. I don't know
                    whether there was an officer along or not. An officer came along afterwards and
                    told my father that he would get pay for it. Property carried off for the use of
                    the army. Think the property was worth the prices charged.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>A gray horse, bay horse, heifer and five other cattle were taken from the
                    claimant. I saw my father talking to the officer and heard him too. Father was
                    down to the road when he came along, and my father told him that he had taken
                    his horses, cattle, etc., and he told him he would get pay for them. He Said the
                    Northern army would pay for them. He didn't say when he would get pay. I don't
                    know what army it was that came along. Army going East coming from the North. We
                    didn't have any battle around here. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Wm. Price saw the horses and the cattle taken by Federal soldiers in June '64
                    belonging to Gen. Averils command. Thinks there was
                    an officer present. They rode the horses away and drove the cattle. Taken for
                    the use of the army. Horses in good condition. Cattle fine order. One of the
                    horses was five years old worth $250 or $260. The other horse seven years old
                    worth $175. One of the cattle was a three year old heifer, worth $20.00 Five of
                    the cattle were worth $15 each. All taken for the use of the army. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>Mary J. Taylor, daughter of claimant, saw all this property taken, and the
                    officer said at the time that it would be paid for. That the horses and cattle
                    were in good condition. Values one of the horses at $250 and the other at $150.
                    Testifies to the taking of six head of cattle number charged for. (P. 3). That
                    there was a good many soldiers engaged in the taking.(P. 4).</p>
                <p>Mrs. Troxell, daughter of claimant, testifies, that she saw the property charged
                    for taken by Union troops. Cattle and Horses in good condition. (P. 5). That
                    there was an officer along and that he told her father he would get pay for the
                    property. Testifies to the taking of two horses and six head of cattle.</p>
                <p>This testimony is conclusive in establishing the taking for the use of the army 2
                    serviceable horses, and six head of cattle in June 1864. For one of the horses
                    there should be allowed at least $150, for the other $125. The price charged for
                    the cattle is reasonable, and for the six head there should be allowed $95.</p>
                <p>The account should therefore be stated as follows:--2 horses, $275.00; 6 head
                    cattle, 95.00; Total, $370.00</p>

                <p>BRIEF ON MOTION</p>
                <p>This case was submitted on the issue of loyalty October 28, 1896, and the
                    claimant was found loyal November 2 following. At the time of the submission of
                    the case, certain matters of record were not called to the attention of the
                    court; and believing there were this done the same could but result in the court
                    reversing their finding, I hereby beg leave to respectfully submit the following
                    points to their consideration.</p>
                <p>It is of record that in 1871 the claimant stated under oath that he never sold
                    any supplies whatever to the Confederate Government or to any agent or agents of
                    the same. He admits, with seeming frankness, that he did have forage taken from
                    him by the Confederates, <u>but that he was never paid
                        anything for the same</u>. (Record, p. 4; Abstract p. 2.) And yet it
                    appears from the report of the Record and Pension Office of the War Department
                    under date of December 4, 1897, that there are on file in the Confederate
                    archives eight different vouchers signed "John Price," and inspection of the
                    same shows indisputably that to five of the eight in question is attached the
                    signature of the claimant in this case. It is true that these vouchers are all
                    for small sums, the aggregate amount involved being but
                        $238.30$233.89. But were this total one hundred times
                    as much, their importance in the case at this moment could be no greater, for in
                    themselves they establish the fact that the claimant's statements under oath are
                    not to be accepted. A list of these vouchers is to be found hereunto annexed.
                    They will be submitted to the inspection of the court upon the argument of this
                    motion.</p>
                <p>In 1871 the claimant likewise testified that when the Ordinance of Secession was
                    submitted to the vote of the people of Virginia for ratification or rejection,
                    he did not vote at all upon it. He states no reason for this alleged
                    non-exercise of his right of suffrage. It would, perhaps, not have been easy to
                    explain, for the records of the vote on that question show that not a few of the
                    citizens of Augusta County, wherein claimant resided, voted against the
                    ratification of the Ordinance. As a matter of fact, however, the records show
                    that John Price did vote upon this question and voted, too, in favor of
                    ratifying the Ordinance. (See report of Treasury Department filed May 13, 1892.)</p>
                <p>Claimant's counsel attempts to overcome this by bringing forward a witness, one
                    George F. Carwell, who states that there were <u>two</u> John
                    Prices living at Newport, the claimant's home, and that both were old enough to
                    vote; that the name of one of these, the claimant, was John <u>F</u>. Price and that the other was his son, John <u>D</u>. Price.</p>
                <p>We have simply the statement of the witness Carwell that the latter is correct.
                    But whether or not this be so is really not a matter of comment. It suffices to
                    point out that all the papers of record in the case bearing the claimant's name
                    are signed by him "John Price," and this is the name he attached to the
                    Confederate vouchers hereinbefore referred to. It must therefore be presumed
                    that under this name he voted upon the ratification of the Ordinance of
                    Secession, if vote he did.</p>
                <p>But <u>one</u> John Price voted in Augusta County upon the
                    question of the ratification of the Ordinance of Secession, and he voted in
                    favor of ratification. John D. Price, his son, the records in the Treasury
                    Department show, likewise voted upon this question, and voted, as did his sire,
                    in favor of the same. The name John <u>F</u>. Price does not
                    appear upon the list of those voting on that occasion. (See report Treasury
                    Department on loyalty, dated Oct. 2, 1901.)</p>
                <p>But one witness, Michael Weaver, attempts to corroborate claimant's statement
                    relative to the non-user of his right of suffrage on the question of the
                    ratification. This witness asked to state if he knows how the claimant voted on
                    the question, answered positively "he did not vote at all;" but upon
                    cross-examination asked how he knew this to be so, answered simply "I heard him
                    say so." His testimony upon this point is, of course, worthless. And in the
                    absence of any corroborative proof whatever from either of the two other
                    witnesses, Sansebaugh and Carwell, it would seem to me that at least a <u>prima facie</u> case has been made out against the
                    claimant on this point by means of the records cited
                    heretoforeinbefore.</p>
                <p>The testimony in the case in support of claimant's loyalty is in general very
                    weak. David Sansebaugh testifies to conversations with the claimant, but fails
                    to state the purport of the same. He does, however, state that claimant was
                    opposed to the war and was so regarded by his neighbors; also that claimant "was
                    engaged often in helping soldiers and men get out of the rebel lines." Again
                    there is to be noted the utter absence of detail. Other than these general
                    statements of the witness, his statements only negatively support the claimant's
                    contention of loyalty. And while referring to this witness it might, perhaps, be
                    considered adviseable to remind the court that Sansebaugh himself has already
                    been pronounced disloyal,-this in the case of David Sansebaugh v. United States,
                    No. 8610, Congressional.</p>
                <p>The testimony of the next witness, Michael Weaver, is most seriously discredited
                    by one thing in particular. The witness claims the utmost intimacy with
                    claimant's decedent and states that he lived within sight of him and saw him
                    "pretty much every day: I could holler to him from his house to mine; that was
                    from 1848 to the time of his death." (Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p. 4.)</p>
                <p>Upon cross-examination this witness, who himself served for two years in the
                    Confederate army (he confesses to but one year's service, it is to be noted.
                    Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p. 5) was asked:-</p>
                <p>Could you and claimant have left the Confederate lines during the war easily?</p>
                <p>He eliminates that part of the question which applies to himself and answers:-</p>
                <p>A good many did go, but he (claimant) had a family and he was too old to go into
                    the service and so he stayed at home and followed his trade as a wagonmaker when
                    he could get any work to do. He was <u>too old</u> to be
                    conscripted.</p>
                <p>Ques. How old was he during the war?</p>
                <p>Ans. I suppose <u>60 odd years old</u>. (Testimony filed Nov.
                    18, 1895, p. 4).</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, which is of record, (Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p. 1)
                    claimant's decedent, with home this witness claims such an intimate
                    acquaintance, as above noted, testifying in 1871, stated his then age as 49. It
                    accordingly follows that in 1861, at the outbreak of the war, claimant's
                    decedent was but 39 years of age; and I respectfully submit that, such being the
                    case, if this man Weaver could not give testimony either more truthful or more
                    accurate, as the case may be, than the foregoing relation to claimant's
                        age, then his whole testimony, without exception, can not necessarily
                    be deemed of any importance in assisting this court in arriving at a
                    determination of the question under discussion.</p>
                <p>The witness Carwell testifies to loyal conversation by claimant's decedent and
                    the fact that he concealed Union men in his house and helped to get them across
                    the Union lines, etc. (Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p. 6).. The witness displays
                    a rather astoundingly intimate knowledge of the claimant's daily life,
                    considering the fact that he confesses to having served four years in the
                    Confederate army under "Stonewall" Jackson. He states, too, that he and claimant
                    remained good friends throughout the war, and that whenever he (witness) was at
                    home, whether wounded or on furlough, he visited at the claimant's house and
                    conversed with him,- that he would stay at claimant's house, and take his meals
                    there, etc. (Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p. 7.) But the witness alleges that
                    all these kindnesses were shown him simply because he (the witness) "had been a
                    neighbor boy raised up in the neighborhood."</p>
                <p>This witness' testimony may, I think, best be summed up by reference to his
                    concluding statement upon cross-examination, which was to the effect that he
                    never heard claimant's decedent either abuse the South or speak in favor of it.</p>
                <p>Claimant, it appears (Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p. 3) had two sons who fought
                    in the great civil war on opposite sides. One of these was in the Union army and
                    was killed at Shiloh; but he, it is testified (Claimant's Brief on Loyalty, p.
                    6) left home about three years before the war commenced and at the outbreak of
                    the same, when he enlisted, was living in the West. The son who enlisted in the
                    Confederate army was the John D. Price who, with his father, voted in favor of
                    the Ordinance of Secession, and this son went direct from his father's home into
                    the Confederate army.</p>
                <p>It is respectfully submitted that the testimony of record is such as would
                    necessarily preclude the court from making a finding favorable to the claimant
                    upon the issue of loyalty. A new trial upon the issue of loyalty, it seems to
                    me, should be allowed.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Reply to Defendant's Brief</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1900-01</p>
                <p>JOHN PRICE VS THE UNITED STATES No. 8607 Congressional.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>
                <p>Loyalty was found in this case on November 2nd, 1896.</p>
                <p>Claimant's brief on merits was filed on January 16th, 1897; over four years have
                    elapsed without this case being prepared by the defense on merits, and now
                    Defendant's counsel comes with a motion for a new trial on loyalty. The
                    contention that this claimant was disloyal is absurd; <u>absolutely nothing in it</u>. The evidence was conclusive as the Court
                    found on the question of loyalty, showing unmistakably that this claimant was a
                    union man throughout the entire war and loyal to the United States.</p>
                <p>Now there is lugged into the case, at this late day, a document showing that one
                    John Price voted for secession in the precinct where this claimant lived. That
                    proves nothing in the light of the testimony showing that there was another John
                    Price living in that same place in the time of the war; voted at that precinct,
                    and the presumption is that this was the party who voted for secession, because
                    claimant says <u>he did not vote at all</u>. He is
                    corroberated as to this fact. [Handwritten in margin: This question was brought
                    to the attention of the court when its finding of loyalty was made as is shown
                    by the report of the Commissioners of Claims]</p>
                <p>The language of claimant is, "I did not vote at all on the ordinance
                    of secession." Claimant had a son in the union army.</p>
                <p>MR. CARWELL testifies that there were two John Price's
                    living at Newberg, in the same precinct and both old enough to vote; so there
                    can be no question about claimant not having voted for secession.</p>
                <p>There is nothing whatever in the defense, and this motion should be at once
                    overruled and the case ordered to the trial calendar on merits. The delay in
                    this case is absolutely inexcusable. It belongs to a class of cases that fall
                    into the hands of an attorney who holds them indefinitely without any
                    preparation, and no disposition to prepare them on the part of the defense, and
                    I think it about time that these protracted delays in the preparation of cases
                    should cease.</p>
                <p>It is unpleasant to practice law in a Court where the defense is allowed an
                    indefinite period for the preparation of cases for trial. The motion should be
                    overruled without argument.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyerts Attorney for
                    claimant.</p>

                <p>Heretofore, to wit, December 2, 1901, the court allowed the defendants' motion
                    for a new trial on loyalty. Since then claimant's counsel has failed to file
                    either evidence or any brief upon the issue of loyalty.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, it might be noted that October 30, 1902, defendants' counsel filed
                    a brief on loyalty, hoping that by so doing he could prod claimant's counsel
                    into some degree of activity in his conduct in the case; but nothing has
