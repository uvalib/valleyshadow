                    injure said cause or retard its success, and I was at all times ready and
                    willing if called upon to aid and assist the cause of the Union, or its
                    supporters, so far as my means, and power and the circumstances permitted. I
                    voted for the ordinance of Secession for the reason of being threatened at the
                    time, at Waynesboro, with being hung, and it was reported that some Union men
                    would be hung at Sherando. I also was told and made believe that the adoption of
                    the Ordinance by Virginia would prevent a War. I have always regretted that
                    vote.</p>
                <p>Taking the Property</p>
                <p>Ques 1 Ans. I was present and saw my horses taken</p>
                <p>Ques 3 Ans. The horses were in the Stable. The soldiers opened the door, went in
                    and let them out.</p>
                <p>Ques 4 Ans. It was in June 1864, I do not remember the day. I did not hear any
                    names. I think there were about six soldiers. I don't think there was an officer
                    at the stable, but the Command was a short distance off. They were only at the
                    stable a few minutes.</p>
                <p>Ques 5 Ans. Henry C. Kindig and Absolom Kindig were present.</p>
                <p>Ques 6 Ans. I don't think there was present at the stable and they remarked that
                    they needed them.</p>
                <p>Ques 8 Ans. The soldiers led the horses to the road and mounted them.</p>
                <p>Ques 9 Ans. The Command was marching, I did not follow after them.</p>
                <p>Ques 10 Ans. The soldiers were riding my horses the last I saw of them. It was a
                    Cavalry Command.</p>
                <p>Ques 11 Ans. I told them I was a Union man, and that they ought not to take my
                    horses, and they said they needed the horses.</p>
                <p>Ques 12 Ans. I did not ask for a receipt.</p>
                <p>Ques 13 Ans. The horses were taken in day time. I suppose 1 or 2 P.M. There was
                    no secrecy at all.</p>
                <p>Ques 14 Ans. There has been no Camp nearer that Staunton, 11 miles distant,
                    General Hunter's Army had been in Staunton for several days. I think they had
                    left Camp that morning. They said they were going to Lynchburg. The battle at
                    Piedmont took place a few days before. I knew no Quarter Master or other
                    officer.</p>
                <p>Ques 15 Ans. The horses were in very good condition. The soldiers said they were
                    good horses. The dark horse was 4 years old of good size and sound, he was a
                    good riding horse and worked well too. I think he was worth $150. The light bay
                    horse was 9 or 10 years old of good size, and a good work horse. I think he was
                    worth $150.</p>

                <p>Answer to first general question</p>
                <p>My name is Henry C. Kindig my age is 47 years. My residence near Waynesboro. I am
                    a farmer. I am a brother of the claimant. I was present and saw the horses
                    taken.</p>
                <p>Ques 3 Ans. The horses were taken out of the claimants stable, by soldiers and
                    led to the road.</p>
                <p>Ques 4 Ans. I think the 7th or 8 June 1864. I think there were about 1/2 dozen
                    soldiers who were on horseback. I don't think that either of those was an
                    officer. They were only at the stable a few minutes.</p>
                <p>Ques 5 Ans. The claimant and his family were present.</p>
                <p>Ques 6 Ans. There was no officer nearer than the road which was a short distance
                    away.</p>
                <p>Ques 7 Ans. The horses were taken out of the stable by 1/2 dozen solders and led
                    off. I heard nothing said.</p>
                <p>Ques 8 Ans. The horses were led to the road and then mounted and rode off with
                    the Command.</p>
                <p>Ques 9 Ans. The Army was marching. I did not see the horses after they left.</p>
                <p>Ques 10 Ans. It was a Cavalry Command and I suppose the horses were used for
                    that.</p>
                <p>Ques 11 Ans. I heard no complaint. The Claimant remarked that he would rather the
                    Union Army had taken them, than the Confederates.</p>
                <p>Ques 12 Ans. There was no receipt given or asked for.</p>
                <p>Ques 13 Ans. I was day time, about 1 o'clock.</p>
                <p>Ques 14 Ans. I knew of no Camp except the one at Staunton, said to be General
                    Hunter's Army had been there for several days. They had moved out of Camp that
                    morning and left for Lynchburg. There had been a battle fought at Piedmont on
                    Sunday previous. I did learn the name of any officer at all.</p>
                <p>Ques 15 Ans. The horses were in good condition and sound as a dollar. The dark
                    horse was 4 years old, good size and well broken to work and ride - he was worth
                    at least $200. The light bay was 9 or 10 years old, a very good size, a good
                    work horse and sound as far as I know. he was worth $150. I have not talked with
                    Claimant about prices. I knew them well. I have no beneficial interest in this
                    claim.</p>

                <p>My name is Samuel Keiser my age is 62 years. I reside near Fishersville in
                    Augusta Co. I am a farmer. I am not related to the Claimant. I have known the
                    claimant for twenty five years. We lived about one mile a part during the war.
                    We were very intimate. I saw him frequently, often once a week. I have heard him
                    talk many times about The War and he always talked in favor of the Union. I am
                    fully satisfied in my mind that he was decided in his sympathies for the Union.
                    I do not recollect any particular words. It was rumored in the neighborhood that
                    he would be reported for speaking against the South. He knew my Union
                    sentiments. I never heard him express himself in the presence of others. His
                    Union neighbors all believed him to be strictly loyal to the United States. He
                    assisted Union men in getting out the Confederate lines - I know of nothing that
                    he ever did for the rebellion. he had talked too much against the South to have
                    proven loyalty to it.</p>

                <p>Answer to 1st general question</p>
                <p>My name is Henry B. Jones, my age is 54 years. Reside near Fishersville. I am a
                    farmer. I am a brother-in-law of the Claimant. I was very intimate with the
                    Claimant during The War. I reside between 25 &amp; 28 miles from him. I saw
                    him four or five times a year. We conversed freely about The War and I always
                    found True in his Union sympathies and sentiments. He knew my Union sympathies.
                    I never heard him express sympathy for the South at no time. He was regarded in
                    the neighborhood as strictly a Union man. He sent three of his sons through the
                    lines to keep them from fighting against the Union - I heard that was threats
                    made at Waynesboro and the neighborhoods. From what I heard a reign of terror
                    existed in that particular neighborhood. I believe it was the pressure existing
                    that made him believe vote for the Ordinance, for I had heard him
                    speak in opposition to it before and after the election. From my knowledge of
                    him he could not have shown any loyalty to the South, had it been successful.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Henry Crist</p>
                <p>Answer to 1st General Question</p>
                <p>My name is Henry Crist, my age is 50 years. I am farmer. I am not related to the
                    Claimant. I have known the Claimant since childhood. I was very intimate with
                    him during The War. I often conversed with him, average once a week. Our chief
                    conversation was about The War. I left the Confederate lines in February 1864.
                    In all my interviews with his sympathies were in favor of the Union. I never
                    heard him express the slightest sympathy with the rebellion. He knew my
                    adherence to the Union. I met with him once in the presence of others and he was
                    firm in his Union sentiments. He expressed himself as decidedly opposed to the
                    Ordinance of Secession, and I believe it was the threats made in that
                    neighborhood that caused him to vote as he did. The rumored talk was that men
                    were to be hung and there was considerable excitement. His reputation was that
                    of a Union man in the neighborhood. I never knew him to do anything for the
                    Union cause. I don't think he ever did any thing for the rebellion voluntarily.
                    I know that he had taken too strong grounds in favor of the Union to show any
                    loyalty or sympathy for the South. I lived about one mile from him during The
                    War on to the time I left.</p>
