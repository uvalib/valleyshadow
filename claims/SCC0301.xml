                <p>John H. Bates died in Augusta in September 1865 and left no will. I qualified as
                    Administrator of his estate in the year 1865 - I do not remember the exact date.
                    He left a widow and one child by his last wife and four children by two former
                    wives. I believe all the children are living. I had known the deceased for
                    twenty years prior to his death and was intimately acquainted with him during
                    the war. I lived about a quarter mile distant from him and saw him pretty much
                    every day. I talked with him about the cause and progress of the war. I know his
                    political sympathies and opinions, by his conversations had with me. He always
                    expressed himself in favor of the Union cause and expressed himself very
                    bitterly against the rebellion. I heard him frequently express the wish that the
                    Union armies would subjugate the South. I was a Union man during the war and the
                    claimant so regarded me. I knew his general reputation of loyalty. It was that
                    of a Union man. All parties considered him a Union man. His loyal neighbors
                    regarded him a Union man. I don't know that he was ever molested or threatened
                    on account of his Union sentiments. I never knew him to own any Confederate
                    Bonds, or to contribute in any way toward the financial credit of the
                    Confederacy. His assistance rendered Union refugees and his language used in my
                    presence in dissuading persons from service in the Confederate army, would have
                    rendered him unable to prove his loyalty to the Confederate government if it had
                    succeeded in maintaining a separate existence.</p>
                <p>The witness is here examined by the <abbr expan="Commission">Com.</abbr> as to
                    the value of the horse charged.</p>
                <p>I don't know anything about the taking of the horse charged. The horse was an
                    iron gray horse five years old, in very fine condition - he was a fine saddle
                    horse and was worth $175. I knew the horse well.</p>

                    affirmed and examined by the Com'r says:</p>
                <p>I am <unclear>40</unclear> years old and reside in New Hope, Augusta County,
                    Virginia. I am a farmer. I am not related to the deceased and have no interest
                    in this claim. I had known the deceased for twenty five years previous to his
                    death. I was intimate with him during the war. I lived about a mile and a half
                    from him, and saw him once a month during the war. I talked with him frequently
                    in regard to the cause and progress of the war. I knew his political sympathies
                    and opinions. They were in favor of the Union. I knew so from his conversations.
                    I do not remember of hearing him speak in the presence of others, but I have no
                    doubt that I did so hear him, as he was an outspoken man. I knew his reputation
                    in the community. He was regarded a loyal man generally. He was so regarded by
                    his loyal neighbors. I never knew him to be molested or threatened with injury
                    on account of his Union sentiments. I never knew him to own any Confederate
                    Bonds. I never knew him to aid or assist either army in any way. His general
                    reputation in the community for loyalty would have prevented him from proving
                    his loyalty to the Confederate government had it succeeded in maintaining a
                    separate existence.</p>

                    &amp; she told the soldiers that they aught not to take the horses. They

                    soldiers came and got the horse and led him away. I did not see any officer with
                    them. They said they wanted to use the horse for the artillery. They said they
