<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The claimant resided in Augusta Co.Va throughout the war, was totally blind. His
                    business was merchandising. The testimony fails to satisfy us that he remined
                    loyal to the union cause. There is no doubt whatever had the Confederacy
                    succeeded he could have proved his loyalty to it by scores of witnesses. He
                    voted to ratify the ordinance of secession. There was no necessity for this.
                    Nobody would have harmed this blind man if he had stayed at home &amp; not
                    voted at all. Such was the course pursued by many persons opposed to secession
                    and they were not harmed. One of his own witnesses says "I do not know whether
                    he was strictly a Union man or not." The claim is disallowed.</p>

                    day of February or March, in 1865 by Gen<sup>l.</sup> Sheridan's Command. There were a large
                    number of soldiers present and engaged in taking the articles.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5. Ans. There was a colered woman by name of
                    Nancy Brock present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6. Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not, the

                    Vinegar in buckets, Coffee pots &amp; pans.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8. Ans. The property was removed to their camp by soldiers. I asked them
                    not take my provisions that they saw my condition being blind, and they replied
                    that they were obliged to have provisions that they had no prisoner train.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9. Ans. The property was taken to the camps, in and around the town.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10. Ans. They told me they wanted provisions. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11. Ans. I made no complaint to any officer.</p>

                    but one night. There was a skirmish, with Gen<sup>l.</sup> Early. I knew no Quarter Master or
                    other officer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15. Ans. The Flour was a first rate article, I had refused the day previous
                    ten dollars in gold per barrel. A portion of the corn was shelled and the
                    balance on the cob. The hay was good, sound good Bacon. The Vinegar was of an
                    excellent quality, the Kettles, Coffe Pots, Crocks &amp; pans all new. The
                    bags were all sound and good. I judged the quantity of hay, by the amount I knew
                    my house held. I had purchased the Corn only three days previously, and none of
                    it had been used. I made the Bacon and knew that that amount was taken. The
                    boxes of Tobacco were unbroken, except one which contained 40 pounds. One Case
                    of Smoking Tobacco, was unbroken and contained 200 pounds, and the balance was
                    in 1/2 pound packages. The flour was in barrels and 10 of them. Every article
                    taken was good and sound.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Susan A. Mann</p>
                <p>Answer to first general question. My name is Susan A. Mann, my age is 39 years. I
                    reside in Waynesboro. I am the wife of the claimant. I was present and saw the
                    property taken. I saw all the property taken, which was from the
                    dwelling, Flour, Corn, Rye, Bacon, Vinegar, hay, Crocks, Bags, &amp;
                    Kettles.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3. Ans. The flour was rolled out of the house into the garden. The Bacon
                    from the Smoke house, and hay and corn and everything taken from the dwelling
                    was from the places where such articles are usually kept by families.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4. Ans. The articles were taken to the camp, so far as I know. I have no
                    recollection of the time, I know the year was 1865. Gen<sup>l.</sup> Sheridan I understood was the
                    Commander. There were a large number of soldiers present. I do not know whether
                    there was an officer present or not. Nancy Brock, a colered woman was present. I know of no officer being present. I do not
                    recollect anything that was said except that I told them my husband was blind,
                    and asked them not to take my provisions, and the reply was that I "had better
                    go to the house." The flour was emptied from the barrels into bags. The bags
                    taken from us was used for that purpose. They hay was
                    carried by the soldiers. The Bacon was carried by the soldiers in their hands
                    and the Vinegar in Coffee Pots, Crocks pans &amp;c. to the camp. I never saw
                    the articles after it was taken away. There was no
                    complaint made to any officer that I know of and no receipt given. The property
                    was taken in the day time in the Afternoon. The army was camped in different
                    places in and around the town. It remained one night.</p>
                <p>There had been a fight with Gen<sup>l.</sup> Early. The day that Gen<sup>l.</sup> Sheridan came to the town. The
                    property was sound and good as far as I know.</p>

                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup>Gen<sup>l.</sup> Question. My name is Rufus M.

                    war. I was in Waynesboro working at my trade most of the war. I saw him
                    frequently and had frequent conversations about the war, he always denounced the
                    south for going into the rebellion. I never heard him express himself in the
                    presence of others. he was very free to talk with me, as he knew me to be a
                    strong Union man. The Union men of the town and neighborhood regarded him as a
                    good Union man. I have heard him say to others that it was very unwise for the
                    South to rebel. There was a great many threats made against any who voted
                    against Secession. There were parties banded together to lynch any one who voted
                    against the Ordinance and my impression that alone caused the claimant to vote
                    for it, for owing to his situation being blind, he was in a dependant situation
                    and I do not believe that had he voted against Secession or refused to vote for
                    it, he could have gotten patronage to support his family. I do not believe from
                    what I knew of the claimant that he could have proven his loyalty to the
                    Confederate States, if they had succeeded.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Benjamin M. Lines</b>
                <p>Deposition of Benjamin M. Lines.</p>
                <p>Ans. to 1<sup>st</sup> general question. My name is Benjamin M.
                    Lines, my age is 73 years. I reside near Waynesboro. My occupation is Post
                    Master, &amp; Shoemaker. I am not related to the claimant and have no
                    interest in the claim. I have known the claimant for over fifteen years. I lived
                    about 3 miles distant from the claimant during the war. I saw him frequently,
                    probably once a week. I do not recollect of talking with him about the War. The
                    claimant knew my sentiments to be in favor of the Union. I do not know whether
                    he was strictly a Union man or not. I think however, that he was so inclined,
                    but I had no particular conversation with him on the subject. It was not at all
                    prudent in that town (Waynesboro) and neighborhood for a man to express himself
                    against secession. The claimant being a blind man and having a small variety
                    store would have been in danger of losing his goods and reduced to want, if he
                    had expressed himself openly in favor of the Union. I know a part of his Union
                    neighbors regarded him as a Union man. I never heard of his giving anything to
                    aid the Confederates. When Stonewall Jackson, had a large number of prisoners
                    enroute to Richmond the claimant sent or carried provisions to the prisoners. I
                    do not know whether he could have proved his loyalty to the Confederacy or not.</p>
