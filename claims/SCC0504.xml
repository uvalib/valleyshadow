                    taken. A squad of men came and took the horse. I think there was an officer with
                    them. No conversation took place when the horse was taken. I did not try to
                    recover the horse. I did not ask for or receive any receipt. The horse was a
                    young horse. I do not remember his age. I think he was about three years old.
                    The other three horses and the three cows were taken by Gen. Sheridans army at
                    the time he made his Burning Raid through the Valley. The horses were in the
                    field except one and the cows were in the field. The army passed along the road
                    by my house and drove all the stock away. I saw them driving the horses and
                    cattle past my house. There was no conversation held at the time. There were a
                    large number of soldiers present who took the horses and cattle. I heard one of
                    the soldiers address one of the officers as "Captain." I do not know the names
                    of any of the officers. One was a black mare 8 or 9 years old. She was worth
                    $125. One was a gray mare about eleven or twelve years old and was worth $120.
                    One was a bay horse about twenty years old, a very fine horse, and was worth
                    $80. The three cows were <orig reg="milk">milck</orig> cows. They were of
                    moderate age. I do not know how many pounds of beef they would have made. They
                    were worth on the hoof, $35 each. Further deponent saith not.</p>

                    One was a roan horse about five years old. One was a black mare, about eight

                    was encamped three or four miles off. I did not hear any conversation between

                    Minister of the Gospel. I was present when the articles mentioned in the
                    claimants petition were taken, saw some of them taken. I saw one horse taken,
                    &amp; am satisfied two others were taken at the same time. I think the
                    fourth horse was taken from the stable, but am not certain, I did not see the
                        <orig reg="milk">milck</orig> cows mentioned in the petition taken.</p>
                <p>4. Witness says: The articles were taken during <abbr expan="General"
                    >Genl.</abbr> Sheridans raid, from the claimants farm by Union Soldiers.</p>
                <p>5. Witness says: Three other persons were present when the property was taken.</p>
                <p>6. Witness says: I suppose there were some officers present when the property was
                    taken. Do not know their rank or the army to which they belonged but suppose
                    they were Sheridans men.</p>
                <p>8. Witness says: The property was removed by soldiers, one horse was ridden but
                    dont know about the other property.</p>
                <p>9. Witness says: I do not know to what place the property was removed.</p>
                <p>10. Witness says: I do not know for what use the property was taken, except the
                    bay horse was moutetd by what I supposed to be a cavalry man.</p>
                <p>11. Witness says: No complaint was made to any officer on account of such taking.</p>
                <p>12. Witness says: There was no receipt given, none asked for.</p>
                <p>13. Witness says: The property was taken about 4 o'clock in the day.</p>
                <p>14. Witness says: The army was encamped nearby the day before the property was
                    taken but can not say whether they had moved when the property was taken. Don't
                    know the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> or Brigade, it was Sheridan Army.
                    There was no battle or skirmish just before the property was taken.</p>
                <p>15. Witness says: The horses were in good condition. One roan horse was 4 years
                    old, I think he was worth $120.00. One grey mare, 10 years old worth $100. One
                    bay horse 20 years old worth $50.00. Don't know any thing about the cows.</p>
                <p>19. Witness says: I believe the prosperity mentioned was taken for use in the
                    union army &amp; not for private use.</p>
                <p>22. Witeness says: I think the property was taken for some purpose so necessary
                    that the Govt. ought to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23. Witness says: I don't know that those who took the property had orders to do
