<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Mr. Masincup is a farmer and a resident of Augusta Co.Va. He voted to ratify the
                    ordinance of secession which was submitted to the people of Va. after hostilities commenced. It was a voluntary
                    act and it is difficult to imagine any act more intensely disloyal than aiding
                    to take a State out of the Union. He was not only an original secessionist, but
                    after the State seceded he went out with the militia as a soldier and fought for
                    2 months against the Union.</p>
                <p>The claim is disallowed.</p>

                    the same field, and the Corn was in and old Chopping Mill,
                    near my house, just across the road.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4. Ans. The property was taken in June 1864 by soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>ls</sup> Hunter's command.
                    I suppose there were probably 200 present. They were only a few minutes in
                    taking the property.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5. Ans. Lewis Hill was present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6. Ans. There were officers present. I think one Major, and several
                    Captains. I did not hear any names. I heard nothing said by the Officers.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7. Ans. The Stallion was taken out of the Stable and the two Mares, Heifer
                    and Calf out of the field and the Corn out of an old Chopping Mill.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8. Ans. The Stallion was rode by a soldier who led his
                    own horse, and the two Mares were led by soldiers and the Heifer and Calf drove.
                    The Corn &amp; Rye was taken in bags by the soldiers they were all mounted.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9. Ans. I suppose the property was taken to Staunton. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10. Ans. I never saw the property after it was taken, and do not know how
                    it was used.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11. Ans. I asked the soldiers not to take the Stallion, but they persisted
                    in doing so. I made no other complaint.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12. Ans. I asked for no receipt.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13. Ans. The property was taken about 12 o'clock in day time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14. Ans. Gen<sup>l</sup>
                    Hunter was encamped at Staunton distant 5 miles. The Army had been encamped
                    there 3 or 4 days I think. They left the day following the taking of my
                    property. There had been a battle at Piedmont, in Augusta Co. on Sunday
                    previous. I knew no names of any officer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15. Ans. The Stallion was 4 years old, of good size, in fine order. He rode
                    finely and worked well. I think he was worth $200. The soldier that rode him
                    said was worth it. The bay Mare was 6 years old, in fine order and of
                    medium size, well broken and worth $100. The Grey Mare was 14 years old she was
                    in good condition, had a Colt at her side which I kept and raised. She was well
                    broken and worth $65. The Heifer was 3 years old, very fat. The Calf was 6 weeks
                    old, a very large and fine Calf. They were worth what is charged. I had measured
                    the Corn &amp; Rye (mixed) when I put it in the garner, and there had none
                    been taken out. It was well worth $1 per bushel. I recieved no pay at all.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Lewis Hill</p>
                <p>Answer to first question. My name is Lewis Hill, my age is 38 years. I resided
                    near Staunton Va. and am a laborer. I am a colered man and belonged to Samuel H. Bell, Swopes
                    Depot, Augusta Co. I was present and saw the property was taken by Union
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3. Ans. The Stallion was in the Stable, and the bay &amp; grey Mares
                    were in the field, the Corn &amp; Rye was in the Mill.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4. Ans. It was in June and I think 1864. I know Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter was then camped at Staunton. There was a large Cavalry company
                    present all round the Stable at the time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5. Ans. The Claimant and family were present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6. Ans. There were officers present. I did not hear names or rank. I did
                    not hear any orders given.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7. Ans. The property was taken as I have described.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8. Ans. The Stallion was rode and the Mares were led, and the Heifer and
                    Calf were drove off. The Corn &amp; Rye was carried in sacks.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9. Ans. I suppose the property was taken to the camp. I did not follow to
                    the camp.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10. Ans. I do not know what use they made of the property.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11. Ans. The claimant asked them not to take his property but the soldiers
                    said that they always took such good stock when they found it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12. Ans. I saw no writing given.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13. Ans. The property was taken in day time, about 10 olock I think.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14. Ans. The Army was encamped at Staunton, about 6 miles away. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter was
                    commander. They were in camp 3 or 4 days. There had been a battle at Piedmont on
                    Sunday before a few miles below Staunton.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15. Ans. The Stallion was young, fat, &amp; fine I think he was worth
                    $200 or more. The bay Mare was worth $75 and the grey about $60. I did not know
                    the ages. The Heifer was very fat and I suppose I would have weighed 350 lbs.
                    The Calf was large. I guess there was 45 bush<sup>l.</sup> Corn &amp; Rye. I did not see it
                    measured.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>John W. Gladwell</b>
                <p>Deposition of John W. Gladwell</p>
                <p>Answer to first general question.</p>
                <p>My name is John W. Gladwell, my age is 45 years. I reside near Staunton. My
                    occupation a Shoemaker. I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in
                    the claim. I have known the claimant 15 years. I resided about two miles from
                    him. I saw him frequently nearly once a week. We conversed about the War. I was
                    opposed to the rebellion and the claimant knew my position. I have often heard
                    him denounce secession and say that he hoped or wished the Union might prevail.
                    I have heard him converse in the presence of other Union men and he was at all
                    times the same firm Union man. I think he had the confidence of his Union
                    neighbors. I never heard his loyalty doubted. I never knew him to do anything to
                    aid the rebellion. I know that he give all the aid he
                    could to Union men to keep  the rebellion. I do not think if the South had
                    gained an independence the claimant could have proven any loyalty to the
                    Confederate Government. I have often heard him say that if the war should so
                    terminate he would have to leave, and I do not think he could have remained in

                <p>Deposition of Joseph H. Bailey</p>
                <p>Answer to first question.</p>
                <p>My name is Joseph H. Bailey, my age is 31 years. My occupation a farmer. I reside
                    near Staunton, Va. I am not related to the
                    claimant nor have no interest in the claim. I have known the claimant about 15
                    or 16 years. I lived about 3/4 mile from him during the war. I was very intimate
                    with him, and saw nearly every day. I was a Union man myself nad known such by
                    the claimant. I talked with him often about the war and he was always opposed to
                    it. He said that he would never be forced to fight against the United States. As
                    far as I know his reputation among Union man was that of a true loyal Union man.
                    I never knew him to do anything in aid of the rebellion. He was private to all
                    the plans of Union men, who were escaping the Confederate service. I never
                    doubted his fidelity to the Union. I believe he was as good a Union man as was
                    in the country. I heard of threats being made to his wife by rebel soldiers who
                    were in pursuit of him. From my knowledge of the claimant he could not have
                    proven any loyalty to the Confederate States, if they had succeeded. I do not
                    think he ever did anything to favor the rebellion by his own free will and
                    accord.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Harvey Gladwell</b>
                <p>Deposition of Harvey Gladwell</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> general question.</p>
                <p>My name is Harvey Gladwell, my residence near Arbor Hill, Augusta County. My age
                    is 26 years by occupation a shoemaker. I am not related to the claimant and have
                    no interest in the claim. I had a slight acquaintance with the claimant about
                    the commencement of the war. I lived about one mile from him a part of the war.
                    The war had progressed for some time. I do not recollect of having any
                    convesation with the claimant about the war until in the fall of 1864. I then
                    heard him say that he did not intend to fight in the war and he made the
                    impression on my mind that he was a Union man. I could as a loyal man myself
                    confide in him and he never deceived me. I never heard his Union sympathies
                    doubted by the Union men of the neighborhood though there were but very few of
                    that class in the neighborhood. I do not know that he ever did anything for
                    either the Union or rebel cause. From the fact of his escape and concealing
                    himself from the rebel authority I do not think he could have proven loyalty to
                    the South, if it had succeedd its gaining independence.</p>
