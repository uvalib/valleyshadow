<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>William Gibson</b>
                <p>William Gibson a witness introduced by the Claimant to prove the taking of the
                    property being first duly sworn answereth as follows.</p>
                <p>Quest Witness says - I saw all the articles specified in the claimant's petition
                    taken</p>
                <p>4 Witness says - The articles mentioned in the claimant's petition were taken
                    from his farm about the 7th of June 1864 they were taken by soldiers under Genls Averill's and Crook's command</p>
                <p>8 Witness says - I don't know whether the horse was rode or led the cattle were
                    driven</p>
                <p>11 Witness says - I heard no complaint to any officer on account of such taking</p>
                <p>12 Witness says - I don't know that any receipt was asked for or any given</p>
                <p>13 Witness says - It was taken in the daytime none of it was taken secretly</p>
                <p>14 Witness says - The night before they were encamped near there the next day
                    they came to Staunton Virginia. I knew none of the officers.</p>
                <p>15 Witness says - the horse was a young horse and in good condition the cattle
                    were in good condition - I think the horse was worth what the claimant has
                    charged in the petition also the cattle. I think the rifle was worth twenty
                    dollars I do not know much about the other gun.</p>
                <p>22 Witness says - I suppose that the property was taken for some purpose so
                    necessary that the Government ought to pay for it</p>
                <p>23 Witness says - I suppose it was taken by some officers or soldiers who had
                    authority to take it the soldiers said they had orders to take all property that
                    could be used to break down the Confederacy.</p>
                <p>Questions by the Commissioner</p>
                <p>Quest 1 How long have you known the claimant</p>
                <p>Answer I have known him ten years I saw him often after 1863 he seemed to be
                    loyal to the United States during the war and was so regarded by his neighbors
                    and to the best of my belief he was loyal to the United States during the war. I
                    never knew him to do anything against the United States Government I never knew
                    him to do anything for the Confederate Government - he was too loyal to the
                    United States Government to have been considered a loyal man to the Confederacy
                    if it had been maintained as a separate Goverment</p>
                <p>Quest 2 How old are you where do you reside and what is your occupation</p>
                <p>Answer I am forty two years old I reside in Augusta County Virginia by occupation
                    a farmer</p>
                <p>Further the witness saith not</p>

                <p>Quest 1 How old are you where do you reside and what is your occupation?</p>
                <p>Answer I am forty years old I reside in Augusta County Virginia by occupation a

                <p>Quest 2 How long have you known the claimant</p>
                <p>Answer I have known the claimant eight years - I saw him often during the war I
                    talked to him about the war he was loyal to the United States during the war and
                    was so regarded by his neighbors - I never knew him to do anything for the
                    United States except to harbor a few deserters from the Confederate Government
                    except what he was forced to do - I think he was too loyal to the United States
                    to have been considered loyal to the Confederacy if it had been maintained as a
                    separate Government further the deponent saith not August 17th 1871</p>
