<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Mr. Anderson resided on his farm near Staunton Va.
                    during the war. He had two sons in the Confederate service but he swears he did
                    his best to get them to leave the Confederacy. He swears strongly to his own
                    loyalty-&amp; is sustained by the testimony of Mr. N.K. Trout the Mayor of
                    Staunton &amp; by one Daniel O'Rourke. -At the close of the War he was
                    appointed by Genl. Canby Pres. of the Commrs of Election
                    and Justice of the Peace for Augusta.</p>
                <p>On the whole we incline to hold him loyal; tho' not without hesitatation.</p>
                <p>The evidence to show taking is the Claiment claimant's &amp;
                        his daughter Mary. Mary seems like a fair &amp; honest witness,
                    but her testimony gives no amounts of articles taken. She testifies only to Corn
                    "taken in wagons," "bacon," "oats" The phrase "some Corn" is too indefinite to
                    found any allowance upon. The party must prove his case-all indefinite testimony
                    is to be taken ag<sup>t</sup>.
                    him. It is fair to presume he would prove a better &amp; more definite claim
                    if he could.</p>
                <p>The black horse, Item 2, seems to be proved. As corn was taken in wagons, we may
                    allow for two wagon loads-though it is very slender proof; but a voucher for
                    Corn in the Ear sustains it. "Bacon," "Oats" too indefinite for any allowance.
                    Rifle gun-probably stolen-no authority. Item 5. bags not proven. Items 9
                    &amp; 10-The horse seems to have been an old one &amp; not fit for
                    Cavalry service. Colt 3 yrs old &amp; not fit for Cavalry use. We can not
                    think such animals taken by Authority for the use of the Army.</p>

                    was all the property. I think Corn, was worth a dollar a bushel, being a lady I
                    do not know the prices of such property, but I would think that the charges
                    named in the petition were fair and reasonable.</p>

                    far as I know his neighbors so regarded him. I regarded him as truly loyal to

                    to prove his loyalty to the U.S. Government
                    being duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>1<sup>st</sup> Witness says I am 52 years old. I reside in
                    Staunton, Va. By profession a lawyer and Mayor of
                    the City. I have known the claimant 30 years, I talked with him often during the
                    war, and he was an avowed Union <sup>man</sup>, never
                    concealing his sentiments to any one. And was so regarded by all who knew him
                     opinions in that he was so bold in expressing his sentiments that he
                    could not have established any claim of loyalty to the Confederacy, had it
                    succeeded. Further this deponent saith not.</p>
