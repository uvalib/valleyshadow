<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The claimant is about 55 years of age and a farmer. He resided in Augusta Co.Va. during the war.
                    When this case was first submitted the testimony was so badly taken that we
                    required an investigation and further testimony. The testimony has been
                    furnished. Mr. Myers was opposed to secession, and when the ordinance of
                    secession was submitted to the people he did not vote on the question. His son
                    was conscripted and being sick he purchased a substitute for him and sent him
                    north into the federal lines to escape conscription. He rejoiced at Union
                    victories and is regarded by all his Union neighbors as having been a constant
                    and consistent Unoin man. The rebels took his property but paid him nothing.</p>
                <p>The battle of Piedmont occured June 5, 1864 about one mile from claimants
                    premises. The next day June 6 the claimants property was taken. The horses and
                    the corn clearly for army use. The quantity of corn is not certain. The field of
                    grain was wheat which was just heading out and the cavalry horses were turned
                    into the field and trampled it down. For the pasturing we can make a small
                    allowance. The flour and molasses must be charged to depredation. No vouchers or
                    receipts were given.</p>
                <p>We recommend the payment of $615</p>

                <p>Ques. 14<sup>th</sup>. Witness says. They were coming to
                    Staunton, Va., where they remained not more than
                    week, there was a battle fought at Piedmont on the 5<sup>th

                <p>Ques 15<sup>th</sup>. Witness says that the horses were in
                    pretty good condition and I think the charges made by the claimant are
                    reasonable and fair. They were all young horses. </p>
                <p>Ques. 19<sup>th</sup>. Witness says that they were taken for the

                <p>Ques. 20<sup>th</sup>. Witness says they were taken for the use

                <p>Ques. 21<sup>st</sup>. Witness says. I suppose they were ordered
                    to take them.</p>
                <p>Ques 22<sup>nd</sup>. Witness says. I do think the Government
                    ought to pay for them.</p>

                <p>Questions asked by the Commissioner</p>
                <p>Question 1<sup>st</sup>. How long have you known the claimant?</p>
                <p>Ans. Ever since my infancy and I have known him to be a loyal man. I saw him
                    often during the war, and lived near him and know that his sympathys were with the Union all the time. He fed
                    the Union soldiers during the time they were about his house, I never knew him
                    to aid the Confederate Government, I never knew him threatened on account of his
                    Union sentiments. He never owned any Confederate bonds. He was regarded a Union
                    man by his neighbors.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2<sup>d</sup>. Do you know any act done, or language used
                    by the claimant, which would have prevented him from establishing his loyalty to
                    the Confederacy if it had been maintained as a seperate Government. If so, state the same particularly.</p>
                <p><u>Ans</u>. He was such a good Union man that he could not
                    have maintained his loyalty to the Confederacy.</p>

                <p><u>Ans</u>. The horses were in good condition and I think
                    worth all charged for them. I know that the army took corn. I suppose about the
                    quantity specified, but I do not know what Corn was worth by the bushel, they
                    pastured their horses on the wheat and carried Corn from the barn and fed it in
                    the wheat field--but I do not know how much. I think they took a barrel of flour

                <b>David Myers</b>
                <p>My name is <u>David Myers</u>, my age <u>54</u> years, my residence <u>Augusta County</u>, in the
                    State of <u>Virginia</u>, and my occupation a <u>Farmer</u>; I am related to the claimant,
                        and have beneficial interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>I did not see any of the horses charged taken. I did see the Corn grain, Flour,
                    and sorgham molasses taken. These items were all taken on the 6<sup>th</sup> day of June 1864 from my farm near this place.
                    The Corn was taken out of my granary, by a portion of Genl. Hunter's Army. They were going towards Staunton. They
                        said I was at the house an officer came and
                    toldasked me that if I had Corn. I told him I
                    had a little; he said they were obliged to have grain for their horses, and they
                    turned their horses into my wheatfield and came to the barn and carried the corn
                    out. They fed it right there, I saw then they had been feeding it. They left no
                    receipt for it. They got 25 bus. I knew I had put
                    25 bus into the granary and I had used none of it
                    and they took it all, the last grain. I was there and insisted on their leaving
                    us some, but they didn't do it. They carried the corn away in my sacks. They
                    took 12 or 15 sacks to carry it away. They did not return the sacks. The sacks
                    were cotton and were not worth more than 25 cts a piece. Corn was worth at that
                    time $1.- per bus in specie.</p>
                <p>The grain charged was growing wheat, just out of bloom. they turned the cavalry
                    horses in on it and pastured it there some 21 acres in the field and it was
                    pretty full of them. It looked to me like it was full. They were in the field
                    about 2 hours, I don't know the number of horses. There must have been a
                    regiment at least. The wheat was good. It was a good season. It would have made
                    at least 15 bus, to the acre. Wheat standing in the
                    condition mine was at that time was worth $1 per bushel. I cut the corner a
                    small portion of one of the fields about an acre. The horses were hungry and
                        eat rapidly. they destroyed by tramping about one
                    third of as much as they eat.</p>
                <p>The flour charged was taken out of a barrel in my corn cub. They carried the
                    flour away in their Horses sacks. It was a full barrel. They knocked the head of
                    the barrel in an took it all. They stopped then but for a short time.
                    They carried the flour away with them. I don't know where they took it. The
                    flour where was then worth $8 per barrel. They said they were hungry
                    and were obliged to have the flour to eat.</p>
                <p>The sorgham they took at the same time. I think they filled their Canteens with
                    it. They took some of the molasses. They said they were obliged to
                    have something to eat. The molasses was in a finkin in my
                    spring house. There was 12 Galls in the
                        Finkin and they took it all. I was
                    worth $(50 cts) fifty cents per gallon. The battle was of Piedmont
                    was fought the day before about a mile from my house. I got no receipts for any
                    of the property charged. I never thought about a receipt. Officers said the saw
                    the soldiers taking the property. I don't think they tried to prevent them from
                    taking it. No one is interest in this claim
                    from but me. Further saith not.</p>

                    taken from the clt, one was good size Bay horse 6

                    sorrel mare worth $75 she was about 12 yrs old. They they were all
                    round--in good condition, large, they had no brands on them. I don't think any
                    officers were present when the horses were taken, the horses were taken from my

                    I am a farmer. I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in this
                    claim. I saw five horses belonging to the claimant taken by General Hunter's
                    army in the month of June 1864. The horses were in the barnyard of the stable
                    where they were taken. There were several soldiers present--but I don't know
                    whether there was an officer with them. I heard them say they wanted the horses
                    for the artillery service. One horse was a bay about six years old and worth
                    $200. One was a black mare. I don't know how old, worth about $130. One was a
                    bay mare about three years old, worth about $130. One was a brown mare. I don't
                    recollect how old worth about $120. The claimant was not present when the horses
                    were taken. The soldiers said they had a fight the day before and their horses
                    were broken down and that they needed these horses to supply their place. I knew
                    the horses well and worked them and knew their condition and am thus able to

                    wheat was growing in the head and didn't lack much of being ripe. It was a good
                    crop, I think it would have made 20 bushels to the acre. I saw it the day after
                        the day after the Ar the Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's army moved by, It was

                    which they didn't get over so much--it was pretty tolerable good. The wheat was

                    the claimant by marriage on his wife's side but have no beneficial interest in
                    the cliam. I lived about one mile from the claimant during the war and saw him
                    frequently and talked with him about the war and I always regarded him as a true
                    Union man doubted or questioned by any of his neighbors. I do not recollect any
                    language used by claimant, but have no hesitation in saying that he was a strict
                    union man. I never knew him to do anything to aid the Confederacy except he was
                    compelled to do. The rebels had no confidence in him. I was a Union man myself
                    and the claimant knew it. I am satisfied that had the rebels succeeded in
                    gaining an independent government, the claimant never could have proven any
                    loyalty to that government.</p>

                <p>Answereth--</p>
                <p>My name is John A. Stover, my age is 31 years, my residence near New Hope Augusta
                    County. occupation a farmer. I am not related to the claimant. I resided about
                    ten miles from the claimant during the war. I saw him frequently, but cannot say
                    how often during the time. I heard him talk frequently and always in favor of
                    the Union and its cause. I remember when I was about starting through the lines,
                    that he advised and encouraged me to go, and concealed me at his house until
                    everything could be fixed for my departure. I left in 1864. had never been in
                    the rebel service. I joined the 6th Ohio Regiment, Co. M, under command of
                    General Sheridan. To the time I left I never had heard of the claimants unionism
                    doubted. I believe he was strictly and truly a Union man and he was so regarded
                    by his neighbors. I know that he has acted with the Union party since the
                    surrender and acted as a Justice of the Peace under military rule in this
                    county.</p>
                <p>I have heard him express himself since, and know that he has worked and voted for
                    the Republican party.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Henry K. Eakle</b>
                <p>Deposition of Henry K. Eakle, taken in Staunton,
                    Va. November 5th, 1874, in behalf of David Myers of Augusta County
                    Virginia who being duly sworn answers as follows. My name is Henry K. Eakle, my
                    age is 55 years, my residence near New Hope in Augusta county, and occupation a
                    farmer. I have known the claimant, David Myers, all my life. I lived one mile
                    from him during the war and saw him very frequently during the war, and talked
                    frequently about the war with him, and am satisfied that his sympathies were
                    always with the Union. He appeared to be pleased when news would reach us of the
                    probability of the Union Army coming to our section, and when General Hunter's
                    did come, he seemed delighted and was releaved and
                    pleased with the result of the battle at Piedmont. I never heard his loyalty
                    doubted by the Union men of the neighborhood, and was regarded as a Union man my
                    the rebels of the neighborhood. The prominent Union men of that neighborhood,
                    were Charles Batis, Martin and Saml. Garber, Isaac Coffman and myself, with
                    others. I never knew the claimant to do anything for the Confederacy, except
                    what he might have been compelled. I have no hesitation in saying that I believe
                    he was strictly loyal during the war, and that since he has sustained the
                    Government by his votes and influence. He served as a Justice of the Peace,
                    under the military rule, which none but union men could do. My own record as a
                    Union man was and is well known in my section of the county.</p>
