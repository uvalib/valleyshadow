<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Jacob Myers,
                            September 4, 1872, Claim No. 2557</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Myers claimed $460.00 worth of provisions, for which he provided a receipt. The
                    Commissioners of Claims, however, disallowed his claim because he gave
                    insufficient proof of his loyalty to the United States. Myers appealed this
                    decision to the Congressional Court of Claims, apparently unsuccessfully.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The Confederate Archives (War Dept) show that
                    this Jacob Myers was a supporter of the Confederacy furnished supplies to
                    Confederacy &amp;c &amp;c</p>
                <p>Claimant swears to his loyal sympathies and his opposition to secession. Didn't
                    vote at all on the adoption of the ordinance of secession. Sent his sons North
                    to keep them out of the Rebel Army.</p>
                <p>Calls his brother and another witness who swear that he was opposed to the war
                    and in favor of the Union. The brother thinks the fact that he sent his sons
                    North unequivocal indication of loyalty. The other witness don't know of his saying or doing any thing inconsistent with
                    loyalty to the Confederacy. Claimant himself admits to
                    receiving a pass from the Confederate Army at Staunton.</p>
                <p>We do not regard the fact that he sent his sons North to keep them out of the
                    Rebel Army any indication of loyalty. If he had sent them North to join the
                    Union Army it would make a different case. We are not satisfied with the
                    evidence of loyalty and therefore reject the Claim.</p>

                <p>It is hereby certified, that on the 4 day of September 1872, at New Hope, in the
                    County of Augusta and State of Virginia, personally came before me the following
                    persons, viz: Jacob Myers, Claimant, and Sarah C. Miller, Isaac S. Myers Thomas

                    Commissioner of the Commissioners of Claims</p>
                <p>My name is Jacob Myers, my age is 54 years, my residence Staunton, in the State
                    of Virginia, and my occupation a farmer</p>
                <p>To question No. 2 he answers, Where I now reside near Staunton, Va. Did not
                    change my residence or occupation during that time. I was farming on my own
                    land, it contained about 400 acres. 300 acres of that were under cultivation.</p>
                <p>To question nos. 3 to 24 inclusive he answers no in full to each question
                    separately put</p>
                <p>To questions 25 he answers, The Confederates called on us tolerably early in the
                    war to furnish so many horses. In common with my neighbors I delivered one horse
                    to the Confederate authorities at New Hope, Va., received payment for him
                    Confederate money. They afterward got another horse from me in the same manner,
                    but never paid me for it. The Confederate army encamped on my farm and used my
                    oats and hay &amp; pasture. I got no pay for any of it. I never furnished
                    anything voluntarily for the Confederate army or navy.</p>
                <p>To question Nos. 26 and 27 he answers no in full to each.</p>
                <p>To question No. 28 he answers no, except to aid my two sons and others to get
                    away to the North.</p>
                <p>To question Nos. 29 to 37 inclusive he answers no in full to each.</p>
                <p>To question No. 38 he answers, At one time during the war I went to Staunton, Va.
                    I do not remember what for, and I acquired a pass from the Confederate
                    authorities there to return home.</p>
                <p>To question No. 39 he answers no.</p>
                <p>To question No. 40 he answers, At the beginning of the rebellion I sympathized
                    with the Union Cause. I felt that the South was wrong and would get whipped. I
                    did not say but little. I exerted my influence for the Union cause and voted the
                    Union ticket. I did not f vote for or against the ratification of the
                    ordinance of secession. After the ordinance of secession was adopted I still
                    adhered to the Union cause.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the Commissioner, as to property taken. I was
                    present and saw all the property charged in my account taken. It was all taken
                    on the 6<sup>th</sup> 7<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> &amp; 9<sup>th</sup> days of
                    June 1864 by Gen. Hunter's army. The
                    sorrel horse was taken as the army went up toward Staunton. It was in
                    the stable. The soldier who took the horse arrested a Confederate soldier at my
                    house &amp; they said they wanted the horse for the prisoner to ride. I dont
                    know whether there was an officer with them. There were four or five soldiers
                    present when the horse was taken. I did not ask for a receipt &amp; did not
                    get any. I went to Staunton Va to next day to get him back, but I could not find
                    him. While I was there I had a talk with an officer who told me that they needed
                    horses &amp; had to have them. The horse was three years old fast and worth
                    $150. He was a good army horse &amp; in fine condition. My sheep, cattle,
                    flour and bacon were taken on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of June
                    1864 by the same command. It was all gotten by an officer named Thompson, who
                    gave me a certificate or receipt (the certificate is here exhibited &amp; is
                    appended marked "A".) The sheep were good for mutton and would have made about
                    one hundred pounds each, gross. There were ten of them. They were driven away.
                    The seven head of cattle were stock cattle, some heifers and some small ones. I
                    do not know how much they would have weighed, either gross or net. The lot, on
                    the hoof, was worth $105. They were also driven away. The one barrel of flour
                    was in my storeroom and it was carried out in bags
                    by the soldiers. There was not less than a barrel taken. Flour was then worth
                    about $100 per barrel. The 75 pounds of bacon was in my
                    smokehouse and it was carried out by the soldiers. I estimated it at 75 pounds.
                    Bacon was worth 66 2/3 cts per lb. All the property was taken by the officer
                    named-Thompson-who had men with him &amp; who removed the property. The gray
                    horse was taken on the 9<sup>th</sup> day of June 1864 by some
                    soldiers of I think Gen. Averill's command. The
                    horse was in the stable and some men and a Lieutenant came and got the horse. I
                    protested against it, but I could do nothing to prevent it. He said he must and
                    would have the horse. The horse was a gray, a fine horse and was four years old,
                    and was worth $200. I followed the horse and found him at one of my neighbors,
                    but could not get him back. I did not ask the officer for a receipt for the
                    horse, and he did not give me any. Further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>Sarah C. Miller, witness to prove property taken, being affirmed and examined by
                    the Commissioner, says:</p>
                <p>I 27 years old and reside in New Hope, Augusta County, Va. I am a daughter of the
                    claimant and have no interest in his claim. I saw two horses, some flour and
                    bacon taken from my father by Gen. Hunters army
                    during the war. It was just after the battle of Piedmont. The one horse-a
                    sorrel-was in the stable when taken. He was taken by six soldiers, I don't know
                    whether any officer was with them. I heard them say that they took the horse for
                    to take a Rebel prisoner to Staunton. I reckon the horse was something over
                    three years old. This was on the 6<sup>th</sup> day of June, I
                    think. I saw the same men take an iron gray horse belonging to my father on the
                    Thursday following. This horse was in the stable when taken. There were a good
                    many soldiers present. I dont think there was any officer with them. All I heard
                    them say was that they intended to take the horse. The horse was about four
                    years old. I think the sorrel was worth $150, and the iron gray $175.
                    I saw a foraging party, a couple days after the sorrel horse was taken, take
                    some flour and bacon from my fathers house, but I do not remember what amounts
                    there were. I think there was an officer present. I do not remember hearing
                    anything said at the time. This is all I know about it. Further deponent saith
                    not.</p>

                    claimant and have no interest in his claim. I lived about seven miles from the
                    claimant during the war and saw him frequently. I talked with him very
                    frequently in regard to the cause and progress of the war. He always spoke in
                    favor of the Union Cause and was opposed to the rebellion. I dont remember that
                    I heard him express himself in the presence of others. I was a Union man and the
                    claimant so regarded me. I knew what his reputation was, it was that of a Union
                    man. He was regarded a Union man by his loyal neighbors. I never knew him to be
                    injured or molested on account of his Union sentiments. I never knew him to own
                    any Confederate Bonds. I never knew him to render any aid or assistance to the
                        rebelUnion cause. I never knew him to render any aid
                    or assistance or to sustain the credit ofto the
                    Confederate cause. He sent his sons North to keep them out of the Confederate
                    army, and I think this would have rendered him unable to prove his loyalty to
                    the Confederate government if it had succeeded in maintaining a separate
                    existence. Further the deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim, and in their report state:--</p>
                <p>"Claimant swears to his loyal sympathies and to his opposition to secession.
                    Didn't vote at all on the adoption of the ordinance of secession. Sent his sons

                    army it would make a different case. We are not satisifed with the evidence of
                    loyalty, and therefore reject the claim</p>
                <p>The Confederate archives, War Dept. show that this Jacob Myers was a supporter of
                    the Confederacy, furnished supplies to the Confederacy, etc."</p>
                <p>The claim was transferred to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, March
                    10th, 1895.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Sept. '72.</p>
                <p>JACOB MYERS testifies: Age 54; residence Staunton, Va., farmer; am the claimant.
                    (P. 1). I did not change my residence or occupation during the war. Questions 3
                    to 24 answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. The Confederates called us
                    tolerably early in the war to furnish so many horses. In common with my
                    neighbors, I delivered one horse to the Confederate authorities at New Hope,
                    Va., and received payment for it in Confederate money. They afterwards got
                    another horse from me in the same manner, but never paid me for it. The
                    Confederate army camped on my farm, and used my rails, hay and pasture. Got no
                    pay for it. Never furnished anything voluntarily, for the Confederate army.
                    Questions 26 and 27 answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. Did nothing
                    except to aid my two sons and others to get away to the North. Questions 29 to
                    37 inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. (P. 2). At one time
                    during the war I went to Staunton, Va. Don't remember what for. Received a pass
                    from the Confederate authorities there and to return home. At the beginning of
                    the rebellion I sympathized with the Union cause. Felt that the South was wrong
                    and would get whipped. I did not say but little. I exerted my influence for the
                    Union cause, and voted the Union ticket. I did not vote for or against the
                    ratification of the ordinance of secession. After the ordinance of secession was
                    adopted, I still adhered to the Union cause. (P. 3).</p>
                <p>ISAAC S. MYERS testifies: age 49; residence New Hope, Va. Brother of Claimant,
                    not interested. Lived about seven miles from the claimant during the war. Saw
                    him frequently. Talked with him very frequently, in regard to the cause and
                    progress of the war. He always spoke in favor of the Union cause and was opposed
                    to the rebellion. I don't remember that I heard him express himself in the
                    presence of others. I was a Union man and the claimant so regarded me. I knew
                    what his reputation was. It was that of a Union man. So regarded by his loyal
                    neighbors. (P. 7). Never knew him to be molested or injured on account of his
                    Union sentiments. Never knew him to own any Confederate bonds. Never knew him to
                    render any aid or assistance to the Union cause.. Never knew him to render any
                    aid or assistance or to sustain the credit of the Confederate cause. He sent his
                    sons North to keep them out of the Confederate army, and I think this would have
                    rendered him unable to prove his loyalty to the Confederate Govt. if it had been
                    successful.</p>
                <p>THOS. J. GILBERT testifies: age 56; residence 4-1/2 miles from Staunton, Va. Not
                    related, or interested. Lived about a mile and a quarter from the claimant
                    during the war, except about one year, from May '64, when I was a refugee. I (P.
                    8). Talked with him in regard to the cause and progress of the war. He expressed
                    himself as a loyal man. I know his public reputation for loyalty. It was that of
                    a loyal man. I think he was regarded a loyal man by his loyal neighbors. I was a
                    loyal man, and the claimant so regarded me. I never knew him to own any
                    Confederate bonds, or do anything to sustain the credit of the Confederacy.. I never knew him to be injured or molested on account of
                    his Union sentiments. I know that he was a good friend to loyal man. Never knew
                    him to aid either army in any way. I know that he sent his son North to prevent
                    him from being conscripted into the rebel army. I know of no act done, or
                    language used that would prevent him from proving his loyalty to the Confederate
                    Govt. if it had succeeded in maintaining a separate existence. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the claim was referred to the Court.
                    In Nov., 1895.</p>
                <p>JOHN A. HARRIS testifies: Farmer; age 52; residence Annex, Va., Not interested or
                    related. (P. 1). I knew the claimant prior to and during the war. I lived within
                    a mile of him and saw him often. I was a blacksmith during the war, and did a
                    great deal of work for him. I talked with the claimant frequently on the subject
                    of the war, and he was always favorable to the Union. Claimant was regarded by
                    every one who knew him as a Union man. I don't think he made any special secret
                    of his Union sentiments. There was no change in his sentiments to my knowledge.
                    I went through the lines myself, and he furnished me money to get away. He sent
                    two of his sons through the Confederate lines to keep them out of the
                    Confederate army. (P. 2). He was a member of the United Brethern church. I have always been told by members of that church
                    that no man owning slaves could be admitted to membership. Claimant never had
                    any middle name that I heard of, and he never lived outside of the New Hope
                    voting precinct. Claimant never lived at Mr. Solon
                    precinct, and he always spelt his name Jacob Myers.
                    He did not serve in the Confederate army. Claimant's voting precinct was New
                    Hope or Staunton. He lived about half way between New Hope and Staunton, and
                        couldn have voted any where else. I know he couldn't establish
                    his loyalty to the Confederacy, had it been successful. (P. 3).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>New Hope polls is 18 or 20 miles from Shenandoa.
                    Don't think New Hope precinct is over five miles from Mt. Sidney Polls. Claimant
                    lived about four or five miles from New Hope Polls. Claimant's place was between
                    six and eight miles from Mt. Sidney polls. I am not able to say whether a man
                    could vote at his precinct or elsewhere at the election on secession. Claimant
                    was living about half way between New Hope and Staunton, so far as my knowledge
                    goes, I don't know, but I have been told this morning by a gentleman who lived
                    on the farm adjoining Mr. Myers, that they could vote at either place. I had a
                    great deal of business transactions with him during my life, and he always
                    signed his name Jacob Myers. Think claimant was about 45 years old at the
                    breaking out of the war.. I think he was over age at first,
                    until they got to taking them over forty-five. (P. 4). I think this is the way
                    he kept out of the army, but I don't know positively. About all I know he done
                    was to send his sons away and aided others to get away from this section, that
                    is from where they could be conscripted. I never heard him talk about the
                        successed of the South in battles. I never heard him express
                    himself as to victories. I mean to say that Mr. Myers was a Union man. I mean a
                    man who was opposed to secession. During the war he was a farmer staying at
                    home. I don't know if claimant was conscripted, but I rather think he was. You
                    see I was only 18 years old, the year the war broke out, and he never said much
                    to me about things like that. He was at the blacksmith shop frequently and
                    talking to my father about the war. As to his being conscripted, I think he was,
                    after they drafted men over 45. (P. 5) He never was in the war to my knowledge.
                    He was not detailed to any sort of work.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>I have heard these conversations, and he always expressed himself opposed to the
                    war. My father died in '63 and I continued the business. I done claimant's work,
                    and he was at the shop often, and he was always opposed to the war. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>LEVI MYERS testifies: Age 69; residence Laurel Hill, Va., Not interested or
                    related. (P. 7). I was acquainted with the claimant prior to and during the war,
                    and lived in sight of him. I saw him nearly every day and had conversations with
                    him about the war. He expressed himself as against secession. He was against
                    their going out of the Union, and wanted to see the Union successful. He never
                    was in the Confederate army. When the soldiers were first called out he wasn't
                    quite over age, and then he was exempt by the board of examiners; it was only a
                    short time after the out break of the war before he was 45 years of age. He was
                    generally known in the community as a Union man. He did not make any special
                    secret of his Union sentiments He sent his sons through the lines. He belonged
                    to the United Brethern Church. (P. 8). It was
                    against the church's doctrine to be a slave holder. I don't think the claimant
                    voted on secession. New Hope was his voting precinct at that time. I never heard
                    of his having a middle name. He always wrote his name Jacob Myers. I have seen
                    him write his name, and I have got some of his papers now I reckon with his name
                    signed. He spelt his name Myers. I know a man that
                    lived at Sherando of the name of J.S. Myers. He was another man entirely, not
                    the claimant. I can't tell exactly as to Mount Solon. There was a family of
                    Moyers living in that part of the county. Mt. Solon is not less than 15 miles
                    from the home of the claimant. The I.C. myers who voted
                    for secession at New Hope precinct was a cousin of Jacob Myers, the claimant.
                    (P. 9). I.C. Myers, and the claimant voted at the same place.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Mr. Myers and myself brought produce to Staunton during the war to sell. I sold
                    none to the Q.Ms. Don't know what Myers did. When I sold to the people they paid
                    me in Confederate money. There was little difference between Mr. Myers and me. I
                    had to sell to the Q.M. and Mr. Myers was not bound to sell to them. He sold
                    wherever he could. I was part of the time a detailed farmer, and had to sell my
                    produce to the army. He wasn't detailed (P. 10). When he sold he sold wherever
                    he could, while I had to sell to the Q.M. We often brought our hay down
                    together.</p>
                <p>The attention of the witness is called to a receipt of Mr. Myers for $1500 worth
                    of hay, and he says he must have sold that to the Q.M., but I know he always
                    sold to other parties whenever he could. That his reason for not
                    selling to the Confederate Q.M. was that he couldn't get the money. I know Wm.
                    J. Nelson. He was the finest kind of a man. Mr. Myers bought Mr. Nelson's farm.
                    Knew each other very well, were friendly, and I suppose that was how he happened
                    to sell him the hay if he sold it. Mr. Myers was friendly and on good terms with
                    his old friends who were in the army. (P. 11). I remember about his sending
                    horses to New Hope. There was a general order issued for every body to report to
                    New Hope, how many horses each had. He and I reported there. The judge decided
                    we could keep four or five horses and bring one horse to New Hope. So he brought
                    the one horse to New Hope and kept the other four, and so did I. The Judges were
                    from the neighborhood. Everything about the transaction was in a friendly
                    manner. Judges and ourselves recognized it as a matter of duty, and abided by
                    what they done. Claimant had no brother or relatives in the Conefderate army
                    that I know of.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>The friendly relations of Mr. Myers and Nelson was because they were old friends
                    and neighbors. (P. 12). Mr. Myers would have got himself in trouble had he
                    refused to report the number of horses he owned, in compliance with the order
                    issued to that effect. (P. 13).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims found as facts that the claimant's sympathies were
                    with the Union cause. That he did not vote on the ordinance of secession and
                    sent his sons North to keep them out of the rebel army. Notwithstanding these
                    facts they were not satisfied with the evidence of loyalty. Based their adverse
                    action mainly upon the report of the War Dept. of Confederate vouchers for
                    supplies, etc.</p>
                <p>Mr. Myers was undoubtedly a Union man throughout the entire war and gave no aid
                    to the rebellion, except what he was forced to do. He was 43 years old in '61,
                    residing at Staunton, Va., farming. He aided not only his two sons, but others
                    to go North. He did this to keep them out of the rebel army.</p>
                <p>His witnesses also testify that he aided others to get away to prevet their being
                    conscripted in the Confederate service.</p>
                <p>The effort to show that this claimant voted for secession has failed. He did not
                    vote for secession. There were other men in that county of the same name. His
                    conversation through the entire war was favorable to the Union cause. He was
                    regarded by all his neighbors loyal and disloyal as a Union man.</p>
                <p>I do not see how a doubt can be reasonably entertained as to Jacob Myers loyalty
                    throughout the entire war.</p>

                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The evidence is correctly abstracted in claimant's brief on loyalty.</p>
                <p>Claimant in his testimony (page 2 claimant's brief) says that he did not furnish
                    any supplies to the Confederate Government, except a horse which he was ordered
                    to furnish and another which was taken from him by force.</p>
                <p>The C.S. Archives
                    show by vouchers which will be produced at trial of the case that he furnished
                    and was paid for nearly $2000.00 worth of supplies. The manner in which these
                    supplies were furnished is explained in the testimony of Levi Myers (pp. 7 to 9
                    claimant's brief).</p>
                <p>In view of these facts the claimant should be declared by the Court to have been
