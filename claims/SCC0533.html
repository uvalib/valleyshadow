<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The clm<sup>t</sup>. was a

                    to put him in the reserves. He got a pass to go home &amp; with it went
                    through the lines to West Va &amp; Ohio
                    &amp; staid North till the close of the war. Two

                <p>Ques 1. Witness Says: I saw the property mentioned in my petition taken. I was
                    present, was taken from my farm in Augusta Co.V<sup>a.</sup> in June 1864 by
                    Soldiers of Gen<sup>l</sup>.
                    Hunters Army. There were two Soldiers who took the property. My son, Saml. D. Stover, my daughter &amp; wife saw the
                    property taken. There was no officer present. The horse was taken from the
                    plough in my field. The sheep were in my field near the house. The horse was led
                    away &amp; the sheep were carried off on horses. The property was taken in
                    the direction of the camp, at Staunton V<sup>a</sup>. The soldiers said they had orders to
                    take all horses they could find. I tried to get him to leave the horse but it
                    did no good. I made no complaint to any officer. No receipt was given and none
                    asked for. The property was taken in the day time. The army was encamped at
                    Staunton 2 or 3 days. They left the day after they took my property. The
                    property was all in good condition when taken.</p>
                <p>Item #1 I saw a horse taken 5 years old, worth $150.</p>
                <p>Item #2 I saw 2 grown sheep taken, were fat worth $4 each.</p>
                <p>I am the sole owner of this claim. Have never been paid for it, &amp; never
                    presented it to any Departments of the government, &amp; nothing was left in

                    regarded him as a union man. He was so regarded I think by his neighbors. I
                    don't know that he ever did anything for the Confederate Government. Nor for the
                        U.S.Govt.
                    He left V<sup>a</sup>. &amp;
                    went north. I think he went to keep out of the Army. Don't know that he was ever
                    threatened because he was a Union man. Don't know that he owned any Confed. bonds, or to support Confederate credit.
                    Don't know how he voted on the ordinance of secession. Don't know that he ever
                    gave any information to Union Officers as to the movement of the Confederate
                    Armies. I think he was in the Union lines when Genl. Lee surrendered. I don't know what he would have done had the

                    would go North. I heard men say they saw him in the North. Don't remember what

                    on the farm of the claimant. The sheep were in the next field, on the same farm.
                    It was during the War I don't remember the year. They were taken by U.S. Soldiers. Don't know whose command they
