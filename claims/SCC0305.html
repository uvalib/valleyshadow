<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>This claimant is 51 years of age and is a farmer &amp; has resided in Augusta
                    Co. Va for 24 years - he swears that he was subject to conscription &amp;
                    put in a substitute to keep out himself - Says he assisted parties to escape
                    into the Union lines &amp; gave them money for that purpose - does not name
                    them or detail the circumstances - Had three brothers in the Confederate Army -
                    gave them food &amp; money "the money belonged to my brother." He was never
                    arrested or molested on account of his Unionism - In the beginning he
                    sympathized with the Union Cause, but does not remember whether he voted for the
                    Ordinance of Secession or not -</p>
                <p>Daniel M. Craun is called as a witness - he is 37 years of age &amp; had
                    known the claimant all his life <u>thinks</u> he was loyal
                    &amp; so regarded by his neighbors - says the claimant furnished him
                    &amp; his family with gold to go through the Union lines &amp; furnished
                    others in the same way - What relationship Daniel M. Craun is to the claimant we
                    do not know.</p>
                <p>Wm Evans is also called as a witness. He says the claimant was regarded as a
                    Union man, but states no facts - this witness was absent in the west about 15
                    months - Neither of these witness states whether he himself was loyal.</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the proof of loyalty &amp; reject the claim.</p>
