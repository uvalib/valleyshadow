<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Benjamin T. Bagby,
                            August 3, 1872, Claim No. 15503</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Bagby's claim for 16 horses and 3 cattle was disallowed on the grounds that he
                    served in the Home Guard and sent a substitute into Confederate service. He
                    appealed this decision to the Congressional Court of Claims in 1892, when he was
                    again found disloyal.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>This claimant, when he filed his petition ought to have known he was entitled to
                    no pay through this commission. He resided in Augusta Co. Va. &amp; was
                    within the conscript age. In 1864 he was in the rebel Home Guard for two months
                    he was employed in the manufacture of horseshoes for the Confederate government.
                    The Confederates paid him for property they took from him. We would the more
                    readily believe him when he says his service in the Home Guard &amp; the
                    putting a substitute in the Confederate Army were compulsory, only, that he
                    swears he never was in the Qr. Master service in the Confederate Govt. and his
                    own witness Tinsdale swear that "he was quarter master", and he further swears
                    he "neither voted for nor against the ordinance of secession" while the record
                    of the votes in Augusta Co. shows that he voted for the adoption of the
                    ordinance.</p>
                <p>Mr. Bagby was disloyal &amp; the claim is disallowed.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Benjamin T. Bagby</b>
                <p>My name is Benj. T. Bagby, my age 43 years, my residence Staunton V<sup>a</sup>., in the State of Virginia, and my occupation a
                    Contractor; I am the claimant, and have a beneficial interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>Ques 2. Witness says, I resided during the war on my farm in Augusta Co. Va. My
                    farm contains 400 acres. I had about 200 acres in cultivation. I did not leave
                    the State during the war.</p>
                <p>3 No in full</p>
                <p>4 Witness says, I don't recollect that I took any oath of Allegiance to the
                    Confederate Govt.</p>
                <p>5 Witness says, I took the amnesty oath after the war. Never asked for a pardon.</p>

                <p>Witness says, I was forced out as one of the home guard, about the 25 of May 64.
                    I got back home about the 25 of June 64. I rendered no immediate service
                    &amp; was one of the home guard contrary to my wishes.</p>
                <p>13 Witness says, I was conscripted in the Rebel service &amp; furnished a
                    substitute to keep out. I don't think my substitute ever went into the Army, he
                    deserted from Richd. Every man from 18 to 45 years old was subject to military
                    duty, &amp; had it to perform or leave the State. I think it was quite a
                    difficulty to get to the Union lines, during the war.</p>
                <p>15 Witness says, I was never in the Qr. Mr. service in the Confed. Govt.</p>

                    month in 1865. My substitute had failed to keep me out of the army, &amp;
                    the detail was the last resort to keep out of the army, &amp; I got it for
                    that purpose.</p>

                    and corn, Wheat &amp; bacon, paid for some of it in Confederate money. I
                    received no pay for the horses.</p>

                <p>40 Witness says, I was opposed to secession, voted in 1860 for S.A. Douglas, for
                    Presdt. of the U.S. regarding him as a National man. I also voted for the Union
                    Candidates to the Convention, which passed the ordinance of secession. I neither
                    voted for nor against the ordinance of secession. After the Ordinance of
                    secession was adopted, like every one else in Va. I was compelled to go with my
                    State.</p>
                <p>41 Witness says I never did anything voluntarily for the Rebel cause, what
                    service I rendered the Confederate Govt. was through extreme necessity, being
                    forced to do so. And further this deponent saith not.</p>

                    value of his property</p>
                <p>Ques 1 Witness says, I did not see the property taken, mentioned in my petition.
                    I was in the home guard at the time. The property was on my farm, 16 horses
                    &amp; three cattle, When Genl. Hunter came to this place, &amp; they
                    were not there when he left. There was no one  them. They were taken by
                    Genl. Averills command, in June 1864. A large no. of soldiers were engaged in
                    taking the property, so I was informed. Five or six of my colored people were
                    present, Hardy, Jim, Harry &amp; Fountain. I do not know whether any officer
                    was present or not. I made no complaint. No receipt was asked for &amp; none
                    given. The property was taken in the day time, I think the army was on the march
                    in the direction of Lynchburg, when my property was taken. The property was all
                    taken from my farm. The horses were all in splendid condition, were from 4 to 7
                    years old. I had sixteen taken, I was speculating in horses, &amp; this lot
                    were selected, &amp; were of no 1 quality. They would have made good
                    Artillery horses, were large draught horses. My colored people told me when I
                    came home that they were put in the artillery service of the U.S. Government.
                    The horses, were worth 150$ each, before and since the war, &amp; would
                    bring it now. I had taken at the same time 3 beef cattle, by Genl. Averills
                    soldiers, were 2 years old, in very good condition, would have weighed about 800
                    lb each or so, worth about 24 cents per the gross. I have never been paid for
                    the property, &amp; have never applied for pay before. I received nothing in
                    exchange. I am the sole owner of the claim. And further this deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>Ques 1 Witness says I am 33 years old I reside in Augusta Co. Va. I am a
                    speculator in horses. I was not present &amp; did not see the property taken
                    mentioned in the claimants petition. I was there the day the property was taken.
                    Saw the horses removed to the woods, &amp; cattle also, the property was on
                    the farm of the claimant when it was taken, it was there when Genl. Averills men
                    came on the farm it was not there when they left there was no one else to take
                    them. I think this was in June 1864. Mr. Bagby's Colored men were present when
                    the property was taken. The whole of Genl. Averills command passed through the
                    claimants farm, &amp; must have taken the horses, there was no one else to
                    take them. The horses were all in first rate condition. I don't know their ages,
                    but they were all young horses. I boarded with the claimant &amp; knew the
                    property well &amp; had owned &amp; used some of them. They were worth
                    $150 to $200 each, &amp; would bring that now. He had 3 beef cattle taken at
                    the same time were 2 or 3 years old, don't know their weights or value. All this
                    property belonged to the claimant. He has never been paid for it so far as I

                    Lived near him during the war, &amp; saw him nearly every day. I had many

                    opposed to going into the war than any man I ever saw. Said he would spend all
                    the money he had rather than go in the Confed. Army He always said he was
                    opposed to the ordinance of secession. He said, I was as good a Union man. I
                    heard his neighbors curse him &amp; say he ought to be in the Confederate
                    Army. He did nothing for the Confederate Army voluntarily so far as I know he
                    was compelled to go in the home guard. I know he had a detail to make horse
                    shoes for the Confederate Government, to keep him out of the army. He told me he
                    furnished a substitute to keep out of the Rebel army. He was out in the home
                    guard only a short time, &amp; <u>then he was Quarter
                        Master</u>. He did nothing for the U.S. Govt. so far as I know. I don't
                    know how he voted on the ordinance of secession. I don't know that he owned any
                    Confederate bonds, nor did anything to support Confederate credit. I don't know
                    that he gave any information to Union officers as to the movements of the
                    Confederate armies. I the witness was a Union man all the war. He helped a
                    deserter from the rebel army to avoid detection, by the provost guard. I suppose
                    he would have stayed here had the South gained its independence. And further

                    said he ought to be sent in the rebel army. I know he didn't want to go in the

                    reputable farmers, near Fisherville P.O. on the L. &amp; O. R.R. midway
                    between this City Waynesboro. From all I can gather this case was kept secret,
                    and the sub-agent (Mr. H. Ken) of Howmer &amp; Smith was the clerk in
                    recording the testimony. Mr. Bagby is a gentleman of wealth, and he and I are
                    members of the same church. I mention this last to show that I am not activated
                    by any feeling of hostility to him.</p>

                    John J. Christian, a colored man of this City, whose claim is likewise
                        filed &amp; No. 7987
                    is considered by the colored men here as being the Agent of disloyal
                        whites. They say that it was rumored that a good deal of Tobacco, Etc. was
                        deposited with him, thinking that as he being a colored man, the Union
                        Officers and soldiers would not molest them.

                    I shall make more enquiries and keep you posted.

                <p>P.S. I am almost daily receiving letters of enquiry in regard to the preparation
                    of claims. I think it a great pity that the limit for the presentation of claims
                    had not been a later date than the 3<sup>d</sup> March. A great
                    man worthy me will fail to get their petitions in by that day.</p>
