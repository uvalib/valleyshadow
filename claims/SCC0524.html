<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of William W. Hailey,
                            1875, Claim No. 19,511</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                William W. Hailey filed this claim in 1875 for $215, claiming Union forces under
                    General Hunter took two horses and a saddle in 1864. William was 74 year old
                    farmer near Sherando. In 1863, Confederate soldiers from Georgia carried him 10
                    miles from home and threatened to hang him before turning him loose. He helped
                    his sons hide in the mountains and eventually flee to the Union in order to
                    escape Confederate Service. The commission allowed $200.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Mr. Hailey is 74 years old-a farmer &amp; has lived on the same place 65
                    years near Sherando in Augusta Co.Va. In '63 soldiers from Georgia arrested him,
                    threatened to hang him, carried him off 10 miles, &amp; turned him loose. He
                    appears to have had the reputation of being a Union Man. Mr. Joseph H. Rankin
                    testifies decidedly in his favor. He refers to several of his neighbors. -We
                    incline to find him loyal.</p>
                <p>The two horses were taken by Genl. Hunter's troops
                    in July 1864 when on the march from Staunton they crossed the Blue Ridge.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Joseph H. Rankin</p>
                <p>My name is Joseph H. Rankin, my age is 33 years, my residence near Stuart's Draft
                    in Augusta County. I am a farmer. I am not related to the claimant, and have no
                    special interest in the claim, except as a neighbor. I testify in behalf of the
                    claimant.</p>
                <p>53 Ans. I have known the claimant twenty or twenty five years. I have known him
                    intimately all that time.</p>
                <p>54 Ans. I lived about 1/4 mile from him during the war.</p>
                <p>55 Ans. We met often, sometimes every day.</p>
                <p>56 Ans. I often conversed with him about the war. I have heard him say that he
                    did not care how soon the Union Army would come, and that he hoped they <sup>(or it)</sup> would come. And he was invariably opposed to
                    the rebellion and secession.</p>
                <p>57 Ans. I know that he kept his sons out of the Confederate Army, by hiding them
                    in the Mountain, and finally sent them through the lines.</p>
                <p>58 Ans. I never knew him to do anything against the Union cause.</p>
                <p>59 Ans. I never heard anything said against his loyalty to the Union.</p>
                <p>60 Ans. His reputation was that of a Union man. I never a word to the contrary. I
                    know his sentiments by my often talking with him on that subject, and also
                    hearing from his neighbors.</p>
                <p>61 Ans. My father David Rankin, Henry Dedrick &amp; Jacob Furr. They could
                    all testify to his loyalty.</p>
                <p>62 Ans. I was an adherent of the Union cause, and so regarded by the claimant.</p>
                <p>63 Ans. I heard of treats. he was arrested at one time by some rebel soldiers and
                    carried away <sup>a</sup> short time distance and
                    then turned loose.</p>
                <p>64 Ans. He never could have proved any loyalty to the Confederacy by me.</p>
                <p>I know nothing of the taken of the property charged. I know that the claimant was
                    the rightful owner and that they horses were good and valuable. I think they
                    were worth more than he has charged for them. The Saddle was good one, and worth
                    $15 or $18.<sup>00</sup>.</p>

                <p>72 Ans. I was present when the property was taken, and saw them when taken. There
                    were a large number of Soldiers present. The horses were taken from the field,
                    and Saddle from the house. The horses were rode away. They were marching toward
                    the mountain and came from the direction of Staunton. I did not hear any
                    officers name mentioned.</p>
                <p>73 Ans. It was about 2 or 3 Oclock in the evening. I heard nothing said at all
                    about the taking of the property. They were Cal Cavalry and
                    Artillery.</p>
                <p>74 Ans. There was no complaint made, that I heard.</p>
                <p>75 Ans. I heard of no receipt.</p>
                <p>76 Ans. My father has never received anything in payment for the property. This
                    is the only claim that he has ever presented.</p>
                <p>77 Ans. There was no encampment. They were marching. There was a skirmish two or
                    three miles from our house. They told us they had a fight at Piedmont a few days
                    before.</p>
                <p>79 Ans. The bay horse was a good animal and so was the Mare, and the Saddle was a
