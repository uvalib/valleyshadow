<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>This claimant was a resident of Augusta Co. Va. As early as the spring of 1861,
                    he took the oath of allegiance to the Confederate government. He belonged to a
                    military company &amp; the oath was required to be taken by each member of
                    that company. When the ordinance of secession was submitted to the people of the
                    state of Virginia he voted for its adoption, did so because he was told "his
                    property would be saved." He gives no satisfactory reason for either his oath or
                    his vote. His loyalty is not satisfactorily proved and the claim is
                disallowed.</p>

                    Horse named in the petition, being duly sworn answers as follows</p>
                <p>Ques. 1<sup>st</sup> Witness says. I am 59 years old, I reside
                    in Augusta Co. Va. I am a farmer. I was very near when the horse named in the
                    petition was taken. I saw him taken. He was taken in September 1864, from the
                    field of the Claimant by U. States soldiers,
                    belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's command. John Casaday
                    was present with me at the time.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup> Witness says - I do not know that there was any
                    officer present at the taking.</p>
                <p>7<sup>th</sup> Witness says the horse taken was a sorrel, I
                    suppose about 10 years, he was in good condition every way - The soldiers led
                    him away. I do not know where he was removed.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup> Witness says I do not know the use the horse was
                    taken for. I never saw him after he was taken from the field - There was no
                    complaint made that I know of.</p>
                <p>12 Witness says There was no receipt taken or asked for, so far as I know. I
                    heard no conversation in relation to it at all.</p>
                <p>The horse was taken in the day time, publicly in the afternoon. There was no
                    encampment near the claimant - there had been no battle or skirmish near. I did
                    not know, or hear the name of any quarter master or other officers except
                    General Sheridan.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup> Witness says the horse was in good condition
                    about 16 hands high - I think the horse was worth $125 or $130 - he was a good
                    horse.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness says. I believe the horse was taken for
                    the use of the Army, alone. I suppose there was a necessity for the horse.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup> Witness says - I think that the Government ought
                    to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup> Witness says I believe it was taken under and by
                    authority.</p>

                    about 40 years. I live very near him - I saw him often during the war, and
                    talked with him on the subject, and I regarded him all the time a good Union
                    man, and all his neighbors regarded him so.</p>
                <p>I know that he left the Confederacy and went to the Union lines. I don't think he
                    ever aided the rebellion, except what he was forced to do.</p>
                <p>I think he was too loyal to the U.S. Government, to ever have been regarded as
