<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Andrew J. Palmer,
                            March 11, 1873, Claim No. 19,860</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Palmer's claim was disallowed by the Commissioners because he was on record as
                    having voted for the ordinance of secession. Palmer appealed this decision in
                    1895 but refused to answer questions about his vote.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The claimant was a resident of Augusta Co. Va. He says he was a Union man loyal
                    to the Federal Gov't. His witnesses state
                    substantially the same thing. They were Confederates &amp; knew Palmers
                    Union sentiments yet he does not appear to have been in any way disturbed on
                    that account. His brothers were in the Confederate Army &amp; he was
                    conscripted &amp; escaped by going west to avoid military service.
                    Confederates took his property &amp; paid him "in scrip." He swears that he
                    did not vote on ratifying the ordinance of secession. The record is against him
                    A.J. Palmer of Augusta Co. is recorded as voting for the ordinance. The claim is
                    disallowed.</p>

                    against the United States to the end thereof, my sympathies were constantly with
                    the cause of the United States, and that I never of my own free will and accord
                    did anything or offered or sought or attempted to do anything by word or deed to
                    injure said cause or retard its success and that I was at all times
                    ready if called upon, to aid and assist the cause of the Union or its
                    supporters, so far as my means and power and the circumstances of the case
                    permitted.</p>
                <p>Testimony in regard to taking the property. Same witness.</p>
                <p>Ques 1 Ans. I was present and saw my flour, Corn &amp; Wheat was

                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. The Flour, Corn and Wheat was taken out of the Mill. There was an
                    Officer who took the articles from the Mill, and he said that there provision
                    train had been cut off, and they were obliged to have it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. I think it was about the 7<sup>th</sup> of June
                    1864. I do not know the Officers name, he said he was from Massachusetts. There
                    were a number of soldiers in the Mill, and engaged in handling the Articles</p>
                <p>Ques. 5 Ans. Samuel Mays, now dead, was present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. There was an Officer who ordered the property to be taken. I think
                    he was a Colonel, and belonged to Genl. Hunter's Army was then in charge of
                    prisoners captured at Piedmont, and marching Westward. He said that they needed
                    the provisions.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7 Ans. The Flour was rolled out in barrels &amp; some put in bags. The
                    Corn &amp; Wheat put into bags and a part thrown loose into the Wagons</p>
                <p>Ques. 8 Ans. Removed in Wagons.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. The Command was then Marching in the direction of Parkersburg W. Va.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I do not know, except the Officer told me he needed them for his
                    men.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. I told the Officer that I ought to have a receipt, and he told me
                    if I would take the oath, he would give me one, but I declined for the reason,
                    that I could have no protection after they left.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12 Ans. I got no receipt for the reason stated above.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. It was day time, probably 8 or 9 A.M.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. The nearest Camp was at Staunton, about 6 1/2 Miles distant. They
                    had been in Camp Two or three days. The battle at Piedmont by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter, was the Sunday previous, I knew no
                    Quarter Master.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. My horse was in a grass field about two miles from my house, and
                    about 1/2 mile from the road. He was a black bay 4 years old, of good size, and
                    fat, well broken to the Saddle and harness, and sound. He was worth $150 in
                    gold. The flour I had refused $10 a barrel for it, only a few days previous, in
                    gold, by W.W. Donaghe. The Wheat was sound and good, I think there was more than
                    the quantity charged I did not measure it. I did not measure the Corn either,
                    but judged the quantity by the piles. I received no pay.</p>

                <p>Deposition of James Perry</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> general question. My name is James
                    Perry my age is 50 years. My residence Near Augusta Springs. My occupation a
                    Shoe Maker. I am not related to the Claimant.</p>
                <p>I was not present when the horse was taken, but saw him in possession of a
                    soldier, about 1 1/2 mile from the field where the horse was pasturing. I said
                    nothing to him about the horse. I think he had a saddle, though I am not sure.
                    The Soldier that was riding the horse was in rear of the command. I did not hear
                    him say whether he belonged to the command or not. His dress was that of a
                    soldier. I do not live on the main road, but he I expect he joined the Command
                    in about 1 1/2 miles from my house. The command was a part of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army, in charge of prisoners taken at
                    Piedmont. I know nothing of the taking of the Wheat, Flour &amp; Corn. The
                    horse was a bay. I do not know his age. I now recollect that he was 4 years. He
                    was in fine plight and really a good horse. The horse was worth any where $150.</p>
                <p>Deposition as to Loyalty. Deposition of Same Witness.</p>
                <p>Answer to first general question, I have known the claimant since 1856. I lived
                    about two miles from him during the War. I was intimate with him during the War.
                    I saw him very frequently, and talked about the War. He (the Claimant) was
                    always a strong Union man, and invariably against rebellion. He said he would
                    never to into the rebel Army. He knew I was a Union man. I do not recollect that
                    I heard him express himself in the presence of others. The Union men of the
                    neighborhood had full confidence in his sincerity as a loyal man. He did all he
                    could for Union Men, he went through the lines in 1864, and did not return until
                    after the surrender. I know he could not have proven any loyalty to the South.
                    He told me the night he left for the West, that if the rebels succeeded, he
                    would not live in it.</p>

                    Acord, my age is 54 years. My residence is Staunton, Va. My occupation is a
                    Carpenter. I am not related to the claimant and have no benefit. I have known
                    the claimant since 1849 &amp; intimately since 1856. We were intimate during
                    the War. I lived about 1/2 mile from him. I saw him often, every day We talked
                    about the War, and he was always opposed to the Southern Confederacy, and in
                    favor of the Union. I have heard him talk in the presence of Union men and he
                    was always the same. I never heard any of the Union men of the neighborhood his
                    being strictly a Union man. I know he could not have proven his loyalty to the

                    to do so. I was then &amp; am now a Miller. Capt. Roberts Avis of
                    the Provost guard sent his guard after me in July 1864 and arrested me &amp;
                    brought me to Staunton, tried me &amp; sent me to Richmond. I went before
                    Maj Peyton &amp; was assigned by him to Co. "E" 1<sup>st</sup> Va Cavalry, with a ten days furlough but never returned to the company,
                    but immediately went through the lines &amp; remained there until after the
                    war. Hunters Army took from me only one horse worth one hundred and fifty
                    Dollars, 70 bushels of corn worth one Dollar a bushel, 8 bls flour worth ten
                    Dollars a barrel &amp; 6 bushels of wheat worth two Dollars per bushel
                    Aggregating $312 &amp; I have never been paid for the same. And further this

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>James F. Bell</b>
                <p>Jas. F. Bell being next duly sworn deposes &amp; says</p>
                <p>To question numbered 1 The witness answers, Jas F Bell is my name. I am 46 years
                    old. I live nine miles from Staunton in Augusta County Va. &amp; have lived
                    there all my life. I am a farmer.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 2 The witness answers, I am not the claimant &amp; am no
                    relation of his nor am I in any way interested in the success of the claim</p>
                <p>To question numbered 52 The witness answers, I am here to testify in favor of AJ
                    Palmer the claimant.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 53 The Witness Answers, I have known A.J. Palmer about 20
                    years &amp; have known him intimately all of that time.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 54 The witness answers, I lived near him during the war,
                    until he left the State. Only about  miles from him</p>
                <p>To question numbered 55 The witness Answers, I met him frequently during the war,
                    about once in two weeks.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 56 The witness answeres, I talked with the Claimant, almost
                    every time I met him during the war, about its causes, its progress, &amp;
                    its results. The only occasion that I can now recall, in which any thing was
                    said of more importance than the ordinary conversations we had about it (the
                    war) was in 1864 I think, when the sale of a horse for Confederate money brought
                    about the Conversation. I was about to sell my horse when Mr Palmer remarked
                    that he would not sell property for Confederate Money. He said he did not think
                    Confederate Money would ever be worth any thing &amp; the impression on my
                    mind if he did not say so in so many words, that the Southern Cause would fail.
                    This conversation occured in Swoopes Mill near where I live. No one else was
                    present when it took place.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 57 The witness answers, I know that when he was called out
                    during the war to enter the army, he said he would not go, refusing positively
                    to go &amp; gave as a reason that he was opposed to the war &amp; was
                    opposed to secession. That he did not think the states had a right to secede
                    &amp; I know that afterwards when he was arrested &amp; taken to
                    Richmond, he left &amp; immediately went through the lines</p>
                <p>To question numbered 58 The witness answers, I know of nothing done during the
                    war against the Union Cause.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 59 The Witness answers, I never heard any thing for or
                    against it.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 60 The witness answers, He had the public reputation of
                    being loyal to the United States. I heard different men say he was loyal
                    &amp; I remember hearing a Confederate Captain, Francis Roberts say he was
                    loyal to it Union &amp; cursed him for it. Jas. Lisley, Henry Mish, David
                    Fauber, Geo. W. Swoope and many others can testify to his loyalty to the Union.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 61 The witness answers Jas Lisley, Henry Mish &amp;
                    David Fauber were prominent loyal men (to the Union) during the &amp; can
                    testify to the loyalty of A.J. Palmer.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 62 The witness answers I was not a Union man during the War
                    but was in the Confederate Service</p>
                <p>To question numbered 63 the witness answers, I do not know of any such
                        charges</p>
                <p>To question numbered 64 The witness Answers I do-His going off &amp; his
                    frequent Confiscations</p>
                <p>To question numbered 65 The witness answers His refusal to take up arms against
                    the Union, his leaving of the Confederate States &amp; going west in the
                    Federal lines &amp; his frequent Conversations with me</p>

                <p>P.O. Palmer a witness of lawful age being next called to testify, after being
                    first duly sworn by the undersigned Special Commissioner deposes and says</p>
                <p>To question numbered 1 The witness answers, My name is P.O. Palmer. I am 74 years
                    &amp; 6 months old. My residence is Valley Mills in Augusta County Va. I
                    have lived there since 1842. I am a general mechanic.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 2 The witness answers I am uncle to the Claimant. I am not
                    at all interested in the success of the Claim.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 52 the witness answers I am here to testify in favor of A.J.
                    Palmer.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 53 the witness answers I have known the claimant intimately
                    since his infancy</p>
                <p>To question numbered 54 the witness answers, The claimant lived a part of the
                    time during the war in my house say about two years; certainly not less. The
                    rest of the time he lived about 2 1/2 miles from me.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 55 the witness answers He was right under my Eye during the
                    time he lived with me &amp; after that I saw him every two or three weeks
                    until he left the state.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 56 the witness answers, I frequently talked with him during
                    the war about the war, its causes, its progress &amp; its results &amp;
                    in every sentiment he breathed nothing but Union principles.
                        Cant mention any particular conversation, but will
                    say that the Cause of most of our conversations sprang from the fact that we
                    disagreed about War entirely. He being a Union man &amp; I a secessionist.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 57 the witness answers When the Confederate Authorities
                    tried to press him into service, he refused to serve &amp; hid himself
                    &amp; afterwards went throug the lines I believe, for I never saw him
                    afterward until the close of the war</p>
                <p>To question number 58 the witness answers, He always declared that secession was
                    wrong &amp; that there was no necessity for it. He talked a great deal on
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 59 the witness answers I have very frequently, every day
                    during the war heard him say there was no cause for the war, that it was useless</p>
                <p>To question numbered 60 the witness answers, He had the public reputation of
                    being loyal to the United States during the War. I heard almost every body in
                    the neighborhood speak of it &amp; speak of it publicly-Jno Brown, Jas. W.
                    Calhoun, WW Taylor Henry Eilson &amp; others of less note can testify as to
                    his loyalty.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 61 the witness answers Jas. Lisley, Rev. Geo. A. Shuey could
                    testify also to his loyalty</p>
                <p>To question numbered 62 the witness answers I was a secessionist</p>
                <p>To question numbered 63 witness answers I do not know of any such threats
                    &amp;c</p>
                <p>To question numbered 64 witness answers I do. His leaving the Country &amp;
                    crossing the lines together with many acts previous to leaving &amp; his
                    frequent conversations with me</p>
                <p>To question numbered 65 the witness Answers He always said he would not aid or
                    abet the Confederate cause &amp; always stated that he was not in sympathy
                    with the Confederate Cause. I think I have stated substantially what I know

                    for 20 years. I knew him intimately from the beginning of the war up to the time

                    conversation that I had with the claimant about the war, but from his character
                    generally it was believed by every one that knew him well that he was opposed to
                    the war &amp; that he stated to me (I remember) that he never intended to go
                    into the Confederate Army, but if I never talked with him about the
                    war when I could avoid, because our views on that subject were entirely

                    six months old. I live at Valley Mills Augusta Co. Va. Have lived there since
                    1842. I am a mechanic in general.</p>

                <p>To question numbered 72 the witness answers, I was present when all of the
                    property was taken &amp; actually saw it taken except the bay mare mentioned
                    in the claim as bay horse. I saw corn taken about 75 bushels. I saw 8 or 10
                    barrels of flour taken. I know some wheat was taken tho dont know how much.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 73 the witness answers, All the property was taken in the
                    day time &amp; openly that I saw taken, except the horse which I did not see
                    taken. I was the owner of the mill in which the property was stored
                    when taken</p>
                <p>To question numbered 74 the witness answers, I myself did make complaint to an
                    officer but dont remember his name rank or regiment. He
                    said he could give me no protection &amp; paid no attention
                    whatever to my complaint</p>
                <p>To question numbered 77 the witness answers, The troops were on the March, just
                    after the battle at Piedmont in Augusta County</p>
                <p>To question numbered 78 the witness answers, Didn't see bay horse taken. I saw
                    corn taken. I saw flour taken. I saw wheat taken.</p>
                <p>To question numbered 79 the witness answers The corn was shelled &amp; stored
                    in a garner in my mill. It was about 75 bushels. I got the amount from my books.
                    The claimant was my miller &amp; entitled to one third of the tolls. The
                    corn was good merchantable corn. I think the corn was worth a dollar a bushel as
                    near as I can state it. It was in June 1864. It was Hunters Army but cant give
                    any more particulars, for I dont remember. The corn &amp; wheat was taken
                    &amp; put into sacks &amp; put into wagons &amp; hauled away
                    &amp; the flour was rolled out in barrels &amp; hauled away in wagons.
                    There were from 12 to 18 wagons, but dont know how many men. They were about two
                    hours in cleaning out the mill. The moved west ward. I know not where. Officers
                    were present &amp; I knew it by their dress. Have been a military officer
                    myself. One of the officers directed matters as to the removal of the property.
                    I cant give his name or the name of any one of the officers. Dont know whether

                <p>Andrew J. Palmer vs. The United States, No. 8870 Cong.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the late war of the
                    rebellion.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim, and in their report to Congress
                    state:--</p>
                <p>"The Claimant was a resident of Augusta Co., Va. He says he was a Union man,
                    loyal to the Federal Government. His witnesses state substantially the same
                    thing. They were Confederates and knew Palmer's Union sentiments, yet he does
                    not appear to have been in any way disturbed on that account. His brothers were
                    in the Confederate army, and he was conscripted and escaped, going West to avoid
                    military service. Confederates took his property and paid him in scrip. He
                    swears that he did not vote on ratifying the ordinance of secession. The record
                    is against him. A.J. Palmer of Augusta Co. is recorded as voting for the
                    ordinance of The claim is disallowed."</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, March
                    28th, 1892.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>While the claim was pending before the Commissioners the following testimony was
                    taken in March '73 [the next 6 pages are a summary of testimony contained in
                    original claim]</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken since the reference to the Court, in Oct. 1895.</p>
                <p>JOS. B. TRIMBLE testifies: farmer; age 75; not interested or related. (P. 1).
                    Known claimant since long before the war. Saw him quite frequently during the
                    war, lived about five miles distant. He was the miller at Valley Mill. Talked
                    with him several times just before the war, expressed himself as a Union man all
                    the time. Had a loyal reputation. When the war commenced it was not injurious to
                    a man in his business to carry himself openly on the Union side, but after the
                    war went on a little, a man in that position was looked on as sort of a traitor.
                    Not many votes cast for secession then. Don't know how he voted, but he was a
                    Union man. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>Never heard that he refused to grind grain for the Confederates. He went through
                    the lines, but don't know how long he was away. Suppose he went because he
                    didn't want to fight against the U.S. Govt. Don't know of his conscription, but
                    know he didn't serve. Don't know of his helping the Confederacy. Nor about
                    threats. He would have had difficulty proving his loyalty to the Confederacy.
                    Everybody knows he was just the other way. (P. 3). He continued a Union man all
                    the while.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I was a Union man. After the war began, couldn't go against Via. Don't know how
                    long claimant was in the Confederate army. Giving as a reason why he went north,
                    witness states, I reckon he didn't want to fight at all. Suppose he could have
                    voted against secession if he wanted to. Don't think he would have been
                    troubled. (P. 4). Said he was running a mill for Mr. Swop and told Mr. Swop, if
                    he would buy the grain he would grind it for the Confederates, who would come
                    and get it, from the mill which he was running for Mr. Swop in Third shares, but
                    that he knew the mimll would have been burned if took in grain from the
                    Confederates, so he made Mr. Swop get the grain, and bring it to the mill as his
                    own. That after he left the mill was burned. When he left the swop meill, he
                    went to work for his uncle. That he ground the Confederate Govt. grain, that his
                    uncle had in his mill when he arrived, but kept his uncle from letting the
                    Confederates deposit his grain at the mill, and so saved his uncles mill. Mr.
                    Swop was regularly engaged in securing and grinding wheat for the Confederates.
                    (P. 5).</p>
                <p>J.E. MAYSE testifies: Age 67 not related or interested. (P. 6). Known claimant
                    all my life, neighbors during the war. Expressed himself as a Union man opposed
                    to the war. Loyal reputation. Thinks to some extent rendered a man unpopular and
                    injured his business to be known as a Union man in that community Nearly every
                    body voted for secession. I was opposed to secssion. Claimant not in the
                    Confederate army. (P. 7). He went through the lines. Didn't return until after
                    surrender. Suppose he went away to avoid fighting against the Union. He was a
                    strong Union man. Never knew of his doing anything to aid the Confederacy. Would
                    have had great difficulty in proving his loyalty to the Confederacy, as he was
                    known to be just the opposite, and a Union man.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>E.J. WAYLAND testifies: Farmer; age 47; not interested or related. (P. 9). Known
                    claimant all my life. Lived in same neighborhood, often saw him. Had
                    conversations. Always expressed himself as a Union man. Known as a Union man
                    among both Confederates and Union men. It is a fact that a good many Union men
                    voted for secssion because of outside pressure. Very unpopular not to do so.
                    Know one man in neighborhood was threatened. with tar and feathers for voting
                    against secession. A man was austercised to a
                    great extent, who openly declared himself for the Union. (P. 10). Claimant not
                    in service. They attempted to press him in. He left at once, went through the
                    lines. Did not return till war closed. Always thought he left because he wanted
                    to avoid bearing arms against the U.S. Govt. As a miller he refused to grind
                    grain for the Confederacy. Did nothing to aid the Confederate side. Think it
                    would have been very difficult for the claimant to establish his loyalty to the
                    Confederacy. (P. 11).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>He told me he refused to grind for the Confederates. The mill was right in the
                    neighborhood. More Confederates got grinding there than other people. That is
                    individuals, but he refused to grind for the Confederate Govt. My whole
                    testimony is not derived from what claimant told me lately. He told me in time
                    of the war that he had refused to grind for the Confederacy. He did grid for
                    Confederates. (P. 12). Was at the mill two or three times a week, often heard
                    him say that he wouldn't grind Govt. grain, because he didn't believe in the
                    cause, and was afraid the mill would be burned if he did. I wasn't in the army,
                    but wanted to see the Confederacy succeed. He had a brother in the mill with
                    him. Don't know about his brother going into the army. (P. 13). He could have
                    remained in that neighborhood and not acted as a Confederate sympathizer. The
                    only man that voted against secession lived there till he died, after the war.
                    You (referring to the attorney) asked claimant's attorney to allow you to
                    cross-examine the claimant as his witness and he refused to do so. Claimant was
                    friendly with all his neighbors during the war. Heard claimant just say that old
                    Jim Calhoun didn't like him because he didn't favor secession. but they were
                    always friendly.</p>
                <p>SUMMARY</p>
                <p>The claimant was living in Augusta Co., Va., at the commencement of the late war.
                    He was 31 years of age in '61. He was a miller. He was not connected with the
                    services of the Confederacy. He was conscripted, but did not furnish a
                    substitute. His sympathies were with the Union all the time. He gave no aid to
                    the rebellion. He did not vote on the ordinance of secession. His witnesses
                    testify to loyal reputation and loyal expressions throughout the war. He left
                    the Confederate states and went into the Federal lines for protection. The
                    testimony to loyalty is very strong throughout the war</p>

                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>This claim, from Augusta County, Georgia, was
                    rejected by the Commissioners in the following report:</p>
                <p>REMARKS</p>
                <p>The claimant was a resident of Augusta Co. Va. He says he was a Union man loyal
                    to the Federal Govt. His witnesses state substantially the same thing-they were
                    confederates &amp; knew Palmer's Union sentiments yet he does not appear to
                    have been in any way disturbed on that account- His brothers were in the
                    confederate army &amp; he was conscripted &amp; escaped, going West to
                    avoid military service- Confederates took his property &amp; paid him "in
                    scrip"- He swears that he did not vote on ratifying the ordinance of secession-
                    The record is against him. A.J. Palmer of Augusta Co. is recorded as voting for
                    the ordinance. The claim is disallowed. A.O. Aldis, O. Ferriss, J.B. Howell,
                    Commrs. of Claims</p>
                <p>The Treasury Department Report is as follows:</p>
                <p>Treasury Department, Office of the Secretary, Washington, D.C. May 17, 1892</p>
                <p>The Honorable The Attorney General.</p>
                <p>Sir: In answer to your request of the 19th ultimo, in the case of Andrew J.
                    Palmer against the United States, No. 8870 Congressional, I have the honor to
                    state that the name of claimant appears in a list of those who voted for the
                    ordinance of secession in Augusta County, Virginia, the original of which is
                    presumed to be in the custody of the clerk of the court of said county.</p>
                <p>Respectfully yours, Charles Foster, Secretary.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the claimant voted for secession and that he did it
                    voluntarily and that he deliberately falsified about it when he gave the
                    testimony about it before the commissioner.</p>
                <p>When the depositions in this case were taken <u>in October,
                        1895</u>, the claimant was there present in the room, and when the Attorney
                    for the Government asked claimant's Attorney to permit him to cross-examine
                    claimant, he refused to permit it unless the Attorney would make him a
                    government witness. Of course the government's attorney refused to be caught in
                    such a trap as this. (See testimony of A.J. Waylard, page 14, aslo pages 12 and
                    13).</p>
                <p>With the knowledge, therefore, that the commissioners had rejected his claim
                    because he voted for secession, and with all this opportunity of explaining or
                    testifying about, his refusal amounts to a positive admission of voluntarily
                    doing the most disloyal of all acts, especially as his witnesses say he could
                    have voted against secession with the utmost impunity. (See pages of record
                    above cited. See also page 4 of J.B. Trimble's testimony.)</p>
                <p>The War Department report shows vouchers signed by claimant for wheat $266.00.

                <p>There can be no doubt about this man's disloyalty. GH
