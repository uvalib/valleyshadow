<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimant swears only to his loyal sympathies. He did not vote at all on the
                    Ordinance of Secession and does not answer questions from 9 to 14 in printed
                    list.</p>
                <p>He calls but one Witness to Confirm his claim to loyalty. And without going into
                    any specific statements he says I always considered Claimant loyal and he was so
                    regarded by his neighbors.</p>
                <p>We reject this claim.</p>
