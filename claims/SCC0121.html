<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Henry Mish, August
                            30, 1871, Claim No. 1387</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                The Commission disallowed Mish's claim for $3,500 worth of agricultural goods on
                    the grounds of disloyalty. His son appealed this decision to the Court of Claims
                    in 1900.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Mr Mish is a farmer is 59 years of age &amp; resided during the war in
                    Augusta Co. Va. He voted for the ordinance of secession, 'says threats were made
                    of burning his farm if he refused.' He does not tell who made the threats, or
                    describe the circumstances to enable us to judge whether he was in real danger
                    by refusing. There were votes in Augusta Co. against the adoption of the
                    ordinance of secession, &amp; very many electors did not vote at all at that
                    Election. Their farms are probably still standing. In answer to the 18<sup>th</sup> printed question he says he "was paid for some
                    grain which I sold to them (the Confederates)". It appears by this that he
                    furnished the Confederates with supplies. He also says, he "had some money in
                    Bank and contracted for bonds but never received them" It would seem he was
                    willing to aid the Confederacy by investing in its bonds. We think his
                    sympathies were with the Confederacy. The claim is disallowed</p>

                <p>Ques. 1<sup>st</sup> Witness says I am 60 years old, I reside in
                    Augusta Co. Va. My occupation is a farmer. I was not present when the property
                    named in the petition of the Claimant was taken.</p>
                <p>2<sup>d</sup>. Witness say I did not see any of them taken</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup>. Witness says they were taken on the 7<sup>th</sup> of June 1864, off the farm of Claimant, by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crooks command.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup>. Witness say I do not know that there was any
                    Officer present at the taking.</p>
                <p>7<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says About two or three hours, before
                    the taking I saw all the Cattle in the field and asked the claimant if he was
                    going to remove them, and he replied that he was not, that he would rather the
                    Union Army should have them, than the rebels.</p>
                <p>8<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The Cattle were drove away by
                    soldiers in Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crooksof command. They camped for one night, about 3/4 of
                    a mile from the claimant.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup>. Witness says I do not know the use made of the
                    property taken. I am satisfied that the whole of the property mentioned in the
                    petition was taken, by the United States soldiers under the command of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crooks</p>
                <p>11<sup>th</sup> Witness says There was no complaint made. The
                    claimant appeared to be satisfied that they had gotten them.</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup> Witness says There was no receipt asked for or
                    given that I know of.</p>
                <p>13<sup>th</sup>. Witness say I think it was taken in the day
                    time, about One or two Oclock in the afternoon. None was taken secretly.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says Gen<sup>l</sup>.
                    Crooks command, camped that night about 3/4 Mile from Claimant, it was encamped
                    from Claimant, it was encamped only one night. There washad
                    been no battle or skirmishing near there. I knew none of the Officers.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The Cattle 41 head were all good
                    beef. The horses were in good condition. I know nothing about the bacon, flour
                    or corn, mentioned in claimants petition</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says I have no doubt that all the
                    property mentioned in the claimants petition was
                    taken for the use of The Army.</p>
                <p>20<sup>th</sup>. Witness says Col. Allen, told me that they had
                    just come through the Mountains and were compelled to take all they could for
                    the use of the Army.</p>
                <p>21<sup>st</sup>. Witness Says From what Col. Allen told me, I
                    think had a necessity for the articles</p>

                    pay all loyal men, for the property they took.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup>. Witness Says I think those who took the property
                    mentioned in the petition were justified in taking it, as Col. Allen told me
                    that the Commanding General had given orders to do so, and I believe the
                    property should be paid for.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Henry Mish, vs. The United States.</p>
                <p>Defendants' Brief on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>I have carefully examined the abstract of testimony prepared by claimant's
                    attorney, and find that it is correct. References in this brief are, unless
                    otherwise specified, to the pages of the abstract of evidence.</p>
                <p>The claim is for stores and supplies, to the value of $3545.00 alleged to have
                    been taken from the farm of Henry Mish in Augusta county, Virginia. It has been
                    considered by the Commissioners of Claims, and by them rejected. The following
                    is their report on the claim:-</p>
                <p>"Mr. Mish is a farmer, is 59 years of age, and resided during the war in Augusta
                    county, Virginia. He voted for the ordinance of secession--says threats were
                    made of burning his barn if he refused. He does not tell who made the threats,
                    or describe the circumstances, to enable us to judge whether he was in real
                    danger by refusing. There were votes in Augusta county against the adoption of
                    the ordinance of secession, and very many electors did not vote at all at that
                    election. Their barns are probably still standing. In answer to the eighteenth
                    printed question, he says he 'was paid for some grain which I sold to then (the
                    Confederates).' It appears by this that he furnished the Confederates with
                    supplies. He also says he 'had sone money in bank and contracted for bonds, but
                    never received them.' It would seem he was willing to aid the Confederacy by
                    investing in its bonds. We think his sympathies were with the Confederacy The
                    claim is disallowed."</p>
                <p>But little remains to be said. The facts speak for themselves. The claimant voted
                    for secession. (See report Treasury Department)</p>
                <p>Concerning this he says: "I voted for secession. Threats were made of burning my
                    barns if I refused to vote for the ordinance of secession," (Rec. p. 6). As the
                    Commissioners point out in their report, there were votes against the ordinance
                    in Augusta county, and many electors did not vote at all. One of claimant's
                    witnesses, J.B. Carwell, nays: "Some of the Union men (of Augusta county) voted
                    against secession and some did not," (Rec. p. 4).</p>
                <p>The claimant states, (Rec. p. 4): "I had property taken by the Confederate
                    government. They took a horse, a quantity of corn, oats and wheat. I never was
                    paid for any article impressed, but was paid for some grain which I sold to them
                    (the Confederates)."</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, there are on file in the Confederate archives five vouchers
                    containing claimant's signature for bacon, oats, hay and straw, aggregating
                    $3,077.75. They will be produced for the inspection of the court at the hearing
                    of the case.</p>
                <p>It might perhaps be well to call the attention of the court to the fact that the
                    claimant's son, John W. Mish, who testified with great positiveness to the
                    loyalty of his father, was in 1861 but 11 years of age.</p>
                <p>That claimant was manifestly disloyal is, I think, most clearly established.</p>

                <p>HENRY MISH, vs. THE UNITED STATES. 8618 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Since the briefs on loyalty were filed, viz. in January 1900, additional
                    testimony on that question has been taken for the claimant as follows:</p>
                <p>JOHN W. MISH testifies: Age 50 years. Resided during the war near Middleburg,
                    Virginia, on the old home place, with Henry Mish. Henry Mish was loyal to the
                    cause of the Union, witness thinks, never, so far as witness knows, voluntarily
                    and willingly rendered any assistance to the Confederate cause. As regards
                    supplies which, according to the vouchers exhibited in this case, Henry Mish
                    furnished to the Confederate Government, viz. on April 6th 1863 bacon to the
                    value of $2308, on June 9th 1863 bacon to the value of $539.75, on December 20th
                    1864 hay and straw to the value of $35.20, on February 29th 1864 oats and hay to
                    the value of $285 and September 1st 1864, hay to the value of $960, the
                    Confederates came and impressed the property so far as witness knows; they came
                    there, he knows, and took them when they wanted them; they would press what they
                    wanted and take it for persons did not sell. (Page l). Lived with Henry Mish
                    throughout the war and, so far as he knows, Henry Mish never voluntarily sold
                    supplies to the Confederacy. He uniformly and consistently during that whole
                    period declared himself favorable to the Union cause. So far as witness ever
                    knew of, he never voluntarily rendered any assistance to the Confederacy of any
                    kind whatever.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>If the Confederates got the supplies enumerated at all, they impressed them. Does
                    not recollect dates but knows that at different times they came and impressed
                    various supplies. Does not know whether it was the custom of the Confederates to
                    pay Union men for supplies taken from them. Deceased claimant was threatened,
                    more especially in regard to stock. A short time before Hunter raided the
                    valley, the Confederates came to him and ordered him to take his cattle and
                    deliver them over to the Confederate authorities at some point which they
                    designated. (Page 2). He did not do this, however. A short time after that
                    General Hunter got the cattle. Knows of deceased claimant's aiding several Union
                    men to go North through the lines; he aided the two Carwell boys, witness
                    thinks, and R. A. Helms; there were others but he does not think of their names.
                    Of the circumstances of his aiding these men in the way mentioned only knows
                    what he has heard; heard him say he had assisted them but was not present when
                    assistance was rendered.</p>
                <p>(Objection here made by the Attorney for the Government to the testimony of the
                    witness as to what he heard deceased claimant say in this matter--objection on
                    the ground that the testimony is hear-say).</p>
                <p>Union men were pretty roughly treated by the Confederate officers; does not know
                    so much about the Confederate soldiers. Does not think there was much feeling
                    manifested against them by their Confederate neighbors. (Page 3). Deceased
                    claimant was threatened on account of his union sentiments, but does not know of
                    his ever being molested. When the Confederates came to his place after the
                    cattle mentioned, they threatened to arrest him and put him in prison. Does not
                    remember ever having heard any of their threats. No one in his presence
                    threatened deceased claimant except as already stated in reference to the
                    cattle, claimant was as courageous as the average Union man in that locality; he
                    was not a timid man. Does not remember the language of deceased claimant but
                    remembers that he was always jubilant over the success of the Union army; does
                    not remember the exact battles or his exact words; heard him say he wanted to
                    see Gen. Lee's army beaten. Does not know whether his memory is as good now as
                    it was in 1897. (Page 4).</p>
                <p>J. B. CARWELL testifies: Age 55 years. Not related to the claimant or interested
                    in the claim. Lived during the war about a mile north of Middleburg, Virginia,
                    and was acquainted with Henry Mish. Was a Union man and heard Mr. Mish express
                    himself as favorable to the Union, The practice of the Confederates in that
                    locality was to take supplies if the owners refused, to sell them. Has no
                    personal knowledge of the circumstances of the taking of certain hay, straw,
                    oats and bacon by the Confederates from Mr. Mish in 1863 and 1864. Mr. Mish
                    rendered some aid to Union sympathizers during that period. He gave witness
                    money to go North, and he did go North. He helped Mr. Helms and J. H. Garwell,
                    brother of witness, to escape from the Confederacy and go North. Does not think
                    he ever voluntarily assisted the Confederate cause. Does not of his own
                    knowledge know whether he was ever threatened or molested because of his Union
                    sentiments. (Page 7). He was generally regarded in that community as a Union
                    man.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>Mr. Mish, when he assisted witness to go North, gave him about $30 in gold; there
                    was a $20 gold piece and a $10 gold piece. There was no consideration for this
                    noney and witness never repaid it. Was not present when deceased claimant, as
                    testified, assisted J. H. Carwell and Mr. Helms to go North; what he knows of
                    this matter Mr. Helms and his brother told him when they were <sup>together</sup>going up North during the war.
                    Met Mr. Helms at Clarksburg, West Virginia, in 1864, he supposes, in the fall or
                    Winter. Mr. Helms was then on his way to Philadelphia. Does not know the time
                    when he (witness) left his home to go to West Virginia; thinks it was in
                    September; it was before his brother and Mr. Helms went away. (Page 8).
                    Referring to this testimony, as stated by the Attorney for the Government, that
                    he went to West Virginia in November or December 1863, does not remember dates,
                    but thinks "you" (this to the Attorney for the Government) have it right." Does
                    not know how long it was after he left home that Mr. Helms left; met him in
                    Clarksburg after witness went there, probably a day or so afterward. The reason
                    why he testified in 1897 that he is the only one who knows of deceased
                    claimant's aiding was that he; received aid himself, while in the other cases
                    the parties told him of it. Means to say now that he is the only one he knows of
                    deceased claimant having aided. Has no present knowledge of deceased claimant
                    ever being threatened on account of his Union sentiments. Such statements as he
                    has made in this connection were based on hear-say; heard Mr. Mish say he was so
                    threatened. Does not know of any particular man who voted against secession and
                    does not know that anybody did vote against it. Does not of his own knowledge
                    know how men who voted against secession were treated because of so voting.
                    (Page 9).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>This testimony not only disposes of the affirmative defence attempted for the Government but materially strengthens the case
                    affirmatively made for claimant. As definitely as can be expected in such
                    circumstances, it is proved by the testimony of the son of deceased claimant
                    that none of the supplies covered by the Confederate vouchers were voluntarily
                    furnished by him. This witness was some 2313 or
                        2414 years old when the Confederate Quartermaster
                    authorities got these supplies, just the right age to have the most distinct
                    recollection of all the facts. He testifies positively that be knows that, while
                    he has no recollection as to the particular dates shown by these vouchers, he
                    knows that at different times the Confederates did go to his father's place and
                    impress supplies; also that the Confederates came there and to other farms
                    thereabouts and took supplies when they wanted them; would press what they
                    wanted if the owners would not sell. (Pages 2 and 3 sup.). His further statement
                    that if the confederates got these supplies at all they impressed them, if it is
                    to be regarded as a mere conclusion, is certainly a very logical and safe
                    conclusion.</p>
                <p>The other witness, J. B. Carwell, testifies that he has no knowledge of the circumatances of the taking from deceased
                    claimant by the Confederates of supplies of the kinds referred to by the
                    vouchers but that the Confederates forcibly took such supplies as they wanted in
                    that locality from persons who refused to sell them. (Page 5 sup.). John W. Mish
                    tells of his father's assisting J. B. Carwell, his brother, J. H. Carwell and
                    one Helms to escape through the lines and go North. It appears that he was not
                    present and did not see what his father did in this connection, but he testifies
                    that his father told him of it. He also says there were others whom his father
                    assisted, or whom in the same way he heard of his father's assisting to go
                    North, but that he could not recall their names. (Page 3 sup.). J. B. Carwell
                    furnishes most convincing details of the assistance to him and his brother and
                    Helms given by deceased claimant in their escape from Confederate territory. He
                    says it was money furnished to him by Mr. Mish for that sole purpose, some $30
                    in gold, which enabled him to make his escape. His knowledge of the manner of
                    the escape of his brother and Mr. Helms and of the assistance rendered by
                    deceased claimant was derived from them immediately afterward, while he was in
                    their society in loyal territory. He says he met Helms in Clarksburg, West
                    Virginia, a day or two after his own escape into that territory and then heard
                    these particulars of the ease of Helms and J. H. Carwell. (Pages 5 and 6 sup.).</p>
                <p>John W. Mish narrates, as a threat to his father because of his union sentiments,
                    a circumstance which, if it is not to be regarded as such a threat or
                    molestation, at least illustrates the Confederate practice of which both these
                    witnesses speak, of impressing supplies in that locality. He says his father was
                    ordered to deliver his cattle to Confederate authorities at a designated point,
                    but did not do so, and that soon afterward Gen. Hunter got these same cattle.
                    (Page 3 sup.).</p>
                <p>The witness Carwell testifies, not only that deceased claimant was generally
                    regarded in that community as a Union man but that, being himself a Union man,
                    he heard Mr. Mish express himself on the side of the Union.</p>
                <p>This testimony, with that which was presented in my former brief, certainly calls
                    for a finding of loyalty.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Defendant's Supplemental Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Henry Mish v. The United States No. 6818, Congressional.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANTS' SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Immediately following the filing of my former brief on loyalty, claimant's
                    counsel had remanded the case at bar for the purpose of taking testimony
                    relative to the matter of the sale by the claimant of supplies to the
                    Confederacy, with a view to explaining away this fact so damaging to the
                    claimant's interests. In this, however, he has most lamentably failed. His
                    additional testimony weakens an already weak case and leaves the court, I
                    submit, with absolutely no ground upon which they can make a finding on loyalty
                    favorable to the claimant.</p>
                <p>The testimony taken consists of the depositions of two witnesses, both of whom
                    testified previously in this case under the rules of the court, to wit, in 1897.
                    In this later testimony of theirs nothing new has been secured by claimant's
                    counsel; and many contradictions of their former testimony are made in the vain
                    efforts of the witnesses to strengthen an already absolutely hopeless case.</p>
                <p>The first of these two witnesses, John W. Mish, states with the utmost
                    positiveness that "if the Confederates got the supplies enumerated at all, they
                    impressed them" (Claimant's Supp. Brief, p. 3); adding that, since he lived with
                    claimant, his father, throughout the entire war of the rebellion, he most
                    certainly would have known it had claimant sold any supplies whatever to them.
                    And claimant's counsel, in his "Summary" (p. 8, Supp. Brief) sees fit to say
                    that "it is proved by the testimony of the son of deceased claimant that none of
                    the supplies covered by the Confederate vouchers were voluntarily furnished by
                    him. This witness was some 23 or 24 yaars old when the Confederate quartermaster
                    authoritias got these supplies, just the right age to have a most distinct
                    recollection of all the facts."</p>
                <p>It is a matter of record that this witness was born in October, 1849 (Claimant's
                    Brief on Loyalty, p. 6); and Consequently at the outbreak of the war he was but
                    11 years old. Therefore, in 1863 and 1864, when these supplies were sold by his
                    father to the Confederates, he was not, as claimant's counsel states, "some 23
                    or 24 years old, # # # # just the right age to have a most distinct recollection
                    of all the facts," but was some 13-14 years old, just the age which would cause
                    him today to have a most indistinct and unreliable recollection of these facts.</p>
                <p>It is worth while to here call to the attention of the court once more the words
                    used by claimant when in 1871 he testified relative to the matter of the sale of
                    supplies to the Confederates. On that occasion he said (Record p. 4): "I had
                    property taken by the Confederate Government. They took a horse and a quantity
                    of corn, oats and wheat. <u>I never was paid</u> for any
                    article <u>impressed</u>, but <u>was
                    paid</u> for some corn which I sold to them." It will be seen by a glance at
                    the list of vouchers attached to this and to my former brief on loyalty that, in
                    five different vouchers, the claimant receipts for a total of $3077.55, money
                    paid him for the supplies enumerated in said vouchers. Accordingly it follows,
                    in the light of the claimant's words above quoted, that these supplies were not
                    impressed as alleged by claimant's son, since claimant "never was paid for any
                    article impressed." The logic of this seems to me to be irrefutable.</p>
                <p>Since John W. Mish has seen fit to put himself in conflict with the statements
                    made under oath by his deceased father, it might perhaps be well to call
                    attention to one or two of the several self-contradictory statements made by him
                    in his latter day testimony. In his 1897 testimony (p. 10), the following is of
                    record:-</p>
                <p>State whether or not he (claimant) ever aided Union men to get through the lines,
                    or render them other assistance.</p>
                <p>Ans. Not to my personal knowledge; I was young then.</p>
                <p>In his testimony of 1900 (p. 3) the following occurs:-Q. Did you know of the
                    claimant ever having aided any Union men to go north through the lines?</p>
                <p>Ans. Yes, I know of several.</p>
                <p>Q. Do you remember their names, or can you state about how many of them there
                    were?</p>
                <p>Ans. Two Carwell boys, I think he aided, and <u>R.A.
                    Helms</u>.</p>
                <p>This in itself is, of course, a direct contradiction of his own testimony and
                    must result in weakening whatever favorable influence it might otherwise have
                    had with the court.</p>
                <p>The other witnessss testifying in 1900, J. B. Carwell, states that
                    both he and his brother, as well as R. A. Helms, were assisted by the claimant
                    in escaping from the Confederacy and going north, although he acknowledges that
                    his information relative to both his brother and Mr. Helms is hearsay
                    (Claimant's Supp. Brief on Loyalty, pp. 5 &amp; 6). This witness was but 15
                    years old in 1861, and it is perhaps due to their then youthfulness that the
                    stories of John W. Mish and the witness Carwell do not agree with the testimony
                    given by the man <u>R. A. Helms</u> in 1897. This witness
                        Helms was then asked (Record pp. 1 &amp; 2):-</p>
                <p>Q. State whether or not you were a Union man (during the war).</p>
                <p>Ans. I was not sir.</p>
                <p>Q. State whether or not he (claimant) rendered assistance to Union sympathizers
                    and soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ans. I do not know about that; only so far as to let their families have
                    provisions.</p>
                <p>Comment is unnecessary.</p>
                <p>Again, the following, occurring in the testimony of witness Carwell, is worthy of
                    mention: In 1897 this witness was asked (Record p. 6):-</p>
                <p>Q. State whether or not you know of the Confederates threatening him (claimant)
                    because of his Union sentiments.</p>
                <p>Ans. They threatened him just the same (as) they did the rest of the Union
                    people.</p>
                <p>In January, 1900, the same witness was asked (Record, p. 7):-</p>
                <p>Q. Did you know of your own knowledge whether the claimant was over threatened or
                    molested because of his Union sentiments?</p>
                <p>Ans. I do not.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, in reference to the claimant casting his vote in favor of
                    secession, I would respectfully ask this court whether a mere threat to
                        burn of barn burning is to be held sufficient to excuse such an
                    ultra-disloyal act as this,- a fact confessed to by the claimant himself. Is it
                    to be held to be duress sufficient to excuse such an act? And if so, is
                    claimant's unsupported statement to this effect, unaccompanied by even the names
                    of the parties alleged to have made the threats, or any statement of the
                    circumstances under which said threats were made, if made they were, to be held
                    to be sufficient proof that he was so threatened?</p>
                <p>It would seem to me that this court can not make a finding favorable to the
                    claimant upon the issue of loyalty.</p>

                <b>Claimant's Reply Brief</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS</p>
                <p>Henry Mish v. The United States No. 8618 Congressional</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY TO DEFENDANT'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>Replying to defendant's supplemental brief on loyalty, filed January 22nd, 1902,
                    we have to state that we stand corrected as to the age of John W. Mish, son of
                    claimant, and witness in this case. Counsel for the defendant is correct in
                    stating that the record shows this witness was eleven years old in 1861.</p>
                <p>Referring now to the testimony of claimant, we desire to call attention to the
                    below quoted portion of his deposition taken August 30th, 1871, while his claim
                    was pending before the Commissioners. On Page 2 of said deposition, answer 11,
                    we find the following:</p>
                <p>Witness says "I never was employed in any business connected with the Confederate
                    Government. I first sold, to J. Bumgardner individually some corn, which he sold
                    to the Confederate Government, and afterwards let the Officers, as they had
                    orders to impress if I refused, for which I was paid in part."</p>
                <p>We submit that the above quoted statement in connection with the other statement
                    made by claimant, and commented upon by counsel for the defense on Page 3 of his
                    brief, allows that while claimant did not voluntarily sell supplies to the
                    Confederacy, he was really forced so to do, by reason of the fact that the
                    Officers had orders to impress claimant's property, if claimant refused to sell
                    same. It will also be observed that claimant says in his above quoted statement
                    that he was paid for a part of his property which he let the officers have. This
                    statement is corroborated by the vouchers brought forward by the defendant. The
                    testimony of claimant taken in connection with the testimony recently given in
                    the case, shows beyond all reasonable doubt that claimant was obliged to sell
                    supplies to the Confederacy, and that it is quite probable that the Confederates
                    also impressed certain other property of claimant, for which no compensation was
                    ever promised or given. In view of all the foregoing, it will be observed by the
                    Court that there is absolutely nothing contradictory in the record but on the
                    contrary the statements made by claimant are borne out by said vouchers
                    exhibited by the defendant.</p>
                <p>Relative to the testimony of John W. Mish as to aid given by his deceased father
                    to those seeking to go North, it is to be observed that in 1900 witness states
                    that he knows of several persons whom his father so helped, but in 1897 he
                    simply stated that he did not know of his <u>personal
                        knowledge</u> of the giving of such assistance. He did not state that he
                    did not know persons who were assisted. As the word "know" is ordinarily used by
                    the laymen, unlearned in legal distinction there is no contradiction whatever
                    between these two different statements made by this witness.</p>
                <p>Adverting now to Page 5 of defendant's brief, and the alleged further
                    contradiction which counsel for the defense thinks he has discovered between the
                    testimony of John W. Mish and J.B. Carwell on the one hand, and the testimony of
                    Robert A. Helms on the other, we invite attention to the fact that counsel for
                    the defendant has failed to call the special attention of the Court to that
                    portion of the testimony of said Helms found on Page 4 of his deposition, being
                    question and answer 16, in which this witness states that <u>his own family</u> was assisted by claimant in this case, the occasion for
                    this assistance being obviously witnesses absence in
                    the North. So much for this alleged contradiction. Instead of there being a
                    discrepancy upon this point, the testimony of each witnesses corroborates that
                    of the others.</p>
                <p>Referring to the further discovery by counsel for the defendant of contradictions
                    in the testimony of said witness Carwell, pointed out upon page 5 and 6 of his
                    brief. We have stated that it does appear that in 1897 this witness testified
                    that the Confederates threatened claimant just the same as they did the rest of
                    the Union people, though no particular threats are mentioned, and that in 1900
                    witness candidly admits that he had no direct personal knowledge of the threats
                    made to claimant, but very frankly states that he had heard claimant say that he
                    had been threatened. If there is anything of moment in this, we must confess our
                    inability to see it.</p>
                <p>Referring now to the concluding remarks in defendant's brief, we would suggest
                    that it is very easy at the present time to say that a mere threat of barn
                    burning should have been disregarded by the claimant, but that such a threat
                    made in a time of general disturbance and turbulent disorder, would be quite
                    likely to have had an effect upon an ordinary farmer unable to protect himself
                    against arson, which might result from the enmity of lawless neighbors. The
                    question is not, what would now be considered such a threat as would have an
                    effect upon a reasonably courageous man, but what would under the circumstances
                    which surrounded claimant at the time in question could have been deemed
                    sufficient to constitute duress.</p>
                <p>We submit that there can be found in this record no material contradictions or
                    discrepancies, and that the testimony leads irresistably to the conclusion that
                    the deceased claimant was wholly loyal to the Union throughout the war, and did
                    all that any man of prodance could have done under
                    all the circumstances to show his loyalty, and under these proven facts he
                    should be found loyal by the Court.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Counsel for
                    Claimant,</p>
