<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The claimant is now about 65 years of age and a farmer. During the war he resided
                    in Augusta Co., Va.
                    The evidence shows that he was loyal to the Union cause. Did not vote on the
                    ratification of the ordinance of secession. His son was in the Confederate army.
                    Mr. Odor tried to keep him out. He was denounced by the Confederates on account
                    of his Unionism. Since the war he has been postmaster and has taken the test
                    oath. Inquiries have been made by our special agent. This report confirms the
                    claimant, allegations of loyalty. We find him loyal.</p>
                <p>In 1864 a fine horse was taken from the claimant by U. S. troops and for army use. No voucher was given &amp; no
                    claim has before been presented for payment.</p>
                <p>We recmomend the payment of $150.00</p>
