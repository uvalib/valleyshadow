<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of George W. Hollar,
                            1876, Claim No. 21,827</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                George W. Hollar filed this claim in 1876 for $175, claiming Union forces under
                    General Hunter took one horse in 1864. George was a 47 year old farmer who lived
                    near Mt. Sidney during the war and moved to Rockingham County afterwards. He was
                    a member of the Dunker church, helped neighbors escape to the Union and lead a
                    party of 18 pacifists through the mountains to escape Confederate service. They
                    were captured by Confederate soldiers and imprisoned in Harrisonburg until the
                    Fine Act was passed in 1862 that allowed their release because of their faith.
                    Included is testimony from John Flory, a Dunker preacher. The commission allowed
                    $125.

                <p>The proof of claimant's loyalty is ample. He was drafted in the winter of 61-2
                    into the Army. He started to go through the mountains to escape to the north,

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>George W. Hollar</b>
                <p>Deposition of Claimant</p>
                <p>1 My name is George W. Hollar. I am 47 years old. I am a farmer, live now 3 miles
                    east of Dayton Rockingham CoVa. During the war I lived 4 miles from Mt Sidney in Augusta Co.</p>
                <p>3 I was born in Shenandoah Co.</p>
                <p>5 I sympathized wholly with the north and with the Union cause all the time.</p>
                <p>6 Not to my knowledge</p>
                <p>7 I was willing to do anything consistant with my
                    religious faith.</p>
                <p>8 I have harbored and fed refugees and deserters and have helped them to escape.
                    I have given them money to go with. I have gone with them in the night to show
                    the way. Two Confederate soldiers staid at my house
                    about two months while on parole, and I persuaded them to go north and gave them
                    money to go with, and put them in the way. I collected about 30 refugees at one
                    time who met at my house by appointment for supper and started the same night
                    for the mountains with a Pilot named John D. Sheets who took them through to New
                    Creek. There were various depots among the farmers about the country were these
                    refugees were harbored and kept. I suppose I knew of as many as 300 who were run
                    through by this route.</p>
                <p>9 &amp; 10 No sir.</p>
                <p>11 Yes. I gave money in gold and silver to get my brother out of the army. I gave
                    money and service to help refugees and deserters escape.</p>
                <p>12 &amp; 13 I took the side of the Union. I voted for the Union delegates to
                    the Richmond Convention. On the day of the election for Secession I left home
                    and went to Harrisonburg. I knew that if I voted I should vote for the Union,
                    and I was afraid of my life if I did. There were terrible threats against Union
                    men if they voted against Secession or if they refused to vote for Secession and
                    Union men were intimidated into voting for secession all through teh country.
                    There were two men who voted for the Union at my precinct and they were near
                    being killed. I heard men talk of hanging them; a man named William Howell and
                    others offered to furnish the rope and stand between the law and any man who
                    would hang them.</p>
                <p>I did not vote for secession.</p>
                <p>14 I was sadly disappointed at the result of the battle of Manassas. But my faith
                    was unshaken in the ultimate triumph of the Union cause. I was rejoiced with the
                    result of the battles of Vicksburg and N. Orleans.</p>
                <p>15 &amp; 16 No</p>
                <p>17 James Todd, a Wm Snead, Samuel Kline Christian, Joseph and
                    John Kline, Noah Earley were all loyal men living within a few miles of me. Any
                    of these could testify to my loyalty but are too far away.</p>
                <p>18 My life was threatened by confederates for rejoicing over a Union victory.</p>
                <p>19 No sir.</p>
                <p>20 Yes. They took a large quantity of property of different kinds. Wheat, corn,
                    Hay, horses, &amp;c. They paid me for a little hay once, but not for the
                    other property. They singled me out because I was a Union Man.</p>
                <p>21 &amp; 22 No sir</p>
                <p>23 I was drafted and started to go through the mountains to New Creek to escape
                    from the Confederacy with 18 others who joined me. We were all captured in the
                    mountains, and brought back to Woodstock and Harrisonburg where we were
                    imprisoned for 5 weeks and nearly frozen and half starved until the first Fine
                    law was passed in April 1862 when I paid my fine and was released.</p>
                <p>24 to 35 No Sir.</p>
                <p>36 Yes I had two brothers in the army. One, I hired to run away as before stated.
                    The other was captured with me in the mountains and not being a member of the
                    church was put in the army, and run away and I concealed <sup>him</sup>.</p>
                <p>37 &amp; 38 No Sir</p>
                <p>39 Yes I took the Amnesty Oath at Staunton.</p>
                <p>40 to 43 No Sir</p>
                <p>44 I voted for the Union candidates for the Richmond convention, but did not vote
                    on the question of secession. I was afraid of my life if I voted my sentiments.</p>
                <p>45 to 51 No Sir.</p>
                <p>In answer to questions concerning property deponent says.</p>
                <p>I had a mare which I loaned to my brother-in-law John Flory who was living near
                        Deyton in Rockingham Co. where I now live. His horses having been taken by the Union forces.</p>
                <p>This mare was taken from his place by some troops of Gen Hunters army in the summer of 1864. While I was living in Augusta
                    County about 12 miles distant.</p>
                <p>He was a young bay Morgan Mare of good size and style, in fine order and well
                    broke. I valued her at $175. I think she would have brought that price. I have
                    no one in this country to prove the taking except John Flory and his wife, and
                    further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>53 to 56 I have known him all my life nearly. Saw him often during the war,
                    talked with him many times about the war and kindred topics. He was a very
                    decided union man, he always opposed secession and supported the cause of the
                    Union. On the evening of the election on the question of Secession <sup>He was at my home</sup> and said among other things, "To
                    night the sun goes down on our liberties."</p>
                <p>57 He came to my house one night with a party of 10 to 12 refugees and took
                    supper and started for the mountains that night. He was the leader of the party,
                    and was joined by others making 18 all of whom were captured in the mountains by
                    the rebels while on the way to New Creek. This was in the Spring of 1862.</p>
                <p>60 He was well known as a union man all through this section. I was a union man

                <p>72 I was present and witnessed the taking of the property.</p>
                <p>It was in June 1864, while the army of Genl Hunter was passing up the valley
                    towards Staunton. A large body of cavalry was halted nearly opposet where I lived then, and two of the men rode to my place and
                    went directly to the stable searching for horses. I had but one on my place, and
                    he belonged to claimant who had loaned him to me to use, as my own horses had
                    been taken before then. This horse of the claimants was taken by one of these
                    men who took the saddle from his one and put it on claimants and rode him while
                    leading his own. He told me his own was near giving out and he must have
                    another. No receipt was given, nor asked for. The horse was young, good size
                    fair condition, well broke, and worth about $125 to $150. And further deponent
