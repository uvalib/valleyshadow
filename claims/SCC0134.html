<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Isaac Ware, August
                            21, 1871, Claim No. 12,671</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Isaac Ware was a black man living in Staunton during the war; presumably he was a
                    slave, since his name is not listed in the Registry of Free Blacks for Staunton.
                    The Commissioners were satisifed that he was loyal to the United States but did
                    not see sufficient evidence proving that Union troops took his horse, and
                    therefore disallowed the claim.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The only Evidence to prove the horse taken for Army use is this-</p>
                <p><u>Hiram Kerr</u>- testifies</p>
                <p>"I did not see the horse taken, but I saw the soldiers &amp; officers with
                    it. It was in the stable and I believe they took the horse of the claimant from
                    the stable" "I was about 50 yards off."</p>
                <p>One would think that he would know, if at that distance, whether the horse was
                    taken or not, &amp; yet he says - "I did not see it taken. I believe it was
                    taken."</p>
                <p>He says afterwards - "The horse was led off by officers &amp; soldiers"! That
                    is an absurd statement. If led off at all only one would lead him off.</p>
                <p>It is plain he means to assert the taking only as he <u>believes</u>, not as he <u>saw</u> it. The Army was not
                    Encamped there at the time. There is no satisfactory proof of lawful taking for
                    Army use.</p>
                <p>Claim rejected.</p>

                <p>Quest 1 How old are you where do you reside and what is your occupation?</p>
                <p>I am twenty five years old I reside in Augusta County Virginia by occupation a

                    Government all the war and he was so regarded by all his neighbors I never knew
                    him to do anything for the Union or Confederate Governments during the war I
                    think he was too loyal to the United States Goverment to have been considered
                    loyal to the Confederacy if it had succeeded I also think that the property
