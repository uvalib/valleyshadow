                <b>William H. Fix</b>
                <p>Deposition of William H. Fix</p>
                <p>Ques. 1. Ans. My name is William H. Fix, my age is 24 years. I
                    reside near Greenville, Va. I am a Blacksmith by
                    trade.</p>
                <p>2. Ans. I am the son of the claimant, but have of no special interest in the
                    success of the claim.</p>
                <p>72. Ans. I was at the house, up stairs and saw the Mare taken from the Stable
                    yard.</p>
                <p>73. Ans. She was taken in day light about 12 or 1 Oclock. There was no secrecy
                    shown at all.</p>
                <p>74. Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not, there was no
                    complaint, and my father was was confined with pains, &amp; could
                    not go out. There were at least four soldiers engaged in taking the Mare. They
                    were horse back and from their equipments I supposed were Cavalry men
                        &amp; belonged to Gen<sup>l.</sup> Hunter's Army. My father's house is
                    probably half mile from the Turnpike road, on which the Army was then
                    marching.</p>
                <p>75. Ans. No voucher was given or asked for.</p>
                <p>77. Ans. The Mare was taken by Soldiers belonging to Genl. Hunter's Army. Then marching from Staunton to Lexington, in the
                    month of June, 1864, the soldiers led the Mare away, and went on the road in the
                    direction of Lexington and paralel with the Turnpike
                    where the main army was then marching.</p>
                <p>78. Ans. I saw the Mare taken away by soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ques. 79. Ans. The Mare was a bay, and about 6 years old. She was medium size,
                    and in good working order, and fine looking, of good life and well broken to
                    ride and to work. I am satsified that at the close of the war, if in the same
                    condition as when taken she would have brought two hundred dollars. My father
                    sold a 4 year old at the close of the War of common appearance and inferior
                    qualities for One hundred &amp; twenty five dollars. I believe that the four
                    men engaged in taking the Mare, were soldiers belonging to General Hunter's
                    Army, all their equipments were soldiers-like, and being so close to the Main
                    body could not have been private citizens.</p>

                    Augusta Co.Va. My
                    occupation is a farmer. I am not related to the claimant, and no benefit in his
                    claim.</p>
                <p>53. Ans. I have known the claimant all his life, and all the time intimately.</p>
                <p>54. Ans. We reside about 2 1/2 miles apart and same distance during the War.</p>
                <p>55. Ans. I met him frequently during the war, how often I cannot say. We attended
                    the same churches, stores and Post Office.</p>
                <p>Ques. 56. Ans. I conversed with him very frequnetly about the War. I have no
                    recollection at any time of those present, and cannot recollect any particular
                    words and expressions used by the claimant, but I know that his sentiments and
                    sympathies were in accord with my own, and I was opposed to secession as
                    violently as any man in the United States.</p>
                <p>57. Ans. I do not know that he did anything to aid the Union cause, he had no

                <p>59. Ans. I never had any one speak of him as a Secessionist.</p>
                <p>60. Ans. His reputation amongst his loyal neighbors was that of a strong Union
                    man, he was a very cautious and timid man. Adam Ziuk and John H.B. Shultz were
                    well known Union men, and Gibsons and others and they knew him well enough to
                    testify for him.</p>
                <p>62. Ans. I was myself an adherent to the Union and well known to the claimant.</p>
                <p>63. Ans. There were threats made against those who might refuse to vote for the
                    Ordinance of Secession.</p>

                <p>56. Ans. At the commencement of the war we conversed together about the cause and
                    results of the war, and he entertained and expressed the same views which I
                    entertained myself, that the war was unjust upon the part of the South. That the
                    Union should and he believed would be maintained. I do not recollect of ever
                    holding a conversation with him in the presence of others.</p>
                <p>57. Ans. I do not know of anything that he did except his declarations to me. I
                    heard from either a man by the name of Parrack or Harvey that the claimant aided
                    and give information to parties, who were trying to escape from the Confederate
                    service.</p>
                <p>58. Ans. I never heard him express a word, or do anything against the Union.</p>
                <p>59. Ans. I never heard anything that the claimant should have said or done
                    against the Union.</p>
                <p>60. Ans. I think that his reputation was that of a Union man. I heard on one
                    occasion John Brownlee, of near Greenville, say that "he doubted his (Fix)
                    loyalty to the South." Brownlee was a strong rebel.</p>
                <p>Ques. 61. Ans. David Parrack, Andrew Ziuk, &amp; Adam Hawpe, of
                    the same neighborhood all of whom I presume could testify to his loyalty.</p>
                <p>62. Ans. I was an adherent to the Union cause during the war, and am still. The
                    claimant knew my position by my words and acts.</p>
                <p>63. Ans. I do not know of any.</p>
                <p>64. Ans. I do not know of anything except his language to myself, he was a very
                    quiet and timid man.</p>
                <p>65. Ans. I know nothing except what I have stated.</p>
