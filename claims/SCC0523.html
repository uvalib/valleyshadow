                <p>All the stock mentioned in the petition was in good condition when taken by the
                    United States Government. I think that the prices charged in the petition are

                    good and were sold at fair prices. Further this deponent saith not. August the

                <p>Questions by the Commissioner</p>
                <p>1<sup>st</sup> How old are you, where do you reside, and what is
                    your occupation? Answer I am fifty three years old. I reside in Augusta County
                    Virginia, by occupation a farmer</p>
                <p>2 How long have you known the Claimant in this petition Answer I have known him
                    twenty or twenty five years. I reside seven miles from him. I knew him during
                    the war. I saw him often during the war. I took him to be strictly loyal to the
                    United States Government during the war. I did not know any man more so in
                    Augusta County Virginia. He was so regarded by his neighbors. I never heard him
                    threatened on account of his union sentiments but Union people were generally
                    threatened. I never knew him to do anything to aid the Confederate Government,
                    nor do I believe he would have done it voluntarily.</p>
                <p>3 Do you know of any act done or language used by the Claimant which would have
                    prevented him from establish his loyalty to the Confederacy if it had been
                    maintained as a separate Government if so state the same particularly. Answer He
                    was so loyal to the United States Government he could not have been loyal to the
                    Confederate Government if it had been maintained as a separate government.</p>

                <p>David Perry a witness introduced by Martin Garber being duly sworn answereth as
                    follows</p>
                <p>1 By Commissioner How old are you where do you reside, and what is your
                    occupation. Answer I am forty nine years old. I reside in Augusta County
                    Virginia by occupation a farmer.</p>
                <p>2 Are you acquainted with the Claimant in this petition Answer I have known him
                    for eleven years. I saw him often during the war. So far as I know and believe
                    he was loyal to the United States Government during the war and so regarded by
                    his neighbors.</p>
                <p>3 Were you acquainted with the property or any part of it mentioned in the
                    Claimants petition Answer I was acquainted with his horses and cows they were in
                    good condition when I saw them last. I saw one of his horses in the posession of
                    the Army of the United States then being commanded by Gen<sup>l</sup> Hunter, and from my knowledge
                    of his stock I do not think he has charged the Government too much in his
                    petition.</p>
                <p>4 Do you know any act done, or language used by the Claimant which would have

                    maintained as a separate Government if so state the same particularly. Answer he
                    was too loyal to the United States Government to have been considered a loyal
                    man to the Confederacy if it had been maintained as a separate Government.</p>

                <p>Martin Garber the Claimant having been duly sworn deposes as follows.</p>
                <p>Witness says-I was present when the cattle were taken. When the horses were taken
                    which was by another portion of the Army, the Cavalry. I was a quarter of a mile
                    distant, they being in the pasture meaning my horses.</p>
                <p>3 Witness says-I saw the grain, the bacon and the harness taken.</p>
                <p>4 Witness says-I say that they were taken the day after the battle of Piedmont
                    which I think was the 6<sup>th</sup> of June 1864 they were
                    taken from my house by Officers and soldiers under the command of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter</p>
                <p>6 Witness says-I saw the cattle taken by the Quartermaster, he gave me a receipt
                    for the same which is filed with my petition, he said the army was making a raid
                    and that they had orders to take horses and cattle and flour and bacon and
                    everything else necessary for the use of the army that the Army <sup>had</sup> lost a good many horses the day before, and that
                    cattle they must have that they had to get their living in the country they
                    passed through.</p>
                <p>8 Witness says-The property was removed by the soldiers. The horses were rode and
                    the cows driven</p>
                <p>9 Witness says-It was removed to Staunton I followed it there. I saw the saddle
                    and one horse the property of Isaac Coffman which was in the pasture with mine
                    at the time they were taken.</p>
                <p>11 Witness says-I complained to the Provost Marshall
                    as they had taken all my horses he told me to come on to Staunton and as they
                    had taken all my horses he would do what he could for me. I went to Staunton the
                    next day and found the Provost Marshal, he told me he was very busy and the
                    Cavalry was all scattered about, and if he would give me an order to hunt my
                    horses unless I was a deity I could not find them he told me to come back some
                    other day. The reason I did not come back, both armies were in the neighborhood
                    and the pickets were fighting.</p>
                <p>12 Witness says-A receipt was given for the Cattle without being asked for which
                    receipt is filed with the petition. There was no other receipt given for any
                    other articles mentioned in the Claimant's petition no other receipt was asked
                    for</p>
                <p>13 Witness says-The property was taken in the day time about ten O'clock and none
                    of the property was taken secretly.</p>
                <p>14 Witness says-It was taken the day after the battle of Piedmont when the Army
                    was on its way to Staunton where it was encamped for several days</p>
                <p>15 Witness says-The horses and cattle were in good condition the cattle were good
                    beef, they were worth what the Claimant has charged the Government in his
                    petition and the Quartermaster's receipt that was given me corresponds precisely
                    with the amount charged by the Claimant in his petition the age of the horses is
                    state in the petition. The wheat mentioned in the Claimant's petition ws
                    threshed and in the barn and was worth at that time what I have charged the
                    Government, as well as the bacon and all other articles mentioned in the
                    Claimant's petition</p>
                <p>16 Witness says-I knew what was in the barn they did not take all. I measured
                    what was left behind which enabled me to know what was taken.</p>
                <p>19 Witness says-I am satisfied that the property which was taken, was taken for
                    the use of the government and for no other purpose.</p>
                <p>20 Witness says-The property was taken for the use of the Government</p>
                <p>21 Witness says-the articles were taken for the use of the Government because the
                    Government needed them</p>
                <p>22 Witness says-I know that it was taken for some purpose so necessary useful
                    beneficial or justifiable as to require the Government to pay for it</p>
                <p>23 Witness says-I do believe that the persons that took the property were
                    authorized, empowered, and justified in taking it or ordering it to be taken.</p>

                <p>Isaac Coffman a witness introduced by Martin Garber being duly sworn answereth as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>Questions by Commissioner</p>
                <p>1 How old are you where do you reside and what is your occupation? Answer I am
                    forty three years old I reside in Augusta County Virginia by occupation a
                    farmer.</p>
                <p>2 Do you know the claimant? Answer I have known him all my life time I reside in
                    a half mile of him. I saw him often during the war, he was loyal to the United
                    States during the war, he was so regarded by his neighbors. He <sup>always</sup> spoke in favor of the United States
                    Government</p>
                <p>3 Do you know any act done, or language used by the claimant which would have
                    prevented him from establishing his loyalty to the Confederacy, if it had been
                    maintained as a separate Government if so state the same particularly. Answer He
                    was too good a Union man to have been considered loyal to the Confederacy if it
                    had been maintained as a separate government</p>
