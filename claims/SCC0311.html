                    have known the Claimant about 14 years.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2d} Did you see him often during the War?</p>
                <p>Ans. I was intimate with him during the War. He, being my confidential friend
                    during that time - I was an adherent to the Union Cause and was so regarded by
                    the Claimant - The Claimant was a Union Man and so regarded by his neighbors, I
                    have heard him very much abused because of his Union sympathies - He contributed
                    nothing to the Union Army that I know of. I have heard threats of this kind
                    made, "That all such Union men ought to be driven out of the country." I never
                    knew him to do anything to aid the rebel Government.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3d} Do you know any act done or languages used by the Claimant which would

                    state the same particularly.</p>
                <p>Ans. I do not think he could have remained in the South at all, because of his
                    strong Union sentiments and sympathies.</p>

                    was the original owner of the property taken by the Union Army.</p>
                <p>Ans. I have known Mrs. Lydia Fishburn all my life, she is the mother of the
                    claimant, Daniel Fishburn. I saw both the claimant and his mother during the
                    War. They were both loyal to the United States Government, and so far as I know,
                    were so regarded by their neighbors. I never knew them to do anything to aid the
                    Union Army. I have not known either of them threatened with damage or injury,
                    except driven from the county because of their Union sentiments. I never knew of

                    taking and value of the property charged by the claimant in his petition, being
                    duly sworn Answereth as follows.</p>
                <p>ques. 1st} Witness Says Were you present when any of the Articles or
                    property specified in the claimants petition were taken?</p>
                <p>Answer. I was present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2d} Did you see any of them taken? If so, specify the articles you saw
                    taken.</p>
                <p>Answer - I saw all the articles named in the petition taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4th} When and where and by whom were the articles taken, which you say you
                    saw taken?</p>
                <p>Answer. The Articles were taken on the 7th day of June 1864 from my mothers farm.
                    The horses were taken by Gen<sup>l</sup> Averill's men, and the
                    other property was taken subsequently by soldiers of the United States Army but
                    I do not know whose command.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5th} Who were present when you saw them taken?</p>
                <p>Ans. No one except my mother.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6th} Was any United States officer, either commissioned or
                    non-commissioned, present at the taking? If so, state his name, rank regiment
                    and the command to which he belonged. Did he order the property to be taken? Did
                    he say anything about the taking?</p>
                <p>Ans. There was no officer present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7th} Witness says. One horse was taken out of the stable and one from the
                    plow in the field. The sheep were drove off and the other articles carried off.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8th} Witness says, All the articles except the horses and sheep, were
                    carried away on horses by the soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9th} Witness says. To their camp, which was near to my mother's farm, I did
                    not follow it to the camp, I did not see the property in the Camp but did see it
                    on its way.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10th} Witness says. I suppose it was taken for the use of soldiers and for
                    Army purposes. I did not see it used. I saw one of the horses the next day in
                    the use of the soldiers, but that was the only article of property I did see
                    after the taking.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11th} Witness says - I did not see any officer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12th} Witness says - That the soldiers told my mother, that if she would
                    come to Staunton, Va. she could get a receipt, but there was none ever asked
                    for, or received.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13th} Witness says. It was taken in the day time, the horses were taken in
                    the forenoon and the other articles in the afternoon. Nothing taken secretly.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14th} Witness says that when the horses were taken there was no camp nearer
                    than Staunton, but when the other articles were taken by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridans Army they encamped a 1/4 mile from the
                    house. They only remained one night - There had been no battle or skirmish near
                    there - I did not know any Quarter master or any officers of the Army for whom
                    the property was taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15th Witness says. The horses were in good condition and very valuable. The
                    Corn was taken partly from the crib and partly from the field which had been
                    husked and lying in the field. One horse was 5 years and the other 6 years old.
                    The sheep were very fat and large size. I do think that the charges in the
                    petition are not too high. I never talked with Claimant about the value.</p>
                <p>Ques 16th} Witness says I know the quantity of Corn cribbed and none had been
                    moved and supposed the quantity taken from the field - I saw it all taken and
                    removed, as it was taken in my presense.</p>
                <p>Ques. 19th} Witness says - I suppose it was all taken for the use of the Army,
                    and suppose they did need it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 20th} Witness says. That it was impossible for the Government to reach the
                    Army with the necessary supplies at that time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 21st} Witness says. I believe their necessitites compelled them to take it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 22d} Witness says I believe it was so useful and beneficial to the Army as
                    to warrant the Government in paying for it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 23d} Witness says. I believe that it was taken under orders, as the
                    soldiers said the were ordered to do so.</p>
                <p>Questions by the Commissioner</p>
                <p>Ques. 1st How old are you, where do you reside, What is your occupation and how
                    long have you known the claimant?</p>
