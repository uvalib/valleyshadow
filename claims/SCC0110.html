<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Peter Ellinger,
                            September 16, 1871, Claim No. 6477</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Ellinger's claim for over $200 worth of property was disallowed because he voted
                    in favor of secession and had two sons in the Confederate Army. He filed an
                    unsuccessful appeal with the Congressional Court of Claims in 1890.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claimant swears that he voted for the Ordinance of Secession under threats of
                    being driven away from his property, and that he was Compelled to serve in the

                <p>These acts are all more or less inconsistent with loyall
