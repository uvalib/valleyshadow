<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John B. Fauver,
                            August 26, 1871, Claim No. 1383</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Fauver's claim for 2 horses and a large quantity of bacon was disallowed because
                    he served in the state militia in 1861. He appealed this decision to the
                    Congressional Court of Claims in 1895.

                <p>William W. Cayson, a witness being introduced to prove
                    the taking and furnishing of the property named in claimants petition, being
                    duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Ques. 1<sup>st</sup> Witness says I am 43 years old. I reside in
                    Augusta Co. Va. by trade a Shoe-maker. I did not see the horses named in the
                    petition taken out of the Stable, but saw them in their possession, with
                    Saddles, bridles &amp; halters, after leaving the claimants house. I was
                    about 150 yards off when the property specified in the claimants petition were
                    taken.</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The Articles were taken in June
                    1864, from Claimants premises, by Genl. Crook's command.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup> Witness says There were Officers present when the
                    horses were carried off. An Officer called at my house for a drink of water and
                    I told him, that his men had taken claimants horses, and he replied that was
                    right, that they were obliged to keep up their cavalry and when they found good
                    horses they took them. Lieutenant Spindle was in company with the other Officer
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>8<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The property was moved by Soldiers.
                    They were rode off. The Army was marching in the direction of Lexington, Va.
                    when they took the property.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup> Witness says The property was taken for the use
                    of the United States Government. Lt. Spindle said it was taken for that purpose.</p>
                <p>11<sup>th</sup>. Witness says I did not hear of any complaint
                    from the claimant. The claimant said that he would rather the Union Army, had
                    his property, than the rebels.</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says There was no voucher or receipt
                    given or asked for, that I know of.</p>
                <p>13<sup>th</sup>. Witness says The property was taken in the day
                    time, about 10 Oclock A.M. publicly.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup>. Witness says When the property was taken the
                    Army was marching, and was a few days after the battle at Piedmont.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup>. Witness says, The horses were in very good
                    condition. One I suppose 6 or 7 years old and the other 9 years. I suppose one
                    horse was worth $100.00 and the other $95.00. The saddles worth about $15.00 The
                    Bridles $5.00 &amp; Halters $3.00. I know nothing about the Bacon, mentioned
                    in claimants petition.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says I think the property described in
                    the petition was taken for the use of the Army, and not for the mere
                    gratification of officers or soldiers.</p>
                <p>21<sup>st</sup>. Witness says I believe the property was taken,
                    in consequence of a necessity existing in the Army, which necessity justified
                    the soldiers in taking them.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup>. Witness Says I think it was taken for a purpose
                    so necessary that the Government ought to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup>. Witness says I think they had orders and
                    authority to take the property.</p>

                <p>I believe he was truly a loyal man to the United States Government and did
                    nothing against the Union cause except what he was forced to do. He was so
                    considered by all his loyal neighbors. I am satisfied that he did nothing
                    against the United States Government, voluntarily, and had no opportunity to do
                    for it. He did nothing for the Confederate Government voluntarily. I do not

                    Cause and Government of the United States, and conscientiously opposed to the
                    Confederate Government, its officers and adherants, that in serving said
                    Confederate Government, it was through compulsion, that he used strenuous
                    endurances to escape therefrom, and availed himself at the earliest moment, of
                    the opportunity to do so. I do not think there can be any question of his
                    loyalty. I also find him to be a highly respected citizen, and the greatest
                    reliance is placed in any statement made by him, and I fully believe his claim
                    for property taken by the US forces to be a just and correct one. I have no
                    interest in said claim.</p>

                <p>I have to certify that I have known Jon B. Fauber for a number of years, and
                    believe him to be a sound Union man. I was not present when he refused to vote
                    for secession but often heard him say that he did not vote long
                    before he thought of being advantaged by claiming loyalty. he was a fellow
                    officer of the Malitia line with myself, and his
                    efficiency in that capacity, would readily have given him a place in the
                    Volunteer ranks this he never sought nor did he go <sup>to the
                        Army</sup>untill compelled to do so and then he only
                    served till he could procure a substitute which was his only way to get out
                    except to desert which he did not like on account of his family which hung alone
                    on him for support but I will also state that he proposed desertion to me once
                    while we were together in the army but we were both rather afraid to undertake
                    it at that time and he has often been reproached by the opposite party which is
                    a good evidence of loyalty. And to to make this evidence have the
                    desired effect and to assure you that it comes from the pen of a Union man I
                    will state that I was forced into the confederate ranks at the same time and I
                    left and went to the North after being in the army the short time of four weeks.

                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va. during the late war of the
                    rebellion.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim, and in their report to Congress
                    state:-- "Claimant served some weeks in the Militia of the State in the summer
                    of '61, and afterwards served in the Provost service in Staunton, three weeks,
                    and them employed a substitute for the Confederate
                    service. We reject the claim".</p>
                <p>The claim was then transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, Feb.
                    16th, 1892.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Aug. '71.</p>
                <p>J.B. FAUVER testifies: Age 41; residence Augusta Co., Va., Cabinet maker and
                    undertaker. I resided in Augusta Co., for six months prior to April '61. Have
                    received here for 14 years. Never passed beyond the military or naval lines of
                    the U.S. into the rebel lines. Never took any oath to the Confederate states.
                    Taken the amnesty oath in '65. (P. 2). After the surrender. Not been pardoned.
                    Never directly or indirectly connected with the Confederate states. Never held
                    any place of trust, profit or honor under the Confederate states. I was 21 days
                    in the state militia in July '61, and subsequently all were ordered out as
                    militia and remained about 10 days. I never was an officer, soldier or marine in
                    the military or navy of the Confederacy. I furnished a substitute for the
                    Confederacy. I served before getting a substitute about three weeks in the
                    Provost service at Staunton, Va., but in no way connected with any other
                    Department. I never had chargre of any suppiies, teams, etc., in the service of
                    the Confederacy. I did work with a man who had a contract with the Government. I
                    never furnished any supplies, stores or property of any kind for the
                    Confederacy. (P. 3). I never gave any information to any officer or soldier of
                    the Confederate army. Worked for a man who had a contract to furnish saddle
                    trees.. Never employed in the collection of stores, etc. for the Confederacy.
                    Never engaged in blockade running. Had no interest in any goods brought into or
                    exported from the Confederate states. I did not leave the Confederate states
                    between the 19th of April '61 adn June 19th, '65. I would
                    have left when the Federal troops come, but my wife was sick, and it prevented
                    me. Was arrested by the Confederates in '64 at Staunton, Va. by Capt. Crank, of
                    the Confederate Army. (P. 4). Kept under arrest about three weeks. Took no oath
                    to the Confederate Govt. to effect my release. Never arrested by the U.S. Govt.
                    None of my property was ever taken by the Confederate Authorities.</p>
                <p>I was threatened with hanging because I refused to vote for secession. I never
                    was injured or damaged, except a refusal to give me work because of my Union
                    sentiments. Never contributed any money or property in aid of the U.S. cause.
                    Had cousins both in the Union and Confederate army. Did nothing to supply them
                    with equipments or money. Never did anything to support the credit of the
                    Confederate states. I never gave aid and comfort to the rebellion. Never engaged
                    in making raids in Canada, or in the destruction of the commerce of the U.S. (P.
                    5). Never engaged in holding in custody any person taken as prisoner of war.
                    Never a member of any society to persecute any person on account of their
                    loyalty to the U.S. Never a paroled prisoner of the U.S. Never held any office
                    in the U.S. nor educated at any military or naval school of the U.S. I received
                    a pass from Capt. Avis, Provost Marshal to go to my home to obtain the pass I
                    did not swear obedience to the Confederate states. Under no disabilities. Did
                    not take the iron clad oath. (P. 6). My sympathies were with the Union and not
                    the rebellin If I had fought at all I would have
                    done so for the Union. I did not vote at all on the ordinance of secession.
                    After the ordinance of secession was adopted, I adhered to the Union cause all
                    the time. Solemnly declare from the beginning of hostilities against the U.S. to
                    the end, I was constantly in sympathy for the Union, and was willing and ready
                    at all times to aid the cause of the Union so far as in my power. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>GEO. RUBUSH testifies: Age 60; residence Augusta Co., Va., Farmer. I have known
                    the claimant for 12 years. Resided about 2 miles from him. Saw him often during
                    the war. and had frequent conversations about the war during its progress. I
                    believe he was truly a loyal man to the U.S. Govt. and did nothing against the
                    Union cause, except what he was forced to do. He was so considered by all his
                    loyal neighbors. I am satisfied he did nothing against the U.S. Govt.
                    voluntarily, and had no opportunity to do for it. He did nothing for the
                    Confederate Govt. voluntarily. I don't believe he could have remained in the
                    South, had the Confederacy maintained a separate Govt.</p>
                <p>WM. W. CASON testifies: Age 41; residence Augusta Co., Va., shoemaker. I have
                    known the claimant about 15 years. Saw him frequently during the war. He was
                    considered loyal to the U.S. Govt. during the war. I believe he was as good <sup>a</sup> loyal man, as to be found any where in Va. and so
                    regarded his neighbors. (P. 12). I believe he was too loyal to the U.S. Govt. to
                    have been regarded as at all loyal to the Confederacy. He would have left the
                    South if it had succeeded in gaining a separate Govt. (P. 13).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court in Aug. 1895.</p>
                <p>J.S. ENGLEMAN testifies: Farmer; age 47; residence near Middlebrook, Va. Not
                    interested or related. (P. 1). I have been acquainted with the claimant all my
                    life, ever since I was a boy. I resided about 2-1/2, miles from claimant, and
                    knew him well throughout the war. I saw him once a week, just in ordinary course
                    of business. I did not have talks with him personally about the war, but he
                    always expressed himself to others as a Union man, and did so throughout. I was
                    but a boy then, but my father was a Union man and I was the same way. Claimant
                    was known as a Union man by the whole community. He did all he could, to aid the
                    Union cause of course. (P. 2). If he did anything to aid the Confederate cause,
                    it was under compulsion. I have heard him say that he did not vote for
                    secession, but don't know of it to my own knowledge . There was no change in his
                    views. He continued a strong Union man throughout the war. I don't know of his
                    being arrested during the war, nor that he was threatened.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I never heard him say he has a pass from Capt. Avis, and don't know he had. I
                    don't know if he took the oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He was too good
                    a Union man to do that. He didn't want no war at all. (P. 3). I don't know
                    whether he did anything for the Union or not. I suppose he did what he could.
                    Had no chance to do anything here. My father has a claim, I am the Adm'r. I don't know anything claimant ever did
                    against a a Confederate soldier. Claimant was drafted and I think he was at
                    Staunton on provost duty, and again he was detailed to make saddle trees for the
                    Confederacy, and again he was detailed to make stirrups for the Confederacy. He
                    just did this to keep out of it. Couldn't say how long he was detailed as
                    provost at Staunton. I don't know how long he was detailed as saddle tree
                    maker,. I have heard him say that he served as detail making saddle trees at
                    Bridge Water, Va., from July to Feb. '64-5 and was sent home as detail to make
                    stirrups. I have heard you, (meaning Govt. Atty) ask claimant's attorney to
                    allow you to cross-examine the claimant, and claimant's attorney declined. (P.
                    4).</p>
                <p>J.B. CARWELL testifies: Farmer; age 52; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not interested
                    or related. (P. 5). I have been acquainted with the claimant ever since my
                    earliest childhood. My acquaintance was intimate with him, and I lived about a
                    half mile from him. Saw him often, that I could keep no account of that. I
                    conversed with claimant frequently, and he always expressed himself on the Union
                    side. Talked to me alone, and not in the presence of others, except a few.
                    Claimant had a fine reputation for loyalty. He aided the the Union cause by
                    keeping out of the Confederate cause. Anything he may have done for Confederate
                    cause was compulsory. I heard it generally said that he did not vote for
                    secession. He exerted his influence on side of the Union. His views did not
                    change a bit in the world. I don't know of claimant being arrested, except what
                    I heard from other parties. It was told me such was the case. I heard
                    considerable talk of claimant threatening with hanging for voting against
                    secession. Claimant was injured very considerably in business for his
                    well known sentiments. I think claimant was threatened with violence by his
                    Confederate neighbors.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken on behalf of the defense on Aug. 14th, 1895.</p>
                <p>JOHN B. FAUVER testifies: merchant; age 65; residence Middlebrook, am the
                    claimant. (P. 1). I never was in the Confederate service as a soldier, and never
                    was on their pay roll. I was here with the militia about three weeks. I said I
                    came with the militia and they made up a quota of volunteers, bit I did not volunteer. When they conscripte I was ordered to report in Staunton, and I did so. And
                    was sent down the valley with other men. We go down as far as Naked Creek; there
                    we were ordered back to Staunton. We got back here in the night, and all went up
                    in the Court house for to stay all night. In the morning when I went to go out,
                    I found a guard at the door and could not get out. After that several days I
                    sent to the provost marshal, how I came to be there. He sent for me and I told
                    him how it was, that I had reported for duty according to order, and found
                    myself under guard. He told me that he would take me out on certain conditions.
                    (P. 2). He said I asked him what the conditions were, and he said, provided I
                    would serve on Provost duty, he would take me out. I told him of course I would
                    sooner be out than in the guard house and I would do as he said, as I was under
                    his control. He thereupon made me provost here at Staunton. I served about three
                    weeks, I think. The next thing I done was to hire a substitute and went home. I
                        staid home, and according to my papers after I had
                    hired a substitute, I could do as I pleased, and go where I pleased My business
                    was cabinet making; and undertaking, and when a man died, I would bury him. The
                    next thing was I was made subject to the army. My substitute papers were of no
                    account to me any more after they passed the act making every body who had
                    furnished a substitute liable to service himself. I was then ordered to report
                    in here at Staunton to the enrolling officer. I reported, as I had to report or
                    leave my home, and when I reported, some one reported me as a Union man, to the
                    enrolling officer, and he held me under guard, and kept me over night, he said
                    there were against me as disloyal to the Confederacy, and I told him all he had
                    to do was to prove them. I told him contrary to the laws. I always abided by the
                    laws of the land, whether it was the law of the Confederacy, or any law. They
                    could establish that I was dangerous and they had to turn me loose. (P. 3). Then
                    they detailed me to work at Bridge water in the shop of a Mr. Allemong, who
                    furnished saddles and saddle trees to the Government. Here I worked from July to
                    the 2nd of Feb. Then Mr. Allemong gave me permission to to home at Middlebrook,
                    to make stirrups for him. I made the stirrups, but he never got any of them, and
                    I had them at my home till after the surrender, when I sold them to any one who
                    wished to buy, and got something for them, whereas, if I had sold them or turned
                    them over to Mr. Allemong I would not have gotten anything for them. I was sent
                    home one time, and think the Sergeant of the Provost Marshal gave me a pass.
                    They told me if men came along by my house and called for me to go with them to
                    hunt certain deserters to do so. I never went with them. I staid home until expiration of my pass and came back. I don't
                    remember signing any petition, though I may have. There was a blacksmith at
                    Middlebrook named Dan'l. Carroll. I was friendly
                    with him. The citizens of Middlebrook requested the Confederacy for my exemption
                    as an undertaker. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>In answer to question by notary, witness states: I know I was a Union man and
                    didn't vote for the ordinance of secession at all, although there were threats
                    made against all Union men saying that they would drive them all out of the
                    country, when the war was over and the Confederacy would gain their
                    independence. I told them I was willing to take chances on that, as I did not
                    think that would be ever.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Mr. Fauber was 31 years old in '61. Lived in Augusta Co., Va., during the war,
                    business cabinet maker and undertaker. He was not in the Confederate service,
                    except for a short time in the State Militia. This service was not voluntary. He
                    furnished a substitute to avoid service. He would have left with the Federal
                    troops when they came into his section, but for his wife being sick. He was
                    arrested by the Confederates in '64, kept under arrest about three weeks. He was
                    threatened with being hung, for refusing to vote for secession. Did not vote on
                    the ordinance of secession, was for the Union in '61, after the ordinance of
                    secession was adopted he still adhered to the Union cause all the time..</p>
                <p>Claimant did not volunteer for service. He was under guard after being
                    conscripted. There is nothing to indicate voluntary service, and he was
                    compelled to furnish a substitute or be a soldier himself.</p>
                <p>In his expressions during the war he at all times favored the Union cause. and he
                    was considered by all his neighbors as a loyal citizen of the U.S.</p>
                <p>His witnesses also corroborate his statement as to being drafted or forced into
                    the service. Also as to his being threatened.</p>
                <p>It is respectfully submitted, the foregoing testimony justifies a favorable
                    finding on loyalty.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1986.</p>
                <p>John B. Fauver vs. The United States. No. 8552, Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The evidence is correctly abstracted in claimant's brief on loyalty.</p>
                <p>It appears from claimant's own testimony (pp. 1 &amp; 7 clmts. brief) that he
                    did not vote at all on the ordinance of secession, and that he spent almost the
                    entire period of the war in the civil or military service of the Confederate
                    Government. Of course he says he did this under compulsion but he does not show
                    a single act of violence to him. In fact when he says he was conscripted into
                    the army or impressed into any civil service he couples it with the statement
                    that he was merely "ordered to report at Staunton" or some similar order and
                    that he obeyed.</p>
                <p>The testimony of his other witnesses add nothing to his case, and I
                    respectfuly submit that he should be found not loyal.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Reply to Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1895-96.</p>
                <p>J.B. Fauver, vs. The United States No. 8552 Cong.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>Defendant's counsel would have the Court believe that the claimant rendered
                    voluntary service in the Militia of Va. and thereby aided the rebellion.</p>
                <p>Now it is contended that this service is not voluntary. The claimant belonged to
                    the militia before the war. The militia were ordered into service by the Gov. of
                    the State The claimant was ordered by his commanding Officer. This order he had
                    to obey He could not disregard it with safety. His furnishing a substitute was
                    also involuntary. He could not have escaped service without doing so. In fact it
                    is evident that this man never voluntary did
                    anything for the Confederacy. He was strongly for the Union all through the war.
                    He was threatened with being hung because he refused to vote for secession..</p>
                <p>His witnesses testify that he always expressed himself as a Union man; that his
                    reputation was that of a Union man "by the whole community".</p>
                <p>The testimony also shows that he was detailed to work at making saddle trees for
                    the Confederacy. He certainly had to accept this detail or go to the front</p>
                <p>This claimant was certainly loyal in sentiment, expression and conduct during the
                    war so far as it was safe.</p>
