<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimants loyalty is established, by his own statements, and the testimony of
                        W<sup>m</sup> Andrews, and
                    B.F. Bayly.</p>
                <p>He aided several Union prisoners to escape, furnished money to deserters from the
                    Rebel Army. He was generally regarded as a loyal man, and was hardly safe in the
                    Country during the War, and now that the War is over, he is shunned by the
                    Rebels.</p>
                <p>The horses were taken from his premises by soldiers of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Command, in June
                    1864, while the Army was stationed a few miles off at Staunton.</p>
                <p>We allow the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

                <p>Ques. 1. Witness Says: I am 70 years old. I reside in Augusta CoV<sup>a</sup>. I am a Farmer. I was present when the articles mentioned in
                    claimants petition were taken.</p>
                <p>2. Witness says: I saw them taken, one brown mare, &amp; one black mare</p>
                <p>4. Witness Says: The property was taken in June 1864 by officers &amp;
                    Soldiers of Genl. Hunters Army from the claimants
                    farm. There was an officer present.</p>
                <p>5. Witness says, A man named David Stultz was present &amp; saw them taken.</p>
                <p>6. Witness says: There was an officer present. Do not know his name, rank or
                        regt. he belonged to the command of Genl. Hunter of the US Army.</p>
                <p>7. Witness says: One was taken from the field &amp; one from the plow. I told
                    them we had obeyed Presdt. Lincoln's
                    proclamation, &amp; it should protect our (claimants) property. We had never
                    put any thing out of the way. The officer said he was compelled to take them,
                    &amp; that my son should be paid for them.</p>
                <p>8. Witness says, The officer rode the black mare, &amp; the brown mare was
                    ridden off by a soldier</p>
                <p>9. Witness says, The property was taken in the direction of Lexington I went
                    about a mile with them. I did not see it afterwards.</p>
                <p>10. Witness says, The officer said it was taken for the use of the army</p>
                <p>11. Witness says: There was no complaint made on account of the taking</p>
                <p>12. Witness says, There was no receipt asked for &amp; none given.</p>
                <p>13. Witness says, The property was taken before 12 oclock, in the day, it was not
                    taken secretly.</p>
                <p>14. Witness says, When the property was taken, the army was about 4 miles off at
                    Staunton. Hunters &amp; Averills men were encamped at Staunton, staid I think two days. Had not been any battle or
                    skirmish near except at Piedmont, 12 miles off, did not know the Quarter Marters
                    or any of them.</p>
                <p>15. Witness Says, The property was in good condition. One black mare was either 4
                    or 5 years old, was worth One hundred &amp; fifty dollars. One brown mare,
                    was worth one hundred &amp; fifty dollars, was about 10 years old.</p>
                <p>19. Witness says, I know the property was taken for the use of the Govt. &amp; not for private use, the officer
                    said so.</p>
                <p>20. Witness say, I think it was taken for the use of the Govt. &amp; for no other purpose. I have reason to believe the
                    black mare was used by Genl. Hunter I was told so
                    by several persons who saw her</p>
                <p>21. Witness Says, I believe the necessity of the army compelled them to take the
                    property, the officer told me so</p>
                <p>22. Witness says: I believe it was taken for the necessary use of the Govt. &amp; it should pay for it.</p>
                <p>23. Witness says: I think the officer who took them had orders to take them for
                    the use of the army. The officer said so, &amp; refused to give her up for
                    money or anything else, as he needed them, &amp; further this deponent

                    man. Every body who knew him regarded him as a loyal man. He has been shunned
                    &amp; avoided by men around him on account of his union sentiments. I have

                    lines, &amp; he helped them go away. Never knew him to do any thing for the

                    was too loyal to the United States Govt. to have
                    been loyal to the Confed.Govt. had it succeeded, he told me, we would all

                    him nearly every day, &amp; talked with him frequently about the war. He was
                    loyal to the USGovt. &amp; was so regarded by his neighbors. I do not know that he
                    was injured in person, but his grain was taken by the Confederates, on account
                    of his being a Union Man. I tried several to induce him to take Confederate
                    Money, but he allways refused, saying he had no
                    confidence in it. I do not know that he had any chance to do anything for the
                        USGovt.
                    he never left his home when the US troops
                    came in. Never knew him to do anything for the Confederate Govt. I know that he was hardly safe in staying at
                    his home during the war, &amp; had the Confederates succeeded I do not think
                    he could have stayed at all. He never would have made a loyal citizen to the
                    Confederate Government, &amp; further this deponent sayeth not.</p>
