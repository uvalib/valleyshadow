<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of George L. Arehart,
                            1872, Claim No. 1,377</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                George Arehart (or Archart) submitted his claim for $160.00 in 1872, but the
                    claim was disallowed because he had voted in favor of secession and purchased a
                    substitute for Confederate service, and the Commission held him disloyal. He
                    appealed the charge of disloyalty in a brief filed with the Congressional Court
                    of Claims on December 14, 1895.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claimant swears that he provided a substitute to the Rebel Army in order to stay
                    at home with his family.</p>
                <p>This was equivalent to personal service in the ranks and was an act of aid and

                    bacon taken from the house. Mother said don't take all the bacon, they said we
                    leave you 3 pieces, that was enough. Told them Father was in Indianna &amp; was loyal to the U.S. Govt.</p>
                <p>8 Witness says, The horse was led away the flour was carried in bags, &amp;

                    useful, as to warrant the Govt. in paying for it.</p>

                    loyal Citizen of the U.S. Early in 1864, he refugeed from his home, owing to
                    persecution for his Union sentiments. And never by act or deed furnished aid or
                    support in any manner to the Confederate Government, its officers or adherents.</p>

                <p>Geo. L. Archart, vs. The United States No. 8720 Cong.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the late war.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim, and in their report to Congress
                    state:--</p>
                <p>"Claimant swears to that he furnished a substitute in the rebel army in order to
                    stay at home with his family</p>
                <p>This was equivalent to personal service in the ranks, and was an act of aid and
                    comfort to the rebellion inconsistent with the claim of continuous loyalty
                    during the war.</p>
                <p>We reject the claim."</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claimd, March 12th, 1892.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Sept. '71.</p>
                <p>GEO. L. ARCHART testifies: Age 43; residence Augusta
                    Co., Va. Have lived here during my life, except five months during the war when
                    I was in Ind. I left the Confederate states in Jan. '64, and went to Montgomery
                    Co., Ind. I am a farmer. When Gen. Hunter occupied Staunton, I got a pass from
                    the U.S. army and went to my home in Augusta Co.. Did not go away again during
                    the war. Can't hardly tell whether I took an oath of allegiance to the
                    Confederate states. (P.2). Took the amnesty oath in '65, in Staunton, Va. It was
                    required of all. Have never been pardoned by the President. Never directly or
                    indirectly connected with the civil service at the Confederate states. Never
                    held any office under the Confederate states. Never in any capacity in the
                    military or naval service of the Confederate states. Never an officer or soldier
                    in the army or navy of the Confederate states. I furnished a substitute, in
                    order to stay with my family. In no manner employed in any department of the
                    Confederate Govt. (P.3). Never had charge of any stores, etc., for the
                    Confederate Govt. Did not furnish any aid, stores or supplies of any kind to the
                    Confederate Govt. In no manner employed in the manufacture of goods for the
                    Confederate Govt. Neither directly or indirectly employed in the collection or
                    impressment of supplies to the Confederate Govt. Had no interst or share in contracts for the Confederate Govt. Never
                    engaged in blockade running. (P.4).</p>
                <p>I left the Confederate states the 24th of Jan. '64 and went to Ind. Did so to
                    avoid service in the Confederate Govt. Was absent five months and a half.
                    Engaged while there in farming. Returned to my home in Augusta Co., in July '64.
                    Neither the owner or part owner of any vessel engaged in navigating the waters
                    of the Confederate Govt. Never arrested by the Confederate Govt. Was arrested by
                    the U.S. Govt. on my way home at Harpers Ferry. Released by proving my loyalty
                    to the U.S. Govt. I had a horse taken by the Confederate Govt., which they kept
                    six weeks. I got it back in six weeks, but received no pay. Never threatened
                    with injury to my person or property on account of my Union sentiments. I
                    contributed nothing in aid of the Union cause. (P.5). Had relatives in both
                    Union and Confederate armies. Did nothing to supply them with military
                    equipments. Never held any Confederate bonds, or did anything to support its
                    credit. Have never given aid nor comfort to the rebellion. Never engaged in
                    raiding into the U.S. from Canada. Never engaged in holding in custody any
                    person taken as prisoner of war by the Confederate Govt. Never a member of any
                    society for the expulsion or persecution of any person on account of loyalty to
                    the U.S. Never a paroled prisoner of the U.S. Never held any office in either
                    the army or Navy of the U.S.. (P. 6). Received a pass from the Union forces, but
                    none from the Confederate Govt. Under no disabilities. Held no office under the
                    U.S. since the war. At the beginning of the war I had no sympathies for the
                    rebellion. I voted for the ordinance of secession, was forced to it, and knew
                    nothing of secession. Would have given fifty dollars in silver to have recalled
                    it. After the adoption of the ordinance of secession, I was for the Union, and
                    not for my state. Solemnly declares from the beginning to the end of the war his
                    sympathies were with the U.S. Was at all times ready and willing to aid the
                    Union cause. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>JACOB BOWMAN testifies: Age 36; residence Augusta Co., Miller. Have known the
                    claimant 26 years. resde within two miles of him. Saw
                    him often during the war. Talked with him about the war. I considered him loyal
                    to the U.S. Govt. during the war, and he was so regarded by his loyal neighbors.
                    Don't know him to do anything for the U.S. Govt. except to go through the lines.
                    He put a substitute in the Confederate Govt. He had to do so to keep out of the
                    army. Heard of his being threatened, but don't think he was molested. I think he
                    was too loyal to the U.S. Govt. to have been loyal to the rebel govt. had it
                    succeeded. (P.11).</p>
                <p>DAVID THORNTON testifies: Age 62; residence Augusta Co., Farmer. Have known the
                    claimant about 15 years. Did not see much of him the first part of the war, but
                    the latter part of the war I saw him frequently. Did not talk with him much. So
                    far as I know he was loyal to the U.S. Govt. I don't know whether he was so
                    regarded by his loyal neighbors. Did not live in his immediate neighborhood.
                    Didn't know him to do anything for the U.S. or Confederate Govt. He was too
                    loyal to the Govt. of the U.S. to have been loyal to the South had it succeeded.
                    (P.12).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claimant to the
                    Court, in Aug. 1895.</p>
                <p>JACOB BOWMAN testifies: Farmer; age 60; residence Arbor Hill, Va. Not interested,
                    connected by marriage. (P. 1). Claimant was considered a Union man, as far as I
                    knew him, and I think I knew all about him. He was regarded as "all right" by
                    his loyal neighbors. I know that. I know of nothing very special he did to aid
                    the Union army. He hired a substitute. He was bound to do it or leave the
                    country. It took all the money had had to do it with too. I don't know how he
                    voted in '61, but he exerted his influence against secession. He was the same
                    clear through. I know all about it. (P.2). My acquaintance with the claimant
                    began when I was a small boy. Have known him all my life. Acquanitance intimate
                    during the war. Lived about four miles from him. Saw him tolerable often,
                    frequently. Just saw him in the ordinary course of business. We sometimes got
                    into ticklish places and I didn't see him then often. He said "I'll be damned if
                    we don't whip the Confederacy out inside of six months." I suppose he expressed
                    himself that way to me hundreds of times. He expressed himself to me alone as
                    far as I recollect, though there may have sometimes been intimate friends
                    present. I was an adherent of the Union cause, and known as such to the
                    claimant. (P. 3). He went through the lines into Ind., early in '64. He did this
                    to avoid service in the Confederacy. He returned in about six months. Was
                    threatened with search of his house after returning from Ind., and had to go
                    into hiding. I furnished him flour and bacon during that time. From Christmas
                    until the surrender he remained in hiding Claimant was not a dunkard. Not
                    molested, except they talked of taking him to the army. (P. 4). The majority of
                    people in our community voted for secession, because they didn't know what they
                    were doing. Nine-tenths of Augusta Co., didn't know what secession meant. Don't
                    think people voted for secession, thinking the North seeing us solid, would
                    allow us peaceable to go out. I have a claim like this. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>WM. BOSSERMAN testifies: Age 69; farmer; not interested, connected by marriage.
                    (P.6). Claimant's reputation was that of a Union man. That was the reason the
                    Confederates like to cotch him. Loyal men regarded him as one of themselves, and
                    they furnished him supplies when hiding. Don't know anything he did to aid the
                    Union army, except to keep from fighting the Union side. He didn't aid the
                    Confederate Govt. Did hire a substitute to keep from from fighting. When
                    substitute's time out he went to the mountains and hid himself. Don't know how
                    he voted. He got stronger in his Union sentinments as the war went on. (P.7).
                    Have known claimant ever since early boyhood. His farm joined mine. Saw him
                    often. Two or three times a week, sometimes not so often. In conversations he
                    was bitter down on the Confederacy, and the war. Conversed generally alone, as
                    he wanted to keep his sentiments quiet from the Confederates. I was not a Union
                    man. (P.8). He went away, did not remain in the Confederacy through the war.
                    Went West. Came back but did not come home. Was hiding in the mountains until
                    the close of the war. He went away to avoid service in the Confederate army</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>GEO. L. ARCHART testifies: Claimant; farmer; (P. 1). I voted for secession. Was
                    plowing near sundown on the day of the election. Meredith Hogshead and Joe Fix
                    came and told me I had to go and vote. Told them I didn't want to, as I didn't
                    understand secession, and didn't want to vote. They took me one by each arm and
                    pulled me over to the voting place and they voted for me. I didn't vote as they
                    called my name out. The plow field was about two miles from the polls. After
                    finishing plowing that day, went to Middlebrook to get a plow share. As soon as
                    I got in the village store they came and took me by the arms to the polls and
                    voted for me. I didn't understand it. They gave my vote in for me. They were not
                    enemies of mine, they were friends. I did not make fun of it. We were boys
                    together. No threats were made I did not remonstrate to the Commissioners of the
                    election for counting that vote. I did not go when the militia were called out.
                    Cut my foot with an axe about that time Didn't report the accident, but they
                    never came after me. Never called on me but once after that. Then I went West.
                    (P. 2). That was in '64. Mr. Bowman put the substitute in for me, I think in (62
                    when my foot was cut. Bowman was my brother-in-law. He paid $230 when he put him
                    in. I was to pay Bowman back. The young man close to Bowman wanted to go in.
                    Bowman said I would have to go in as soon as I got well, or put in a substitute.
                    Thought he could get me one. I was not able to get out, done it to stay with my
                    family. I had no negroes to fight for and that was what it was about. Rather
                    hire some one than stand up and get shot at. The substitute was furnished as I
                    have stated. By my brother-in-law. That was the first time I heard of war, and
                    didn't know anything about it. (P. 3). I did not want to help the Confederacy.
                    Wanted to stay with my family. Was a married man. Had I not been married, I
                    would not have hired a substitute, or fought for the Confederacy, either. I
                    would have left the Country. I assisted 12 through the lines at one time.
                    Confederate Capt., Lt. and 10 privates. I left the Confederate lines myself with
                    16 others. I helped soldiers to get through and assisted deserters in getting
                    through the lines.</p>
                <p>SUMMARY</p>
                <p>The Commissioners base their disloyalty finding upon the claimant furnishing a
                    substitute. He says he furnished a substitute in order to stay with his family.
                    He finally however, had to leave the Confederacy in Jan. '64 and go to Ind. in
                    order to avoid service in the Confederate army He was never threatened on
                    account of his Union semtiments. Had relatives in both armies. Owned no bonds
                    Received passes from the Union forces. None from the Confederates. Had no
                    sympathies with the rebellion in '61. Voted for the ordinance of secession
                    because he was forced to. Continued loyal throughout the war.</p>
                <p>His witnesses testify that he had to put a substitute in to keep out of the army.
                    That they heard of his being threatened. That his reputation was that of a Union
                    man during the war.</p>
                <p>One of the witnesses state that he was bound to put in a substitute or leave the
                    country.</p>
                <p>That he expressed Union sentiments throughout the war. They also state that he
                    went through the lines to Ind. early in '64 to avoid service in the Confederacy.
                    That he hid out to avoid service.</p>
                <p>The testimony shows that he was justified in furnishing a substitute, and that
                    his vote for secession was not a voluntary act.</p>
                <p>The proof of loyalty is strong and convincing.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1896.</p>
                <p>Geo. L. Arehart vs. The United States. No. 8720, Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>The evidence is correctly abstracted in claimant's brief on loyalty.</p>
                <p>Claimant resided during the war at Middlebrook, Augusta County, Va. and by his
                    own showing voted for the ordinance of secession and without any coercion
                    whatever voluntarily furnished a substitute in the Confederate army. (Claimant's
                    brief pp. 2, 3, &amp; 7)</p>
                <p>He says in explanation of his vote that he was plowing in the field and two
                    neighbors came and took him one by each arm to the polls and voted
                    for him and that he did not understand the question.</p>
                <p>When his attention is called to the fact that his field was two miles from the
                    polls he changes that part of the story about plowing and says that he had gone
                    into Middlebrook on business when his neighbors forced him to vote and admits
                    that the whole matter was friendly. This was clearly a voluntary vote.</p>
                <p>In regard to the substitute he says (p. 7) that at the time he furnished one he
                    was himself disabled temporarily and was not liable to conscription. He
                    introduces no evidence even tending to show that he was in any manner coerced.</p>
                <p>He proves that in 1864 he left the Confederate lines to avoid service and did
                        not put himself in their power again. This was a loyal act and if
                    it had been done in 1861 instead of 1864 it might be of some account to claimant
                    now. As it is however, claimant was clearly disloyal prior to 1864 and it is not
                    material to enquire what he was after that date.</p>
                <p>There is on file in the C.S. Archives a voucher showing that claimant sold to the
                    Confederate Q.M. at Staunton, Va. 40 bushels of oats fro
                    which he received $80.00.</p>

                <p>REPLY TO DEFT' S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>I do not agree with defendant's counsel that the claimant had any intention of
                    making a wrong impression in stating that he was plowing at the time his
                    neighbors two of them took him to the poolls and voted
                    for him (as he represents it)</p>
                <p>It will be observed that claimant in his first deposition taken in 1871 states
                    that he voted for the ordinance of secession, but was forced to do it, and knew
                    nothing of secession. In his second deposition taken in 1895, being called as a
                    witness by the defendants he proceeds to explain how it happened that he voted
                    as he did and says that he was plowing that day, the day of the election, and
                    that two of his neighbors giving their names came to him and said he had to go
                    and vote. He told them he didn't want to do it. Didn't understand secession and
                    didn't want to vote, and they took him one by each arm and pulled him over to
                    the voting place and they voted for him. He adds that he didn't vote as they
                    called his name out.</p>
                <p>Now this answer shows very clearly that the claimant was at the time right at the
                    voting place, or very near there, hence his further explanation is entirely
                    consistent, that is that he had finished plowing and had gone to Middle Brook
                    the voting place for a plow share, and that these two neighbors of his came to
                    where he was in the Village store at Middle Brook and took him by the arms to
                    the polls and voted</p>
                <p>Now I see nothing inconsistent in the answers to these different questions. The
                    first answer certainly implies that he was at Middle Brook at the time they took
                    him to the polls, and not in the field plowing, as he had been during the day.</p>
                <p>The next point made by defendant's counsel is in regard to a substitute.</p>
                <p>When he put his substitute into the Conf. service he was temporarily laid up at
                    this house with an injured foot, and a friend of his came to his house and told
                    him that as soon as his foot got well he would have to go into the service or
                    put in a substitute, and his friend further stated that he thought he could get
                    one for him. And he did get one. This friend was his brother-in-law. Claimant
                    adds that he didn't at the time know anything about substitutes.</p>
                <p>Now it is evident that neither of these acts were performed with the design of
                    aiding the rebellion. There was no criminal intent, and it is not to be believed
                    for one moment that Mr. Arehart, a decided Union man as he was, not only a Union
                    man but <u>actively loyal to the U.S.</u> would of his
                    own volition do anything with the intention of aiding the rebellion. Just see
                    what he did for the Union army.</p>
                <p>He assisted 12 men to go through the lines at one time and when he left the
                    Confederacy 16 others went with him. He assisted deserters in getting through
                    the lines. He had no slaves. Had no interest in common with the Confederacy. He
                    should be found loyal throughout the war.</p>
                <p>Respectfully Submitted, Gilbert Moyers Atty. for
                Clmt.</p>
