                <p>The claimant is about 75 years of age &amp; a resident of Augusta Co. Va.
                    where he resided during the war. He had a son in the Confederate Army, and the
                    evidence he produces of his loyalty is weak and utterly devoid of important
                    &amp; significant facts. He says the Confederates took two wagons from him
                    &amp; paid for them. Men with Union sentiments were generally well known in
                    the Shenandoah valley &amp; the Confederates did not pay Union men for their
                    property. He calls two witnesses - one of them a Colored man &amp; formerly
                    his slave, the other admits that he was in sympathy with the south. No union man
                    is called to testify &amp; Mr. Lushbaugh must be well known to them, or some
                    of them at least. While there is nothing in the evidence showing affirmatively
                    that the claimant was a secessionist, there is not enough in it to remove all
                    doubts. And this source of information does remove the doubt - Mr. Lushbaugh
                    says he did not vote on the ratification of the ordinance of secession - the
                    record of votes cast in Augusta Co. on that question shows that he did vote, and
                    voted in favor of the ordinance. He must have been disloyal &amp; the claim
                    is disallowed.</p>

                <p>Ques 38 Ans. I never had a pass from the Confederate Government, had no need for
                    one.</p>
                <p>Ques 39 Ans. I was under no disabilities imposed by the 14th Amendment to the

                <p>Ques 40 Ans. At the beginning of the rebellion my sympathies were with the Union,
                    my feelings were those of sorrow, and regret and where I spoke it was in
                    language of despair. I voted for Union candidates to the State Convention, I did
                    not vote for the ratification of the ordinances of Secession, and after its
                    adoption I remained quiet, and did nothing for the confederacy except as
                    required by the laws.</p>
                <p>Ques 41 Ans. I do solemnly declare that from the beginning of hostilities to the

                    as my means and the circumstances would permit to aid said cause.</p>
                <p>Taking of the Property.</p>
                <p>Ques 1 Ans. I was present and saw the Wagon taken and saw the army horses
                    pasturing on my fields of grass.</p>
                <p>Ques 3 Ans. I did not see the horses taken, but saw them in the possession of the
                    army. The cow was killed and butchered in or near the pasture field. I saw the
                    horses in large numbers, pasturing on my grass and the fencing was used as I
                    believe for fuel and camp purposes.</p>
                <p>Ques 4 Ans. The horses were taken from a grass field a mile or more from town.
                    The Wagon was taken from my stable yard and the cow out of a field near the
                    town. All the property named in the petition was taken in June 1864. There were
                    about five soldiers engaged in taking the Wagon, I do not know how many present
                    when the other articles named were taken.</p>
                <p>Ques 5 Ans. No one present <del hand="h1">when</del> but myself when the wagon was taken
                    that I know of.</p>
                <p>Ques 6 Ans. I did not know any of the officers, and do not know if any were
                    present or not.</p>
                <p>Ques 7 Ans. There were about five soldiers, come to my stable yard <del hand="h1">and</del>
                    with a pair of horses, and hitched them to the Wagon.</p>
                <p>Ques 8 Ans. The Wagon was hauled off with horses.</p>
                <p>Ques 9 Ans. The Wagon was removed to the camp and so were the horses. The cow was
                    used for beef, she was fat.</p>
                <p>Ques 10 Ans. The horses and wagon, were used by the Regiments sent in charge of
                    prisoners to Camp Chase, I saw them when started I suppose the cow was used as
                    rations as she was fat. I saw the Army horses feeding on my grass field.</p>
                <p>Ques 11 Ans. I made no complaint to any one.</p>
                <p>Ques 12 Ans. I did not ask for a receipt.</p>
                <p>Ques 13 Ans. The property was taken in the day time, I do not remember the hour.
                    There was no secrecy in taking it.</p>
                <p>Ques 14 Ans. The Army was encamped in &amp; around the town at the time. It
                    was Genl. Hunter's Army. They arrived at the town (Staunton) on Monday and left
                    the following Friday. The battle of Piedmont took place on Sunday the day
                    previous to their arrival in Staunton. I did not know any Quarter Master or
                    other officer of the Army.</p>
                <p>Ques 15 Ans. The horses were in good condition, both sound and healthy, one the
                    bay 8 years old and the grey 5 years old, they were of large size and fine work
                    horses. The Wagon, was a new one and had been but little used.</p>
                <p>The cow was fat and large, at least 500 pounds <orig reg="net">nett</orig> - the
                    grass was very heavy and good and would readily have made 3 tons to the acre. I
                    had to give <unclear>$16</unclear> a ton for hay, in money paid after the war
                    closed. I suppose from <orig reg="an">a</orig> estimate that the plank enclosing
                    the 14 acres and posts would be equal to 40 cords of wood - not less, if 100
                    rails is equal to a cord of wood. The grass is only estimated by amount of hay
                    cut at other times.</p>

                <p>Deposition of <hi rend="underline">Henry Carter</hi></p>
                <p>Ans to 1st ques. My name is Henry Carter, my age is 41 years, by occupation a
                    laborer. I am not related to the Claimant. I am a colored man - I was present
                    and saw the Wagon taken, but did not see the horses taken, but did see the cows
                    drove off.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. The Wagon was taken by soldiers from the stable yard.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. The Wagon was taken by 4 or 5 soldiers engaged in taking the Wagon.
                    They had two horses and threw off the Saddles and put on the body, and hitched
                    the horses to it and went away to head quarters near the City Cemetery. I do not
                    recollect the month but it was the year before the War closed. There was no one
                    present that I recollect of. The claimant was a very short distance off.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. I think they were private Soldiers I did not know that any were
                    officers.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7 Ans. I said gentlemen you are not going to take the Wagon and they
                    replied oh yes we have more use for it now than you have.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8 Ans. The Wagon was hauled away <del hand="h1">by</del><add hand="h1" place="inline">with</add> horses. I had
                    put the horses on a grass field in the morning. The field about 1 1/2 miles from
                    town and the next morning I saw them have the horses and were watering them when
                    I saw them. I had put the Cow in the same field and an officer told me that he
                    would have to take the Cow to eat. The Cow was very fat. The 14 acre grass field
                    was taken and used for pasture. I suppose there must have been 250 horses and
                    mules in the field, and the plank was used for fuel and about the camps.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. The Wagon was taken to Head Quarter Camp, near the Cemetery. I went
                    to try and get the horses and the Cow back - they said that they had use for the
                    horses, and they were going to eat the Cow. I saw the horses at the Camp.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I did not see the horses used in harness, and did not see the Cow
                    after she was taken from the field. I never saw the Wagon after it was taken. I
                    only know that they told me they had use for all the property. I said nothing
                    about the grass.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. I made such complaint only as asking for the property, that is the
                    horses and Cow. I did not know the name or rank of the officer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12 Ans. There was no receipt asked for that I know of.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. The property was all taken in the day time. The Wagon was taken
                    about 11 o'clock and the Cow in the afternoon and I suppose the horses in the
                    morning - there was no secrecy so far as I saw.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. The Army was encamped in and around the town. The horses were taken
                    the day after they reached Staunton and the Cow next day following that, and
                    next day the Wagon. They turned the horses &amp; mules in on the grass the
                    same day they came. They remained in camp three or four days. The Battle at
                    Piedmont took place on Sunday before they got here. I did not know any Quarter
                    Master or other officer. I only know that it was called General Hunter's Army.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. The horses were fat and fine the bay horse I think was about 8
                    years old. It was a fine work horse. I think he was worth about $160. The Grey
                    was about 5 years old in good order, and a splendid work horse. I think he was
                    worth $175. The Cow was very large and young &amp; very fat. I know she was
                    worth $50. The Wagon was new, iron axles and new body with side rubbers - it was
                    worth at least $125. The grass was Clover &amp; Timothy, very heavy and I
                    think would have averaged 3 tons to the Acre. I do not know how many acres there
                    were, but judge about 14 or 15 acres. I do not know what hay was worth. The
                    Plank and most of the Posts were used.</p>
                <p>The same Witness in relation to the loyalty of the Claimant -</p>
                <p>I had known the Claimant during the War and for years before it. I belonged to
                    him - I saw him every day during the war. We often talked about the War, and he
                    was bitterly opposed to the War. I never heard him talk in presence of others,
                    he was a very quiet man but he was always free in talking to me. he used to set
                    for hours and talk to me about it and always was against it. I of course was in
                    favor of the Union. When the news came that Lee had surrendered he came to me
                    and <add hand="h1" place="inline">said</add> Well Henry, you are free. I want you to work for me and I
                    will give you<del hand="h1">r</del> more wages that I would any one else. I never had any
                    reason to doubt his being a sincere loyal man. I never talked with him about the
                    value of the property.</p>

                <p>My name is Benjamin F. Points, my age 63 years. My residence Staunton, Va. My
                    occupation a Copper Smith. I am not related to the Claimant and have no benefit
                    in the claim. I have known the claimant from my boyhood, we have both resided in
                    this town all our lives and always quite intimate. I had frequent conversations
                    with him during the War and he was invariably opposed to the War. Never at any
                    time did he change in his opposition to it. He is a very quiet man and seldom
                    expresses his opinion or mixes with people especially in Exciting Times. After
                    the War commenced I differed with him but our difference never made any change
                    in our social intercourse and I never named his opposition to the war to any one
                    for the reason that if it had been known he might have been annoyed in
                    consequence. The claimant is one of the oldest and most reputable citizens of
                    the Town. I have understood that he fed the Union soldiers when they came here,
                    and also that he would not deny meals to the Confederate soldiers. Our
                    conversations were always alone and from his expressions to me, I could not have
                    testified that he was in favor of the War and that his sympathies were with the
                    South if she had gained her independence.</p>
