                    petition taken.</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup> Witness says, The property was taken on the 29<sup>th</sup> September 1864, it was taken from the claimants
                    farm, and was taken by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's Army. The claimants family were preent at the taking.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup> Witness says, There was Captain present, I did
                    not know his name, he belonged to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's command. The Captain
                    ordered it to be taken.</p>
                <p>7<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, Two of the horses were taken out of
                    the stable, and the other two from the lot at the house. One of the Mares was
                    rode away by the Captain, and the others by the soldiers. The horses were taken
                    in the direction of the Camp at Mt. Sidney. They were not followed.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup> Witness says, I do not know the use for which
                    the property was taken. I did not see the property after it was removed from the
                    premises. The Claimant complained to the Officer. The Captain said he could not
                    help it, that he was obliged to take them.</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup> Witness Says-There was no receipt given or asked
                    for. The property was taken in the day time, between 11 Oclock A.M. and 3 P.M.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, The Army was encamped at Mt.
                    Sidney, about One mile away. It only remained a part of a day. I dont think there had been any battle or skirmish near
                    there.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, The horses were all in good
                    condition and order. The gray horse was 6 years old, he was worth $165. One bay
                    Mare was 5 years old, worth $150.00. The grey Mares were 4 years old, and worth
                    $320-$160 each.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, I think the property was taken for
                    the use of the Army and not for gratification.</p>
                <p>20<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, I suppose the horses were for the
                    use of the Army.</p>
                <p>21<sup>st</sup> Witness Says-I think there was such a necessity
                    as justified the officer in taking them.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup> Witness Says, I believe there was such a
                    necessity in the Army, that justified the taking and that the Government should
                    pay for them.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup> Witness Says, The Captain said he had orders to

                    farmer by occupation. I have known the claimant 30 years. I live less than One
                    mile from him. I saw him often during the war, and talked with him about the
                    war. I always heard him speak against the rebellion and in favor of the Union,
                    his neighbors regarded him as a true loyal man. He is a Minister in the Dunkard
                    Church. He never done anything for the United States, that I know of except to
                    send his son into the Union lines. He done nothing for the Rebellion but what he
                    was forced to do. He was too good a Union man to have established any claim of
                    loyalty to the Confederacy had it been successful.</p>
