                <p>George Craun of Mossy Creek, Augusta Co., Va., filed this claim October 26, 1871,
                    for $422.50, claiming that Union troops confiscated 1 bay horse, 1 mare, 3

                    put in a substitute to keep out himself - Says he assisted parties to escape
                    into the Union lines &amp; gave them money for that purpose - does not name
                    them or detail the circumstances - Had three brothers in the Confederate Army -
                    gave them food &amp; money "the money belonged to my brother." He was never
                    arrested or molested on account of his Unionism - In the beginning he
                    sympathized with the Union Cause, but does not remember whether he voted for the
                    Ordinance of Secession or not -</p>
                <p>Daniel M. Craun is called as a witness - he is 37 years of age &amp; had
                    known the claimant all his life <hi rend="underline">thinks</hi> he was loyal
                    &amp; so regarded by his neighbors - says the claimant furnished him
                    &amp; his family with gold to go through the Union lines &amp; furnished
                    others in the same way - What relationship Daniel M. Craun is to the claimant we
                    do not know.</p>
                <p>Wm Evans is also called as a witness. He says the claimant was regarded as a
                    Union man, but states no facts - this witness was absent in the west about 15
                    months - Neither of these witness states whether he himself was loyal.</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the proof of loyalty &amp; reject the claim.</p>

                <p>6 Witness say: There were officers present when the property was taken.</p>
                <p>10 Witness say. The horses were taken from me &amp; put at once in the Army
                    for the use of the U.S. Govt.</p>
                <p>13 Witness say. The property was taken in the day time, it was not taken
                    secretly.</p>

                    Lived near him during the war. Saw him often, &amp; talked to him about the
                    war. I regarded him as a loyal man to the US Govt. &amp; he was so regarded
                    by his neighbors. Never knew him to do anything for the U.S. I was in the west
                    15 months. I never knew him to do anything for the Confed. Govt. I have heard
                    him abused for being a loyal man to the US Govt. &amp; disloyal to the
                    South. I think he was too loyal to the US Govt. to have made a loyal citizen to
                    the Confed. States had they succeeded, if he was not loyal no one was loyal

                    him often &amp; talked with him about the war. I think he was a loyal man to
