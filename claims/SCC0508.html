<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Mr. Buchanan resided in Augusta County. He says he did not vote on the question
                    of secession, but we find his name on the poll list as having voted for
                    ratifying the ordinance fo secession</p>
                <p>Mr. Buchanan had two sons in the Union Army, and one in the Confederate who staid only a short time &amp; deserted. Several
                    circumstances stated in the testimony present Mr. Buchanan's conduct in a loyal
                    &amp; favorable light: but his vote for secession is a disloyal act
                    &amp; forbids the allowance of his claim.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John Troxall introduced the furnishing and taking of property
                    mentioned in the petition.</p>
                <p>Ques. 1. Witness says. I am 27 years old, I reside in Augusta Co. Va. and a
                    farmer by occupation. I was present and saw the property taken, or at least one
                    horse, but did not see the other taken, but know the same troops took it.</p>
                <p>4. Witness says. The property was taken in June 1864 from the Claimants of field,
                    by soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>l.</sup> Hunter's Command. There were no Officers present.</p>
                <p>8. Witness says. The property was rode off by the soldiers.</p>
                <p>9t<sup>h.</sup> Witness says. They said they were on their route
                    to Lynchburg. I did not see it after removed.</p>
                <p>10. Witness says. It was taken for the Government use, and the soldiers said they
                    were taking all the horses they could get.</p>
                <p>11. Witness says. The claimants son complained to an Officer, and he told him if
                    he could find the horses to take them, but he did not get them.</p>
                <p>12. Witness says. There was no receipt asked for or given that I know of.</p>
                <p>13. Witness says. The property was taken at about 12 Oclock in the day time, it
                    was taken publicly.</p>
                <p>14. Witness says. There was no encampment. They were on the March. There had been
                    no battle or skirmish. I knew no Quarter master.</p>
                <p>15. Witness says. The bay Mare was in good condition and a fine animal. She was 7
                    or 8 years old and worth I suppose $200. The Sorrel Mare was a good animal. She
                    was I suppose about 10 years old, and worth $200.</p>
                <p>19. Witness says. I believe it was taken for the benefit of the U.S. Government. The soldiers said they needed
                    them and were taking all they could get.</p>
                <p>20. Witness says. I believe it was taken for the use of the Government.</p>
                <p>22. Witness says. I think it was taken for the use of the Government and
                    therefore it should be paid for.</p>
                <p>23. Witness says. The soldiers I think were ordered. They said they were ordered

                <p>Sir: In answer to your request of the 9th ultimo, in the case of the son of David
                    Buchanan against the United States, No. 6818 Congressional, wherein the loyalty
                    of the said David Buchanan is in question, I have the honor to state that his
                    name appears in a copy of a list of those who voted for the ordinance of
                    secession in Augusta County, Virginia, the original of which is presumed to be
                    in the custody of the clerk of the court of said county.</p>
                <p>Respectfully yours, Charles Forten Secretary.</p>
