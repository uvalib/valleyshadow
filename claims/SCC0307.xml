                <p>The claimant voted for Secession - says "he was scared into it" "as they told me

                    not. - It is not by such general assertions, which can neither be proved or
                    disproved by investigation, that such claimants can be allowed to establish
                    duress.</p>

                <p>11 Witness says - There was complaint made but it did no good they said they
                    wanted to mount Cavalry</p>
                <p>12 Witness says - No receipt was given and none asked for</p>
                <p>13 Witness says - The horses were taken in the daytime about nine o'clock they
                    were taken boldly</p>
                <p>14 Witness says - When the property was taken the army was encamped at Staunton
                    Virginia under the command of Genl Hunter. The encampment was three miles from
                    where the property was taken they remained there about a week there had been a
                    battle at Piedmont a few days before the property was taken. I did not know the
                    names of any of the officers or soldiers one I think was a lieutenant all under
                    the command of Genl Hunter.</p>
                <p>15 Witness says - The horses were in very good condition when taken they were
                    young horses and worth fully one hundred and fifty dollars a piece which is the
                    amount the Government has been charged in the petition</p>
                <p>19 Witness says - I think they were taken for the use of the Government because
                    the officers and soldiers said so and I suppose they were needed by the
                    Government or else they would not have taken them</p>
                <p>22 Witness says - I believe they were taken for some purpose so useful and
                    beneficial that the Government ought to pay for them and Further the deponent

                <p>Quest 1 Witness says - I was present when the horses mentioned in the claimants
                    petition were taken I saw them taken, they were taken in 1864 from the farm of
                    the claimant by the soldiers and officers under the command of Genl Hunter.</p>
                <p>8 Witness says - One horse was led and the other was rode off by the soldiers</p>
                <p>9 Witness says - They were carried to Staunton</p>
                <p>10 Witness says - The soldiers and officers said that they wanted them for the
                    use of the Government I did not see them after they were taken</p>
                <p>12 Witness says - No receipt was given for them or asked for</p>

                <p>22 Witness says - I do suppose they were taken for some purpose so useful
                    beneficial and justifiable as to require the Government to pay for them</p>
                <p>23 Witness says - I do suppose that they were taken under the order of some
                    officer connected with the Army whose rank empowered or justified him in taking
                    them or ordering them to be taken. The horses were in good condition when taken
                    and worth the amount charged in the claimant's petition</p>

                    times he was regarded as a loyal man to the United States Government by his
                    neighbors I don't know that I ever heard him or his family threatened on account
                    of his Union sentiments I never knew him to aid the Confederate Government in
                    any way I never knew him to own any Confederate bonds or do anything to sustain

                    on shares the second year after the war commenced. He was then about 48 years of

                <p>I talked with him frequently at this time he seemed a very quiet man and a great

                    &amp; 18 years of age. I don't think they were either of them in the war at
                    any time he expressed himself freely as a Union man. He was opposed to owning
                    slaves. I do not know of his voting for or against Secession. I never knew of

                    Deffenbaugh have known him all my life. I know him to have been a Union man if
                    there ever was one. There is no question about that. I have heard him talk often
                    he was opposed to the War. He done all he could to keep his son out of the
                    Confederate Army, who was old enough to do service the second year of the War.
                    And when he came home on furlough he concealed him and sent him through the
                    Union lines. They had him in the home guard a while, that he could not help. He
                    done all he could to any one that wanted to keep out of the Confederate Army. he
                    lost some horses by the Union troops I do not know how many, but I know he lost
                    some horses not less than two. I did know how many but I have forgotten. I never
                    knew of his doing anything for the Confederates. I was in the Confederate Army,
                    and always regarded him as a strong Union man and he was known as such by all of

                    farmer illiterate but honest in all respects he <unclear>frequently

                    Rebel Army against his will, and the very first opportunity he had he aided him

                    says of him "I know Lewis Defenbaugh well knew him during the war and lived near
                    him he was a timid man but a Union man he refused to sell me some clover and at
                    one time during the war because I was a rebel, he voted for the ordinance of
                    secession through the influence of Col. <unclear>Geo.</unclear> Baylor who was
                    elected as a Union man to the convention he told him that it would be the best
