                    the secession of <abbr expan="South">So.</abbr> Carolina. I voted for the union
                    candidates for the convention but voted for the ratification of secession as a
                    peace measure. It was maintained by our public men that if we were united in
                    this measure it would lead to a reconciliation of our national difficulties and
                    bring about a peace. That is the reason I voted for the ratification. When the
                    State seceeded I went with the state of course.</p>
                <p>In answer to the interrogatories as to the taking of the property deponent says,

                    I had 6 of them taken. They were worth on an average $40. a head.</p>

                    to the place where I was living and drive away a flock of 42 sheep. 6 of whom
                    belonged to Dr. Ewing. I know there were 42 of them because I had salted and
                    counted them about an hour before they were driven away. We had 36 head of sheep
                    driven off at the same time. I was an eye witness to the taking and driving of
                    them away.</p>
                <p>The 6 sheep belonging to Dr. Ewing were in the habit of going with ours and they
                    were all together when taken. The troops that took the sheep were all cavalry.
                    There were a good many of them. They set our barn on fire at the same time.</p>

                <p>Nancy <add hand="h1" place="inline">(colored)</add> Becks duly sworn deposeth as follows. I am about 53
                    years old. I live with Dr. Ewing the claimant. I lived with him during the war.
                    I was one of the servants of the family.</p>
                <p>I was present and saw the northern soldiers drive off 6 head of cattle belonging
                    to Dr. Ewing in <abbr expan="September">Sept.</abbr> sometime. I <orig
                        reg="cannot">cant</orig> tell what year but it was <add hand="h1" place="inline">when</add> his barn
                    was burnt by the soldiers.</p>
                <p>There were 4 <orig reg="milk">milck</orig> cows and 2 heifers nearly as big as
                    the cows. I used to milk the cows; they were first rate ones for milk and
                    butter.</p>
                <p>There were 5 or 6 soldiers in the party. 3 of them went into the house to look
                    for arms, one went to the barn and set it on fire and two of them drove the
                    cattle away. The men who came to the house took all my money. I had five
                    dollars.</p>
                <p>They took 3 sacks and carried them away filled with oats. I held the bags for
                    them to put the oats into them.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Mary A. Crawford as to the Loyalty of Dr. William D. Ewing</p>
                <p>I am 44 years old. I live near the claimant. He married my sister. I have no
                    interest in his claim.</p>
                <p>I hard him often speak in opposition to secession before the State seceded and I
                    believe he was strongly opposed to it. When the war came on he was compelled to
                    go and when taken prisoner at Winchester was engaged as an assistant Surgeon for
                    the soldiers of both armies and when he came home I heard him say he was treated
                    better by the yankees than by our own soldiers and if he had not a family here,
                    he might have <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> with them. I am confident he would
                    not have <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> in the confederacy if his family had
                    not been here.</p>
                <p>Everybody who was able to do military duty was drafted and there was no escape
                    except at the risk of ones life.</p>
