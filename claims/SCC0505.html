<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claimant says they had me in the State Militia at Staunton the Second year of the
                    war about five weeks. I had to pay 100$ to assist in raising troops in order to
                    get the Militia disbanded. It was probably prior to that in 1862 that he was
                    arrested and confined in the Guard House at Richmond four or five days until he
                    paid five hundred dollars and was released.</p>
                <p>Two witnesses swear to Claimants loyalty; but we regard his service as
                    inconsistent with loyal adherence to the Cause of the Union and the Government
                    of the United States during the war; and that the payment of one Hundred dollars
                    to raise troops was evidently giving aid and encouragement to the insurgency.</p>
                <p>We reject the claim.</p>

                    question severally put.</p>
                <p>To question 40 he says, with the Cause, I felt that that the rebellion
                    was wrong that it was wrong to secede. I exerted my influence for the Union, I
                    did not vote all, went to the polls for the purpose of voting against the
                    ratification of the ordinance of secession. No one else had voted before I got
                    there against it and I was persuaded to vote for it but I refused and
                    because I was not allowed to vote without hindrance my own sentiments I did not
                    vote at all. After the Ordinance of secession was accepted in Virginia I still
                    adhered to the Union Cause and did not "go with the State"</p>
                <p>To Question 41 He says I do make that solemn declaration.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the Comr. as
                    to the property charged. I was at home and saw all the property charged taken.
                        Items 1 &amp; 2 The stallion and Dun Mare were taken two days
                    before the burning of the barns in the neighborhood, in the year 1864, by
                    Sheridan's Army from my Stable, two soldiers came for the Mare explaining by
                    there were around three going through the field. I wanted the soldiers to leave
                    them but they would have them. They said they had use for them. They said they
                    wanted to ride them, they were Cavalry soldiers. They did not give me any
                    receipt. I did ask for any, I do not know their names. I don't know what company
                    or Regt. they belonged to. They were riding
                    tolerantly good horses. They did not leave any horses in their places. The
                    stallion was a roan betwen 4 &amp; 5 years old. I think he was about 16
                    hands high, sound and in good condition. He was worth about $150. The Dun Mare
                    was about 10 yrs. old. She was sound, and was worth
                    $100 but I put her at $80 I think.</p>
                <p>3d Item. The Bay mare was taken the day of the burning by the same army and of my
                    yard. The women were hanging to her but they  loose. She had a sucking
                    Colt at the time which they also took. There was but was but one soldier took
                    the Mare and Colt but there were many others near by. I did not hear him say any
                    thing, they had just set my Barn on fire and I had been down there trying to
                    save some things and he was going off with her as I came up. The mare and Colt
                    was worth $125. I did not charge for the Colt because the I was advised the
                        Govt. had no use for Colts. The mare was
                    about 12 years old. She was sound, I did not get any receipt. I asked for none.
                    Further saith not.</p>

                <p>Benjamin F. Wampler a witness for clt. being duly
                    affirmed and examined by Comm. deposes and
                    says</p>
                <p>I am 38 years old, a resident of Augusta County, a farmer by occupation. I am a
                    1st cousin to the claimant Mr. Glick, I have no interest in his claim. I lived
                    about a mile from him during the war, I saw him frequently sometimes once,
                    sometimes as high as twice a week. I talked with him a good deal about the war,
                    I knew his political sympathies and opinions, through the conversations we had.
                    I was a Union man and he so regarded me. He always was opposed to the rebellion
                    thought it was wrong about the most I can recollect now of what he said to me
                    during the war is that if the south gained independence we couldnt stay here and
                    wouldnt want to stay. I can't say positively that I heard him express Union
                    sentiments in the presence of others. I knew his general reputation for loyalty
                    through the neighborhood, he was regarded by both parties as a Union man. He was
                    regarded by his loyal neighbors as a loyal man. I don't think I remember
                    of his having contributing anything in aid of either
                    causes during the war. I never knew him to own any Confederate bonds or to do
                    anything to sustain the credit of the Confederate Govt. I never knew him to be molested or injured on acc't of his Union sentiments. I know of no act done
                    or language used by the Claimant (except what I have said) that might have
                    prevented him from establishing his loyalty to the Confederate Govt. if it had been able to maintain a separate
                    one. Further depon</p>
                <p>The witness is here examined by the Coms as to
                    the property charged.</p>
                <p>I saw two horses taken from the Claimant about the time of the Burning in the
                    neighborhood. They were taken by some soldiers under Sheridan's Command. I saw
                    two of the soldiers leading the horses of the Claimant through my place. I was
                    not present when they were taken. There were a great many other soldiers around
                    at the time. The army was moving at the time. I did not speak to the soldiers
                    about the matter. I was not very close to them but close enough to know the
                    horses. One was a young roan Stallion, The other was a Dun Mare. I had known the
                    young Stallion from a Colt, I had known the Dun Mare about a year. The Stallion
                    was rising 5 years old. The Dun mare's age I don't know. They were in good
                    order, of good size, not large nor small. The Stallion was worth at that time
                    $150, he was a fine traveller, he was broke. The mare was worth at that time
                    about $75. I did not notice whether the soldiers who had them were riding good
                    horses or not. I did They camped that night about 2 miles east of my
                    house. I don't know anything about the taking of the after active
                    mare. Thats all I know about the stock. Further saith not.</p>

                    soldiers took the first 2 and one took the other 2, I did not see any officers

                    Two of them were mares. They mare that had the Colt was about

                    horse was worth $150, no one told me that that was his value, I fixed that sum

                    present when the mare and colt were taken from our yard near the
                    house, the day of the burning. I saw them taken, the were taken by a person whom
                    I guess was a soldier, he was with the Yankee army, No officers were about. The
                    army was passing the road about 50 yards from the house at the time. No receipt
                    was left for them, I tol him to leave her, she was so old, she would do them no
                    good, he cursed me and went on, I took hold of her bridle to keep him from taken her, and held on until he scared me. Then I let
                    go, He abused me, He did not say for what use he wanted the mare and colt, He
                    gave no reason at all for taking her. The mare was about 12 or 13 years old. Her
                    colt was about 5 months old. I knew a little about the value of such property at
                    that time. The mare and Colt were worth at that time about $100. Further saith
                    not.</p>
