<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimant swears to his loyal sympathies, but states that he was Conscripted
                    arrested and put into the Rebel Army and served for more than a year during
                    which time he had a furlough and a pass to visit his home in Staunton where he
                    kept a Livery Stable. Some time late in the year 1864 he deserted and went to
                    New York and got employment in the Navy Yard at Brooklyn. One witness only is
                    called in support of his loyalty and he but repeats in the main what Claimant
                    must have told him for there is no indication that he knew it of his own
                    observation.</p>
                <p>Then there is one other witness and the only one in regard to the property who
                    says that the horses were taken by Gen Hunters Command directly after the battle
                    of Piedmont (June 1864). This was during the time that Claimant according to his
                    own statement was in the Rebel Army</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the sufficiency of the evidence and therefore reject
                    the Claim.</p>

                <p>Question 1st How old are you where do you reside and what is your occupation?</p>
                <p>Answer I am fifty years old I reside in Staunton Augusta County Virginia by
                    occupation a gardener.</p>
                <p>Question 2 Do you know the Claimant mentioned in the petition if so state how
                    long you have known him and all about his loyalty to the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>Answer I have known the Claimant seventeen or eighteen years I knew him well
                    throughout the war and resided in Staunton with him I saw him often during the
                    war I conversed with him about the war its causes and progress. He was loyal to
                    the United States Government during the war he was regarded by his neighbors as
                    a loyal man I don't think he contributed any money to aid the Union cause or the
                    Union Army or gave information to the officers or soldiers of the Union Army in
                    aid of the movements and cause they arrested him and put him in the Confederate
                    Army, he deserted the Confederate Army and went to New York and worked in the
                    Navy Yard, he did nothing voluntarily for the Confederate Army that I know of he
                    owned no bonds or did anything to sustain the credit of the Confederate States</p>
                <p>Question 3 Do you know any act done or language used by the Claimant which would
                    have prevented him from establishing his loyalty to the Confederacy if it had
                    been maintained as a separate Government. If so state the same particularly.</p>
                <p>Answer He was too loyal to the United States Government to have been considered
                    loyal to the Southern Confederacy if it had been maintained as a separate
                    government.</p>

                    for the United States Cavalry</p>
                <p>7 Witness says - They took them out of the pasture and led them along he the
                    claimant had four horses one of them was poor that one the soldiers left with me
                    &amp; told me to fatten him but I told them I had no grain to fatten him on

                    their horses were broken down I did not see any of them used by the army I did
                    not see them after they were taken</p>
                <p>11 Witness says - There was no complaint made there was no one to complain</p>
                <p>12 Witness says - There was no voucher or receipt asked for and none was given. I
                    do not know the name of the officer, rank or regiment but I was told by the
                    soldiers that he was a Captain from Pennsylvania</p>
                <p>13 Witness says - The property was not taken in the night time it was taken in
                    the day time about three o'clock in the afternoon they were not taken secretly</p>
                <p>14 Witness says - When the property was taken the Army was encamped in that
                    vicinity about three miles from where the property was taken by soldiers and
                    officers under the command of Genl. Hunter. They had not been encamped there
                    long they stayed there three or four days. There had been a battle at Piedmont
                    in Augusta County Virginia the Sunday before the property was taken I did not
                    know any of the Quarter Masters of the Army.</p>
                <p>15 Witness says - The horses were in good order when taken I do not know how old
                    they were I think they were worth what the Claimant has charged the Government
                    in his petitions.</p>
                <p>19 Witness says - They told me that they needed them in the Army and I believe
                    they were taken for the Army and not for individual officers or soldiers.</p>
                <p>20 Witness says - The soldiers told me that they were for the use of the Army and

                    good horses.</p>
                <p>22 Witness says - He was a poor man they were taken for the use of the Army of
                    the United States he was forced into the Confederate Army and therefore I think
                    the Government ought to pay him for them</p>
