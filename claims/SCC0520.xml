                <p>Answer to first general question</p>
                <p>My name is Mary C. Berry, my age is 26 years. I reside near Spring Hill, in
                    Augusta County. I stepdaughter of the claimant, I have no interest in the claim.
                    I was present and saw the Mare taken. She was taken out of the field. There were
                    a good many soldiers together. I do not know whether there was an officer
                    present or not. The Mare was taken in the fall of 1864 by <abbr expan="General"
                        >Genl.</abbr> Sheridan's men. The Mare was taken about sunrise. There was
                    nothing said to the soldiers about taking the Mare. There was no Camp near that
                    I heard of, and had been no fighting near that I recollect. The Mare was led
                    away by a soldier. They were all mounted and I suppose were Cavalry. I never saw
                    them after they left the place. They went down the Valley.</p>
                <p>The Mare was in good order. I do not know anything about her age. I do not the
                    worth of the horses, but she was a good animal.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Nannie Frame</p>
                <p>1. My name is Nannie Frame, my age is 19 years. I reside near Spring Hill,
                    Augusta County, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> I was not present and did not
                    see the horse taken, but saw the horse in the possession of the soldiers after
                    they left the claimants house. She lived a few hundred yards from my fathers. I
                    thought there were about 12 or 15 soldiers. There was an officer at my fathers
                    house, just before I saw the horse, but I heard no name or rank, but I do not
                    know that there was an officer in the compay that had the horse. I think it was
                    about the middle of the day when I saw the horse. A Soldier was leading the
                    horse, when I saw him. They were all horseback. I think the command belonged to
                        <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>. Sheridan but
                    I do not recollect the month or year. There was no regular Camp, that I knew of,
                    and had been no fight or skirmish.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Samuel Landes</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> general question</p>
                <p>My name is Samuel Landes, my age is 50 years. I reside near Spring Hill, Augusta
                        <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> My occupation is a Miller. I have known the
                    claimant since 1851 and resided about one mile from her during the war. I saw
                    her very frequently, she visited my house often. I have no recollection of any
                    particular conversation with her about the war. I always considered her loyal in
                        <hi rend="super">her</hi> sympathies to the Union cause. I know that
                    she harbored Union men, and gave them provisions. I was loyal in my feelings and
                    deeds to the Union. The Union men of the neighborhood reposed the utmost
                    confidence in her, and were not afraid for her to know all their plans. I knew
                    her husband, Samuel Cox, from 1848 to his death. He frequently told me that he
                    would never fight for the Confederates, that he would leave before he would do
                    so, <unclear>and he did leave</unclear> in the spring of 1864, and was in the
                    service of the Union Army at New Creek, <abbr expan="West Virginia">W.
                    Va.</abbr> and was there killed by the rebels as I have been informed by Paschal
                    B. Gentry, who was with him at the time. His Union neighbors, had full
                    confidence in his loyalty. The claimants actions were such during the War, that
                    she could not have shown loyalty to the south, if it had been successful.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Paschal B. Gentry</p>
                <p>Answer to first question</p>
                <p>My name is Paschal B. Gentry, my age 44 years I reside near M<hi
                        rend="super">t</hi>. Sidney in Augusta County, <abbr expan="Virginia"
                        >Va</abbr>. I am a farmer. I am not related to the claimant and have no
                    interest in the claim. I have known the claimant some 12 or 13 years. I lived
                    about 2 1/2 miles from her, until I left the Confederate lines in May 1864. I
                    never conversed with the claimant on the subject of the War, but did with her
                    husband (now dead) Samuel Cox. The Union men of the neighborhood regarded the
                    claimant as a loyal woman, her husband left the Confederate lines in March 1864.
                    I met with him <hi rend="super">in</hi> Maryland, and about the first day
                    of October 1864, we were employed, by order of <abbr expan="Captain"
                    >Capt.</abbr> Harrison of the Military Post at New Creek <abbr
                        expan="West Virginia">W. Va.</abbr> and on the day of November, 1864, he
                    (Cox) was killed by the rebel <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super"
                        >l</hi></abbr>. Rosser's command at New Creek, <abbr expan="West Virginia"
                        >W. Va.</abbr> and I was taken a prisoner and carried to Richmond, and after
                    106 days, was exchanged, and received my full pay from <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr> Harrison. There could be no doubt of the loyalty of the
                    claimants husband, Samuel Cox. The claimant was entirely satisfied that her
                    husband had left, and I saw a letter from her to husbands at New Creek, in which
                    she advised him to remain where he was, which I think was good evidence of her
                    loyalty.</p>

                <p>Deposition of John Jones</p>
                <p>Answer to first general question.</p>
                <p>My name is John Jones, my age is 32 years. I reside near Spring Hill, Augusta
                    County, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> I am a farmer. I am not related to the
                    claimant, and have no benefit or interest in the claim. I have known the
                    claimant about 15 years. I lived about 1 1/2 miles from her during the War. I
                    was intimate with her and saw her sometimes once a week up to the spring of
                    1864, where I left and passed through the lines into Maryland, where I remained
                    until the close of the War. I believed that she was in sympathy for the Union,
                    for the reason that while I was <unclear>escaping</unclear> from the rebels, she
                    furnished and carried me and M<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Abram Berry,
                    provisions, which she gave without pay. I do not know here reputation
                    <del hand="h1">was</del> in the neighborhood, but I know other Union men were not afraid
                    to let her know our plans. I never knew of her objecting to her husband going
                    through the lines. I saw her husband, Samuel Cox, at New Creek, <abbr
                        expan="West Virginia">W. Va.</abbr> he was in the service of the Quarter
                    Master, at that place, and I heard that he was killed there, I think by a raid
                    under Command of <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>.
                    Rosser. I have no doubt about here husband Samuel Cox being a true loyal man. He
                    certainly proved it by his conduct. As it was generally known in the
                    neighborhood that she fed Union men, I do not believe she would have proven
                    loyalty or sympathy to the Confederate States, if they had succeeded.</p>
