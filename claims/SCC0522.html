<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimants' loyalty is sustained by her own statement and the testimony of David
                    Myer and Sam<sup>l</sup> P Garber.</p>
                <p>The horses for which she claims compensation were taken by Gen Hunters Cavalry for the Artillery Service. As they were 13 and
                    16 years old, respectively it is probable they were past
                    hearing and so well adapted to that special service
                    nevertheless as old horses are not very valuable in the market, we feel
                    constrained to cut the prices of these down a little, although like all other
                    horses in the South during the War, "they were fat and in fine condition when
                    taken".</p>
                <p>We allow one hundred and ten dollars.</p>

                    answereth as follows.</p>
                <p>1<sup>st</sup> Witness says I was not present. I <sup>know</sup> nothing of the taking of the property.</p>
                <p>2<sup>d</sup>Witness Says Did you know the condition
                    and value of property when taken, mentioned in the claimants petition. Ans: The
                    horses were in fine condition. I think the charges made in the petition are
                    reasonable and fair. I have every reason to believe that they were taken by the
                    Government but I did not see it.</p>
                <p>Questions by the Commissioner</p>
                <p>1<sup>st</sup> How old are you? Where do you reside and what is
                    your occupation? Ans. I am 54 years old, reside at New Hope, Augusta Co.Va. My occupation is
                    a farmer.</p>
                <p>2 How long have you known Elizabeth Garber the Claimant? And were you itimate
                    during the War? Ans. I have known her 30 or 40 years. I live near her, and saw
                    her every few days during the war, and she was as loyal to the Union Cause as
                    any person could be, and so regarded by her neighbors, and she being a widow,
                    the Confederate authorities seemed disposed to oppress her. I never knew her to
                    aid the Confederate Government, its officers or soldiers.</p>
                <p>3<sup>d</sup> Do you know of any act done or language used by
                    the claimant which would have prevented her from establishing her loyalty to the
                    Confederacy, if it had been maintained by the Confederate as a seperate Government. If so, state the same
                    particularly. Ans. She was too loyal to the Union to have been considered loyal
                    to the Confederacy if it had been maintained as a seperate Government.</p>

                <p>2<sup>d</sup> Witness Says, I saw them taken meaning all the
                    Articles mentioned in Claimants petition.</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup> Witness Says Taken the 6<sup>th</sup> June 1864 from the Claimants premises, by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army.</p>
                <p>5 Witness Says I was present and Elizabeth Garber, the Claimant.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, They were taken by some of the
                    Cavalry, belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army. I do not know whether they were Officers or not.
                    The Soldiers who took them said "here are two fine horses, the Claimant said if
                    they took them, she could not get along. They said they wanted them for the
                    Artillery and that the Claimant would be paid for them.</p>
                <p>8<sup>th</sup> Witness Says-The horses were removed by soldiers.</p>
                <p>9<sup>th</sup> Witness Says-The horses were
                        brought<sup>taken</sup> to Staunton, I did not
                    see them afterwards. I believe the property was removed to Staunton because the
                    Army was marching in that direction.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, I do not know for what use the
                    horses were taken but they said, they wanted them for the Artillery.</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, There was no receipt asked for,
                    nor none given.</p>
                <p>13<sup>th</sup> Witness says-The property was taken in the day
                    time, about 9 Oclock A.M. on the 6<sup>th</sup> June 1864. It
                    was not taken secretly.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup> Witness says, There was a battle at Piedmont,
                    the day before the property was taken, which was about one mile from Claimants
                    residence. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter
                    was in command of the Union Army.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup> Witness says The horses were in good condition
                    when taken, and were worth all charged in the petition either to the Claimant or
                    Government.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness says, The property was taken for the use
                    of the Army, and not for the mere gratification of Officers or soldiers.</p>
                <p>20<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, I believe they were taken for the
                    use of the Army.</p>
                <p>21<sup>st</sup> Witness says I suppose they were taken in
                    consequence of some necessity for the articles taken which justified the
                    officers or soldiers in taking them.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup> Witness says I believe they were taken for the
                    use of the Army, and that the Government would be justifiable in paying for

                <p>23<sup>d</sup> Witness Says, I suppose they were taken by the
