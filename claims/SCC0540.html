<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John Ruebush, 1875,
                            Claim No. 17934</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                John Ruebush filed this claim in 1875 for $187.50, claiming the Union army under
                    General Sheridan's command took six head of cattle in 1864 during the "burning
                    raid." Ruebush was a farmer near Mt. Sidney who purportedly urged neighbors to
                    "try Mr. Lincoln." As the property was taken during the Burning Raid, and not
                    specifically for military use, the claim was disallowed.

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>John Ruebush</b>
                <p>In answer to the First General Interrogatory, the Deponent says: My name is John
                    Ruebush, my age 75 years, my residence Augusta County, in the State of Virginia,
                    and my occupation a Farmer; I am the claimant, and have beneficial interest in
                    the claim.</p>
                <p>Interrogatory 2. I lived on my own farm near Mt. Sidney in Augusta County Va.
                    during the whole period of the war.</p>
                <p>3-4 No sir</p>
                <p>5 It seems that I did take some oath after the war. I don't remember distinctly.</p>
                <p>6 to 17 inclusive no sir.</p>
                <p>18 I never furnished the Confederacy with anything I was not compelled to. All
                    farmers were obliged to give a tenth since they took a tenth part of my crops.</p>
                <p>19 to 24 inclusive no sir</p>
                <p>25 yes they took 1/10 of my crops as before stated. They did not pay me for it.
                    They wanted my horses several times but I managed to save them.</p>
                <p>26 to 29 inclusive no sir</p>
                <p>30 none nearer than nephews. One in the county and two in Rockbridge. They were
                    drafted in the militia. I did not aid nor encourage them in any way nor furnish
                    them with anything. They are all now living near their old homes.</p>
                <p>31 to 39 inclusive no sir.</p>
                <p>40 I sympathized with the Union cause. I told more that 50 people it was better
                    for us to stay in the Union, and to try Mr Lincoln first before making a fuss
                    and I always believed it would have been best to have staid in the Union and I never could  [several lines of text are
                    illegible]</p>
                <p>41 I was for the Union all the time and am still. I didnt have
                    any sympathy at all with the rebellion.</p>
                <p>44. I am a native born citizen of the United States and have not passed through
                    Bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>In answer to interrogatories as to the taking of the property deponent says.</p>
                <p>Property I was in the cornfield cutting up corn when my cattle were taken and saw
                    my cattle driven away by some troops of Gen
                    Sheridan's army in the fall of 1864. While the burning was going on. They were a
                    small squad of cavalry who were taking cattle from all around the neighborhood
                    they drove away 7 cows from me, and I followed them on toward Harrisonburg a day
                    or two after and got some of them back. The six which were taken were worth on
                    average $30 a piece if not more.</p>
                <p>And further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>I don't remember any particular conversation with him on the subject of

                    that he would have nothing to do with the war. I had frequent conversations with
                    him during the war, and he always spoke in favor of the old government. He never
                    said much about the battles - it was not prudent for one to say much about such
                    things on the Union side. I don't know of his having anything to do about
                    helping refugees through the lines. I only know he used to speak when talking
                    with me in favor of the old government as it was before the war. So far as I
                    could understand him he sympathized with the Union Cause.</p>

                <p>I have known the claimant about 35 years. I often heard him speak on the subject
                    of Secession, rebellion and such matters. He was opposed to Secession - and told
                    people that had better wait and try Mr. Lincoln before rushing into a war. Said
                    he believed he would make a good President and that they ought not to break up
                    the union. I was a union man myself, and he knew it, and talked freely with me,
                    but it was dangerous to speak much openly in favor of the union. He was
                    generally known however by union people as loyal to the
                    United States. I have heard him spoken of as a union man. And I regarded him as
                    a loyal man during the war.</p>
