                <p>Samuel H. Swisher filed this claim in 1875 for $165, claiming Union forces under
                    General Sheridan took one horse, one Spanish saddle, and two bridles in 1864.
                    Samuel was a 36 year old farmer who was granted exemption from Confederate
                    service and tried to help his brother escape to the Union to avoid service. The
                    commission allowed $165.</p>

                    beginning to the end of the war in sympathy with the Union Cause. He
                    unquestionably bore the reputation of a Union man. When the case was first
                    submitted no such facts were shown as would settle the question of loyalty
                    &amp; we caused an investigation to be made by an agent, whose report with

                <p>Deposition of Phillip D. Swisher to prove property.</p>
                <p>Ques 1. Witness says, I am 32 years old. I live in Augusta <abbr expan="County"
                        >Co.</abbr><abbr expan="Virginia">V<hi rend="super">a</hi></abbr>. I
                    am a farmer. I was present &amp; saw the property mentioned in the claimants
                    petition taken. I saw one horse one saddle, one riding bridle &amp; one
                    blind bridle taken.</p>
                <p>4. Witness Says, The property was taken in 1864 from the farm of the claimant, by
                    Soldiers of the <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> army under <abbr
                        expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Sheridan</p>
                <p>6. Witness Says, There were no officers present when the property was taken, so
                    far as I know. Know neither the name rank or <abbr expan="command">comd.</abbr>
                    of any of them, but <abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Talbot was in <abbr
                        expan="command">comd</abbr>.</p>
                <p>10. Witness says, The property was taken for the use of the <abbr
                        expan="United States">U.S.</abbr><abbr expan="Government">Govt</abbr>.</p>
                <p>11. Witness Says, No complaint was made on account of the taking.</p>
                <p>12. Witness says, There was no receipt asked for &amp; none given</p>
                <p>13. Witness Says, The property was taken in the day time it was not taken
                    secretly</p>
                <p>14. Witness Says, When the property was taken the army was on the march.</p>
                <p>15. Witness Says, Item #1. Saw one fine horse taken, he was 10 years old, was
                    worth $150.00. Item #2. Saw one Spanish riding saddle taken, was worth $15.00
                    Item #3. Saw one riding bridle taken worth $2.00 Item #4. Saw one blind bridle
                    taken, was worth $1.00. Saw all the above property taken for the benefit of the
                    army.</p>
                <p>19. Witness says, I think the property was taken for the use of the <abbr
                        expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> army &amp; not for private use, the
                    horse was put into immediate service.</p>
                <p>22. Witness say, I think the property was taken for the necessary use of the
                    army, &amp; the <abbr expan="Government">Govt.</abbr> should pay for it.</p>
                <p>23. Witness says, I suppose those who took the property had authority to take it
