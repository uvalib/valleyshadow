<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of David Bowers, April
                            4, 1873, Claim No. 20827</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                David Bowers filed this claim in 1873 for $385.25, claiming Union troops
                    confiscated 1 grey mare, 1 bay horse, 2 saddles, 4 halters, 2 bridles, bacon,
                    molasses, bags, and lard from his farm near Middlebrook, Augusta Co., Va. The
                    claim was disallowed in 1874. Bowers filed an additional claim, No. 1379, for
                    $428.50, that was considered "substantially the same" as the prior claim; it was
                    also disallowed.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The testimony in this case is not of that satisfactory character that would
                    justify any accomodation of payment - It does not show the claimant to have been
                    loyal to the United States during the war. He resided in Augusta Co. Va.
                    &amp; swears that he did not vote for the ratification of the ordinance of
                    secession - The record of the votes in that county shows that he did vote for
                    the ordinance</p>
                <p>This claim is disallowed.</p>

                    injure said cause or retard its success and that I was at all times ready and
                    willing when called upon to aid and assist the cause of the Union or its
                    supporters so far as my means, power and the circumstances permitted.</p>

                <p>Ques 3 Ans. The horses were in a field near to my house and the saddles, halters
                    &amp; bridles were in the stable and the Bacon, Lard &amp; Molassses
                    were in my house and the bags in my grainary.</p>
                <p>Ques 4 Ans. The property was taken about the 7th of June 1864. The property was
                    taken my Union soldiers. I suppose there were 500 present. Three soldiers went
                    into the field and caught the horses, and the house was full when the other
                    articles were taken. They were passing my house for several hours.</p>
                <p>Ques 5 Ans. No one present but my wife.</p>
                <p>Ques 6 Ans. There were two officers present I do not know their rank. It was Genl
                    Crook's command. I heard no order given.</p>
                <p>Ques 7 Ans. The horses were taken from the field &amp; the other property
                    taken from the house and stables.</p>
                <p>Ques 8 Ans. The horse were rode off by soldiers and the bacon and other articles
                    were carried off by soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ques 9 Ans. The Army was marching at the time my property was taken -</p>
                <p>Ques 10 Ans. I saw the property after it was taken away.</p>
                <p>Ques 11 Ans. I made no complaint</p>
                <p>Ques 12 Ans. I got not receipt</p>
                <p>Ques 13 Ans. The property was taken about 11 A.M. There was no secrecy at all.</p>
                <p>Ques 14 Ans. The Army camped about one mile from my house that night - Genl
                    Hunter was in Staunton at that time - I think he had a battle a few days before
                    below Staunton. I knew no officer at all.</p>
                <p>Ques 15 Ans. The horse and mare were both in good condition, the horse about 9
                    years and the mare about 6 years old, both of good size rode and worked well. I
                    think they were worth what I have charged $325 - The saddles were nearly new,
                    the halters and bridles were some worn but very good I suppose there were 60
                    pounds of Bacon It was not weighed. I do not recollect the number of pieces -
                    The Lard was in a Can, about half full. I think the Can held about 40 pounds. I
                    would judge the Molasses to be about 5 gallons. There were 12 bags. I do not
                    think there is any charge unreasonable or too high - I never received any pay
                    for any part of the property -</p>

                <p>Answer to first question</p>
                <p>My name is Sarah Bowers my age is 37 years. My residence near Middlebrook, Va. am
                    the daughter of the claimant, David Bowers. I was not present when the property
                    was taken being absent at the time in Middlebrook about 1/2 mile from my
                    father's residence. The Army commanded by Genl. Crook passed through Middlebrook
                    after passing my father's house, and I saw my fathers horses in possession of
                    the soldiers, and were riding them. I know the horses, I applied to one of the
                    officers, I think a General to release the horses, that my father had only the
                    two and they being so well broken that we could do anything with them - He
                    replied that if my father would come to the Camp that night he should have them
                    but I could not get home to tell my father. He said that his men out not to have
                    taken them, especially from from old persons. I do not know anything about the
                    other articles, only I know that all was gone when I got home. The Army was
                    marching in the direcion of Staunton, where Genl Hunter was then encamped. I do
                    not recollect of any battle, being fought. The horses were taken in June 1864 -
                    I think the grey mare was well worth $150 and the horse was worth not less that
                    $125 -</p>

                <p>Ques 1st My name is George L. Arehart, my age is 44 years. My residence is near
                    Middlebrook, Augusta Co. My occupation a farmer. I am not related to the
                    claimant nor have no interest in the claim - I have known the claimant about 25
                    years. I lived about 1 3/4 miles from him during the war. We were intimate
                    during the war, and saw each other very frequently. My own sympathies were with
                    the Union, the claimant knew my position. I talked with the claimant about the
                    war. I never heard him say anything in favor of the rebellion - I never heard
                    the claimants loyalty doubted by the Union men of his neighborhood - I never
                    knew him to do anything for the rebellion - I left the Confederate lines in
                    January 1864, and went to Indiana. I understood that the claimant sons, Samuel
                    and George Bowers went through to the Union lines. I do not think that if the
                    South had gained its independence the claimant could have proved loyalty to it.
                    He could not have done so by me.</p>

                <p>My name is Lee Squires. My age is 36 years. My residence Middlebrook. My
                    occupation a Hotel keeper. I am not related to the claimant and have no interest
                    in the claim. I have known the claimant since 1862. I lived about one mile from
                    him until the close of the War. I was very intimate with him during that time of
                    the War. I saw him frequently, once a week. I do not recollect that we ever
                    talked about the War, but from what I knew of him I believed that he was opposed
                    to the War. I traded horses with him and during the time, he expressed his views
                    on the subject of the War. I was opposed to the War myself, and was arrested by
                    the rebels in W. Va. because of my opposition to the War. I never heard any
                    doubts expressed about the Claimants loyalty by his Union neighbors. The
                    Claimant could not have proven loyalty to the South by me. I never knew him to
                    do anything in aid of the Confederates - His sons, George and Samuel went
                    through to the Union lines in 1864 -</p>

                    represented - and was the full value as claimed by David Bowers. We do further
                    swear, that we knew said Bowers was a truly loyal citizen of the U.S. during the
                    rebellion and was so loyal at the time his claim occurred,
                    neither did he by act or deed render any voluntary aid or support in any manner
                    to the Confederate Government, its offices or adherents -</p>
