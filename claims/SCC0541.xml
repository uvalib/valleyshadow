                <p>Jacob Ritchie filed this claim in 1872 for $230, claiming the Union army under
                    General Sheridan's command took two horses and sheep in 1864 during the "burning
                    raid." Ritchie was a farmer near Mt. Sidney who had five sons in the Confederate

                <byline>Jacob Ritchie</byline>
                <p>In answer to the First General Interrogatory, the Deponent says: My name is Jacob
                    Richie, my age 71 years, my residence Augusta County, in the State of Virginia,
                    and my occupation a farmer, I am the claimant.</p>
                <p>To Question 2 <orig reg="he says">hesays</orig>: in Augusta County on my own farm
                    containing 51 acres about 8 of which was woodland I did not change my business
                    or residence during the war.</p>
                <p>To Questions 3 through 23 inclusive he answers no, to each and every question
                    seperately put.</p>
                <p>To Question 24 he says, I was several times, once in 1862 at Harrisonburg, I
                    don't know who did it. It was for expressing my sentiments. They did not keep me
                    long under arrest. And did not make me take any oath or affirmation of any sort,
                    I was arrested again in the winter of 1863 near my home, by some soldiers whom I
                    did not know, I was not kept under arrest more than an hour or two, they just
                    let me go again. They did not require me to take any oath. I was never arrested
                    by the United States <abbr expan="Government">Govt</abbr>.</p>
                <p>To Question 25 he says. They took some Corn from me. I suppose for the use of
                    their army, I never received anything for it. They wanted to pay me for it, but
                    I would not have it. It was after the burning raid, the money they offered I
                    thought worthless.</p>
                <p>To Question 26 to 29 he says No to each and every question separately put.</p>
                <p>To Question 30 he says, I had 5 sons in the Confederate Army, Benjamin, John,
                    Peter, <unclear>Polk</unclear> and Dallas. They are all living, 3 in this County
                    near me, one in Rockingham near Dayton, the other in <abbr expan="Maryland"
                    >Md</abbr>. I don't know his Post Office address, I did not furnish them or
                    either of them with anything while in the service, when either them would come
                    here I would, of course, give them something to eat.</p>
                <p>To Question 31 to 39 inclusive he answers No to each question separately put.</p>
                <p>To Question 41 he says At the beginning of the rebellion I sympathized with the
                    Union Cause, my feelings were that the rebellion was wrong and unconstitutional,
                    I am not a lawyer and never read the Constitution, I <del hand="h1">too</del> voted for
                    the ratification of the Ordinance of Secession. I was compelled to do so, some
                    of my neighbors were about to take me up and they told me that if I won't vote
                    that way they would let me alone I had to do it to save myself, I voted against
                    my sentiments.</p>
                <p>To Question 41 he says I do made that solemn declaration.</p>
                <p>The <abbr expan="Claimant">Clt.</abbr> is here examined as to the property
                    charged.</p>
                <p>The property charged was all taken the time of the burning I was at my barn
                    trying to save some of my property and did not see all taken, I only saw the <hi
                        rend="underline">horse</hi> charged in the 2<hi rend="super">d</hi>
                    item taken, some of Sheridan's men took it all it was all taken the same day,
                    the horse I saw taken was in a field close by the barn, he was taken by a squad
                    of some 12 or 13 soldiers together, I did not say anything to them nor they to
                    me, I can't say any whether any officers were with them or not, the sheep were
                    taken out of the field, not the one the horse was in, and the Bay mare was taken
                    out of the woods. They took 10 sheep, the horse I saw taken was worth $50 - I
                    had paid $75 for him about 10 months before, he was about 12 years. He was in
                    pretty good condition, he was blind <unclear>one</unclear> eye. He was a big
                    heavy horse - <unclear>stoned</unclear> a little in his shoulders.</p>
                <p>The mare was a fine one - going on 4 years old, she was sound - about 16 hand
                    high well broke rode well and worked well, she was worth $150.- I was offered
                    that sum for her in gold just two days before she was taken, by one of our
                    neighbors. The sheep were fine fat ones, they would have netted from 80 to 100
                    lbs, <del hand="h1">thinks</del> I don't know what mutton was worth then. They were worth
                    at that time on the hoof about $3.- apiece.</p>
                <p>That's all I know about the matter.</p>

                <p>Ann E. Ritchie, witness to prove property taken, being affirmed and exmined by
                    the Commissioner, says:</p>
                <p>I am 40 years old and reside in Augusta Co.Va. I am the wife of the Claimant and
                    have no interest in this claim.</p>
                <p>I saw the Yankees take a black horse from my husband at the time of the Burning
                    Raid. I do not know who commanded the troops. The horse was in the pasture field
                    near by when he was taken by the soldiers. There was no officer present. I asked
                    them to leave the horse &amp; they swore at me and took the horse away. He
                    was about ten years old. He had been <unclear>gravelled</unclear> and was a
                    little lame when he was taken. He was worth about $50. I also saw the same
                    soldiers take ten sheep at the same time. The sheep were in the field with the
                    horse and were driven away with him. They were all full grown I don't know how
                    much they would have weighed. I do not know their value. They were fine sheep

                <p>I saw the Yankee army on the morning of the Burning Raid, have a bay mare which I
                    knew to be the claimant's in its posession. It came past my house and the
                    soldiers were leading the claimant's horse. I knew the mare and could have not
                    been mistaken as to her identity. I do not know her age. She was in good
                    condition. She was a young mare, worth about $100. The soldiers who had her said
                    they found her hid in the claimant's field. There was an officer with the
                    soldiers who had the horse. I do not know what officer ws in command of the
                    army. This is all I know about it and further saith not</p>

                <p>Benjamin F. Wampler, witness to prove loyalty of claimant, being affirmed and

                <p>I am 38 years old and reside near Mt. Meridian, Augusta County Va. I am a farmer.
                    I am not related to the claimant and have no interest in this claim. I lived
                    about a mile and a quarter from him during the war. I saw him about once every
                    two weeks during the war. I talked with him about the cause and progess of the
                    war. He expressed himself as opposed to the so-called Confederacy. I do not
                    remember hearing him express himself in the presence of others. I was a Union
                    man and the claimant so regarded me. I knew his public reputation. It was that
                    of a Union <add hand="h1" place="inline">man</add>. He was regarded a loyal man by his loyal neighbors. I
                    never knew him to <add hand="h1" place="inline">be</add> threatened or molested on account of his Union
                    sentiments. I never knew him to own any Confederate Bonds. I never knew him to
                    contribute anything toward the financial credit of the the Confederate cause. I
                    never knew him to render any assistance to either army. I know of no act done or
                    language used other than already stated by me, that would have prevented him
                    from proving his loyalty to the Confederate Government had it succeeded in

                    to the cause and progress of the war. He always expressed himself as a Union man
                    and was with the North in sympathy. I have heard him express himself in the
