<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Samuel Garber,
                            September 5, 1872, Claim No. 2508</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Garber's claim for horses and livestock was disallowed because he voted in favor
                    of the ordinance of secession. He unsuccessfully appealed this decision to the
                    Congressional Court of Claims in 1892.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The Claim Consists of 8 items valuation to 445.00</p>
                <p>Amount Disallowed 445.00</p>
                <p>Claimant swears to his loyal sympathies and that he aided refugees. He says he
                    voted for the Ordinance of Secession through compulsion and against his
                    sentiments. He does not give the circumstances of the compulsion of which he
                    speaks, and we presume it was only the fear of public opinion.</p>
                <p>We regard a vote to dissolve the Union, inconsistent with loyal adherance to it,
                    and we therefore reject the Claim.</p>

                <p>The claimant is here examined by the Commissioner concerning property taken. I
                    saw the black horse with the 55 bushels of oats recorded in my account taken. I
                    did not see the other property taken. The horse and oats were taken at the day
                    of the battle of Piedmont, by Gen. Hunters army.
                    The horse was in the stable and a great many soldiers were in the yard and one
                    of them took the horse and rode him away. I heard an officer present <sup>talking</sup> that he had better not take the horse as I
                    was a Union man, but the soldier took him. The soldier said he needed the horse
                    and would have to take it. It was in the evening after the battle. I did not ask
                    for a receipt and he did not give me one. The horse was 5 years old, sound and
                    in good order &amp; was worth $150. The oats were in the barn and was
                    carried off by the soldiers in bags on their horses. I think there were some
                    officers present. They did not say anything about the oats, nor did I say
                    anything to them. I asked for no receipts and they did not give me any. I
                    estimated the amount of oats I had put in the barn at 55 bushels, &amp; it
                    was all taken by the soldiers. It was not measured when taken. Oats were worth
                    at least fifty cents per bushel in . The cattle were taken at the time of
                    the Burning Raid, but I did not see them taken although was assured by others
                    they were taken. He saw There were eight head of them. There were 3
                    cows in good in good order &amp; I could have sold them for $40
                    each. They were in good order. The balance were young cattle, from three to four
                    years old each, and were worth from $15 to $20 Each, except one fat steer which
                    was worth $40. The sheep were taken by Gen. Hunters
                    army at the time of the Piedmont fight in the night time. There were six taken.
                    They were good mutton and would have averaged 50 pounds net. I do not know what
                    mutton was then worth. The sheep were worth $4 or $5 each.</p>
                <p>I never saw any thing of any of the property afterward. The sheep were inside the
                    Union lines when taken. I went to get the sheep the evening before they were
                    taken, but the soldiers would not let me get them, and the next morning when I
                    went for them they were gone. The army was then encamped on my farm.</p>

                    Commissioners, says:</p>
                <p>I am  years old and live near New Hope, Augusta County Va. I am the wife of
                    the claimant &amp; have no money interest in his claim. I saw one horse, 3
                    cows and five young cattle and some oats taken from my husband by the Union army
                    during the war. The horse was taken at the time of the Piedmont fight, by Gen. Hunter's army. The horse was in the stable and
                    was taken by the soldiers and rode away. I heard the soldier who took the horse
                    say that he did not like to take the horse, but he was compelled to have him. It
                    was the a black horse, about five years old. I do not know his value.
                    He was a good riding horse. I never saw the horse after he was taken. The oats
                    were taken the same day by some soldiers of Gen.
                    Hunter's army. The oats were in the barn &amp; some were fed on the ground
                    and some carried away by soldiers in bags. I do not know how much oats there
                    was. I do not know its value. I did not hear any conversation at the time. I saw
                        Gen. Sheridan's army take three cows and five
                    young cattle from my husband at the time of the Burning Raid in September 1864.
                    They were in the field and I saw the soldiers drive them away. The soldiers who
                    took the cattle told my daughter in my presence that they had orders to take the
                    cattle and that if we were Union people we would get paid for them. I had been
                    offered $18 each for two of the heifers in the spring before they were taken. I
                    do not know the value of any of the others. The cows were first-rate ones. At
                    the time Gen. Hunters army was there in June 1864.
                    The soldiers who were with it told me that they had killed six of my husband's
                    sheep, that they did not take any more than they were obliged to have. It was
                    the night succeeding the fight that the sheep were taken. I saw the sheep hides
                    on the ground in the camp &amp; recognized the hides from a private mark. I
                    do not know their value.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>

                <p>George W. Garber, witness to prove loyalty of claimant, property
                    taken, being sworn by the Commissioner, deposes and says:</p>
                <p>I am 25 years old reside near New Hope &amp; am a son of the claimant and
                    have no money interest in this claim. I saw one horse 8 head of cattle and a lot
                    of oats--55 or 60 bushels of oats--taken from my father by the Union army during
                    the war. The horse and oats were taken by Gen
                    Hunters army in the year 1864. The horse was in a old house in the yard used as
                    a stable, and a soldier saddled him up in the yard and rode him away. My father
                    told him we were Union people &amp; the soldier said he did not like to take
                    the horse but he needed a horse and must take him. An officer was present who
                    told him not to take the horse, but the soldier said he needed him and must take
                    him. The horse was five years old and was worth $150. The oats were taken at the
                    same time by the same command. Part were fed on the groud and part carried away
                    in bags. I put the oats away in the barn &amp; am satisfied there were from
                    55 to 60 bushels. It was all taken. I did not hear any conversation. There were
                    several officers present. The sheep were taken the night after the Piedmont
                    fight by Gen. Hunters army &amp; the soldiers
                    told me that they had taken the sheep and eaten them. They said they had not
                    taken any more than they wanted to make use of. I saw the hides laying on the
                    ground and recognized them from a private mark, as having been my fathers sheep.
                    The sheep were in good order and would have made good mutton. At the time of the
                    Burning Raid I saw the soldiers belonging to Gen
                    Sheridans army take three cows and five head of young cattle belonging to my
                    father. I saw the soldiers driving the cattle away, but did not hear any
                    conversation. The army was at that time taking all the stock in the
                    neighborhood. I do not know their value as I was a boy when they were taken.
                    This is all I know about it and further say not.</p>

                    loyalty during the war would have rendered it impossible for him to prove his
