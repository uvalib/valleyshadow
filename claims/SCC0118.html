<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John K. Keiser,
                            August 2, 1872</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Keiser's claim for horses, livestock, food, and forage was disallowed by the
                    Claims Commission in 1872 because they were not satisifed with the proof of his
                    loyalty. Two of Keiser's former slaves testified about the taking of the
                    property by Union soldiers. Keiser appealed to the Congressional Court of Claims
                    in 1898.

                    the claimant 23 years. I lived near him during the war. Saw him often, &amp;
                    talked to him about the War. He was opposed to the War, said he would not stay
                    here, but would go North. He was a Union man from start to pole. I
                    looked upon always as a Union man, from beginning to the end. He was looked upon
                    by his neighbors as a Union man. I don't know how he voted upon the ordinance of
                    secession. I heard he was threatened because he was a Union man, they threatened
                    to burn his house. I know he left home, and I heard he had gone North. He did
                    nothing for the Confed Govt. He was very friendly with the Union people, but I
                    do not know that he did anything for the U.S. Govt. I don't know that he owned
                    any Confederate bonds, or did anything to support the credit of the Confederate
                        creditGovernment. I never heard him rejoice over any
                    Northern or Confederate victory. I don't know that he gave any information to
                    any Union Officer, as to the movements of the Confederate Army. The claimant is
                    a very correct &amp; honorable man. I have been a Union all my life
                    &amp; am going to die one. Had the South gained its independence, I don't

                    Rebel Army. He did not vote at all on the ordinance of secession. I heard him
                    say he fed the Union Soldiers, he did not do anything for the Confederate Cause.

                    &amp; belonged to the claimant. I was emancipated by the Proclamation of
                        Presd<sup>t</sup>. Lincoln. I reside now on the land of the
                    claimant. I was present and saw all the property taken, mentioned in the
                    claimants petition. The horses were taken from the stable of the claimant, all
                    the property was on the farm. Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 were taken in June
                    64, by U.S. Soldiers under Genl. Hunter. Items 7, 8, &amp; 9 were taken in
                    the Spring of 1865 by Genl. Sheridan's soldiers. There were thirty Soldiers
                    present when Genl. Hunter's men took the property, they were engaged an hour in
                    taking the property. My Mother Louisa Washington, old Mistress, &amp;
                    Marshall Washington saw the property taken. I did not see any officers present.
                    The whole army was camped on the place when Genl. Sheridan's soldiers took the
                    property the three horses, 300 bus. corn &amp; twenty five sheep. They were
                    all over the place. There was an officer present. I did not hear him say
                    anything. I don't know the names of any of the officers. Marshall Washington,

                    took the property the army was on the march. When Genl. Sheridan's men took the
                    property, the army was camped on the place. Hunter's men took the property with
                    the army. Genl. Sheridans men took the property to the camp on the farm the
                    property was ll moved by the soldiers. I saw them feed the hay to the horses.
                    (Genl. Hunter's men) The Grandmother of the claimant complained, to some of the
                    soldiers, but it did no good. No receipt was given &amp; none asked for. The
                    claimant was not at home. The property was taken in the day time, it was not
                    taken secretly. The property was all in good condition.</p>
                <p>Item No 1 I saw 3200 lbs of pork taken. I estimate the weight by the no. of hogs
                    there were 30 of them. They would have weighed 250 lbs each, nett. The hogs were
                    in the field by the house. I don't know the value of the pork.</p>

                    hay from 20 acres of land, don't know the no of loads. This is the only way I

                <p>...I was a slave before the war, belonged to the claimant, &amp; was set free
                    by the Proclamation of Presdt. Lincoln. I was present &amp; saw all the

                    in 1864 by Genl. Hunter's Soldiers, items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6. The other
                    property was taken in the Spring of the next year, 1865, by Genl. Sheridans men.
                    There were a great many soldiers engaged, each time, in taking the property. I

                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners of Claims. Aug. '72.</p>
                <p>JOHN K. KEISER testifies: age 40; residence Augusta Co., Va. farmer. Claimant.
                    (P. 1). I resided on my farm all the war, except when I was north. My farm
                    contains 130 acres. I went to Baltimore Sept. '64 went from there to Pa. from
                    there to Ohio and W.Va., where I remained until the surrender. I was not in any
                    business a greater portion of the time. Was clerk at the oil wells for a short
                    time. Did not return to the Confederacy until after the surrender in May.
                    Questions 3 and 4 answered in the negative favoable to loyalty. I took the
                    amnesty oath after the war, did not have anything to be pardoned for. Questions
                    6 to 12 inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. They tried to
                    conscript me in the rebel service. Afterwards I was conscripted and left the
                    state. I furnished a substitute when I was conscripted. I did it to keep out of
                    the Confederate Army. Questions 15 to 21 inclusive answered in the negative
                    favorable to loyalty. (P. 3). I left the Confederate states as stated. I was
                    arrested by the Conf. Govt., in '64. I was under arrest today a day
                    and night. I took no oath to get my release. I never was arrested by the U.S.
                    Govt. I had corn, sheep, hogs, bacon and pork and horses taken by the
                    Confederate Govt. I received no pay therefor. Questions 26 and 27 answered in
                    the negative favorable to loyalty. I fed the Union soldiers whenever I could (P.
                    4). I had two brothers in the Confederate Army, both are now living reside in
                    Augusta Co., Va., Jas. M. &amp; W.S. Keiser. Did not supply them with
                    military equipments, money or clothing. I advised them to desert and go North.
                    Questions 31 to 37 inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. I
                    received several passes from Officers of the Confederate Govt to go to my home
                    from Staunton and Richmond. Took no oath to get the pass. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>Under no disabilities. I have held the offices of Overseer of the poor and
                    Constable since the war by military appointment and took the iron clad oath when
                    I qualified. I was at all times in favor of the Union cause. Did not vote at all
                    on the ordinance of secession. After the ordinance I still stuck to the Union.
                    From the beginning of the war to the end I desired to see the Govt. put down the
                    rebellion, and was willing to do all in my power to accomplish that end. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>THOS. H. HARLON testifies: Age 68; residence Augusta
                    Co., mechanic. I have known the claimant 23 years. Lived near him during the
                    war. Saw him often and talked to him about the war. He was opposed to the war.
                    Said he would not stay here but would go North/ He was a
                    union man from start to pole. I looked upon always as a Union man from the
                    beginning to the end. He was looked upon by his neighbors as a Union man. I
                    don't know how he voted on the Ordinance of secession. I heard was threatened
                    because he was a Union man. They threatened to burn his house. I know he left
                    home, and heard he had gone North. He did nothing for the Conf. Govt. He was
                    very friendly with the union people, but I don't know that he did anything for
                    the U.S. Govt. (P. 7). I don't know that he owned any Conf. bonds or did
                    saything to support the credit of the Conf. Govt. I never heard him rejoice over
                    any Northern or Conf. victory. I don't know that he gave my information to any
                    Union Officer as to the movements of the Conf. army. The claimant is a very
                    correct and honorable man. I have been a Union all my life,and am going to die
                    one. Had the South gained its independence I don't think the claimant would have
                    returned to his home in Va. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>THOS. JEFFERSON (col'd) testifies: age 45; residence Augusta Co., am a tavern
                    keeper. I have known the claimant about 15 years. Am a colored man and belonged
                    to R.I. Hope of Staunton, Va. before the war. I was emancipated by the
                    proclamation of President Lincoln. I reside on my own land. I lived in Staunton
                    during the war, The claimant resided 12 miles from me. I saw him often during
                    the war. I had several conversations with him about the war. He always said he
                    never would have anything to do with the rebellion. Said he was always opposed
                    to the war. I regarded him as a Union man. He was as kind to the colored people
                    as he could be. (P. 9). His colored people did as they pleased. His neighbors
                    always regarded him as a Union man, and they do now. I never heard that he was
                    threatened on account of his Union sentiments.. I know that he left here and
                    went North during the war; he came back after the war. I heard him say he went
                    away to keep out of the rebel army. He did not vote at all on the ordinance of
                        secession.. I heard him say he fed the Union soldiers.
                    He did not do anything for the Confederate cause. He owned no Conf. bonds nor
                    did anything to support the credit of the Conf. states. I am a Colored man and a
                    Union man. I don't know that he gave any information to any Union Officer in
                    regard to the movements of the Conf. Army. (P. 10). He rejoiced when he heard of
                    a Union victory but did not rejoice when he heard of a Conf. victory. Had the
                    South gained its independence he never would have returned home. (P. 11).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Nov. 1897.</p>
                <p>WM. McKEEVER testifies: merchant; age 62; residence Staunton, Va. Not related ar
                    interested. (P. 1). I have known the claimant since '63. I was in S.C. before
                    the war, and during the war at Yorktown, Va. I saw the claimant in Staunton, and
                    was acquainted with him here. I left Yorktown and came to Staunton, where I was
                    detailed to work for the Confederate Govt. I was captured here by the
                    Confederate Govt. and afterwards got away from them. After I got away, I was
                    working out at Elizabeth Furnace, in this county. The Union Army under Gen'l.
                    Crook destroyed the furnace and I came home, and was arrested by the
                    Confederates and ordered to report in Richmond. They didn't treat me right after
                    arresting me, wanted to take me by force. I made up my mind I wouldn't go to
                    Richmond. They forced me to go on the train. I left them at the train and went
                    to W. Va. I was in the oil business there and met Mr. Keiser, and he told me
                    that he had left this country on account of being a Union man. Mr.Keiser worked
                    in the neighborhood where I was, and I considered him loyal to the Union. It was
                    in '64 that I met him in W.Va. (P. 2). We were in Wirt Co., inside the Federal
                    lines. He expressed himself that he wouldn't into the Conf. fight. He would
                    desert first. I took seven men out at one time. Mr. Keiser staid away from the Confederacy until after the war. I wouldn't
                    think it would have been safe for him to return had the Confederacy been
                    successful. His sentiments never changed before the close of the war.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED.</p>
                <p>I didn't vote on secession. I was living at Charlotte, N.C. when the vote was
                    taken I don't knew how the claimant voted. I can't say what armies were between
                    us at the time I speak of, Cook and Sheridan were then up and down the valley.
                    (P. 3). I think it was Dec. or Jan. that he was in there. I was there the latter
                    part of '64 and until May '65, and it was during that time that we had the
                    conversations. All I know about the claimant's loyalty to the Union was the
                    result of the conversations referred to, and how he voted or anything of that
                    sort, I don't know anything about. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>JOHN K. KEISER testifies: farmer; age 67; residence Staunton, Va., Claimant. (P.
                    5). I was born the 2nd of Oct. 1830. Prior to and during the war I resided at
                    Wayneoboro, Augusta Co. Parts of the time I was North. I don't recollect when I
                    went away exactly, it was a year or two before the war ceased. I was in
                    Baltimore, Phila., and other places, but the last place was at the oil walls in
                    W. Va. I staid away until after the close of the war.
                    Went away because they wanted to put me in the Conf. army. I had put a
                    substitute in, and they took my substitute and tried to put me. I would have
                    left earlier if it hadn't been for my grandmother, a very old woman and I hated
                    to off and leave her. I was a Union man out and out and was always glad to hear
                    of a victory of the Union side. I helped many a man in getting out of the
                    Confederacy into the Union lines. I knew all the lines, and when they were going
                    out. I saw 25 or 30 start one night, and helped them off. (P. 6). The
                    Confederates threatened me at different times. Threatened to burn my house that
                    me and my grandmother lived in, and they would have done so if she hadn't been
                    there,she being a very old woman, 80 odd years. I had to go off and leave her
                    too. When the vote was taken on secession in '61 I was living at Waynesboro,
                    Augusta Co., Va. I did not vote. I was not at the polls nor near there. I went
                    off and didn't vote. Me and old Mr. Palmer went up in the mountains way off.
                    John K. Koiner lived there and voted there and he was a secessionist, and the
                    man who voted. I think it is a mistake in having my name appear on the poll
                    books. It must have been John K. Koiner instead of John K. Keiser. He was known
                    to be a secessionist. It was dangerous for a man in that community to vote
                    against secession at that time. (P. 7). I don't know of any men of Union
                    sentiments living in that community at that time and voted against secession. I
                    don't think there were any, as Union men threatened on account of Union
                    sentiments After the war I was appointed constable and overseer of the poor by
                    Military appointment. I am a republican and have been since the war, before too.
                    I was always opposed to slavery though I owned slaves and expected to set them
                    free if they hadn't been emancipated. I don't think any but Union men were
                    appointed to office under the military Govt., if it was known. If the south had
                    succeeded I would have been afraid to come back. I never owned Conf. bonds. I
                    did no more than I could help to aid them. I wouldn't give them anything to eat
                    if I could help it. I wasn't at the polls on the day of the election or near
                    there. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED.</p>
                <p>I did not serve before my substitute took my place, and I don't know how long he
                    served. I went to Richmond and bought him and turned him into the company and
                    brought my papers back to the enrolling officer here at Staunton.</p>
                <p>RE-EXAMINED.</p>
                <p>I furnished a substitute instead of going North first on account of the age of my
                        grandmohter. She was an old lady, and I hated
                    to leave her. There was no person there to protect her but me. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>John K. Keiser was a farmer residing in Augusta Co., Va., during the war. He was
                    29 years of age when the war commenced. He went North in Sept. '64, where he
                    remained until the surrender. He left to avoid service in the Conf. army. He was
                    conscripted and furnished a substitute The Confederates took stores and supplies
                    from him for which he says he received no pay. He advised his brothers in the
                    Conf. army to desert and go north. He did not vote on the ordinance of
                    secession.</p>
                <p>His witnesses corroborate these facts. State that his reputation was a Union man
                    during the war. Always expressed himself that way. Confederates threatened to
                    burn his house.</p>
                <p>Claimant also states that he was always pleased to hear of Union victories.</p>
                <p>There certainly can be no doubt entertained from his testimony as to the loyalty
                    of Mr. Keiser throughout the war.</p>

                <p>J.K. Keisor, vs. The United States. Cong. 8615</p>
                <p>SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Testimony taken in Oct. 1898.</p>
                <p>J. Wesley Cook testifies; age 60; no interest or relation. (P. 1) I saw John K.
                        Keisor during the first part of the war sometime
                    during the second year; after that not until the close of the war. He went away
                    after that; think he left because it was too hot for him. Don't know whether he
                    left because he was afraid of going into the war or not. Claimant was considered
                    a union man. His whole family were union people. I didn't run away although I
                    was a union man and wasn't hurt. I worked on the railroad part of the time. I
                    don't know of anybody but old man Harlow in that neighborhood who was threatened
                    with hanging because of union sympathies Thought that was mostly talk, however
                    it may not have been. (P. 2) John K. Koiner lived in the same neighborhood. He
                    wasn't a union man; a secessionist. I worked with him several years before the
                    war. Don't remember talking about secession. He was a well known secessionist.
                    Claimant and Koiner lived in the same neighborhood. Think they voted at the same
                    place. Everybody in the neighborhood understood that Keisor was a union man. and Koiner a secessionist. That was the talk. I
                    don't know how Keisor voted. Don't think he would go
                    against his principles. He was a union man. Have no recollection of seeing him
                    on the day of election. I don't belive he would vote a secession ticket if he
                    did it would be contrary to his talk.</p>
                <p>Cross Examination.</p>
                <p>Have never testified before in this case. (P. 3) I can't say
                    how often I saw Mr. Keisor during 1860 and 1861. He
                    used to come to Staunton and I would see him. Don't know how often. I don't
                    think I saw him from the time of Hunter's Raid until the close of the war. All I
                    know of claimant's loyalty was in the year 1861. I lived in the neighborhood
                    during 1856-78. Knew claimant's family well. Moved from the neighborhood. After
                    that don't know that I ever stopped at their house. I never heard of J.K. Keisor being in the confederate army. I think he lived
                    at the old home place in 1861. Not certain. (P. 4) Koiner lived at Slate Hill
                    Mill about two miles from Keisor. Have no idea how old
                    he was. I understand that Koiner is living somewhere in Florida. Claimant had
                    several relatives around Staunton. I think he has a brother named George K.
                    Koiner living near Waynesborough.</p>
                <p>REMARKS.</p>
                <p>This testimony shows that John K. Koiner lived in the smae neighborhood that
                    claimant lived in and that Koiner was a secessionist, and that Koiner voted the
                    same place that Keiser did. Now as Koiner's name does not appear upon the poll
                    list it is contended that the Judges of Election made a mistake and entered the
                    name John K. or J.K. Keiser instead of Koiner.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                <p>JOHN K. KEISER vs. THE UNITED STATES. #8615, Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANTS' BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case lived near Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia, As he
                    comes from a State that was disloyal to the Union, the burden rests upon him to
                    prove his loyalty by absolute and unmistakable evidence. We submit that he has
                    not done so.</p>
                <p>When the case was examined by the Commission they found:</p>
                <p>That the claimant was conscripted into the Con-federate army; that he went to
                    Richmond and promptly furnished a substitute who served for him throughout the
                    war. That the claimant had passes to go in and out of Richmond and Staunton
                    freely. These passes were issued to him directly by the Confederate authorities.
                    The record shows that he voted for the adoption of the Ordinance of Secession,
                    although claimant swears that he did not.</p>
                <p>An effort is made to impress the court that claimant was loyal because he went
                    north to get out of unpleasant surroundings in Virginia. I desire to call the
                    court's attention to the fact that the claimant found the surroundings
                    aond associations of Virginia sufficiently pleasant and congenial to
                    remain there until the latter part of 1864 as shown by the testimony;
                    and further, that the claimant did not take the <u>oath of
                        allegiance</u> to the United states Government until <u>after the war</u> had ceased.</p>
                <p>The claimant states that he had two brothers in the Confederate service and
                    admits that he didi have passes issued di-
                            directly from the Confederate authorities which
                    enabled him to pass in and out of Richmond and Staunton, Va., and
                    through the Confederate lines without molestation.</p>
                <p>The only two witnesses examined when the claim was before the Commission were
                    Thomas Harlon and Thomas Jefferson, the latter, being
                    a colored citizen. The former testifies that he "had heard" that the claimant
                    was a Union man, and Jefferson only testified in a general way as to having
                    heard of claimant's sentiments being for the Union, but states distinctly that
                    he had never heard of claimant being threatened or molested in the slightest
                    manner for any alleged Union sentiments.</p>
                <p>Since the case was referred to this Court the claimant and one witness have been
                    examined. The claimant admits that he owned a number of slaves. He denies that
                    he voted for secession, although on that question the report from the Treasury
                    Department states:</p>
                <p>The name of claimant (John K. Keiser) appears in the copy of a list of those who
                    voted for the Ordinance of Secession in Augusta County, Virginia.</p>
                <p>It is in evidence that Staunton and Wanyesboro, the latter place the claimant's
                    home, are in Augusta County, and that there was but one John K. Keiser who
                    resided in that county at that time. We submit on this point that if the
                    claimant was not present at the polls and did not vote that he could have proven
                    where he was on that date. In fact there are few things more easily proven then
                    the whereabouts of a person on a Natal day, such as that was, in Virginia. The
                    claimant, however, makes no effort to refute the clear evidence against him, as
                    shown by the record, and furnishes nothing in support of the
                    statement that he was not present and did not vote.</p>
                <p>
                    As to the claimant's service in the Confederate Army,
                </p>
                <p>He <sup>the Claimant</sup> says that the name upon the poll book
                    was not his, but was the name of one John K. <u>Koiner</u>.
                    On that subject, and in confirmation of the report from the Treasury Department,
                    herein quoted in part, we submit and file herewith the following sworn
                    statement, under seal, of the Clerk of the Court of Augusta County, the
                    custodian of these poll books. He says:</p>
                <p>Clerk's Office County Court, Augusta County, W. A. Burnett, Clerk. Staunton, Va.,
                    July 2d, 1898.</p>
                <p>State of Virginia, County of Augusta ss.</p>
                <p>I William A. Burnett Clerk of the County Court of Augusta County in the State of
                    Virginia, the same being a Court of record with Common law and Probate
                    jurisdiction having a clerk and seal, do hereby certify that the Poll Books of
                    the election held in said county of Augusta on the 23rd day of May 1861 upon the
                    question of the "Ordinance of Secession" are filed and are among the public
                    records of said office and court, and it appears from one of said Poll Books
                    held in the town of Waynesboro in said county of Augusta on said 23d day of May
                    1861 the name of "Jno. K. Keiser" is recorded in said last named book on the
                    265th line of same as having voted for the ratification of the Ordinance of
                    Secession as well for the "Amendment to the Con.-stitution of Virginia on the
                    subject of taxation, and I further certify that the name of John K. <u>Koiner</u> does not appear at all upon the said Poll Book.</p>
                <p>Given under my hand and the seal of said Court at Staunton Virginia this 2nd day
                    of July A.D. 1898 and in the 122nd year of the Commonwealth.</p>
                <p>William A. Burnett, Clerk.</p>
                <p>And, as to the Claimants service in the war, on the Confederate side, he says:</p>
                <p>I did not serve before my substitute took my place. I went to Richmond and bought
                    him and turned him into the Company, and brought my papers back to the enrolling
                    officer here at Stanton.</p>
                <p>The only other witness examined since the case was referred to this Court, was
                    the witness McKeever, who states that he considered the claimant possessed of
                    loyal sentiments. He admits, however, that he was not in or around claimant's
                    home before, during or shortly after the war. In fact he says he was down in one
                    of the Carolinas when the war broke out and when the vote was taken on
                    secession, and that he did not see claimant until he met him in West Virginia in
                    the latter part of the year <u>1864</u>. It was at that time
                    that the, claimant (whose substitue was then serving for him in the Confederate
                    army) expressed the quasi loyal sentiments to which this witness McKeever so
                    fluently testifies.</p>
                <p>The witness (McKeever) concludes his testimony with the statement, showing
                    conclusively <u>how little</u>, if anything, he knew of the
                    alleged loyalty of the claimant:</p>
                <p>(P. 3, original dep.) Cross Q. I understand you then to say that all you know
                    about the claimant's loyalty to the Union was as a result of the conversation
                    you had in Virginia? (in 1864).</p>
                <p>Ans. That is all I knew, and how he voted, or anything of that sort I don't know
                    anything about it.</p>
                <p>I cannot feel that this Virginian was a loyal man during the whole period of the
                    war, and I am satisfied in my mind what that whatever he was, he
                    certainly has not proven his loyalty as it is contemplated that he should do
                    under the Act which enables him to have this Court investigate this case.</p>
