<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The claimant is the <sup>widow of</sup> Philip Fishburne who died in 1865 and left all his personal
                    property to her. She is a very old Lady and they have a very large family of
                    sons and daughters. Some of the sons and Grandsons were in the Rebel Army but
                    more in the Union Army. Claimant swears to her own and her husbands loyalty, and
                    two or three witnesses give decided testimony to the loyal conversation and
                    reputation of both as well as  most of the family connection, part of whom
                    had moved to Iowa before the war.</p>
                <p>The Horses were taken by soldiers of Hunter's Command three days after the Battle
                    of Piedmont, and seem to have been needed for the use of the Commad, as many
                    were dismounted. The corn and sheep seem also to have been needed for Army use
                    and were taken by Sheridan in Sept.</p>
                <p>Items five to 15 in claim were taken by Sheridan's Command in March 1865 by
                    Sheridan's Command. We do not allow for Pantry stores usually as Supplies for
                    the Army.</p>
                <p>We allow in full of Claim the sum of Seven Hundred and fourteen dollars on the
                    testimony of Claimant and her daughter.</p>

                <p>Taken in the Property</p>
                <p>Deposition of Same.</p>
                <p>1 Ans. I was present and saw the property taken.</p>
                <p>3 Ans. One of the horses was in the field and the other in the Stable, and the
                    Sheep were in the field, and the hogs were in the pen. The other articles
                    specified were taken from the house, granary &amp;c.</p>
                <p>4 Ans. The horses were taken in June 1864 by soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army. I
                    suppose there <sup>were</sup> two at the Stable and three in
                    the field, but quite a number near by. I do not know whether there was an
                    officer present or not. The two Sheep and Corn <sup>&amp;
                        butter</sup> was taken in September 1864 by soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan. I suppose
                    there were 60 or 70 present. And from item 5 to 15 were taken in March 1865, by
                        Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's
                    Command.</p>
                <p>5 Ans. My daughter Sarah L. A. Fishburn was present.</p>
                <p>6 Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not.</p>
                <p>7 Ans. The property was all taken by soldiers.</p>
                <p>8 Ans. One of the horses was rode and the other was led away. The Sheep were in
                    part butchered on my farm and the others drove off. Same as to the hogs. The
                    Corn was carried off in Sacks and the Bacon &amp; Beef was taken in sacks
                    the Butter &amp; Lard was carried away in Cans in which it was packed. The
                    Apple butter was in Jars &amp; Crocks, and the molasses and vinegar, in
                    buckets, and the hay was carried in bundles. I think too they had a wagon and
                    hauled some hay.</p>
                <p>9 Ans. I suppose the horses were taken to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Camp at Staunton, and in
                    September 1864. The Command marched on in the direction of Staunton, and in
                    March 1865, the Army camped in about 1/2 mile of my house for one night. I did
                    not follow and I saw nothing after it was taken away.</p>
                <p>10 Ans. I only saw them take the horses + all the other articles, but do not know
                    how or for what they were used. A part of the sheep &amp; hogs were killed
                    and the meat carried off.</p>
                <p>11 Ans. I complained about my horses and the other articles, but the reply was
                    that they needed the horses for Army purposes, and the Corn to feed and also the
                    hay, and the provisions to eat, as they were out and needed provisions. They
                    told <sup>me</sup> I would be paid for everything taken.</p>
                <p>12 Ans. I did not ask for a receipt.</p>
                <p>13 Ans. The horses were taken from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. Items 2, 3 &amp; 4 were
                    taken about 2 P.M. and the balance all taken between 3 P.M. &amp; night.</p>
                <p>14 Ans. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter was
                    camped at Staunton, and had had a fight at Piedmont a few days <sup>before</sup>. In Sept. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan was on a raid, and in March
                        Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan
                    camped on night near my house. I knew no officer.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The horses were very fine, young 8 &amp; 6 years old, of good size
                    and well broken. The sheep were fat and also the hogs. The Bacon &amp; Beef
                    sound and good, and all the articles were good. The most of the Corn was on the
                    Cob. I did not measure it. From the quanitity of Bacon &amp; beef I think
                    there must have been the weight specified. I judged the quantity of hay by the
                    amount put into the Mow. Every article was very valuable to me and I think worth
                    all that is charged.</p>

                    the butter carried in Cans. The 6 Sheep were also killed and also the hogs
                    killed too, and the Meat carried away, and every thing else was carried a short
                    distance where they camped for the night.</p>
                <p>9 Ans. I did not follow, but could see them going with the articles to the camp.
                    I mean all items from No. 5 to 15.</p>
                <p>10 Ans. I did not see them use any thing at all. Only saw them taken and carried
                    away.</p>
                <p>11 Ans. I asked them not <sup>to</sup> take the property, and
                    they replied they needed all, ad must take it.</p>
                <p>12 Ans. There was no receipt asked for.</p>
                <p>13 Ans. The horses were taken from 12 to 3 P.M. and items 2, 3 &amp; 4, were
                    taken in the afternoon, when they were on March, and the balance taken in March
                    1865, was in the afternoon. They camped for the night in sight of claimants
                    house.</p>
                <p>14 Ans. When the horses were taken Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter had his camp at Staunton. He
                    had a battle at Piedmont on Sunday before. The horses were taken on a Wednesday
                    of the same week, and when the 2 Sheep, 50 bus.
                    Corn &amp; 50 <sup>lbs</sup> butter was taken the command
                    was marching in the direction of Staunton, and then the last army camped one
                    night in sight. I did not hear the name of any Quarter Master.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The horses were in splendid condition, good sized horses, one 6 and the
                    other 8 years, both of them good riding horses and also worked anywhere. The
                    sheep were No. 1, very fat + large. The hogs were good size and order. The hay
                    sound and good, and from the amount put into the Stable I should think there was
                    3 1/2 Tons. We guessed at the quantity of Corn, by the bulk in the Crib, it was
                    on the Cob. I do not think there was a pound less than 550 <sup>lbs</sup> Bacon, and 300 Beef. The Butter was in Cans, and
                    also the Lard, Apple Butter in Jars &amp; Crocks, and the Molasses and
                    Vinegar in Blls. I do not think that there <sup>is</sup> a charge or item in excess of its actual
                    quantity, and horses and every article worth all and more than the prices
                    charged. I did not weigh any thing or count pieces, but judged the quantity by
                    bulk.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Samuel Landes</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> general question</p>
                <p>My name is Samuel Landes, my age is 50 years. My residence near Spring Hill,
                    Augusta County and my occupation is a Miller. I am not related to the claimant,
                    nor have any interest in the claim. I become acquainted with the claimant and
                    her deceased husband in 1857. At the commencement of the War and until May 1862
                    I lived adjoining farms, and then I removed about 3 miles off. We were intimate
                    and I saw her and husband frequently. I saw her husband Philip Fishburn, at
                    least twice a month. I dont think we ever met without
                    conversing about the War. I was an adherent to the Union, and he was aware of
                    that. I do not recollect any particular expression or language that he used, but
                    I distinctly remember that I could always express myself freely and in
                    confidence in his presence, and I have no doubt of his being a true Union man,
                    and utterly opposed to the war. His reputation in the neighborhood, amongst the
                    Union men, was that of a Union man. I never knew him to do anything in aid of
                    the rebellion. I never knew him to do anything for the Union cause, except that
                    he harbored and helped men to keep out of the rebel service. I do not believe
                    that if the South had succeeded in gaining its independence, Philip Fishburn,
                    could if alive, proven loyalty to it.</p>
                <p>His widow, the claimant, was quite an old lady, seldom from home. I do not know
                    anything about her sympathies, but in my own mind I believe she was in sympathy
                    with her husband. I never heard anything to the contrary.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Erasmus L. Houff</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> general question</p>
                <p>My name is Erasmus L. Houff, my age is 44 years. My residence near Mt. Sidney,
                    Augusta County. My occupation a farmer &amp; a U.S. Store Keeper.</p>
                <p>I knew Philip Fishburn, the deceased husband or the claimant, for about 15 years
                    prior to his death, and resided about 3 miles from him during the war. We were
                    intimate I saw him frequently during the war, probably two or three time a
                    month, frequently spent the night with him. We talked about the War, its cause
                    and progress, and he invariably expressed his devotion to the United States
                    Government. That he at no time expressed any <sup>wish</sup> or
                    used any language in favor of the rebellion or its success. He said frequently
                    in my presence that he had witnessed the War of 1812, and in that he could have
                    fought with good conscience, but that he could not in the rebellion, for that
                    was to destroy what the other was to defend. His wife, the claimant always
                    agreed with her husband in his sentiments, stating what the people had suffered
                    to maintain the Government, and the rebels were now trying to break it down.</p>
                <p>I do not now recollect that there were any persons present (except their daughter
                    Sarah) when we had conversations, but they were always very bold and positive in
                    expressing themselves.</p>
                <p>The Union men of the neighborhood, had full confidence in their loyalty to the
                    Union cause. I was a strictly Union man myself, and consequently visited them
                    because they were true, and I could converse freely and fully with them. I never
                    knew them to do anything for the rebellion, but on the contrary they harbored
                    Union men and helped to keep them concealed.</p>
                <p>If the south had been successful they could not have proven by their neighbors
                    any loyalty to the Confederacy.</p>
