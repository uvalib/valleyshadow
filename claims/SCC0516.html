                <b>Christian Cline</b>
                <p>Deposition of Christian Cline, to prove the taking of property charged in claimants petition.</p>
                <p>1. Witness Says, I am 62 years old, I reside in Augusta Co.Va. I am a farmer. I was present
                    when all the articles named in the petition were take. I saw them taken-two
                    Horses, and saw the Cow in their possession.</p>
                <p>4. Witness says, The property was taken in 1864-the horses in June and the Cow in
                    Sept. Taken from the Claimants farm. The horses
                    were taken by Officers and soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunters Army, and the Cow by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's.</p>
                <p>5. Witness Says-I suppose the family were present. The Claimant was I know.</p>
                <p>6. Witness Says, When the Cow was taken there was a Captain present, but do not
                    recollect about when the horses were taken. I do not <sup>know</sup> the regiment to which the Captain belonged, but it was Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's
                    command. I cant say whether the Captain ordered the
                    taking or not.</p>
                <p>7. Witness Says-The horses were taken from the premises of claimant. There was a
                    conversation between the claimant and soldiers, but I do not know its nature or
                    substance.</p>
                <p>8. Witness Says-The horses were led off by the soldiers, and the Cow drove off.</p>
                <p>9. Witness Says-The horses were taken to Piedmont, where the Army was encamped,
                    and the Cow was drove with Sheridan's Army down the Valley. I did not follow the
                    property or see it after it was taken.</p>
                <p>10. Witness Says-I do not know, but suppose the horsees were taken for the use of
                    the Army, and the Cow likelise. I saw none used.</p>
                <p>11. Witness Says, I do not know that there was any complaint made.</p>
                <p>12. Witness Says, I do not know that any receipt was asked or given.</p>
                <p>13. Witness Says, The property was taken in the day time-afternoon. It was taken
                    publicly.</p>
                <p>14. Witness Says-The Army was encamped at Piedmont about one mile from Claimant.
                    The Army was only there one day and night. The battle of Piedmont took place the
                    same day the horses were taken, but had been no battle or skirmish when the Cow
                    was. I knew no Quartermaster.</p>
                <p>15. Witness Says, The horses were in serviceable order, so was the Cow. The
                    horse, was about 9 or 10 years old and worth $150. The Mare was 4 or 5 years,
                    and worth $150. The Cow worth $25 or $30. The property was all good. The
                    property was taken in 1864.</p>
                <p>19. Witness Says-I believe the property was taken for the use of the Army and not
                    to gratify any one.</p>
                <p>20. Witness Says, I suppose they had need of horses, and beef, and that there was
                    a necessity for them.</p>
                <p>22. Witness says, I think there was such a necessity, as to justify the
                    Government in paying for it.</p>
                <p>23. Witness Says, I think the property was taken by orders.</p>

                    him intimately during the rebellion. I have no doubt of his loyalty to the
                    Union, and he was generally regarded so by his neighbors. He assisted persons in
                    getting to the Union lines, and made the attempt to go himslf but was caught by
                    the rebels. He never did anything voluntarily for the Confederacy. Nor for the
                    United States except to aid persons to get through the Union lines. I do not
