                Wampler's claim for livestock taken in the fall of 1864 was disallowed by the

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimant swears to his loyal sympathies. He also swears that in 1861 he went to
                    Staunton Va under threats and served several days in the Militia - In the spring
                    of 1862 he furnished a substitute to the Rebel Army.</p>
                <p>These acts are inconsistent with loyal adherence to the Cause of the Union and
                    the Government of the United States during the war and we therefore reject the
                    claim.</p>
                <p>Poll Books show he voted for Secession.</p>

                    separately put.</p>
                <p>To question No. 40 he answers - at the beginning of the rebellion I sympathized
                    with the Union cause. I voted for Union men to go to the Convention. I did not
                    vote upon the ratification of the ordinance of secession. After the ordinance of
                    secession was adopted I still adhered to the Union Cause.</p>
                <p>To question No. 41 he answers I do so solemly declare.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the Commissioner as to property taken.</p>
                <p>I was present and saw all the property charged in my account taken. It was all
                    taken at the same time, or about the same time, at the time of Sheridan's
                    Burning Raid. It was all taken by General Sheridan's army. The horses were at
                    the stable when taken and the cattle were in the field close by. They were taken
                    in daylight by a large number of soldiers. I did not notice whether any officers
                    were present. There was an officer present when the horses were taken. One of
                    the soldiers said in reply to a remark made by my father that we were Union
                    people, that if that was so we would be paid for the horses and cattle. I did
                    not ask for receipts and they did not give me any. They were two gray mares -
                    one a four and one a five year old - in good condition and were worth at that
                    time $125 each, at the lowest. I never afterward saw them.</p>
                <p>There were eleven cattle - four milch cows, from four to six or seven years old
                    each, one two year old, five yearlings, and six months old taken. They were
                    driven out of the field by the soldiers and taken away with the army. The cows
                    were worth $25 each. The two year old was worth $18 - the yearlings were worth
                    $15 each and the calf was worth $6. Further deponent saith not.</p>

                    was present at his house and saw two horses and a number of cattle taken from
                    him by the Union army in September - the year I do not remember. I do not know
                    whose army took them. I do not remember hearing anything said at the time by the
                    soldiers. The horses were in the barnyard when they were taken, There were six
                    or seven soldiers present. They were gray horses, from four to five years old,
                    each. They were worth about $100 each, in good money. The cattle were in the
                    field and were driven away by the soldiers at the same time. I do not know how
                    many cattle there were. I cannot describe them or give their value. I cannot

                    related to the claimant and have no interest in this claim. I was at his house,
                    and saw General Sheridan's army take two horses and eleven cattle from the
                    claimant on the 26<sup>th</sup> day of September 1864. The
                    horses were in the barnyard and were ridden away by the soldiers. I don't think
                    there were any officers present. I begged the soldiers to leave the horses but
                    they said they liked good horses and they rode them away. They were gray horses
                    - three &amp; four years old each, and I think were worth $125 each. The
                    cattle were in the field and were driven away by the soldiers. There were two
                     18 mos. old and one calf six months old. There was one
                    brindle the same age as the two . I think the two
                     and the brindle were worth $18 each. There were four cows among the lot
                    two of them were young heifers.</p>

                    during the war, I saw him about twice a week all through the war, we talked
                    sometimes about the war. I knew his political sympathies and opinions, I took
                    them from his talk. He always thought that it was very wrong that he would not
                    have any part in it, I was a union man during the war and the Clt so regarded me. I have heard him express Union
                    sentiments in the presence of others. I knew his general reputation in the
                    community for loyalty, people always counted him a loyal man, his loyal
                    neighbors regarded him as a Union man. I never knew him to contribute any money
                    property or information in aid of either cause during the war. I have no
                    knowledge as to whether he did or did not own any Confederate bonds, I never
                    knew him to contribute any thing to sustain the credit of the Confederacy. I

                    war, I lived about a mile from him durng the war, I saw him he often,
                    about once a week &amp; often talked with him about the war, its course and
                    progress. I knew his political sympathies and opinions by talking with him, he
                    was bitterly opposed to the war, opposed to the rebellion. He said that he would
                    go north before he would go with the Army but the one reason for this
                    was his religious scruples agst fighting, I don't
                    remember anything else he might have said about it. I was a Union man and I
                    think the claimant so regarded me, I knew his general reputation in the
                    community as to loyalty. He was looked upon by both Union and secesh as a Union
                    man. His loyal neighbors regarded him as a loyal citizen. I have heard him
                    express Union sentiments in the presence of others, but we had to be carefull about it. I never knew him to be molested or
                    threatened with injury on account of his Union sentiments. I never knew him to
                    own any Confederate bonds or to do anything to sustain the credit of the
                    Confederate Gov<sup>t</sup>. I never knew him to contribute
                    anything in aid of either cause during the war. From his chat to me and his
                    general reputation I don't think he could have proved his loyalty to the
                    Confederacy if it had been able to maintain a separate Gov<sup>t</sup>, but I do not know of any act done or language he used that might
