                <p>Christian Palmer filed this claim in 1873 for $200, claiming Union troops under
                    General Hunter took one horse in 1864. Christian was a 35 year old farmer who
                    did not vote at all regarding the Ordinance of Secession but who failed to
                    produce much evidence of his loyalty to the Union. The claim was disallowed.</p>

                <p>The evidence in this Case is very meager and quite too thin to be at all
                    Satisfactory. The Claimant is 35 years old and was subject to Conscription,
                        <del hand="h1">and</del> he fails entirely to answer questions numbered from 6 to 14
                    which are intended to elicit the material facts, as to Military service or
                    employing subsitute in the Rebel Army. The omission to answer those questions is
                    Conclusive as to Claimants own testimony and he calls but one witness to loyalty
                    and his testimony is of no force or value whatever.</p>
                <p>We reject the Claim for insufficiency of Evidence of Loyalty and suspicious
                    indications of actual disloyalty of Claimant.</p>
