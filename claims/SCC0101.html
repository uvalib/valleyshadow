<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claim rejected</p>
                <p>The proof of the taking of the property is Entirely insufficient. -The only
                    witness is one Walker-a former slave of the claimant, who says he was not
                    present when the property was taken, but saw it afterwards in the possession of
                    the Army. -How could he identify hay, wood &amp; wheat? Plainly he could
                    not. -He does not tell when &amp; where he saw the Cattle afterwards, or how
                    he could identify them. -From examining the whole of his evidence we think it
                    wholly unreliable &amp; reject the claim.</p>
                <p>It is therefore unnecessary to decide upon her loyalty.</p>

                <p>Question 1<sup>st</sup>. Answer. Witness Says, I am 60 years old
                    I reside in Augusta Co. Va. by occupation a farmer. I have known the claimant
                    Mrs. Baker, about 30 years. I lived near her during the War, and heard her often
                    express herself very bitterly against the rebellion. I had no doubt about her
                    loyalty. She was regarded so by her neighbors, and she was talked about, a good
                    deal on account of her opposition to the South. I never knew her to do anything
                    for either of the Armies. If the Confederate States had succeeded, She could not
                    shown any loyalty to it. She was too strong a Union woman to have even tried.</p>

                    petition.</p>
                <p>Ques. 1 Witness Says, I am 55 years old. I reside in Augusta Co. Va. by trade a
                    blacksmith. I was not present when the property was taken but saw it in the
                    possession of the Army.</p>
                <p>4 Witness Says The property was taken in June 1864, from the farm of the
                    Claimant, Mrs. Baker, by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crook's Army.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup> Witness Says-The property was taken by Officers
                    and soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crooks command I did
                    not know any names of the officers or their rank.</p>
                <p>12 Witness Says, There was not any receipt given or asked for, that I know of</p>
                <p>13 Witness Says, The property was taken in the day time, in the Afternoon-and
                    publicly</p>
                <p>15 Witness Says, The Cattle were fat, and I suppose worth not less than $35 a
                    head. I do not know the quanitity of Hay taken, but it a great deal. The Hay was
                    good, and I think worth about $15. a Ton. The Wheat was standing on the ground
                    and very fine. The Army Camped in the field and destroyed entirely, I think the
                    Wheat was worth $1.50 a bushel. I suppose there was at least 30 Cords of Wood
                    used by the Army. Wood at that time was selling at $4.00 a Cord. The wood was
                    not measured but supposed to be the quantity charged.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness Says, The property was taken for the use
                    of the Army. The Cattle were killed on the ground. The Hay fed and the Wood
                    burnt and the Wheat eaten and tramped by the Horses and Soldiers of the Army. I
                    suppose it was needed, as it was certainly used.</p>
                <p>21 Witness Says, I do not know what their necessities were, but they certainly
                    took it.</p>
                <p>22 Witness Says, I do think that as the Claimant is a widow and all the time for
                    the Union she ought to be paid for her property.</p>
                <p>23 Witness Says, I think the Officers and Soldiers taking the property were
                    acting under orders as Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crook, had his head
                    quarters in the field.</p>

                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the late war.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners rejected the claim because they were not convinced of the

                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, Feb. 17,

                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>Testimony taken in Sept. '71.</p>
                <p>MARY BAKER testifies: age 52; residence Augusta Co., Va.; housekeeper; Resided
                    here for years before the war, and all the time of the war. Never took any oath
                    to the Confederate Govt. or amnesty oath, or never asked for pardon. Never
                    connected with the civil service of the Conf. states. Never engaged in blockade
                    running. Never arrested by the Confederates, but was threatened with arrest
                    because of my sympathies for Union men. Never arrested by U.S. Govt. No property
                    taken by Confederates. My son was arrested and taken to the army. (P.1). I went
                    about 200 miles to get him released. Never contributed anything for the support
                    of the U.S. Had a brother in the Conf. army. No relatives in Union army that I
                    knew of. Did not furnish my brother with anything at all. Never owned a
                    Confederate bond,or did anything to support the credit of the Confederacy. Never
                    gave aid or done anything direct or indirect for the use or benefit of the
                    Confederate Government, its army or navy. I went to Winchester., Va., and had to
                    get a pass to return to my home in Augusta County. Took no oath to obtain it. At
                    the beginning of the war sympathies were with the Union and continued so all the
                    time. I did nothing of my own free will or accord to aid the Confederacy, or
                    against the Union or its cause, and I was willing and ready at all times to
                    assist the Union and its supporters so far as my means, power and the
                    circumstances would permit. (P.2).</p>
                <p>MICHAEL CARWELL testifies: Age 60; residence Augusta Co., Va.,; farmer; Known the
                    claimant about 30 years. Lived near her during the war and heard her often
                    express herself very bitterly against the rebellion. I had no doubt about her
                    loyalty She was regarded so by her neighbors and talked about a good deal on
                    account of her opposition to the South. Never knew her to do anything for either
                    of the armies. If the Confederate states had succeeded, she could not have shown
                    any loyalty to it. (P.3). She was too strong a Union woman to have ever tried.
                    (P.4).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Feb. 1898.</p>
                <p>J. W. ENGLEMAN testifies: farmer; age 54; residence Augusta Co., Va. not
                    interested or related. Acquainted with the claimant, known her for 34 or 35
                    years. (P. 1). She resided one mile of me during the war. She was loyal to the
                    United States Government. Heard her express opinions about the war so far as to
                    satisfy me that her sympathies were with the United States.  of '63
                    remained in Indiana until after the war closed. (P.2). Had conversations with
                    the claimant prior to going North, don't recollect just what she said, but she
                    advised me to go. I suppose her sympathies were with the Union, she knew mine
                    were that way. Don't think I had any conversation with her relative to my
                    entering the Confederate army. (P.3). Don't recollect language she used, but
                    recollect she advised me to go. She had one son W. H. H. Frenzer. Had two others
                    which I regarded as not grown. Claimant was married twice. She kept Jas. A.
                    Frenzer home during the war. (P.4). He was just a boy about 10 years old
                    probably, not old enough to go in the army. Don't know ages of the others, but
                    they were old enough to go in the army. They went North. They did not want to go
                    in the Southern army. Her reputation was good as to loyalty to the U.S. Govt.
                    She was regarded loyal to the U.S. Govt. (P.5).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED</p>
                <p>Became acquainted with the claimant before the war. Her first husband John
                    Frenzer was living the first of the war. Think he died about the second year of
                    the war. He was not in the army. His sympathies were on the U.S. side.
                    Claimant's two sons went north hecause they did not want to go in the Southern
                    army. (P.6). Because their sympathies were with the U.S. Heard them speak of it.
                    Don't know just what they said to me it has been too long a time to remember. My
                    supposition is Wm. H. Frenzer done the most of the talking as he was the oldest.
                    (P.7). I have heard claimant in conversation with my father and myself, which
                    satisfied me that her sympathies were entirely with the Union. Can't give
                    exactly what was said. Have heard her speak her sentiments pretty freely in
                    regard to the war. She did not think it ought to be, and if my memory serves me
                    right she did not want any of her children in it. (P.8). Don't know that I can
                    recollect any particular remark she made. Can't say anything as to her loyalty
                    after the fall of '63, I was not at home. (P.9)</p>
                <p>MICHAEL CARWELL testifies: farmer; age 88; residence Augusta Co., Va.; not
                    interested or related. Knew claimant not less than 65 years. Lived about 6 miles
                    apart. Do not know anything to the contrary, always heard her say she was in
                    favor of the Union. (P.10). Can't say when her sons left, but I was at her house
                    when they left and saw them start, to go North. I had a conversation with her
                    then. She sent for me that night to see them start. Conversation principally
                    about the war and that she wanted them to go North as she was raised in the
                    north. As near as I can remember claimant's first husband died the second year
                    of the war. (P.11). So far as I know she was Union during the war, and is yet I
                    reckon.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED.</p>
                <p>She said so long as we were united together we might stand, but divided we might
                    fall. Saw claimant maybe 100 times during the war. Often. Claimant was raised at
                    Frederick Co. Md., near Winchester, Va. (P. 12). Think she was raised in
                    Frederick Co., Ma., not certain. (P. 13).</p>
                <p>ALEX GIBSON testifies: farmer; age 68; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not interested
                    or related. Knew the claimant before the war. Resided about 2-1/2 miles apart.
                    She was loyal so far as I know, and always appeared to be. Think she 
                    Union. (P. 14).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED.</p>
                <p>Know claimant was regarded as loyal to the Union by several conversations I had
                    with her. Don't know that I can just recollect any particular conversation I had
                    with her at that time. Have heard her express hersepf
                    frequently on the side of the Union cause. Left Va. about March '65. (P.5). In
                    Augusta Co. up to this time except when in the army, Conf. Was in a volunteer
                    company of militia before the war and was ordered out with them., in the early
                    part of '61. Served about 18 months. Belonged to Greenville Co., 5th Va. Inft. I
                    was at the hospital at Staunton during that time. (P. 16). And frequently at
                    home on furlough.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>Heard claimant express herself during the war. Think before Crook and Averil
                    camped near Mrs. Baker. Heard her so express herself before and after June '64.
                    (P.17).</p>
                <p>J. B. CARWELL testifies: farmer; age 53; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not related
                    or interested. Known claimant from my childhood. Lived about 3 miles from her
                    during the war, I suppose. Have heard her express herself as favorable to the
                    Federal side. Think she was recognized by those who knew her as a Union woman.
                    Think that was her general reputation. (P.18).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED. (P.21).</p>
                <p>Don't recall any particular thing she said. She advised her boys to leave, and
                    they did, and I had letters from them when they were on the other side. Don't
                    recollect any one being present in any of our  her expressions. (P.22).</p>
                <p>JOHN A FRENZER testifies: farmer; age 52; residence Augusta Co., Va. Interested;
                    son. Claimant's first husband, John Frenzer died Nov. 19, '61. (P. 24).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims did not seem to doubt the loyalty of Mrs. Baker. The
                    testimony justifies the conclusion that she was at all times loyal to the United
                    States. She was threatened on account of her Union sentiments. Her son was
                    arrested and taken to the army. She did all she could to get him released. Never
                    aided the Confederacy. For the Union all through.</p>
                <p>Her witnesses testify to loyal expressions and loyal reputation throughout the
                    war.</p>
                <p>Mr. Engleman says she advised him to go North.</p>
                <p>There can be no question as to her loyalty.</p>

                <p>DEFENDANTS' BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case lived in Augusta County, Virginia. She seeks to recover
                    for cattle, hay, wheat and wood to the value of $646.25 alleged to have been
                    taken from her by Federal troops in June, 1864. The claim was presented to the
                    Commissioners of Claims. They did not pass upon the question of her loyalty
                    because the proof of the taking was deemed by them insufficient. The counsel for
                    the claimant has carefully abstracted the testimony submitted. The witnesses
                    testify mostly of conversation, which they claim to have had with Mrs. Baker.
                    There are vouchers which indicate that one Mary Baker received pay from the
                    Confederates for certain supplies; but the vouchers are dated one at Abingdon
                    and one at Crockett, Virginia, which are a long distance from claimant's place
                    of abode.</p>
                <p>There is, however, some resemblance in the signatures of the vouchers to that of
                    the claimant in this case.</p>

                <p>MARY BAKER, VS. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8560 Congressional.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided during the war of the rebellion in Augusta
                    County, Virginia, where her claim originated. The Commissioners of Claims
                    disallowed it because they were not convinced of the taking of the property. It
                    was referred to the Court by the Committee on War Claims Feb. 16, 1892. The
                    claimant was held loyal March 5, 1899.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>In her petition the claimant alleges that the following property was taken from
                    her by Gen. Crook's command about June 11, 1864, near Greenville, Va.: 4 head
                    Cattle at $40, $160.00; 16 tons Hay at $15, 240.00; 125 bus. Wheat at $1.25,
                    156.25; 30 cords Wood at $3 per cord, 90.00; Total $646.25.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners of Claims, in September, 1871:</p>
                <p>JOSEPH WALKER testifies: Age 55; residence Augusta County, Va.; blacksmith. Was
                    not present when the property was taken but saw it in the possession of the
                    army. Was taken in June 1864 from the farm of the claimant, Mrs. Baker, by Gen.
                    Crook's army. I did not know the names of any of the officers who mere present
                    or their rank. There was no receipt given or aksed for
                    that I know of. The property was taken in the afternoon and publicly. The cattle
                    were fat and worth, I suppose, not less than $35 a head. I do not know the
                    quantity of hay taken but it was a great deal. It was good hay and worth, I
                    think, about $15 a ton (p.5). The wheat was standing on the ground and very
                    fine. The army camped in the field and destroyed <sup>it</sup>
                    entirely, I think the wheat was worth $1.50 a bushel. I suppose there was at
                    least 30 cords of wood used by the army. Wood at that time was selling at $4 a
                    cord. The wood was not measured but supposed to be the quantity charged. The
                    property was taken for the use of the army. The cattle were killed on the
                    ground, the hay fed, the wood burned and the wheat eaten and tramped by the
                    horses and soldiers of the army. I suppose it was needed as it was certainly
                    used. I do not know what their necessities were but they certainly took it. I
                    think that as the claimant is a widow and all the time for the Union she ought
                    to be paid for her property (p.6). I think the officers and soldiers taking the
                    property were acting under orders as Gen. Crook had his head-quarters in the
                    field. I know that butter and other articles were taken from the house (p. 7).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken at Middlebrook, Va. in February 1898:</p>
                <p>J. W. ENGLEMAN testifies: Farmer; age 54; residence Augusta County, Va.; no
                    interest or relationship. I think claimant's first husband, John Frenger, died
                    about the second year of the war (p.6).</p>
                <p>MICHAEL CARWELL testifies: Farmer; age 88; residence Augusta County, Va.; no
                    interest or relation (p .10). Have known claimant not less than 65 years. John
                    Frenger, claimant's first husband, as near as I can remember, died the
                        first<sup>second</sup> year of the war (p.11).</p>
                <p>JOHN A. FRENGER testifies: Age 52; farmer; residence Augusta County, Va.; no
                    interest; son of claimant. John Frenger, the first husband of claimant died Nov.
                    19, 1861 (p.24).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken commencing August 28, 1900:</p>
                <p>MRS. MARY BAKER testifies: Widow of John Frenger: Age 81; Residence Staunton,
                    Va.; claimant. Resided during the war about 1 1/2 miles north of Greenville,
                    Augusta County, Va. on my farm. I had property taken by the U. S. Army in
                    harvest time, in June or July, the third year of the war, I think (p. l); the
                    wheat was beginning to turn. This property consisted of 4 improved head of
                    cattle; 20 acres of fine wheat; ten-acre field of fine clover; a large meadow
                    ready to mow; twenty-acre field of corn plowed once; about 60,000 rails, I
                    think, all that was on the place; my entire garden; all my chickens; all cooking
                    utensils in my house destroyed; everything in spring house; 25 bushels shelled
                    corn. Do not remember anything else. I lost all the dry hay that was in my barn.
                    This property was taken by Generals Crook, Averill and Hunter, I suppose, for
                    the benefit of the army This property was on my farm when it was taken. I was
                    given no receipts, but Gen. Crook told me to put my claim in. There were three
                    fine heifers and one bull, improved stock and fat (p.2). I can not tell what
                    they were worth; did not know the prices. Three were butchered on the farm and
                    the other was driven off. Can not state how much dry hay was taken; all was
                    carried out of the barn. One very large mow was full. Some of the old pens are
                        sta<sup>n</sup>ding now. I can not state what hay was worth
                    per ton. Do not know the value of wheat, but it was very high (p.3). Could not
                    state exactly how many bushels of wheat the 20 acres would have amounted to, but
                    not less than 400 or 500 bushels. Can not state how many cords of wood the rails
                    which I have stated were taken would have made. Do not know what it was worth
                    per cord.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination</p>
                <p>I did not see or hear any officer but Gen. Crook give direction for the taking of
                    my property (p.4). I went to Con. Crook and told him his men were destroying
                    everything I had. He told me to take an account of everything, which I did. The
                    next morning as he was about to leave he rode up to my house, and told me to put
                    my claim in and I would be paid for it after the war. I do not know under whose
                    direction the soldiers were; I only talked to Gen. Crook and Dr. Wormick (p. 5).</p>
                <p>JOHN A. FRENGER testifies: Farmer; age 53; residence near Greenville, Augusta
                    County, Va.; no interest; son of claimant. I have been present at the taking of
                    my mother's deposition and heard the same. I am acquainted with the farm upon
                    which she lived during the third year of the war and was acquainted with it at
                    that time. Remember the barn that was there; a portion of it is there now. This
                    barn was capable of holding 14 to 16 tons of Day according to the way it was
                    packed (p.6).</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I do not know of my owm knowledge of the loss of my mother's property. I was at
                    Cumberland, Md. at that time (p. 7).</p>
                <p>MARY E. ENGLEMAN testifies: Age 59; residence near Greenville, Va.; no interest
                    or relation. I have known the claimant in this case ever since I can remember.
                    She resided during the war on the Frenger home place. I resided where I now
                    live, about a mile from claimant. I knew that Gen. Crook's army was on part of
                    claimant's farm; I was <sup>on</sup> part of the camp ground. I
                    am not sure whether I was on Mrs. Baker's farm about that time. The camp ground
                    was about 200 or 300 yards from Mrs. Baker's house. I could have seen her house
                    if the ground had been level, but under the circumstances I could not (p.8). I
                    saw evidences of the slaughter of cattle on the camp ground. I saw piles of raw
                    beef thown out as if from some kind of vessel (Objected to by the attorney for
                    the government). I do not know whose cattle the soldiers had slaughtered there.
                    I did not notice the fencing on Mrs. Baker's farm.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I do not know anything of my own knowledge of the losses Mrs. Baker alleges to
                    have suffered from the Union troops (p 9).</p>
                <p>SUSAN M. HAYS testifies: Age 73; residence near Greenville, Ca.; no interest or relation. Have known the claimant since a short time
                    before the war. During June of the third year of the war she lived on the
                    Frenger farm, about a mile from where I lived. I know Gen. Crook's army was in
                    the neighborhood of her farm but do not know whether it was on her farm or not.
                    I was not on her farm; was on the camp ground. I saw where cattle had been
                    butchered on the camp ground but do not know whose they were.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I have no personal knowledge of the losses said to have been sustained by
                    claimant at that time (p. 10).</p>
                <p>S. H. BURNETT testifies: Age 66; residence near Greenville, Va.; no interest or
                    rela-tion. I lived during the third year of the war, in June, in Rockbridge
                    County, Va. The value of cattle where I lived at that time was from $35 to $60
                        accordig to quality (p. 11). I traveled through
                    Augusta, Albemarle and Nelson counties and bought some cattle in Albemarle
                    County about that time. I could not see any difference in the prices in the
                    several counties named. Wheat was worth about that time $1.25 a bushel. Hay sold
                    for $15 per ton. Wood was worth $5 per cord; I sold a good deal and never got
                    less than that (p.12). A rail is 11 feet long and on an average 4 inches square.
                    I do not know how much cord wood they would make per thousand (p. 13).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken at Staunton, Va. commencing Nov. 24, 1900:</p>
                <p>H. F. WISEMAN testifies: Hospital attendant and nurse. Age 50. Residence
                    Staunton, Va. No interest or relation. Have known claimant ever since before the
                    war (p. 1). She resided during the war on her farm, the old Frenger home place,
                    in Augusta County, Va., about two miles, I think, from Greenville. In June,
                    1864, I resided on the adjoinin farm; don't suppose
                    it was over a quarter of a mile from where claimant lived. The U. S. Army was
                    encamped on her farm in June, 1864. I was there the next morning after they
                    left. I know she had four head of cattle at that time. Did not see the soldiers
                    kill them. Never saw them on the place after that time. I saw some pieces of
                    cattle and blood near her barn when I went there the next morning; the hides and
                    most of the meat had been taken away. The soldiers destroyed the whole of her
                    growing crop of wheat; they encamped right in the field and it was tramped down
                    as flat as it could be. On the side of the farm opposite to the side which
                    adjoined the farm on which I lived all the fences were destroyed, both the
                    inside and outside fences. The main part of the army camped on that side of her
                    farm and burned the rails for camp fires. (p. 2):</p>
                <p>Cross-examination</p>
                <p>It was Crook's army that was here at that time and Generals Hunter and Averill
                    also, I think. They came about three o'clock in the afternoon and stayed, I
                    think, until about ten o'clock the next morning. Most of them were infantry;
                    there may have been some cavalry, but I think most of them were infantry. Could
                    not say exactly how many rails were taken. At a rough estimate I would suppose
                    there was something like 35,000 or 40,000 rails. Think there were about 200
                    acres of land in the farm and it was fenced into fields that were small. They
                    were used for regular camp fires by the soldiers for cooking. A good many of the
                    pieces were still burning when I was there. The fences were worm stake and rider
                    rail fences. Mrs. Mary Baker owned this farm at that time.</p>
                <p>Redirect-examination.</p>
                <p>Claimant had about ten acres of growing corn that was destroyed, and I suppose
                    about 16 acres of grass that had not been reaped (p. 3).</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Mary Baker v. The United States. No. 8560 Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>This is a claim for $646.25, the value of stores and supplies in the shape of
                    cattle, hay, wheat and wood alleged to have been taken from the home of the
                    claimant in Augusta County, Virginia, during the year 1864, by soldiers of Gen.
                    Crook's army. Counsel for the claimant has made a fair abstract of the
                    testimony. There is no evidence from any of the witnesses that they saw the
                    property taken. Amounts are approximated. So far as the wheat is concerned the
                    testimony is positive that the soldiers came in the field and camped, and
                    trampled down the said wheat which was growing in the field. According to
                    claimant's own witnesses, the Union troops never derived the slightest benefit
                    from the wheat.</p>
                <p>It will be noted that the prices for cattle, $40 each, is very high. Claimant has
                    charged for hay to the amount of almost the utmost capacity of her barn.</p>
                <p>The testimony as to quantities is very indefinite. The only definite statement as
                    to number, <sup>or</sup> amounts is relative to the cattle,
                    witnesses testifying that claimant had four cattle. In regard to all the other
                    items the witnesses approximate in every case. While objecting to the request of
                    counsel for the claimant, because of the indefinite character of the testimony,
                    it is almost impossible to suggest what amounts, if any, should be found
                    respecting the various items embraced in claimant's second request.</p>
                <p>There is no objection to claimant's first and third requests.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Reply to Defendant's Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1900-1901.</p>
                <p>MARY BAKER VS. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8560 Congressional.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANTS' BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>While it is true, as defendants' counsel states, that the witnesses did not see
                    the property taken, their testimony is quite as conclusive as if they saw it
                    taken. For instance, Joseph Walker testifies that while he was not present when
                    the property was taken, he saw the property, in possession of the army when it
                    was taken, in June 1864, and gives the command.</p>
                <p>Counsel is not quite correct when he states that none of the witnesses saw the
                    property taken. Mrs. Mary Baker, the claimant, certainly was present, as
                    indicated on her examination when she says that she went to Gen. Crook, who
                    commanded the forces that took her property, and told him his men were
                    destroying everything she had, and he told her to take an account of everything,
                    which she did. This shows that she was there when the property was taken and
                    made complaint to the officer and also that she made out an account at the time,
                    from which account she doubtless made her claim.</p>
                <p>The other witnesses testify very clearly that they were there soon after the army
                    left and saw that the property had been taken. Some of them testify that they
                    know she had this property before the army came and that it was gone after they
                    left. Now, as there was no one else to take it, the presumption is irresistible
                    that the Federal forces did get the property that is charged for.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the contention of defendants' counsel to the contrary, I think
                    the quantity, of hay is very definitely proven as charged. The claimant states
                    the the mow in her barn was full of hay at the time the Federals came and that
                    they took it all; that besides this they took the hay from a ten-acre field of
                    fine clover.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that this was taken in June 1864, about the time that hay was
                    matured in the field and ready for harvesting. In fact the claimant testifies
                    that it was ready to mow.</p>
                <p>Mr. Frenger, who was familiar with claimant's property and knew about her barn,
                    states that the barn was capable of holding from 14 to 16 tons of hay.</p>
                <p>So, taking the standing hay, which was ready to mow, and the amount that was in
                    the barn, it is proven conclusively that they took much more hay than is charged
                    for.</p>
                <p>Now as to the wheat:</p>
                <p>This wheat was taken at a time when it was ready for harvesting, in June 1864.
                    There were 20 acres of it and it would yield from 400 to 500 bushels to the
                    acre. While the proof shows that the stock trampled down this wheat to a large
                    extent, it is not unreasonable to believe that out of 400 or 500 bushels that
                    they used 125 bushels, that is, got the benefit of that number of bushels by
                    feeding their stock.</p>
                <p>So the quantity of wheat, notwithstanding defendants' counsel to the contrary, is
                    a reasonable charge and is fully supported by the proof.</p>
                <p>Again, as to the wood, Mr. Walker testifies that the claimant had at least 30
                    cords of wood used by the army, which was selling at that time at $4 a cord. The
                    proof shows that they took about 60,000 rails. That would make at least 30 cords
                    of wood.</p>
                <p>Mr. Wiseman testifies that the claimant had in her farm about 200 acres and it
                    was fenced in small fields; that they burned the fence on one side of the farm.
                    He, being a farmer, could properly make an estimate and he says there were
                    something like 35,000 or 40,000 rails taken.</p>
                <p>So there can be no doubt as to the quantity of wood. There should have been more
                    charged for. $3 a cord is reasonable. The finding should therefore be as
                    requested, that is, 30 cords of wood at $3 per cord.</p>
                <p>It is very evident therefore that this claim is just for the property charged for
                    and that the prices requested to be found are very reasonable. The finding of
                    the Court should be as requested in the original petition.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>

                <p>Mary Baker vs. The United States</p>
                <p>STATEMENT OF CASE</p>
                <p>The claim in the above-titled case for supplies, or stores, alleged to have been
                    taken by or furnished to the military forces of the United States, for their use
                    during the late war for the suppression of the rebellion, was transmitted to the
                    Court by the Committee on War Claims of the House of Representatives on the 16th
                    day of February 1892.</p>
                <p>On a preliminary inquiry the Court, on the 5th day of March 1899, found that the
                    person alleged to have furnished the supplies or stores, or from whom they were
                    alleged to have been taken, was loyal to the Government of the United States
                    throughout said war.</p>
                <p>The case was brought to a hearing on its merits on the fourth day of December
                        189 1901, Gilbert Moyers, Esq., appeared for claimant, and the
                    Attorney General, by George H. Walker, Esq., his assistant, and under his
                    direction, appeared for the defense and protection of the interests of the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>The claimant in her petition makes the following allegations:</p>
                <p>That she is a citizen of the United states, residing in Augusta County, State of
                    Virginia, where she resided during the late war of the rebellion; that at
                    different times during said period the United States forces, by proper
                    authority, took from her quartermaster stores and commmissary supplies of the
                    value of $646.25, and appropriated the same to the use of the United States
                    Army, as follows, namely:</p>
                <p>Taken by Gen. Crooks' command about June 11, 1864, near Greenville, Va., 4 head
                    Cattle at $40, $160.00; 16 tons Hay at $15, 240.00; 125 bushels Wheat at $1.25,
                    156.25; 30 cords Wood at $3 per cord, 90.00: $646.25</p>
                <p>The court, upon the evidence, and after considering the briefs and argument of
                    counsel on both sides, makes the following</p>
                <p>FINDING OF FACT</p>
                <p>There were taken from the claimant in Augusta County, State of Virginia, during
                    the war of the rebellion, by the military forces of the United States, for the
                    use of the army, stores and supplies of those above described, which at the time
                    and place of taking were reasonably worth the sum of Four hundred and twenty-six
                    dollars ($426).</p>
                <p>It does not appear that payment has been made for any part thereof.</p>
