<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Claimant is forty three years old, and was within Conscript age during the War.
                    He seems to have been detailed as a tanner to prepare supplies for the
                    Confederate Army as well as we can gather from his answers to questions, and was
                    exempt therefore from service in the field. This employment was inconsistent
                    with loyalty in itself, but aside from that the evidence of loyalty is not
                    satisfactory. He had two brothers in the Rebel army and we see no clear
                    indication that his sentiments differed from theirs. Moreover there is no
                    evidence that the articles charged were taken as supplies for the Army or were
                    so used - One witness swears that thirteen tanned calf skins were taken by
                    soldiers of Hunter's Command but there is no evidence or inferences fairly
                    deducible from circumstances that they were taken for the use of the Army.
                        There A boy, now 15 years old and then seven or eight swears that
                    some soldiers came in the night and took two saddles and eight bushels of Corn.
                    That is all the evidence in support of the claim and it is of course utterly
                    insufficient and unsatisfactory and we therefore reject it.</p>
