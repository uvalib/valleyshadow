<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The claimant is a farmer about 59 years of age - he resided in Augusta Co. Va. He
                    alleges that his sympathies were at all times with the federal union &amp;
                    that he gave no voluntary aid to the confederates, that he furnished them no
                    supplies &amp; they paid him nothing for the property taken from him - He
                    was never threatened molested or injured on account of his union sentiments
                    &amp; no facts are proved tending to show that the Confederates regarded him
                    as a Union man &amp; an opponent of the Confederacy - he belonged to the
                    Virginia Militia &amp; early in the war went with his company to Staunton
                    procured a substitute &amp; went home. Subsequently conscripted &amp;
                    figured to get out of the service. In the last year of the war he was a member
                    of the Home Guard who did patrol duty &amp; employed in looking up deserters
                    - did duty in the Home Guard for a month or two - In his first deposition he is
                    recorded as swearing that he voted against the ratification of the ordinance of
                    secession - he afterwards swears that he did not vote on that question - his
                    name is not recorded as voting either way - the confederate archives show that
                    Mr. Eakle was paid $190.00 for corn &amp; fodder sold to a
                    Q.M. in the Confederate Army Dec. 31, 1864 - If the claimant
                    has been at some time or is now as one of his witnesses intimates "a black
                    republican" it does not show that he remained during the war
                    a loyal adherent to the Union Cause - The claim is disallowed.</p>

                    with the Union cause. I used my influence for the Union. I voted the Union
                        ticket. I did not vote. I voted against the ratification of the
                    ordinance of secession. After the ordinance of secession was adopted I still
                    adhered to the Union cause and did not go with my state.</p>
                <p>To question No. 41 he answers, I do so solemnly declare.</p>
                <p>The claimant is here examined by the Commissioner concerning property taken. I
                    was present and saw all the property charged in my account taken on the 6th of
                    June 1864 the morning of the battle of Piedmont, by Gen. Hunter's Army. The army
                    encamped on my farm. My horse was in the yard by my house and was taken by a
                    calvary soldier. He told me he would return my horse if he stayed in Staunton
                    for long enough to get one to suit him. He said his horse had
                    given out. He left his horse with me and the Confederates got him. My horse was
                    a gray one, four years old, in tolerably fine condition and was worth $150. I
                    went to get my horse back &amp; saw Gen Hunter and he said they had lost
                    some horses in the battle the day previous and that they were compelled to take
                    some. He said nothing about pay for the horse. My beef cow was in the lane near
                    the house when she was taken by the soldiers who put her in the  and took
                    her away. They said she was in good beef order and they would have to take her.
                    There did not seem to be any officer present. The  them, . I did not
                    ask for receipt and they did not give me any. It was a new large cow and would
                    have netted 650 pounds. She was in tolerably fair condition, she was worth $60
                    on the hoof. The rye and buckwheat were taken out of the barn and fed to the
                    team horses along the road near the house. It was not measured. Estimated it. No
                    conversation took place at that time about it. There were ten bushels of rye
                    &amp; five bushels of buckwheat. Rye was worth about $1 bushel &amp;
                    buckwheat about $1 per bushel.</p>

                    Commissioner says:</p>

                    to the claimant and have no interest in this claim. I was present and saw the
                    Union army under Gen. Hunter take a horse belonging to the claimant the day
                    after the fight at Piedmont. I do not remember what year it was. The
                    horse was in the barn and the soldiers led him out. I did not hear anything said
                    as there  confusion at the time. I did not take notice whether any officer
                    was present. It was a gray horse. I don't know how old. It was tolerable fair
                    condition. I do not know what it was worth, as I am no judge of horses. I think
                    it was a pretty good family horse. I don't think the army was encamped about
                    there at that time. This is all I know about it, and further saith not.</p>

                    the claimant and have no interest in this claim. I lived about a half mile from
                    him during the war and saw him about once a week. I talked with him in regard to
                    the progress of the war. He seemed to be greatly opposed to the rebellion and
                    spoke a great deal against it. I heard him so express himself in the presence of
                    others. I was a Union man and he so regarded me. I knew his public reputation in
                    the community. It was that of a Black Republican. He was regarded a loyal man by
                    his loyal neighbors. I never knew him to own any Confederate Bonds. I never knew
                    him to contribute in any way toward the financial credit of the Confederacy. I
                    never knew him to render any assistance to either army. I never knew him to be
                    threatened with injury or molested on account of his Union sentiments. I know of
                    no act done or language used, but I am satisfied his reputation for loyalty
                    would have prevented him from proving his loyalty to the Confederate Government

                    charged taken by the Yankee Cavalry out of the yard. The Cavalry that got the
                    horse belonged to Genl. Hunters command. I did not hear any thing said at the
                    time I was in the house. It was taken the day after the battle which was fought
                    at Piedmont, June 6th don't remember the year. It was a grey horse. I don't know
                    his age, he was in tolerable condition - very good working order. The Army was
                    passing at the time, the yard was full of soldiers at the time, the Officers
                    were present at the time some came and sat on the portico a good while
                    afterward. I don't know what the horse was worth at that time.</p>
                <p>I know that the cow disappeared at that time and I saw him at the road with some
                    other cattle which belonged to the Army, I never saw her afterward. It was a red
                    and white  cow notably large, in very good order 
                    giving very little milk at the time. I don't know the value of the cow at the

                <p>I suppose the distance between our residence during the war was about five miles,
                    a part of the time perhaps six miles. I did not see him often during the war, I
                    had one extended conversation with him about the cause of the war and its
                    probable results in 1861. He expressed himself very decidedly against secession
                    and in favor of the Union and its cause. He believed the war was uncalled for
                    and without any necessity. His character among his Union neighbors, was that of
                    a strict and rigidly union man, and known by all as free in his expressions of
                    loyalty to the Union. I was a union man and known as such by the claimant. I
                    never had a doubt of his loyalty, and believe if there was a true man to the
                    union he was one. I never knew him to do anything to aid the rebellion and am
                    satisfied that if he did do anything it was because of compulsory measures. I
                    suppose he was out with the malitia but if so, he was
                    as all able bodied men under forty five years were required to be enrolled under
                    the State , I mean by being "<u>called out</u>." That
                    he was required to report at Staunton for enrollment and that was all the
                    military duties he performed. I remember that he and I agreed that before we
                    would go into the rebel army, we would go through the lines. This agreement was
                    made on the day we enrolled at Staunton. As to his furnishing a substitute, the
                    law required all men under 45 years of age to be enrolled as a
                    soldiers, and all under that age had either to take his place in the Army,
                    furnish a substitute or leave the Secession lines. The claimant having a
                    dependent family, he procured a Substitute in order to remain with his family.
                    He did not do it because of any sympathy he had for the cause of the rebellion,
                    for he had none. I do not know what the oath was that was required
                        byof the militiamen I did not take any oath myself and
                    do not know that the claimant did take the oath - I presume the oath was
                    allegiance to the State of Virginia, and not to the Confederate Government for
                    there was no Confederate Government organized then. I have been intimate with
                    the claimant since the close of the War and have found him a bold and
                    unflinching adherent to and supporter of the Union party. I am satisfied that
                    the claimant could never have proved the slightest loyalty to the Confederacy.</p>

                <p>Answer - my name is David Myers, my age is 57 years, residence New Hope, Va. I am
                    not related to the claimant. My deposition was taken once before in this case on
                    the general character of the claimant for loyalty.</p>
                <p>I heard that the claimant furnished a substitute but he did it because being of
                    the military age he had either to take his place as a soldier in the rebel army,
                    leave the lines or get a substitute and he chose the latter because of the
                    interests of his family. I do not mean to say that a man had the privilege
                    granted by the rebel authorities of leaving the lines. I am satisfied that his
                    putting required or taken.</p>

                <p>During the war I was a youth and never had any conversation with the claimant,
                    but I know that he was regarded by both his union and rebel neighbors as a Union
                    man, believed to be an Abolitionist. Since the war the claimant has been a
                    working man in the Republican party - From all I heard of him during the War and
                    since I believe he was truly a loyal man to the Union and its government, and
                    that he did nothing to aid the rebellion except what he was compelled to do.</p>

                    am 59 years old. I reside about one mile from New Hope. I have lived where I am
                    now all my life, I am the claimant claim 16218. When the militia was called out
                    in 1861 by this State I belonged to the militia and went with my company to
                        Staunton and was there in camp with them for some time, then I
                    procured a Substitute &amp; put him into the Confederate Army. I do not
                    remember whether I was detailed by the Confederates Army as a .
                    I was Subsequently conscripted &amp; went to Staunton and by Some
                    figuring of the Proost Marshall I got out of it
                    &amp; went home that night. Subsequently in the last year of the war I was a
                    member of the home guard. The duties of the home guard was doing patroll duty and looking up deserters from the
                    Confederate Army. I done duty in the home guards for a month of two, when the
                    Ordinance of Secession was Submitted for a vote of the people here I do not
                    recollect whether I went to the Polls or not. I dodid not
                        think I voted at all. I did not hold any office what
                    ever under the Confederate States Government of the State Government during the
                    War. The day after the Piedmont fight I lost a grey horse he was taken in the
                    day time, a Soldier came and with four or five men, they come from the big wood
                    into the yard after water &amp; this horse was there in
                    the yard &amp; they Saw him &amp; one of the Soldiers Said his horse had
                    given out and he must have one &amp; he took him off. I Saw him riding him
                    after this. I do not know that any officers were with this Squad that took my
                    horse. I never went to any Quarter Master to get pay for this
                    horse or a voucher for him, and at the Same Time some Soldiers drove off a fine
                    milch cow, the army had torn down the fence &amp; my cows come down to the
                    Big wood, and this one got among their cows &amp; they drove her along the
                    Rye &amp; Buckwheat charged in the account was taken from the grainery at
                    Same Time by the soldiers &amp; fed out along the road Side, to their
                    horses, when they took my cow She was worth Sixty five dollars &amp; they
                    left me one worth about twenty dollars &amp; I kept this one for two years
