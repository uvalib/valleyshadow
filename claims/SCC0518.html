                    by claimant to prove the taking of the property named in the petition, being
                    duly sworn as follows.</p>
                <p>1<sup>st</sup> Witness says I am 53 years sold. I reside in
                    Augusta Co.Va. I am
                    house keeper. I have was present when the property named in the
                    petition was taken. I saw it taken. There were two horses, two Cows, One barrel
                    of Flour, the Bacon of 3 Hogs, two Bridles and One Saddle. I suppose the hogs
                    weighed about 150 lbs each.</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup> Witness says the property was taken in June 1864
                    from the claimants premises in Augusta Co.Va. by officers and soldiers of the United States
                    Army under Command of Genl. Hunter. An officer
                    ordered the soldiers to take the property.</p>
                <p>7<sup>th</sup> Witness says the soldiers come in and took the property.</p>
                <p>8<sup>th</sup> Witness says the horses were rode and led away,
                    and the Cows were driven. They carried the flour and Bacon away on their
                    shoulders.</p>
                <p>9<b>th</b> Witness says they were encamped about 1/2 mile away,
                    where they took property too.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup> Witness says they said they wanted the property
                    to help in breaking down the rebellion, and I suppose it was used for that
                    purpose. I never saw it afterwards.</p>
                <p>11<sup>th</sup> Witness says there was no complaint made to any
                    officer.</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup> Witness says there was no receipt asked for or
                    given that I know of.</p>
                <p>13<sup>th</sup> Witness says the property was taken in the day
                    time, publicly between 10 A.M. and evening.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup> Witness says there was no encampment near,
                    except for a few hours when they moved and camped for one night about 3 miles
                    from claimants. There had been no battle or skirmish near. I knew none of the
                    officers at all.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup> Witness says The one was 6 years old and in good
                    condition and worth $150.00. The other was about 9 years old, also in condition
                    and worthy fully $150.00. The Cows were worth $35.00 &amp; 25$ or $60 for
                    both. I do not know what the flour was worth. I suppose the Bacon was worth
                    about 25 cents a pound. The bridles were worth $1.00 a piece and the saddle
                    about $10.00 the property was all good and I think fully worth my valuation.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness says I would think the property was
                    taken for the Army and not for private use.</p>
                <p>20<sup>th</sup> Witness says-I suppose they needed the articles
                    of property.</p>
                <p>21<sup>st</sup> Witness says-I think they needed what they took.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup> Witness says-I think there was such a necessity

                    the horses, one from W<sup>m</sup>. Basserman, near Middlebrook and the other from a man in Highland
                    County, whose name I have forgotten, and the Cow and heifer (2 years old) he
                    bought the cow and raised the heifer. We raised the hogs that made the bacon,
                    and bought the flour, and the Saddle &amp; bridles. We were living on rented
                    land, belonging to D. Baylor. I suppose there were 150 acres, about 50 acres in
                    timber. I have filed no petition bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>69. I am married, my husbands name is Samuel Blackburn, we were married in 1868,
                    December 31. My first husband John Patrick died in 1867 or '68, he was a Union
                    man. he made no will. I had as I have stated three children, hamed John F.
                    Patrick, Philip Patrick, &amp; George M. Patrick, they were sold to a trader
                    and carried off. I have no knowledge of them at all. My deceased husband did
                    nothing at all in aid of the rebellion. My children were quite young when sold.</p>
                <p>70. My husband bought me the year the War commenced, I think it was. I lived with
                    my husband who rented land and farmed, he had been a free man for about ten
                    years before he purchased me. he paid over one thousand dollars for me. I
                    belonged to Henry Mish. I am not in his debt or employment. If my children are
                    living would be interested. I suppose my present husband too.</p>
                <p>72. I was present and saw the property taken. The horses were taken from the
                    field and bridled at the house, and the saddle put on at the same time and rode
                    away. The Cattle were in the Meadow close to the house, where the soldiers went
                    and brought it down, and carried it to their Camp a short distance from my house
                    and the flour out of the house. The property was all taken in day light. The
                    Army came about 9 oclock A.M. and left in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>74. There was no complaint made, by husband was sick at the time. I told one of
                    them that I thought he might leave me a little flour. I knew no names of any
                    soldier or officer, and did not ask for a receipt. I have never received any pay
                    nor did my husband, ever ask or try to get any in his life time.</p>
                <p>77. The Army was in camp, near my house for a part of the day. They came from the
                    West and crossed the Mountain from Pond Gap to Summerdean, and when they left
                    they started in the direction of Staunton. The Army was in command of General
                    Averall, but generally known as Genl. Hunter's, and
                    it was in June 1864. There had been no battle in that vicinity.</p>
                <p>79. The horses were in good condition, and of good quality, one was a young horse
                    and the other not old. They worked and rode well, and of good size. I think they
                    were worth one hundred and fifty dollars each. The Cattle were fat, and from
                    their size, they cow being very large and the heifer very large too. I think
                    they were worty fifty dollars, and thirty dollars. The bacon was averaged by the
                    weight of the hogs when killed, which was 150 <sup>lbs</sup>
                    each for two and 100 <sup>lbs</sup> for the third, and we had
                    used but little of the bacon, we had none but us two in family. Flour was worth
                    ten dollars in good money. The Saddle was some worn and the bridles were very
                    good. I do not know whether an officer was present or not. They were in camp in
                    our meadow.</p>

                <b>Michael Carwell</b>
                <p>Deposition of Michael Carwell</p>
                <p>My name is Michael Carwell, my age is 63 years. My residence near Middlebrook in
                    Augusta County, my occupation a farmer. I have no interest directly or
                    indirectly in the claim and in no way related.</p>
                <p>52. I testify in behalf of the claimant.</p>
                <p>53. I have known the claimant for about fifteen years, and knew her intimately
                    during the war, and always found her willing and ready to do all she could for
                    the Union cause. She would receive and conceal provisions &amp;c for persons
                    who were making their escape from the rebel army through the lines. She could be
                    depended on, and her deceased husband John Patrick, whom I knew intimately was a
                    faithful co-worker. They were free, Patrick having purchased hiw wife, the
                    claimant in this casee, and they were past common for their industry and economy
                    and regarded by all strictly honest, by their industry &amp;c they made
                    money and saved it. I was a Union man myself, and always felt safe in confiding
                    in them, and trust my secrets and plans with them. I have known them to be
                    threatened by rebels, because of their intimacy with Union men and because they
                    were suspected for harboring Union men and provisions.</p>
                <p>I was not present and did not see the property taken, but I do know that they had
                    such property and the morning after the Army passed their property was gone.
                    They told me that the Union Army commanded by General Averall or Crooks, who had
                    crossed the Mountain from Pond Gap to Summerdean, had taken their property, and
                    I believe they did. I never saw the property afterwards. There is no doubt that
                    the property really belonged to them and no one <sup>else</sup>
                    white or colered had any interest in the property.
                    John Patrick was a farmer and made money at it. The horses were really good
                    animals young and strong farm horses. I think they were worth one hundred and
                    fifty a piece. I do not know what the cattle were worth, but suppose sixty or
                    seventy dollars, bacon was selling at 25 cents in good money and flour ten
                    dollars per barrel in good money.</p>

                <p>I will add that I knew Samuel Blackburn the present husband of the claimant,
                    during the War, he was a slave, belonging to John Randolph of Albemarle County,
                    he went off with the Union Army, and remained until after the close of the war.
                    I have no doubt of his loyalty, his reputation is that of an honest man.</p>

                <b>Henry Mish</b>
                <p>Deposition of Henry Mish</p>
                <p>My name is Henry Mish, my age is 62 years my residence near Middlebrook in August
                    County. My occupation a farmer. I have no beneficial interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>I testify in behalf of the claimant.</p>
                <p>53. I have known the claimant Mary Blackburn, since 1837. She was my servant for
                    twenty years. I got her with my wife, and sold her to her husband John Patrick
                    deceaseed in 1869. He was a free man, and had been for a number of years.</p>
                <p>54. They lived about one mile from me.</p>
                <p>55. I saw them frequently sometimes, two or three times a week.</p>
                <p>56. From all I heard them say and do, I regarded him and the claimant as in every
                    way loyal to the Union.</p>
                <p>57. I do not know of anything, of myself but heard from others that they did aid
                    persons who were trying to go through the lines.</p>
                <p>58. I know of nothing done by them against the Union. He was impressed at one
                    time to haul a load of supplies for the Confederate army, but he told me that if
                    done so again, they would have to tie him. The claimant I am satisfied never did
                    anything at all.</p>
                <p>60. I never heard anything against their loyalty to the Union, and believe that
                    the Union men of the neighborhood had confidence in them.</p>
                <p>61. Michael Carwell, Washington and Jacob Hess, John Engleman, &amp; Geo Rubush, I think they all would testify to their
                    loyalty if called upon.</p>
                <p>62. I adhered to the Union myself and was treated as such by my rebel neighbors,
                    during the war and since, and the claimant &amp; her deceased husband knew I
                    was.</p>
                <p>63. John Patrick told me that he was threatened by some rebels.</p>
                <p>64. From my knowledge of them, I could not testify to their loyalty to the
                    Confederates, had they gained an independence. I was not present and did not see
                    the property taken, but I saw the horses and cattle at claimants house about an
                    hour before the Army arrived, and I know they were gone the next morning. They
                    told me that the Union army had taken them, and I believe they did, as I never
                    saw the property afterwards. The Army was in command of Genl. Averal and Crooks, and it was in June 1864. The horses were in
                    good condition and so were the cattle. The horses were young &amp; strong
                    and I think they worth One hundred and Seventy dollars each. I paid that, for
                    not as good. I would think the cattle were worth forty or forty five dollars a
                    piece. I know nothing of the other property charged, but believe they were too
                    honest to make a false charge. John Patrick dec<sup>d</sup>. and the claimant, were of the most
                    honest and industrious character. Samuel Blackburn, present husband of the
                    claimant, is an honest upright man, and I believe loyal to the Union, I never
                    heard anything to the contrary. I know he is a working republican.</p>
