                <p>Isaac Ware was a black man living in Staunton during the war; presumably he was a
                    slave, since his name is not listed in the Registry of Free Blacks for Staunton.
                    The Commissioners were satisifed that he was loyal to the United States but did
                    not see sufficient evidence proving that Union troops took his horse, and
                    therefore disallowed the claim.</p>

                    the stable" "I was about 50 yards off."</p>
                <p>One would think that he would know, if at that distance, whether the horse was
                    taken or not, &amp; yet he says - "I did not see it taken. I believe it was
                    taken."</p>
                <p>He says afterwards - "The horse was led off by officers &amp; soldiers"! That
                    is an absurd statement. If led off at all only one would lead him off.</p>
                <p>It is plain he means to assert the taking only as he <hi rend="underline"

                <p>Quest 1 Witness says -- I did not see it taken but I saw the soldiers and
                    officers with it. It was in the stable and I believe they took the horse of the

                <p>7 Witness says -- They took the horse from the stable officers and soldiers were
                    present and took the horse I was about fifty yards off from the stable when they
                    took him out of the stable</p>
                <p>8 Witness says -- The horse was led off by officers and soldiers</p>
                <p>9 Witness says -- The horse was brought to Staunton</p>
                <p>10 Witness says -- I suppose that the horse was taken for the use of the United

                <p>11 Witness says -- There was no complaint made to any officer or soldier on
                    account of such taking</p>

                <p>15 Witness says -- The property was in good condition and eight or nine years old

                <p>Quest 1 How old are you where do you reside and what is your occupation?</p>
                <p>I am twenty five years old I reside in Augusta County Virginia by occupation a
                    cooper. I have known the Claimant all my life we live together I saw him every
                    day during the war he is a colored man and was loyal to the United States
                    Government all the war and he was so regarded by all his neighbors I never knew
                    him to do anything for the Union or Confederate Governments during the war I
                    think he was too loyal to the United States Goverment to have been considered
                    loyal to the Confederacy if it had succeeded I also think that the property
                    mentioned in the Claimant's petition was worth what the Claimant has charged the
                    Government in his petition and further the deponent saith not August the 21<hi
