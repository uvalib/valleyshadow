<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The claimant is a farmer, has resided in Augusta Co.
                    all his life. Was within the conscript age but how he kept out of army does not
                    appear. He did nothing in aid of the Confederacy swears that he at all times
                    sympathized with the Union Cause-witnesses testify to his loyalty. As the case
                    when submitted by the claimants atty. was devoid
                    of such facts as would clearly indicate  the loyalty or disloyalty of the
                    claimant it was entrusted to an Agent for investigation. His report &amp;
                    the testimony accompanying it satisfies us that he was loyal &amp; dhered to
                    the Union Cause.</p>
                <p>The claimants horse &amp; bridle were taken for the use of the army by
                    soldiers of Gen. Sheridans command about the 1<sup>st</sup> Oct. 1864. No voucher was given or payment made.</p>
                <p>We recommend the payment of $154.00</p>

                    &amp; he was so regarded by his neighbors. I suppose he aided his brother in
                    trying to escape into the Federal lines, to avoid Confederate service, he never
                    did any thing for the Confed. Govt. Never Knew him threatened molested or
                    injured on account of his union sentiments. He thought, from a conversation I
                    had with him, that he would not be allowed to stay in the South, if the
                    Confederates succeeded, on account of his loyalty to the U.S. I talked with him frequently on that
