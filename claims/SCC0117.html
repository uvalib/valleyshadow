<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Samuel Driver,
                            February 21, 1873, Claim No. 19563</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Driver's claim for a horse and some corn was disallowed because he voted to
                    ratify Virginia's Ordinance of Secession in 1861. He was a Dunkard Preacher who
                    hid in the mountains for a time during the war to avoid Confederate Service. He
                    appealed this decision to the Court of Claims in 1896.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>The claimant was a Preacher and farmer during the War. He had some trouble in
                    keeping out after the Rebel Army. He was paid for suppies by Rebel Officers,
                    which indicated that he had not the reputation of a Union man. He also voted for
                    the Ordinance of Secession. But now makes a lame excuse for doing so. He says he
                    heard before the Election threats against those who voted against the Ordinance,
                    and yet instead of staying away he went to the Election and voted for the
                    Ordinance because a man told him in an imperious tone to do so.</p>
                <p>He dont come up to the standard of loyalty adopted by
                    the Commission. His brother in law and two neighbors called as witnesses dont
                    strengthen his claim to loyalty by their general statements, and opinions in
                    which no unequivocal facts are adduced. We reject the Claim.</p>

                <p>Ques. 40 Ans. My sympathies were with the Union cause. My feelings were not kind
                    to the rebellion, and I so expressed it to my friends. I used my influence and
                    cast my vote in favor of the Union. I voted for the ordinance of Secession, for
                    the following reasons. A few days before the day of that election, Mr.
                    Washington Swoope, said in my presence that theyhe was
                    going to have a rope in his pocket election day, and the first man who voted
                    against the ordinance they would hang, and his son, breathed cruelty and injury
                    to all persons, who would refuse to go with secession, and on the strength of
                    these threats, I left my house and went to Staunton, &amp; when about
                    leaving Staunton for home, and walking by the polls, I was stopped by a
                    prominent citizen, by name of W<sup>m</sup>. J. Shumate, who
                    took me by the Arm, and asked me if I had voted, I replied that I had not, nor
                    did not intend voting, he then showed me the door, and told me to vote for the
                    ordinance or do worse. Under these circumstances I voted for it, against my own
                    will and desire.</p>
                <p>Ques. 41 Ans. In conclusion I do most solemnly declare, that from the beginning
                    of hostilities against the United States, to the end thereof, my sympathies were
                    constantly with the cause of the United States that I never of my own free will
                    and accord did anything, or offered, or sought or attempted to do anything, by
                    word or deed to injure said cause or retard its success, and that I was at all
                    times ready and willing when called upon or if called upon to aid and assist the
                    cause of the Union or its supporters so far as my means and power and the
                    circumstances of the case permitted.</p>
                <p>Taking of Property.</p>
                <p>Ques 1 Ans. I was present when the property was taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2 Ans. I did not see the horse taken, but did see the Corn taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. The Corn was taken from the garret of my house, by Union Soldiers,
                    and fed to the horses in my house yard &amp; barn yard.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. The Corn was taken from my garret &amp; Corn Crib. The Corn was
                    taken in March 1865, by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's Cavalry.
                    There were I suppose from 200 to 400 soldiers present. They were in command of a
                    Major, whose name I did not hear. They were at my house about three hours.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5 Ans. Mrs. Bailey &amp; Mrs. Livick, were present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. There were several, one was called by the soldiers Major. They
                    belonged to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan.</p>

                    and some in bags, and some by soldiers in their hats.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8 Ans. The most of the Corn was fed there, and the balance carried of in
                    bags on horse back.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. The Corn was fed.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. Horse feed.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. I made complaint, to an officer of some rank, and he then asked the
                    soldiers how much there was still in the house, and was replied to "five bushels
                    about, he then made them stop.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12 Ans. No voucher taken or asked for.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. It was day time, between 10 A.M. &amp; 2 P.M. &amp; taken
                    openly.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. There was no Camp nearer than Staunton, that I knew of, and only
                    there about one day. I knew no officer, at all.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. The Corn was dry and on the Ears, sound and good. I know the
                    quantity by my wagon bed, which I had measured before using it. I never received
                    any pay. Samuel Driver</p>

                <p>My name is Joseph Click, my age 52. My residence near M<sup>t</sup>. Sidney in Augusta, my occupation a farmer. I am a brother-in-law to
                    claimant but have no beneficial interest in the claim. I have known the claimant
                    all my life. I knew him intimately during the War, and saw him often. I lived
                    about 17 miles from him. I talked to him about the war every time we met. From
                    all I heard him say I believe he was a Union man. I heard him speak of leaving
                    Virginia, because of the rebellion. I know that he regarded me as a Union man.
                    He was regarded by all his Union neighbors as being a Union and loyal man. He
                    aided Union men in making their escape. I know of nothing that he did for the
                    Confederacy. I do not think that he could have shown any loyalty to the
                    Confederate States, if they had gained their independence</p>

                <p>My name is George A. Shuey, my age 57. My residence near Churchville, Augusta Co.
                    My occupation a farmer. I not related to the Claimant, and have no interest in

                    during the War I was intimate with him during the War, and saw him frequently,
                    we conversed together about the war and its cause. He always expressed himself
                    to me as opposed to the war and secession. I heard him say that he would never
                    fight in behalf of the Confederacy. I do not recollect of hearing him speak in
                    presence of others about the War. He had the confidence of all the loyal men in
                    his neighborhood. I was a Union man and the claimant so regarded me. I know that
                    he supported the family of a poor man, who had escaped from the rebel lines. I
                    know of his doing nothing for the Confederates. He could not have proven any
                    loyalty to the Southern Confederacy, had it gained its independence.</p>

                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> general question</p>
                <p>My name is William Hoover, my age 39 years. My residence near Buffalo Gap Augusta
                    Co. Occupation a farmer. I am not related to the Claimant, and have no interest
                    in the claim. I have known the claimant 20 years. I was a resident of the State
                    during the war. I knew him intimately before and since the war. The two years of
                    the war, I heard from him frequently, and all occasions I heard that he was a
                    Union, and this information was rec'<sup>d</sup> by underground railroad. I was in the
                    State of Indiana. I returned to Virginia in 1865 &amp; never heard any
                    doubts expressed about his being a loyal man. I saw nothing of him during the
                    War. I was employed in various ways during the war until I enlisted in the Union
                    Army at Sulphur Springs, Henry County Indiana, in 1862, and served till the
                    close of the war. I was a member of Co. G. Capt.

                    20 or 30 soldiers present in the yard. I suppose they were there appr
                    two or three hours.</p>

                <p>Ques. 7 Ans. 4 or 5 soldiers, come with the horse through the yard from the
                    stable. I heard nothing said about the horse. The Corn was taken by throwing
                    some from the garret window and some carried down in bags, and most of it fed in
                    the yard, and a small quantity taken away in bags.</p>

                    about any battle or skirmish before either the taking of the Corn,
                    but the Piedmont battle I think was fought just before the horse was taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15. Ans. The horse was in good condition I think he was about 4 years old.
                    I think he was a good riding horse, being a lady I do not know the value of the
                    horse. I think the corn was worth at $1.25 <sup>cts</sup> a
                    bushel.</p>

                <p>Ans to 1<sup>st</sup> General question</p>
                <p>My name is Andrew J. Acord, my age 54 years. My residence Staunton Va. My
                    occupation a Carpenter. I am not related to the claimant, nor have no beneficial
                    interest in the claim. I have known the claimant for 16 years, and 14 years of
                    that time lived about one mile from him. I was very intimate with him during the
                    war, seeing him at times every day, and then not for a week or more, up to the I
                    went through the lines in 1864 We talked a great deal about the War, in fact
                    that was generally the subject of conversation. I have heard him express delight
                    when news would reach us of the defeat of the Confederate at different battles.
                    All his words and deeds, satisfied me that he was a true loyal man, to the Union
                    and its cause, and I never heard any doubts expressed of his sincerity as a
                    Union man. I think he was so regarded by all the Union men of the
                    neighborhood. I do not recollect of hearing him express his views in presence of
                    others, until we met in the mountains Then his expressions, were full and free
                    in opposition to the rebellion and in favor of the Union cause. I never knew him
                    to make any contributions for the use of the United States or its Army, he did
                    feed and shelter Union men who were trying to escape fromm rebel esrvice. I know
                    of no information he ever give to officers of the Union Army.</p>
                <p>I never heard of him having any Confederate bonds or of making loans or of doing
                    anything to support the credit or aid or comfort of the Confederate States. He
                    told me after voting for the ordinance of Secession, that he was forced to do
                    so, being a man of property he was afraid of damage. I do not think he could

                    been sucessful.</p>

                <p>Sam'l River, vs. The United States No. 8555 Cong.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the late war.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim, and in their report to Congress
                    state:--</p>
                <p>The claimant was a preacher and farmer during the war. He had some trouble in
                    keeping out of the rebel army. He was paid for supplies by Rebel officers which
                    indicated that he had not the reputation of a Union man. He also voted for the
                    ordinance of secession. But now makes a lame excuse for doing so. He
                    says he heard before the election threats against those who voted against the
                    ordinance and yet instead of staying away he went to the election and voted for
                    the ordinance because a man told him in an imperious tone to do so.</p>
                <p>He don't come up to the standard of loyalty adopted by
                    the Commission. His brother-in-law and two neighbors called as witnesses don't
                    strengthen his claim to loyalty by their general statements, and opinions in
                    which no unequivocal facts are adduced. We reject the claim."</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the case was pending before the Southern
                    Claims Commission, in Feb. 1873.</p>
                <p>SAM'L. DRIVER testifies;age 38; residence Swoop's Depot, Va., Farmer and
                    Minister. Am the claimant. (P. 1). My residence has been the same as now for 16
                    years. Did not change my residence during the war, was a farmer. Never passed
                    from the U.S. Lines to the rebel lines. I never took any oath of any description
                    to the Confederate states. I took an amnesty oath after the close of the war at
                    Staunton, in '65. Never asked for any pardon. I never held any office or place
                    of trust or profit under the Confederate Govt, or any state or territory
                    subordinate thereto. I never held a clerkship or agency or employment except
                    when I was conscripted., I was assigned to duty in the Q.M. Dept, but I refused
                    to accept, then I was detailed as a farmer until I sued out a writ of habeaus corpus, which I was discharged for about one
                    month after suing out the writ. Before the Court convened, I kept myself hid
                    from the Confederate authorities during which time an order was issued to take
                    all my horses and my wife suceeded with a friend who held the order to get three
                    of my horses away. She took the horses herself assisted by a colored boy 17
                    miles leaving home at 11 o'clock in the night. On the day following an order was
                    issued by Gen'l. Rosser to take one bay mare which had been left by my wife,
                    which was taken. See order filed marked "A". I was arrested by a military guard
                    at Staunton, Va., and forced me to take charge of a musket, which I carried
                    about 1-1/2 miles and then the gun was taken from me by Capt. Opie, and two days
                    afterwards I was released just before the battle at Piedmont began. I never was
                    an officer or soldier of the Confederate army. I never belonged to any militia,
                    state or otherwise. (P.3). I never belonged to any Home Guard or vigilance
                    Committee. The Confederate Congress enacted a law conscripting all who had
                    previously been exempt from military service, the conscripts to be assigned to
                    duty or detailed as farmers, etc., under that law I was conscripted. Furnished
                    no substitute. Never directly or indirectly connected or employed in any branch
                    or dept. of the so called Confederate states. Never employed on any R.R. or in
                    the transportation of soldiers or munitions of war of any description whatever.
                    I never had charge of any stores or supplies or teams, trains, wagons, or boats
                    for any purpose at all. During the time of my detail, and before the Court
                    convened, they got from my farm the flour of 200 bus. of wheat and 7 tons of
                    hay. I never give any information to any one or for any purpose. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>Questions 19 and 20 answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. Never engaged
                    in blockade running. No share or interest in any goods brought into or exported
                    from the Conf. states. I did not leave the Confederate lines at all. I had no
                    interest or share in any boat or vessel for any purpose or upon any waters.
                    Never arrested except as detailed in my answer to question 9. Took no oath of
                    any kind. Never arrested by the U.S. Authorities. My horse, flour and hay was
                    taken, never paid for the property. I was threatened by soldiers, saying that
                    all such men as I was should not be allowed to remain at home, but ought to be
                    imprisoned and the enrolling officer, Capt. Matthews said if he had his way he
                    would put me where the habeus corpus could not reach
                    me, and did send two armed soldiers into the Court house for my arrest and the
                    judge commanded that they be seated or removed from the Court House. I never was
                    molested or injured, except by taking my supplies. I never made a contribution,
                    except by giving money Union men in aiding them to escape. I had not opportunity
                    to do aything, except to aid men to get through the lines. I had no relatives in
                    the Confederate army that I know of. I never owned a Confederate bond or had any
                    a share in loans. I never did anything for the credit of the Confederacy. I
                    never gave aid or comfort to the rebellion, except as mentioned. I never was
                    engaged in making raids into the United States from Canada or any where else.
                    Never engaged in holding in custody any person or persons for political causes,
                    or for anything. (P. 6). Never been a member of any association, for the
                    imprisonment or persecution of any kind to persons for their loyalty to the
                    United States. Never a parolled prisoner. Never held
                    an office in the army or Navy of the United States nor educated in any military
                    school. Had no pass. I was not under any disabilities and have held no office
                    since the war. My sympathies were with the Union cause. My feelings were not
                    kind to the rebellion and I so expressed it to my friends. I used my influence
                    and cast my vote in favor of the Union I voted for the ordinance of secession
                    for the following reasons: A few days before the day of that election Mr.
                    Washington Swoope said in my presence that he was going to have a rope in his
                    pocket election day and the first man who voted against the ordinance of
                    secession they would hang, and his son, breathed crully and injury to all and on the strength of these threats I left my
                    home and went to Staunton, Va. and when about leaving Staunton for home and
                    walking by the polls I was stopped by a prominent citizen, by name Wm. J.
                    Shumate, who took me by the arm and asked me if I had voted I replied that I had
                    not, nor did not intend he then showed me the door and told me to vote the
                    ordinance or do worse. Under these circumstances I voted for it, against my own
                    will and desire. I do most solemnly declare that from the beginning of
                    hostilities against the United States to the end thereof my sympathies were
                    constantly with the cause of the United States, that I never of my own free will
                    and accord did anything or offered or sought or attempted to do anything by word
                    or deed to injure said cause or retard its success. Was at all times ready and
                    willing when called upon or if called upon to aid and assist the cause of the
                    Union or its supporters so far as my means and power and the circumstances of
                    the case permitted. (P. 8 &amp; 9).</p>

                    claimant but have no beneficial interest in the claim. (P. 10). I have known the
                    claimant all my life. I knew him intimately during the war. Saw him often. I
                    lived about 17 miles from him I talked to him about the war every time we met.
                    From all I heard him say, I believe he was a Union man. I heard him speak of
                    leaving Va. because of the rebellion. I know that he regarded me as a Union man.
                    He was regarded by all his Union neighbors as being a Union and loyal man. He
                    aided Union men in making their escape. I know of nothing that he did for the
                    Confederacy. I don't think he could have shown any loyalty to the Conf. States
                    if they had gained their independence.</p>
                <p>GEO. A. SHUREY testifies: Age 57; residence Augusta Co. farmer. Not related or
                    interested. Have known the claimant about 16 years. I lived about 3 miles from
                    him during the war. (P. l1). I was intimate with him during the war and saw him
                    frequently. We conversed together about the war and its causes. He always
                    expressed himself to me as opposed to the war and secession. I heard him say
                    that he would never fight in behalf of the Confederacy. I don't recollect of
                    hearing him speak in presence of others about the war. He had the confidence of
                    all the loyal men in his neighborhood. I was a Union man and the claimant so
                    regarded me. I know that he supported the family of a poor who had escaped from
                    the rebel lines. I know of his doing nothing far the Confederates. He could not
                    have proven any loyalty to the Southern Confederacy had it gained its
                    independence.</p>
                <p>WM. HOOVER testifies: age 39; residence Augusta Co., Va., Farmer. Not related or
                    interested. (P. 12). I have known the claimant 20 years. I was a resident of the
                    state during the war. I knew him intimately before and since the war. The two
                    years of the war I heard from him frequently and all occasions I heard that he
                    was a Union, and this information was received by underground R.R. I was in the
                    state of Ind. I returned to Va. in '65 and never heard any doubts expressde
                    about his being a loyal man. I saw nothing of him during the war. I was employed
                    in various ways during the war until I enlisted in the Union Army at Sulphur
                    Springs, Henry Co., Ind., in '62 and served till the close of the war. I was a
                    member of Co. G. Capt. Vanneman 84th Ind.Vols.Inft. Col
                    Trussler. (P. 13).</p>
                <p>ANDREW J. ACORD testifies: age 54; residence Staunton, Va., Carpenter. Not
                    related or interested. I have known the claimant for 16 years. (P. 18). And 14
                    years of that time lived about one mile from him. I was very intimate with him
                    during the war, seeing him at times every day, and then not for a week or more,
                    up to the time I went through the lines in '64. We talked a good deal about the
                    war, in fact that was generally the subject of conversation. I have heard him
                    express delight when news would reach us of the defeat of the Confederate at
                    different battles All his words and deeds satisfied me that he was a true loyal
                    mean to the Union and its cause, and I never heard any doubts expressed of his
                    sincerity as a Union man. I think he was so regarded by all the Union men of the
                    neighborhood. I do not recollect of hearing him express his views in presence of
                    others, until we met in the mountains. Then his expressions, were full and free
                    in opposition to the rebellion and in favor of the Union cause. I never knew him
                    to make any contributions for the use of the U.S. or its army. (P. 19). He did
                    feed and shelter Union men who were trying to escape from rebel service. I know
                    of no information he ever gave to officers of the Union army I never heard of
                    him saying any Confederate bonds or or of making loans or of doing anything to
                    support the credit of aid or comfort of the Confederate states. He told me after
                    voting for the ordinance of secession that he was forced to do so, being a man
                    of property he was afraid of damage. I don't think he could have proved loyalty
                    to the South by his neighbors of the Confederacy had been successful. I did not
                    vote for the ordinance of secesssion, but was never molested because of my
                    refusal to do so. Nor I never heard of any being molested in that neighborhood
                    for refusing to do so. (P. 20).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has bear taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court in Aug. 1895.</p>
                <p>ELWIN M. CUSHING testifies: general auctioneer; age 65; residence Staunton Va.
                    Not interested or related. My acquaintance with the claimant began about 1858. I
                    knew him very well from the time I first became acquainted with him. I met him
                    frequently on the farm and in town here. I don't know that I ever had any
                    special conversation with him about the cause of the war, but I knew that Sam
                    Driver was a Union man,and belonged to the Dunkard church all of the members of
                    which were Union people. I was a confederate. I think I knew the public
                    reputation of the claimant, and he was regarded by everybody as a Union man. I
                    never heard his loyalty doubted. I don't know of anything claimant did to aid
                    the Union army during the war. Did not aid the Confederate cause to my
                    knowledge. (P. 2). I don't know how claimant voted. His views never changed so
                    far as I know. My impression is that the claimant was a preacher all the time of
                    the Dunkard denomination. That church as a body was all the time opposed to the
                    war and secession. It was currently reported, and I believe that the Legislature
                    of Va. because of the known opposition of this denomination to bearing arms
                    passed a resolution by which the members of it would be exempt from military
                    duty on the payment of a certain sum. Claimant did not make any secret of his
                    Union sentiments so far as I know. Claimant would have had great difficulty in
                    proving his loyalty to the Confederate Government had it succeeded. I don't know
                    if he was ever threatened for his Union sentiments. (P. 3). He was offered the
                    Circuit clerkship for the county by the military government. He never accepted
                    that office. I don't know where the convention was held, but he was spoken of
                    for Sheriff.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>JOHN N. OPIE testifies: Lawyer; age 51; residence Staunton, Va., Not related or
                    interested. (P. 5). I have known the claimant for, at least 35 years. I did not
                    see him prior to or during the war. I was a Confederate soldier, a private. When
                    Hunter marched up the valley I was at home wounded and I organized a Cav. company principally composed of old men and
                    boys; and Capt. Peck at the same time organized a similar company, both of which
                    were under my command. At that time an order was issued by, I think, the
                    Secretary of war requiring every one who were capable of bearing arms to enlist
                    in once organization. The Rev. Sam'l. Driver came to my company. I don't know
                    whether he was sent or came of his own accord, but he was sent or came in
                    pursuance of this general order. He reported to me, and told me that it was
                    contrary to his creed to carry arms, or to make war, and begged me to relieve
                    him from his arms. I knowing he would render no service in that way, turned his
                    gun over to a more willing party, and did not require him to go into battle. He
                    was a member of the Dunkard church and it was against the creed of that church
                    to engage in war, and the members of it were exempt from military service. I
                    always regarded him as a Union man.</p>
                <p>WM. A. BURNETT testifies: Clerk of Augusta Co. Ct. Va., age 59; residence
                    Staunton, Va. not interested or related. (P. 7). I have known the claimant,
                    during and since the war. I didn't hear claimant's reputation discussed one way
                    or the Other during the war, as I recollect. The church or denomination to which
                    he belonged was generally opposed to it. He belonged to and was a minister of
                    the German Baptist or Dunkard Church as it was commonly called. After the war I
                    heard his reputation for loyalty discussed, that the claimant, Mr.Driver, has
                    been opposed to the war. As a matter of fact,I know nothing one way or the other
                    of my own knowledge. My best impression is that one of the county officers,
                    probably that of the Circuit Court of this county, was offered to Mr. Driver by
                    the so called Carpet Bag Govt. of Va. but he declined and did not accept it. I
                    don't think positions of this character were offered, at that time to any but
                    men of well known Union sentiments, though men of that kind were hard and
                    difficult to find at that time.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>RECALLED FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>My information is that his church affiliations prevented him from engaging in the
                    war on either side. In other words is opposed to war out and out whether it
                    occured in China or Guinea. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken March 30, 1897.</p>
                <p>SAM'L. DRIVER testfies: Minister of the gospel; age 62; residence Barren Ridge,
                    Va. (P. 1). I am the claimant. I am a minister of the German Baptist Church, and
                    that Church as a church and its members as individuals were utterly opposed to
                    the war, and they make it a condition of admission into the church that the
                    males shall not take up arms, and that the females shall not use their influence
                    in behalf of the war. I was a native of Augusta Co. at the time the
                    vote was taken on secession. The day of the election I resided 7 miles west of
                    Staunton. I passed immediately by my voting precinct one mile and a half from my
                    home and on arriving at Staunton, as I was passing along the street three men
                    accosted me one whose name I recolled, Wm. Shumate, and asked the question had I
                    voted. I told him I had not, and didn't intend to. He remarked "united we stand,
                    divided we fall", if you do not vote for secession, it will show we are divided,
                    and a war will be imminent. If we stand united we will avert the war. I told him
                    I could not vote for secession. He took me by the arm, and rushed me to the door
                    about out three yards from where the commissioners were seated, and told them to
                    record my vote for secession, using profame language
                    that I don't wish to repeat, first apprehending me, second intimidating me, and
                        ostracised me from my principles that I
                    entertained. (P. 2). I did not want a war. I loved the Union and the principles
                    of my church too.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Mr. Shumate used the argument that unless we down South showed the north a solid
                    front the north would not try to force us back into the Union, at the polls, and
                    I didn't vote at all until after we used this argument. I would have preferred
                    the Union to war. The men like Mr. Shumate knew my sentiments and had been
                    electioneering of course before the vote was taken, and if he had known my
                    sentiments, he otherwise would not have stopped me. My church had the
                    pre-requisite qualification of the principle of not bearing arms, and that
                    females were required to use their influence against bearing arms, or war in any
                    cause, as a condition precedent to being admitted to join the church. In the
                    first place I objected to that character of questions because it casts a
                    reflection on other denominations. However, the quotation of the doctrine and
                    theology of the question is right, but I don't want to caste an epithet on other denominations. (P. 3). But we are not in
                    Confederate times now, and every man can worship God according to his own
                    conscience, thank God for that. I will add to this that the Confederate Govt.
                    passed a law exempting Dunkard from service on paying a fine of $500, and in
                    every case except two the Dunkard paid their fine. The fine was imposed and
                    paid. My doctrine was that it was better to have any sort of Govt. almost rather
                    than bear arms contrary to the Saviour's injunction. You have got that also
                    stated in the evidence of Capt. Opie when he testified about a year ago in this
                    case. I wanted the Union of the states. I was just going to say that under no
                    circumstances would we submit to the taking up of arms. We would have rather
                    suffered persecution as many of our members did, and were imprisoned at the
                    capital of our state for the principles they maintained on the subject of
                    non-combatantism.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT. (P 4).</p>
                <p>I was appointed by the provisional Governor, Mr. Pierepoint, Clerk of the Circuit
                    Court of Augusta Co., being recommended by the most substantial Union men in the
                    county as their choice. Brother Sam'l. Cline was appointed to the position of
                    County Clerk by the same parties that recommended me. None but Union men were
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>RE-CROSS.</p>
                <p>It is right that I said I would rather have had the breaking up of ten Unions
                    than to depart from the doctrine of the church against taking up of arms. (P.
                    5).</p>
                <p>WM. CROSBY testifies: professional nurse; age 76; residence Staunton, Va. Not
                    related or interested. (P. 6). I resided in this county at the time the election
                    was held on secession. I voted in Staunton when I did vote. I was in Staunton on
                    the day of the election. I was a Union man. There was heavy pressure brought to
                    bear on Union men to compel them to vote for secession. I was going down the
                    street that day past the voting precinct, just as I got where they were voting,
                    Mr.Shumate stopped me, and said have you voted yet. I said no. Well says he you
                    have got to vote. Then he took me by the army and stopped me as I
                    started on. Said he you have got to vote, and I said no, I have nothing to do
                    with it; I won't vote and he said to the Clerk who was writing put him down. I
                    never intended to vote for secession. It was recorded against my will and
                    protest. I knew the Claimant sometime before the war. That was his general
                    positive character, a strong Union nan, according to my understanding of. (P.
                    7). Witness is asked if it was dangerous for a man to vote against secession on
                    that day at that place, and says: I don't know how to answer that. There was
                    strong pressure; I don't know that anybody would have lost his life, but he
                    would have been browbeaten. Before I would have consented to vote for secession,
                    I would have run any risk that might follow.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I don't know of any body that was hurt for not voting for secession, but they
                    were persecuted and browbeated. They would say the meanest things they could,
                    and impress their hay and that sort of thing. I don't know if Mr. Rippetoe voted
                    against secession. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Sam'l. Driver., the claimant, was 26 years of age in 1861. He was a farmer and
                    minister during the war, residing in Augusta Co., Va. He never took any oath to
                    the Confederate states. He was conscripted and assigned to duty in the Q.M.
                    Dept. Refused to do this duty Was then detained as a farmer, until he sued out a
                    writ of habeas corpus, for which he was discharged. Kept himself hid from the
                    Confederate authorities during which time they issued an order to take all his
                    horses. He was arrested by a military guard at Staunton, Va. (P. 2). He never
                    belonged to any Home Guard or vigilance committee. Had a horse, flour and hay
                    taken by the Confederates. Was threatened by Confederate soldiers. Gave money to
                    Union men in aiding them to escape. Sympathize with the Union cause throughout.
                    He voted for the ordinance of secession on account of threats. His sentiments
                    did not change during the war. (P. 4 &amp; 5).</p>
                <p>His witnesses testify that his expressions were those of a Union man during the
                    entire war. Such was his reputation. He aided Union men in making their escape.
                    They testify also that he was delighted and so expressed himself when he heard
                    of the defeat of the Confederates in battle. That he was ordered into the
                    Confederate service. On the re-construction of loyal Government in Va. he was
                    appointed Clerk of the Circuit Court of Augusta Co..</p>
                <p>This evidence certainly justifies a favorable finding on loyalty.</p>

                <p>Sam'l. Driver vs. The United States No. 8555 Cong.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S MOTION TO PLACE CASE ON TRIAL CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER.</p>
                <p>Gilbert Moyers, attorney for claimant, moves this Honorable Court to place the
                    above entitled cause on the trial calendar for December on the question of
                    loyalty.</p>
                <p>This claim was referred to the Court in Feb. l892. The case was proceeded with
                    regularly according to the rules and practice obtaining in the Court of Claims.
                    Testimony taken at considerable expense and the brief on loyalty finally filed
                    on May 7th, 1897. Since which time the record of the case shows no action taken
                    by defendant's attorney in the way of preparing the case for trial. The delay is
                    certainly unreasonable and cannot be excused. Repeated efforts have been made by
                    claimant's attorney to have the case prepared by the defense without any
                    satisfactory results. Having exhausted efforts in that direction an order of the
                    Court is now invoked under paragraph 5, of December Calendar.</p>
                <p>It is a trifling case only involving $209, and should have been tried and dispose
                    of over a year since.</p>
                <p>Protracted delays in the preparation of this class of cases on the part of the
                    defense renders the Bowman act a mockery of justice. The Court should certainly
                    enforce its rule and allow motions such as this, being most reasonable and
                    proper and, in fact the only remedy that claimants have to secure action and
                    enforce their rights.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term, 1898.</p>
                <p>SAMUEL DRIVER vs. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8,555 Cong.</p>
                <p>BRIEF FOR DEFENDANT ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>This claim is a small one, the amount involved being in the neighborhood of
                    $209.00. It was rejected by the Southern Claims Commission, because of the
                    disloyalty of the claimant. The testimony for claimant seems to have been
                    abstracted in proper form by claimant's counsel. The declarations of claimant
                    himself, in an early deposition used before the Commission, and one taken at
                    comparatively recent date, under the rules, in favor of his own loyalty, are
                    very strong, and in fact vehement to a high degree. Claimant voted for the
                    ordinance of secession, and admits such to be the fact, probably after it was
                    ascertained by the agencies of the Commission. In explanation and defence of his
                    conduct in that respect, the claimant insists that in fact he did not vote, but
                    was voted by a citizen of the place where he resided, who took him by the arm,
                    walked him up to the polls and instructed the clerk to record his vote in favor
                    of secession; which was done. The citizen who thus imposed upon him, did so in a
                    very imperious manner, and thus the claimant, who was 26 years of age and
                    apparently able-bodied and in good health, and a man of some influence and
                    standing in the County where he lived in Virginia, allowed himself to be coerced
                    into voting against his principles, as he now claims; being so recorded. It is a
                    singular circumstance, as it now appears in connection with some of these claims
                    under the Bowman Act, that it only required two or three men in each city or
                    county to coerce the entire body of citizens in it into voting for the ordinance
                    of secession. And it also seems singular that all the vigor and energy that was
                    displayed at the time, all the moral courage, the entire <u>fortiter in re</u> was possessed by those two or three ardent
                    secessionists in each community of the South. The rest were all passive, all
                    intimidated, all glowing within with love for the Union, but all terrorized
                    without by the stalwart stalking ghost of secession. Claimant was one of the
                    latter class.</p>
                <p>We have nine vouchers for goods sold to the Confederate army in the Confederate
                    archives, which will be presented at the time of the trial of the cause. In
                    addition to claimant's admission that he voted for the ordinance of secession,
                    it also appears, from the report of the Treasury Department, that he was on a
                    list of persons to whom certificates were issued for the Bank of Rockingham,
                    near where he lived, which bank was the Confederate States depssitory. Some of
                    these little circumstances are not particularly explained in the testimony.
                    Several parties have testified that he was a truly loyal man. One of them has
                    rather overdone the thing by testifying that he refused to accept office as
                    clerk of the circuit court for Augusta County, Virginia, under the Carpet Bag
                    Government, and the remark is made that the Carpet Bag Government was extremely
                    cautious about appointing men to office, unless they were well-known Union men.
                    It would appear, however, that the claimant did not care to be identified with
                    the Union sentiments of the Carpet Bag Government.</p>
                <p>This is one of the cases, so very common, where, all of a man's <u>words</u>, or the expressions of witnesses relative to his
                    sentiments have a tendency to show loyalty, while all of his <u>acts</u> seem to tend in one direction, and that direction
                    is very active disloyalty.</p>
                <p>If the Court goes upon the principle that words speak louder than actions, they
                    may find the claimant loyal. But if they fallow the opposite, and well
                    established rule, he certainly will be found disloyal.</p>
                <p>The defendant had expected to obtain testimony in the case, but it has been
                    deemed to be of such small importance in amount, that no investigating agent of
                    the Government could be sent for that puprose, and the case is respectfully
                    submitted to the Court upon the documentary evidence above cited.</p>

                <p>SAMUEL DRIVER, VS. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8555 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>So far as the reasons defendants' counsel advances why this claimant should not
                    be found loyal during the war are concerned, they are involved in the following
                    facts which are a matter of proof. So far as the aid to the Federal cause is
                    concerned, defendants' counsel is very much in fault. Does he not recognize the
                    fact that a Union man, living in an insurrectionary territory during the war,
                        assisting men of his locality in escaping through the
                    Confederate lines for the purpose of uniting themselves to the Federal cause,
                    was giving active assistance to the Union cause? What more could a Union man do
                    than that? Impossibilities are not expected. It is simply this: Did this man, as
                    a man faithful to the Union cause during the period of the rebellion, do what he
                    could, consistent with home, happiness, and protection, for the Federal Army and
                    the Union cause? Now, I submit in all candor that he did this in good faith, and
                    there is no reason in the wide world, in the light of this testimony, to find
                    this man disloyal. I must insist on a finding of loyalty in this case.</p>

                <p>SAMUEL DRIVER VS. THE UNITED STATES NO. 8555 CONGRESSIONAL</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in May, 1900.</p>
                <p>CAPT. P.B. WILSON TESTIFIES:- Real estate broker. Age sixty years. Resides at
                    Staunton, Virginia. Not related to the claimant or interested in the claim.
                    (Page 1) Knew Mr. Driver very well; raised about two miles from him. I served in
                    the Confederate Army four years. Mr. Driver was a consistent Union man. We had a
                    talk as I was leaving home for the army in April, 1861, and he expressed great
                    regret that I should rebel against the Government. I remember this as well as if
                    it was yesterday. I know he was a strong Union man; he never relented during the
                    war. He was outspoken. Everyone in the neighborhood knew his position. Do not
                    know of any voluntary acts of his in support of the Confederacy. Saw him several
                    times during the war. Knew his position. I am a Presbyterian.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I served under Stonewall Jackson. My opinion concerning the status of Mr. Driver
                    was formed at the out break and during the war from direct conversation with
                    him. The conversations occured in April, 1861, and occasionally during the war.
                    Do not know of his being intimidated to vote for secession. He might have
                    furnished aid and comfort to the Confederacy during my absence but I never heard
                    him accused of it. (Page 3) MY opinion concerning his loyalty is not based on
                    casual conversations. I remember distinctly the tinge they were conscripting. I
                    was ordered to visit his house and bring him to Staunton; I did so but did not
                    find him at home. (Page 4)</p>
                <p>JOHN MARTIN TESTIFIES:- Carpenter. Age seventy-seven years. Not related to the
                    claimant or interested in his claim. Lived about four hundred yards from Mr.
                    Driver during the war. He was a Union man. Have heard him speak of his Union
                    principles. I never knew of him doing anything in favor of the Rebellion
                    willingly. All he did he was made to do. Cannot remember what I heard him say.
                    Cannot remember the conversations that passed between us. When the Confederate
                    Army whipped Banks down the valley, the Confederates called upon Mr. Driver for
                    his team. He refused to give it and they then said they would impress his team.
                    They then made a proposition that he and Mr. Brown join teams. I drove the team.
                    (Page 5) I got a horse from him one Saturday and rode to hunt a pilot to pilot
                    me through the line; the line between the Confederacy and the United States. I
                    passed through the line with a pilot. Do not know that it was generally known in
                    the community that he assisted men through the Union lines. I know that claimant
                    had a horse taken but do not know whether the Federals or Confederates took it.
                    (Page 6)</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>It is true that the Rev. Mr. Driver was a German Baptist Minister whose decided
                    religious convictions were against war, any kind whether for the Union or the
                    Confederacy. His general reputation at the time was that he was equally
                    reluctant to join the Union army. Do not know of his furnishing any supplies for
                    the Confederacy. My memory it was in times passed. (Page 7)</p>
                <p>JOSEPH B. TRIMBLE, TESTIFIES:- Age seventy-nine years. No interest or relation.
                    Was acquainted with Mr. Driver during the war. He was a union man.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>Heard him say so several times during the war. Do not think he cared to fight for
                    either army. I do not think a man would be regarded as loyal who voted for
                    secession and who furnished supplies to both sides. (Page 8)</p>
                <p>S.L. WAMPLER TESTIFIES:- I was acquainted with claimant during the war. The talk
                    around the neighborhood was that he was a Union man. In 1862 I was home on
                    furlough. Stayed with Mr. Driver that night. While I was there that night a
                    whole lot of soldiers straggled out there Mr. Driver told them he was a Union
                    man and did not intend to be imposed upon. Captain Price was on his way home on
                    furlough and he stopped at Mr. Driver's that night. There were several others,
                    schoolmates of Mr. Driver. (Page 10) Captian Price told the men to go back to
                    their camp and not to interrupt Mr. Driver. One gentleman there said he was
                    surprised that Mr. Driver expressed himself as he did before these rebel
                    soldiers. The next morning when I came over we had broken some harness. We went
                    in there to get it fixed and this conversation took place.</p>
                <p>Some gentleman said they were surprised that the rebel soldiers had not stripped
                    Mr. Driver of everything.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I was in the Confederate service about three and a half years. (Page 11) Mr.
                    Driver could have rendered the Confederacy assistence when I was absent and I not have known of it.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I knew another Samuel Driver in Rockenham County;
                    he was a rebel. I lived near New Market. The way I came to know was when I was
                    going to leave this country and go to the yankees I met this Driver on the road.
                    He suspected I was running off and wanted to arrest me. This was in 1864. I
                    learned afterwards that he was doing business for the Confederate Government.
                        Witnesse's attention is called to receipts under
                    the Confederate archives and he states that these receipts were given in the
                    vicinity of this Driver and not in the vicinity of the other. (Page 12)</p>
                <p>-Cross-Examination-</p>
                <p>I was in New Market when the Federal forces came up the valley in 1862 and this
                    man Driver had charge of some of the supplies of the Confederacy. The rebels
                    were falling back. Saw him several times since. He died about two years ago.
                    (Page 13)</p>
                <p>MRS. SUSAN N. LIVVOCK, TESTIFIES:- Age fifty-seven years. No interest or
                    relation. I lived with Samuel Driver during the war. He was a Union man. The
                    Union Army took a horse from Mr. Driver. (page 14)</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>Mr. Driver was at home when this property was taken. He did not protest at the
                    time that he was a Union man, that I know of. I was present when the property
                    was taken. I do not think that Mr. Driver's political opinions were largely
                    controlled by his desire to escape military service. (Page 15)</p>
                <p>SAMUEL DRIVER, the claimant, TESTIFIES:- Age sixty-seven years. Questions. As to
                    nine receipts signed by Samuel Driver, one for the use of a four horse team from
                    December 10th to December 21st. Another 121 1/2 bushels of corn. Another at
                    Timberville, Virginia, for fifteen bushels of corn and another for 1,000 pounds
                    of hay. (Page 16) Others for corn and hay in different quantities. He states
                    that the items in bill number one, seven and eight, are my items; that is for a
                    four horse team, four bushels of corn and 15357 pounds of hay. The rest of the
                    times, so far as I know, were given by individuals of the same name. The parties
                    referred to are dead. One lived near Timberville, Rockingham County, and died
                    about two years ago, the other lived at Mt. Clinton, Rockingham County, and died
                    about eight years ago. Does not know anything about the other seven items
                    mentioned in the bill. My team was impressed by a band of soldiers and used to
                    haul supplies for the Confederate Government. The mare in item seven was
                    impressed without my permission; also the hay. (Page 17)</p>
                <p>Q. You are reported as having voted for secession. What have you to say about
                    this?</p>
                <p>A. My testimony is in my former deposition. I passed my voting precinct, Herbron Church, under threats that if I did not vote for
                    the ordinance of secession that I would be made to suffer for it. When I came to
                    Staunton I was incepted by Mr. Snow and asked the
                    question if I had voted. I told him that I had not and did not intend to. This
                    occurred infront of the door of the voting precinct, in the City of Staunton. I
                    was pushed inside of that door and Mr. Snow directed the clerk to record my
                    vote, against my protest, for secession.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I cannot say that the vote in Staunton was <sup>u</sup>nanimous
                    for secession. I never heard of any person suffering personal injury on account
                    of their having voted or refused to vote for secession in this county but they
                    were ostracized and evaded and were said to belong to the black Republican
                    party. A gentleman, who was a friend of mine, when I met him on the road In West
                    View, when I saluted bidding him the time of day he struck me off my horse and
                    remarked, "I do not want you to provoke me by speaking when we meet," calling me
                    a black republican. (Page 18) I believed we had the best government in the
                    world. I Lived and adhered to the Government notwithstanding the fact that my
                    religion did not allow me to take up arms and fight for or against the
                    Government. The receipt given for the mare taken could not have been given to me
                    because the face of the receipt says I was not at home at the time and therefore
                    I could not have either given permission or objected to the same being impressed
                    for the use of the Government. (Page 18)</p>
                <p>-SUMMARY-</p>
                <p>This testimony is substantly as follows:- Captain Wilson says that when he was
                    leaving for the army in 1861 the claimant expressed great regret that he should
                    rebel against the Government. Witness states further that he knows claimant was
                    a strong Union man and was outspoken in his sentiments; that every one in his
                    neighborhood knew his position. (Page 1)</p>
                <p>Mr. Martin testifies that he lived about four hundred yards from Mr. Driver
                    during the war and often heard him speak of his Union principles; that on one
                    occassion he refused to let the Cofederates have his team and they said they
                    would impress it. Mr. Driver gave witness a horse to aid him in getting through
                        to the Union lines. (P 2)</p>
                <p>Mr. Wampler testifies as to the reputation of claimant, being that of a Union man
                    in the neighborhood in which he lived. (Page 3) This witness also testifies that
                    there was another Samuel Driver who lived in Rockingham County during the war
                    and was a rebel.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Livvock testfies that claimant was a Union man during the war. She lived
                    with him. The claimant explains the Confederate vouchers and states that his
                    team was impressed by a band of soldiers to haul supplies for the Confederate
                    Government; his hay and mare were also impressed. He explains how he came to
                    vote for secession and states that such a vote was contrary to his sentiments
                    and was the result of imposition and fraud. (Pages 5-6)</p>
                <p>This testimony would seem to remove any doubts that could possibly be entertained
                    in regard to the loyalty of Mr. Driver during the war. All the objections have
                    been fully met and it is plainly evident from the proof that Mr. Driver was a
                    consistent Union man through out the war and the Court should so find.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Supplemental Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Samuel Driver v. The United States No. 8555, Congressional.</p>
                <p>Defendants' Supplemental Brief on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case, since the filing of Defendants' Original Brief on
                    Loyalty, feeling the weakness and insufficiency of his proof, has taken a number
                    of additional depositions and filed a Supplemental Brief on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>Counsel for claimant has made a fair abstract of his additional testimony filed.
                    The only suggestion of aid to the Union cause or outward manifestation of
                    loyalty is found in the following abstract of the deposition of John Martin, a
                    carpenter and neighbor of claimant, taken May 7, 1900.</p>
                <p>Q. 4. Please state whether or not Mr. Driver assisted men to pass through the
                    Federal lines to the Union territory?</p>
                <p>A. Yes, he did. I got a horse from him on one Saturday to ride to hunt a pilot to
                    pilot me through the line.</p>
                <p>Q. 5. What do you mean by line?</p>
                <p>A. The line between the Confederacy and the United States.</p>
                <p>Q. 6. Did you pass through the lines?</p>
                <p>A. Yes; I did pass through the lines with the pilot.</p>
                <p>Q. 7. Please state whether or not Mr. Driver assisted and helped men through the
                    Union lines during the civil war?</p>
                <p>A. I don't remember whether he did or not further than what I have stated above.</p>
                <p>Q. 8. Was it not generally known in the community in which he lived that he was
                    assisting men through the Union line?</p>
                <p>A. I don't remember anything about it.</p>
                <p>Despite the efforts of claimant's counsel in questions decidedly leading and
                    improper, the witness can not testify positively that the claimant did an act
                    that showed his loyalty during the war. S.L. Wampler testified to an incident
                    where the claimant announced to some rebel soldiers that he was a Union man, but
                    the story, mythical at best, is not corroborated by other proof of any kind. The
                    Court can hardly find warrant in such testimony to decide the claimant to have
                    been loyal.</p>
                <p>Now as to the positive acts of disloyalty. There are several vouchers filed for
                    stores and supplies sold by the claimant to the Confederates. In his testimony
                    before the Commissioners of Claims, he stated that he did not furnish any aid,
                    or any supplies or stores, or property of any kind, to or for the so-called
                    Confederate States, or any State in rebellion, or to the army, navy, militia,
                    home guards, armed forces, or military organizations thereof; or for any
                    officer, soldier, or sailor thereof. He now admits, when confronted by the
                    report from the War Department respecting Confederate vouchers, that certain of
                    the vouchers were signed by him. It is remarkable how the Confederate Archives
                    serve in this and other instances in reviving the recollection of the claimant.
                    But for their existence the Court would have been obliged to have believed his
                    original statement that he never sold any stores or supplies to the enemy. As to
                    his assertion that only part of the vouchers were signed by him, we shall leave
                    to the Court the determination of that matter when the vouchers are presented
                    for examination.</p>
                <p>Testimony is offered that the claimant evaded service in the Confederate army,
                    but the witnesses also state that he was equally opposed to service  was
                    because of his religion, which made him opposed to war or the taking up of arms
                    in any cause. He is therefore not entitled to any credit for his efforts to
                    evade service in either army. It is not evidence in any sense of loyalty to the
                    Union.</p>
                <p>The claimant still adheres to his former testimony that he was forced inside of
                    the building where the voting took place on the Ordinances of Secession, and the
                    man who thus pushed him through the door directed the clerk to record claimant's
                    vote for secession. On cross-examination the claimant testified that he could
                    not say that the vote in Staunton, where he lived, was unanimous for secession.
                    He also testified that he never heard of any person in the county suffering
                    personal injury on account of having voted or refused to vote fore secession,
                    but they were ostracized and evaded or were said to belong to the black
                    Republican party.</p>
                <p>The Court is respectfully asked to find the claimant to have been disloyal.</p>
