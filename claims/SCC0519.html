<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John Brown, 1879,
                            Claim No. 22264</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                John Brown filed this claim in 1879 for $250, claiming the Union army took two
                    horses in 1864. John was a 41-year-old farmer. His dislike of the Confederacy
                    forced him to seek refuge in the mountains after he was unable to reach Union
                    lines due to an injury. He was threatened by Confederates and had a
                    brother-in-law in the Union Army. The commission allowed $210.

                <p>John Brown was a blacksmith. He says he ws always for the Union &amp; hated
                    the Confederacy. He left his house &amp; went through the lines and was gone
                    one or two years &amp; did not return till the close of the war. "The rebels
                    despised him &amp; some said he ought to be hung, &amp; one man told me
                    he would not get him to do any more work for him that he would rather hang him
                    than give him work to do." -Three witnesses testify to his loyalty. He had a
                    brother in law in the Union Army.</p>

                    miles from the claimant. I did not <sup>know</sup> any
                    Quartermaster or any other Officer of the Army. I <sup>did</sup> not see any.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup> Witness says The horses were in good condition.
                    They were young horses just in their prime. I think one of the horses was worth
                    $150.00 to $175.00 and the other about $150.00. The claimant asked me what they
                    were worth.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness says I believe that from what the
                    soldiers <sup>said</sup> they were taken for the use of the
                    Army and not for mere gratification of any one.</p>
                <p>20<sup>th</sup> Witness says, I believe they were taken in
                    consequence of a necessity in the Army. And such a necessity as justified the
                    taken.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup> Witness says, I believe it was taken for purposes
                    so necessary, and beneficial as to require its being paid for.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup> Witness says I suppose that it was taken by
                    authority of some officer, whose rank justified in ordering it to be taken.</p>
