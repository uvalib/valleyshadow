                <p>This claim we had sent to Washington City, in 1872, or early 1873. We were
                    informed <sup>it</sup> was not acted on by the court for
                    Southern claims. This statement must have been correct, although the impression
                    was that the court did not adjudicate ascs of that kind. We
                    would very Respectfully beg leave to ask your advise
                    in regard to how we shall act in the premises &amp; also if you think the
                    court will allow &amp; pay a Just claim of that kind. <u>Our Loyalty</u> is <u>in</u>disputable, <u>as we are colored persons</u>, and only suffered our House
                    to be used as a Hospital, and furnished sustainance and the attendance upon the sick soldier, because he was
                        wouned at our door, and the Confederates would
                    have 
                        <u>striped</u>
                     and <u>murdered</u> him after he was
                    wouned he was shot down, had he not been cared for by us. It would only be

                <p>Hon Charles F. Benjamin</p>
                <p>Dear Sir:</p>
                <p>I rec<sup>d</sup> from you a few
                    days ago, the Enclosed letter of Thomas Jefferson and from the endorsement it
                    seems that there has been no testimony taken in support of the Claim. I am
                    surprised at this, because immediately upon the filing of the claim, we took,
                    before Judge Riley, the then Commissioner, the testimony of a large number of
                    witnesses, proving beyond all question, the loyalty of the petitioners and the
                    justice of their Claim. This testimony was, of course left with Judge Riley to
                    be forwarded to your office, and I suppose he must have neglected to do so. Will
                    you please inform me what course to pursue in order to get in this testimony. I
                    am very anxious to have the claim allowed, not only because I believe it to be
                    just but because the petitioner is one of our most worthy coloured men and if any one in the south is entitled to compensation
                    he is. Hoping to hear from you soon I remain</p>
                <p>Very Respectfully Your ObtServ<sup>t</sup></p>
