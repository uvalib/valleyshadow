                    peace measure. It was maintained by our public men that if we were united in

                    bring about a peace. That is the reason I voted for the ratification. When the

                <p>Property. I am 40 years old. I live with the claimant; he is my husband. I was
                    present when the property was taken and saw it all taken except the sheep. The
                        stock were all taken on the 29<sup>th</sup> day
                    of Sept. 1864. They were driven away by five
                    cavalry men about the time of the burning.</p>
                <p>Item 1. Cattle. The Cattle were taken from a field in front of our house in plain
                    view. The soldiers were taking other cattle also. There were 6 taken from us. 4
                    were milk cows and two were large heifers as fine as the cows and nearly as
                    large.</p>

                <p>Items 4 &amp; 5. The oats were taken from our grainery by the parties that burned the barn. They took three of our

                <p>In the fall of 1864 when Gen. Shermans army was in
                    this country collecting Stock and burning barns. I saw some of his troops come
                    to the place where I was living and drive away a flock of 42 sheep. 6 of whom
                    belonged to Dr. Ewing. I know there were 42 of them because I had salted and
                    counted them about an hour before they were driven away. We had 36 head of sheep
                    driven off at the same time. I was an eye witness to the taking and driving of
                    them away.</p>
                <p>The 6 sheep belonging to Dr. Ewing were in the habit of going with ours and they
                    were all together when taken. The troops that took the sheep were all cavalry.
                    There were a good many of them. They set our barn on fire at the same time.</p>

                    years old. I live with Dr. Ewing the claimant. I lived with him during the war.
                    I was one of the servants of the family.</p>
                <p>I was present and saw the northern soldiers drive off 6 head of cattle belonging
                    to Dr. Ewing in Sept. sometime. I cant tell what year but it was when his barn
                    was burnt by the soldiers.</p>
                <p>There were 4 milck cows and 2 heifers nearly as big as
                    the cows. I used to milk the cows; they were first rate ones for milk and
                    butter.</p>
                <p>There were 5 or 6 soldiers in the party. 3 of them went into the house to look
                    for arms, one went to the barn and set it on fire and two of them drove the
                    cattle away. The men who came to the house took all my money. I had five
                    dollars.</p>
                <p>They took 3 sacks and carried them away filled with oats. I held the bags for

                <p>I hard him often speak in opposition to secession before the State seceded and I
                    believe he was strongly opposed to it. When the war came on he was compelled to
                    go and when taken prisoner at Winchester was engaged as an assistant Surgeon for
                    the soldiers of both armies and when he came home I heard him say he was treated
                    better by the yankees than by our own soldiers and if he had not a family here,
                    he might have staid with them. I am confident he would
