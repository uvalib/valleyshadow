<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>It is a peculiar circumstance that Claimant fails to answer question 10 which
                    amongst other items relates to the employment of a Substitute. He does swear
                    however that he owned a Mill, and sold supplies to the Rebel Army and received
                    pay therefore and that he obtained passes and used them to go to Staunton and to
                    Richmond.</p>
                <p>Only one witness and he of the same name, and probably a near relative is called
                    to prove loyalty.</p>
                <p>We are not satsified with the evidence of loyalty and therefore reject the
                Claim.</p>

                <p>In pursuance of an application filed to take additional testimony, Christian
                    Kline, claimant, being sworn deposes and says:</p>
                <p>I saw all the property charge in my account taken. The roan horse item No. I.)
                    was taken by Gen. Hunter's army in the year 1864. It was on the 8<sup>th</sup> day of June. The horse was in the stable when
                    taken. A squad of men came and took the horse. I think there was an officer with
                    them. No conversation took place when the horse was taken. I did not try to
                    recover the horse. I did not ask for or receive any receipt. The horse was a
                    young horse. I do not remember his age. I think he was about three years old.
                    The other three horses and the three cows were taken by Gen. Sheridans army at
                    the time he made his Burning Raid through the Valley. The horses were in the
                    field except one and the cows were in the field. The army passed along the road
                    by my house and drove all the stock away. I saw them driving the horses and
                    cattle past my house. There was no conversation held at the time. There were a
                    large number of soldiers present who took the horses and cattle. I heard one of
                    the soldiers address one of the officers as "Captain." I do not know the names
                    of any of the officers. One was a black mare 8 or 9 years old. She was worth
                    $125. One was a gray mare about eleven or twelve years old and was worth $120.
                    One was a bay horse about twenty years old, a very fine horse, and was worth
                    $80. The three cows were milck cows. They were of
                    moderate age. I do not know how many pounds of beef they would have made. They
                    were worth on the hoof, $35 each. Further deponent saith not.</p>

                <p>Martin Kline, witness to prove property taken being sworn deposes and says:</p>
                <p>I am 30 years old and live near New Hope, Augusta Co., Va. I am a farmer. Am a son of the
                    claimant and have no interest in his claim. I was present and saw
                    four one horse taken from the claimant at the time of the fight at
                    Piedmont, by the U.S. army in the third year of the war and three horses
                        and four (4) cows and one heifer at the time of the Burning Raid under
                        Sheridan. I also saw four cows and one heifer taken at the same time.
                    One was a roan horse about five years old. One was a black mare, about eight
                    years old. One was a gray hors mare about nine ore or ten
                    years old. The other was a bay horse, about nineteen yeas old. Two of these
                    horses were in the field back of the barn &amp; one was in the stable,
                        and in when taken. I am not sure that I saw the bay horse taken
                    saw my father ride the horse down to the river where the Union troops were and
                    saw him come back in a few minutes without the horse. The army was passing my
                    father's farm at the time, and it took all this stock away with them. The army
                    was encamped three or four miles off. I did not hear any conversation between
                    the officers or soldiers and my father at the time the horses and cattle were
                    taken. Further deponent saith not.</p>

                    have no interest in this claim. I was present and saw the horses taken at the
                    time of Sheridan's Burning Raid, by the United States troops. The horses were
                    driven down the lane, from the barn, in my presence. I also saw them at the same
                    time driving away four cows and one heifer belonging to my father at the same
                    time. They were in a drove with other cattle. I was not near enough to hear any
                    conversation. One horse was a bay, about nineteen years old, one a black mare
                    about seven years old, and the color or age of the other I do not remember. I do
                    not know that there was any officer along with the soldiers who had the cattle
                    or horses. The bay horse was worth $90, the black mare was worth $120, and the
                    other one about $120. The cows &amp; heifer were worth, on the

                    progress of the war. He always expressed himself for the Union cause and the
                    Union army. I heard him so express himself in the presence of others. I am a

                    loyalty. It was that of a loyal man. He was regarded a Union man by his disloyal
                    neighbors. He aided his sons to escape North. I do not know that he
                    suffered any injury on account of his Union sentiment. He advised Union men to
                    leave and go North. He contributed provisions to Union soldiers in the hospital
                    near New Hope, Va. I never knew him to own any

                    &amp; am satisfied two others were taken at the same time. I think the
                    fourth horse was taken from the stable, but am not certain, I did not see the
                        milck cows mentioned in the petition taken.</p>
                <p>4. Witness says: The articles were taken during Genl. Sheridans raid, from the claimants farm by Union Soldiers.</p>
                <p>5. Witness says: Three other persons were present when the property was taken.</p>
                <p>6. Witness says: I suppose there were some officers present when the property was
                    taken. Do not know their rank or the army to which they belonged but suppose
                    they were Sheridans men.</p>
                <p>8. Witness says: The property was removed by soldiers, one horse was ridden but
                    dont know about the other property.</p>
                <p>9. Witness says: I do not know to what place the property was removed.</p>
                <p>10. Witness says: I do not know for what use the property was taken, except the
                    bay horse was moutetd by what I supposed to be a cavalry man.</p>
                <p>11. Witness says: No complaint was made to any officer on account of such taking.</p>
                <p>12. Witness says: There was no receipt given, none asked for.</p>
                <p>13. Witness says: The property was taken about 4 o'clock in the day.</p>
                <p>14. Witness says: The army was encamped nearby the day before the property was
                    taken but can not say whether they had moved when the property was taken. Don't
                    know the Regt. or Brigade, it was Sheridan Army.
                    There was no battle or skirmish just before the property was taken.</p>
                <p>15. Witness says: The horses were in good condition. One roan horse was 4 years
                    old, I think he was worth $120.00. One grey mare, 10 years old worth $100. One
                    bay horse 20 years old worth $50.00. Don't know any thing about the cows.</p>
                <p>19. Witness says: I believe the prosperity mentioned was taken for use in the
                    union army &amp; not for private use.</p>
                <p>22. Witeness says: I think the property was taken for some purpose so necessary
                    that the Govt. ought to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23. Witness says: I don't know that those who took the property had orders to do
                    so. &amp; further this deponent sayeth not.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Joseph M. Cline</b>
                <p>Joseph M. Cline a witness introduced by the claimant to prove his loyalty, being
                    duly sworn, answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Ques 1. Witness says: I am 34 years old, reside in Augusta Co.V<sup>a.</sup>
                    &amp; by profession a Minister of the Gospel. Have known the claimant during
                    my life time. Saw him all the time during the war. Talked with him often
                    &amp; believe that he was at all times loyal to the Govt. of the U.S. He was so
                    regarded by his neighbors. Did not know him to do any thing for the U.S.govt.
                    during the war, as he had no opportunity. He told young men to leave &amp;
                    go north. He sold supplies to the Confederate Govt. &amp; had some impressed. I do not know that he was paid for
                    any. I think he was too loyal to be called a southern man. I saw nothing in him
                    like sympathy for the south. &amp; further this deponent sayeth not.</p>
