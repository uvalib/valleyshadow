<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Julius C. Waddle,
                            March 25, 1872, Claim No. 12,658</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Waddle lived in Hampshire County, (West) Virginia during the war but filed his
                    claim in Staunton, where he worked as a United States Storekeeper beginning in
                    1869. Despite Waddle's loyalty to the Union during the war, the Commissioners
                    disallowed his claim because most of the property for which he requested
                    compensation did not qualify as "stores and supplies" under military
                    regulations.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>An examination of the items of the claim in this case shows that but very little
                    of the property comes under the head of "stores or supplies." It is alleged to
                    have been taken Decr. 20, 1862 by Gen. Cluseret of Gen. Milroy's command from
                    the claimants premises in in Hampshire Co., Va. The Union army encamped on his
                    premises over night &amp; Gen. Cluseret made the claimants house (which was
                    a hotel) his head quarters. Mr Waddle says he complained to Gen. Cluseret
                    &amp; he gave him "a certificate for a portion of it." He does not tell us
                    what became of the Certificate or what portions of the property taken it covered
                    or whether payment was ever made for the amount it did cover. Under the
                    circumstances we must presume that everything regarded as "stores or supplies"
                    was included in that Certificate &amp; the remainder chargeable to the
                    lawless depredations of the soldiers.</p>
                <p>We cannot allow the claim.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Julius Waddle to prove the taking &amp; furnishing of Property.</p>
                <p>Ques Witness Says. I was present and saw &amp; know all the property
                    mentioned in my petition was taken. It was taken in December the 20<sup>th</sup> of 1862. The Buggy was taken by Gen Banks troops
                    at the evacuation of Winchester, the other Property was taken by Gen
                        Cluseret of Gen Milroys Command. It was taken from my
                    place in Hampshire Co. Virginia. It was taken for the use of the U.S. Army
                    &amp; I saw some of the Property used by the U.S. Army. My family was all
                    present when it was taken. Gen Cluseret was present when it was taken. The
                    Property was removed by the soldiers. They were encamped at my Place &amp;
                    remained there one night. Gen Cluseret made my house his head-quarters. I
                    complained to Gen Cluseret - <u>who gave me a certificate for
                        a portion of it</u>. There was no receipt given except this certificate.
                    The property was taken in the night-time.</p>
                <p>Item 1 I saw 300 lbs of Bacon taken. I estimate the quantity from the number of
                    hogs I killed, and from the number of pieces left me when the Army was gone. It
                    was worth 12 1/2 <sup>cts.</sup> per lb.</p>
                <p>Item 2 I saw 200 lbs of Candles taken. I had my Candles in Boxes, they broke open
                    the boxes and they took them off in their arms. I estimate the
                    quantity from the number of Boxes I had, they were worth 16 2/3 <sup>cts</sup> per lb.</p>
                <p>Item 3 I Saw one Bbl of Apples taken, worth $2.50</p>
                <p>4 I saw 10 Galls of Tomatoes taken, they were all in Cans, &amp; hence I know
                    the quantity, they were worth 75 cents a gallon</p>
                <p>5 I Saw one Doz tin pans taken, they were worth 50 cents each, they were large
                    tin pans.</p>
                <p>6 I Saw two hand saws taken, worth one dollar each.</p>
                <p>7 I Saw one doz chickens taken, they were large &amp; worth $2.00</p>
                <p>8 I Saw 10 lbs of Smoking &amp; Chewing tobacco taken. I estimate it by the
                    bulk. It was worth 1$ a pound.</p>
                <p>9 I saw 43 blankets taken, worth two dollars each they were good blankets.</p>
                <p>10 I Saw 12 Comforts taken, they were worth three &amp; a half dollars each</p>
                <p>11 I Saw 33 Feather Pillows taken, they would have weighed two pounds each, they
                    were good feathers &amp; worth one dollar each.</p>
                <p>12 I Saw 7 Feather bolsters taken, they would weigh over two pounds each
                    &amp; worth 2$ each.</p>
                <p>13 I Saw 3 hogs taken, they killed them on the place they were about 1 year old
                    and would weigh 130 lbs Each nett. They were worth ten
                    dollars each.</p>
                <p>14 I Saw 10 bus of Corn taken, they took all I had, &amp; I judge from the
                    bulk there was 10 bushels &amp; worth one dollar a bushel</p>
                <p>15 I Saw 7 bus. of Oats taken, they were in the granary with the Corn. I estimate
                    the quantity by the bulk, they were worth 50 <sup>cts</sup> a
                    bushel</p>
                <p>16 I saw five bushels of Onions taken. I estimate by the bulk, they were worth 1
                    dollar a bushel</p>
                <p>17 I Saw one Overcoat taken, worth ten dollars</p>
                <p>18 I saw two tons of hay taken. I estimate it from the quantity I had in the mow.
                    It was worth twenty dollars a ton.</p>
                <p>19 I saw fourteen doz Towels taken. They were worth three dollars a dozen, they
                    were good Towels.</p>
                <p>20 I saw 8 Carpets taken, they were nearly new and cost 12 dollars each. There
                    was about 12 yds in each Carpet &amp; worth 9$ each.</p>
                <p>21 I Saw 8 Rose Blankets taken, they were very fine Blankets and worth 3 dollars
                    Each.</p>
                <p>22 I Saw 7 Looking glasses taken, they were 12 X 16 inches German glasses, worth
                    50 cents Each</p>
                <p>23 I did not see one top Buggy taken, but I Rode in it to Winchester with my Son,
                    &amp; left it in case of the hostler at the Taylor Hotel. Gen Banks was in
                    Command of the U.S. Army and when he left there, the hostler told me an Officer
                    and soldier of the U.S. Army had taken it off. There was no body else to take it
                    but the U.S. Troops. I paid ninety dollars for it, and it was cheap at that. I
                    am the sole owner of the property mentioned in the petition. I have never been
                    paid for it and nothing left in exchange. The prices charged for the things are
                    all low. The property I judge was all taken for the use of the U.S. Army. I Saw
                    them using some of it. I think it was taken for some purpose so useful to the
                        Gov<sup>t</sup>. that the Gov<sup>t</sup>.
                    ought to pay for it. I desire to state that I went to Baltimore in 1863, with a
                    pass from the U.S. Provost Marshal at Winchester, to get supplies for my family.
                    And once to Washington in 1863 or 1864, with a recommendation from Genls
                    Fessenden &amp; Hancock for the Office of Assessor in my district. I
                    returned as soon as I transacted my business, and further this deponent sayeth
                    not.</p>

                    about twenty miles from him but saw him frequently &amp; talked to him about

                    considered by his neighbors. He always so expressed himself. I dont know how he
                    voted upon the Ordinance of Secession, but if he voted at all I think he voted
                    against it, he always spoke against it. He did nothing that I know of for the
                    U.S. Gov<sup>t</sup>. He did nothing for the Rebel Gov<sup>t</sup>. He was threatened to be hung on account of his

                    know nothing about his political Status during the war, but heard always that he
                    was a Union man. The Claimant is now and has been for the last three years, a
                    United States Storekeeper. I have always regarded him as a Union man and a
                    member of the Republican party, he is a man of character and I do not think he
                    would bring any unjust claims against the U.S. Government. And further this

                <p>Ques. Witness says I am 22 years of age, a resident of Augusta Co. Va. by
                    occupation a clerk. I was present and saw all the property taken mentioned in
                    the Claimants Petition. It was taken in Decr. 1862 by Gen Cluseret of Gen
                    Milroy's Command. It was taken from the Hotel of the Claimant in Hampshire Co
                    Va. It was taken for the use of the U.S. Army, and I saw part of it used by the
                    Army. The family of the Claimant was present when the Property was taken. Gen
                    Cluseret was present when the took the property. I did not hear him order the
                    property to be taken. He made Father's house his head quarters, as soon as he
                    found out he was a Union man he gave him a guard. The Army was encamped all
                    around the house, the Property was all carried to the U.S. Camp by the soldiers.
                    The Claimant Complained and they gave him a guard and there was no more taken.
                    There was no receipt given or asked for that I know of. The property was taken
                    in the evening and none of it secretly. It was all in good Condition.</p>
                <p>Item 1 I know there was some bacon taken, but I dont know how much, it was in the
                    smoke house. I dont know its value.</p>
                <p>2 I know that there was candles taken from the cellar, but I dont know how many</p>
                <p>3 I did not see one barrel of apples taken.</p>
                <p>4 I know that there was Tomatoes taken, but I dont know how many.</p>
                <p>5 I know that the tin pans were taken. I dont know how many. I did not see them
                    taken.</p>
                <p>6 I know nothing about two hand saws.</p>
                <p>7 I saw them trying to catch the chickens. I dont know how many the caught.</p>
                <p>8 I did not see the Tobacco taken.</p>
                <p>9 I did not see 43 Blankets taken.</p>

                <p>17 I did see one Overcoat taken, dont know its value</p>
                <p>18 I saw them feeding hay. I dont know how much.</p>
                <p>19 I did not see Item 19, fourteen towels taken.</p>
                <p>20 I did not see 8 Carpets taken.</p>
                <p>21 I did not see 8 Rose Blankets taken</p>
                <p>22 I did not see 7 Looking Glasses taken, but I saw them after they were taken.</p>
                <p>23 I did not see one Top Buggy taken, but my Father and myself went to Winchester
                    in it, staid all night. The Rebel Soldiers came in and
                    Gen Banks went out, and one of the Union Soldiers took the buggy with him. The
                    hostler told Father that one of the U.S. Officers drove it away. I did not see
                    all the property taken mentioned here but I know that it was taken. It was all
                    there when the U.S. Army came the Army encamped there for one night and when
                    they left the property was all gone. There was no body else to take it, but the
                    Union Troops. I think the quantities &amp; prices claimed in the Petition
                    are very reasonable. The Claimant is the sole owner of the property. He has
                    never been paid for it, and nothing left in exchange. I think the property was
                    taken for some purpose so useful to the Gov<sup>t</sup>. that
                    the Gov<sup>t</sup>. ought to pay for it, and further this
