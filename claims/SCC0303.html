<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claimant hired a substitute and put him in the Confederate Service in the stead
                    of his Son. And he voted for the ordinance of Secession, but says he was forced
                    to it.</p>
                <p>The mere allegation of force to compel him to vote for the dissolution of the
                    Union and the overthrow of the Government without showing the character of the
                    Force or any of the circumstances, fails to satisfy us and the hiring a
                    substitute in place of his son though an act of filial affection, was still
                    rendering effectual aid to the enemy. And we regard the conduct of the Claimant
                    as it appears in the Evidence without other explanation inconsistent with loyal
                    adherance to the Cause of the Union and the Government of the United States.</p>
