<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Jacob Stover, March
                            12, 1873, Claim No. 19,888</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                The Claims Commission rejected Stover's claim for horses, grain, and commissary
                    supplies because his name appeared on the Augusta County polls as having voted
                    in favor of the ordinance of secession. His son appealed this decision to the
                    Court of Claims in 1889. The case went through several appeals between 1896 and
                    1901.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The claimant is a farmer about 56 years of age &amp; resided in Augusta Co.
                    Va. Was not molested by the Confederates. They paid him for property they took
                    from him. He states that he did not vote for the Ordinance of Secession. The
                    records show that he did vote for it. We must accept the record as the better
                    evidence. It was a disloyal act committed after the commencement of hostilities
                    and is not explained nor is there any attempt to justify.</p>
                <p>The claim is disallowed.</p>

                <p>Taking of Property. Same Deposition.</p>
                <p>Ques 1 Ans. I was present and saw the Bacon, Corn, Oats, &amp; Sugar taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. The Bacon was taken out of my Meat house. The Corn &amp; Oats
                    from my granary &amp; the Sugar from the Cellar of my dwelling.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. The property was taken in June 1864 I think the 9<sup>th</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> day. There
                    Officers present but I did not know names or rank. I suppose there were 500
                    soldiers present. A number were engaged in taking the property.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5 Ans. Mr. Jamison, Mrs. Guthrie, Mrs. Hall and others were present,
                    besides my family.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. There were several Officers but I did not know any of them. The
                    Officers told me the needed such articles, as they could not get to their
                    supplies.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7 Ans. The Bacon &amp; Grain, was carried off in bags and in hand. The
                    sugar was Maple or Home made and carried off in the hands of Soldiers.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8 Ans. The property was taken off by soldiers on horseback.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. The Command was marching.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I only know what they said, that they needed supplies, and horses
                    too. I saw one horse in their possession. That one was taken out of the plow in
                    the Cornfield. The other two were taken from my stable.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. I asked to get the horse which I saw, not knowing then that the two
                    others had been taken from my Stable. They refused giving as a reason that they
                    needed horses, but said I would get paid for him.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12 Ans. I asked for no receipt.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. It was in day time about 10 or 11 A.M. There was no secrecy in
                    taking it.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. There was no encampment, but had been one at Staunton, about 7
                    miles distant, but had broken camp that morning, and was en route. The Army was
                    in Command in Command of Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter.
                    There had been a battle at Piedmont on the Sunday prior and were skirmishing
                    that morning, with Gen<sup>l</sup>. Imboden. I knew no Quarter
                    Master, or other Officer. I heard one of the Officers called Col. Singleton, he
                    seemed to know me by reputation.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. The Sorrel horse, was 9 or 10 years old 17 1/2 hands high, in fine
                    order, and of fine action. I had frequently refused $200 for him. The black
                    horse was 6 years old, good medium size, a natural pacer, he was in fine, order,
                    he had only one eye, he was worth $150. And the bay horse was about 5 years,
                    fine order, and sound, he was worth $175. The Bacon all sound and good the grain
                    sound also. Sugar &amp; Butter good too. I do not think that any of the
                    articles are over charged. I estimated the quantity of prices, and the grain I
                    estimated in bulk.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Mollie E. Koiner</p>
                <p>My name is Mollie E. Koiner, my age is 24 years. My residence near Fishersville.
                    I am the daughter of the claimant, but have no interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>I was present and saw the bay horse taken, also the bacon, Corn, Oats, Sugar and
                    Butter.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. I saw the bay being led from the stable, by a soldier. The bacon
                    from the Meat house, and the grain from the Granary. The Sugar was taken from
                    the cellar. (A part Maple, and part coffee sugar.) The Coffee Sugar was in a
                    keg. When I saw the bay horse leading off I went immediately to the stable and
                    the black horse was gone, but I did not see him taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. I think it was the 10<sup>th</sup> of June 1864.
                    There was one soldier leading the bay horse off, though there were a large
                    number of soldiers in the field. There were several hundred in all, engaged in
                    examining the premises, taking the bacon, grain, Sugar &amp; Butter the last
                    was in the Spring house. They were on the farm, probably three or four hours.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5 Ans. Mrs. Jamison, Mrs. Hall and I think a Mrs. Guthrie were
                    present besides my mother and father a part of the time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. I do not know whether there was any officers present or not. I
                        thinkwas there was an officer present, as one man
                    entered the house and made the soldiers leave, I heard no name, he told me when
                    he saw me weeping about the black horse, the one I always rode, that if I could
                    show him the soldier who took the horse, he would make him give him up.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7 Ans. The property was taken as I have described in my previous answer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8 Ans. There were no Wagons, and the property was taken by soldiers on
                    horses. The Oats were all fed, I think, before they left the yard, some corn fed
                    too &amp; the balance carried off in bags. I saw some bacon in sacks.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. The Soldiers were marching. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I do not know the use. I saw the Oats and a part of the Corn fed.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. I heard no complaint made.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12 Ans. I never heard of any receipt.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. The property taken in the day time I suppose about 10 A.M. They
                    took every thing as though it belonged to them.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. I knew of no encampment. I heard of that Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's had been camped at Staunton, about 7
                    miles distant. There had been a battle a few days before at Piedmont. I
                    understood there had been some little skirmish that morning in the direction of
                    Waynesboro.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. The bacon &amp; Butter were a good Article, and I suppose the
                    grain was too. I prized the black horse very highly and they were all good. The
                    bacon, butter, sugar nor grain was not measured or weighed that I know of.</p>

                    Augusta County. I am a farmer. I am not related to the claimant, and have no
                    benefit in the claim. I was present and saw the horse taken out of the plow in
                    the Corn field, and then went to the house and saw the two horses taken out of
                    the stable. I did not see the bacon taken. I helped to fill up the Oats. I did
                    not see the Corn taken. I did see the Maple Sugar taken but not the Coffee
                    Sugar. Nor the butter.</p>
                <p>There were 30 or 35 come to the field, and two crossed to the plow and took the
                    Sorrel horse. The geer was taken off, which I took to
                    the house. There were three at the Stable when the black horse was taken, he was
                    rode off bare back, and in about ten minutes, quite a number of soldiers at the
                    stable when the bay horse was taken, and he as rode off by a wounded soldier.
                    The Oats were fed, or nearly all, before they left.</p>
                <p>I do not know about Officers being present. There was one man, who seemed to
                    command, as he hurried them off. I suppose they were on the place, some two or
                    three hours. The property was taken in the day time, about 9 or 10 A.M. There
                    was no camp nearer than Staunton about 6 or 7 miles distant. I heard that the
                    Army was Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunters. I heard the soldiers say
                    that the camp had broken that morning. I do not remember the time, month or
                    year, there had been a battle a few days before, I think it was called the
                    battle of Piedmont. The soldiers said that day that they were then
                    going to Lynchburg.</p>
                <p>The Sorrel horse I suppose was 10 or 11 years old, he was very large and
                    valuable. I would think he was worth at least $175. The black was 6 or 7 years
                    old, he was a fine family horse, rode finely. I think he was worth, to a man who
                    wanted a good riding horse $150. The bay was about 4 years, well formed, well
                    broken to the saddle, of fine mettle and beautiful. I think he was worth $160.
                    The Corn was in the cob and the Oats shelled. I should judge from the pile there
                    was between 50 &amp; 100 bushels. I think the garner containing the Oats
                    would hold 50 or 60 bushels and the garner was very near full. I never had a
                    particular conversation with the claimant about the value of the horses or
                    grain.</p>

                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> gen<sup>l</sup>.
                    Question. My name is Henry B. Jones my age is 54 years. I reside near
                    Fishersville, Augusta County. I am a farmer by occupation. I am not related to
                    the claimant. I have known the claimant about 30 years I lived about 25 miles
                    from him during the War. I saw him frequently during the War, probably five or
                    six times a year. We were intimate and talked freely about the War, he knew I
                    was a Union man. All his expressions and sympathies were in favor of the United
                    States. I do not recollect that I ever heard him speak in presence of others. I
                    never heard his loyalty to the Union questioned by any Union man. I never knew
                    or heard of his doing anything to aid the rebellion. He had a son in the Union
                    Army, as I understood and believe. I do not believe that the claimant could have
                    proven any loyal feeling or act to the Confederate States, if they had been
                    successful in gaining an independence.</p>

                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> general question My name is Henry C.
                    Kindig my age is 48 years. I reside near Waynesboro. My occupation is a farmer.
                    I am not related to the Claimant. I have known the Claimant about 25 years. I
                    lived about two miles from him during the War. I saw him frequently, sometimes
                    twice a week. We always talked freely about the War, I always found him opposed
                    to the War. His expressions and sympathies were invariably with the side of the
                    Union. He wanted the Union Army to be successful and said if it was not he could
                    not stay here. Every where, I ever met him he was the same. I have heard him
                    express himself in the presence of Union men. I agreed with him and he knew
                    that. His Union neighbors had full confidence in him as a true Union man. I
                    never knew him to give any aid or comfort to the Rebellion. His son John A.
                    Stover, belonged to the Union Army. He volunteered in Ohio. He is now living,
                    and resides near New Hope in Augusta Co. I do not believe that he could have
                    shown any loyalty to the South, if it had gained an independent government.</p>

                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The deceased claimant resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the late war of the
                    rebellion. The Commissioners of Claims rejected because they were not convinced
                    of loyalty. The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War
                    Claims, Feb. 15th, 1889. The deceased claimant was held loyal by the Court Nov.
                    2, 1896.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>It is alleged in the petition that there was taken from the decedent's premises
                    near Fishersville, Augusta Co., Va., on or about the 9th of June '64 by Col.
                    Singleton, of Gen'l. Hunter's army, the following stores and supplies:--1 large
                    sorrel horse, 9 years old: $175.00; 1 black riding horse, 6 years old: 175.00; 1
                    bay riding horse, 5 years old: 175.00; 500 lbs. bacon at 20 cts: 100.00; 40 bus.
                    corn at $1 per bu: 40.00; 50 bus. oats at 50 cts: 25.00; 50 lbs. sugar: 8.00; 30
                    lbs. butter: 7.00; Total $680.00.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners in March 1873.</p>
                <p>JACOB STOVER testifies: age 55; residence near Fishersville, Va. Am the claimant.
                    (P. 1). Testifies as to loyalty. I had 207 acres, about 172 acres in cultivation
                    and the balance in timber. (P. 2). I was present and saw the bacon, corn and
                    oats and sugar taken. The bacon was taken out of my meat house. The corn and
                    oats from my granary and the sugar from the cellar of my dwelling. The property
                    was taken in June '64 I think the 9th or 10th day. Officers present. Did not
                    know name or rank. I suppose there were 500 soldiers present. A number were
                    engaged in taking the property. Names those who were present. There were several
                    officers, but I did not know any of them. The officers told me they needed such
                    articles, as they could not get to their supplies. (P. 5). The bacon and grain
                    were carried off in bags and in hand. The sugar was maple or home made and
                    carried off in the hands of soldiers. The property was taken off by soldiers on
                    horse back. The command was marching. I only know what they said, that they
                    needed supplies and horses too. I saw one horse in their possession that was
                    taken out of the plow in the corn field. The other two were taken from my
                    stable. I asked to get the horse which I saw not knowing the two others had been
                    taken from the stable. They refused giving as a reason that they needed horses,
                    but said that I would get paid for him. I asked for no receipt. Taken in the day
                    time about 10 or 11 o'clock. There was no secrecy in the taking. There was no
                    encampment but had been one at Staunton about 7 miles distant, but had broken
                    camp that morning and was enroute. The army was in command of Gen'l. Hunter
                    There had been a battle at Piedmont on the Sunday prior and were skermishing that morning with Gen'l. Imboden. Knew
                    no Q.M. or other officer. I heard one of the officers called Col. Singleton. He
                    seemed to know me by reputation.</p>
                <p>The sorrel horse was 9 or 10 years old, 17-1/2 hands high, in fine order, and of
                    fine action. I had frequently refused $200 for him. The black horse was 6 years
                    old, good medium size, a natural pacer. He was in fine order, he had only one
                    eye, worth $150. The bay horse was about 5 years old, fine order, and sound. He
                    was worth $175.</p>
                <p>The bacon all sound and good. The grain sound, also the sugar and butter. I don't
                    think that any of the articles are over charged. I estimated the quantity of
                    pieces. The grain I estimated in bulk.</p>
                <p>MOLLIE E.KOINER testifies: age 24; residence Fishersville, Daughter of claimant.
                    I was present and saw the bay horse taken, also the bacon, corn, oats, sugar and
                    butter. (P. 7). I saw the bay being led from the stable by a soldier. The bacon
                    from the meat house and the grain from the granary. The sugar was taken from the
                    cellar. (part maple and part coffee sugar) The coffee sugar was in a keg. When I
                    saw the bay horse being led off I went immediately to the stable and the black
                    horse was gone, but I did not see him taken. I think it was the 10th of June
                    '64. There was one soldier leading the horse off., though there were a large
                    number of soldiers in the fields, several hundred in all engaged in examining
                    the premises, taking the bacon, grain, sugar and butter, the last was in the
                    spring house. They were on the farm probably three or four hours. Names those
                    who were present. I did not know whether there was any officer present or not. I
                    Think there was an officer present, as one man entered the house and made the
                    soldiers leave. I heard no name. He told me when he saw me weeping about the
                    black horse, the one I rode, that if I could show him the soldier who took the
                    horse he would make him give him up. (P. 8). There was no wagons, property taken
                    by soldiers on horses. The oats were all fed. I think before they left the yard.
                    Some corn fed too and the balance carried off in bags. I saw some bacon in
                    sacks. The soldiers were marching. I did not follow. I do not know the use. I
                    saw the oats and a part of the corn fed. Heard no complaint made. I never heard
                    of any complaint made. I never heard of any receipt. The property was taken in
                    the day time. I suppose about 10 A.M. They took everything as though it belonged
                    to them. I know of no encampment I heard that Gen. Humters had been camped at Staunton, about 7 miles distant. There had
                    been a battle a few days before at Piedmont. I understood there had been some
                    little skermish that moningg in the direction of Waynesboro. (P. 9). The bacon and butter
                    were a good article. Suppose the grain was too. I price the black horse very
                    highly and they were all good. The bacon, butter, sugar nor grain was not
                    measured or weighted that I know of.</p>
                <p>WM. P. JAMISON testifies: age 24; residence near Fishersville, Farmer. Not
                    related or interested. I was present and saw the horse taken out of the plow in
                    the corn field, and then went to the house and saw the two horses taken out of
                    the stable. I did not see the bacon taken. I helped to fill up the oats. I did
                    not see the corn taken. I did see the maple sugar taken but not the coffee,
                    sugar nor butter. There were 30 or 35 came to the field, and two crossed to the
                    plow and took the sorrel horse. The geer was taken off,
                    which I took to the house there were thre at the stable
                    when the black horse was taken. He was rode off bare back and in about ten
                    minutes quite a number of soldiers at the stable when the bay horse was taken,
                    and he was rode off by a wounded soldier. (P. 10). The oats were fed, or nearly
                    all, before they left. I do not know about officers being present. There was one
                    man who seemed to command, as he hurried them off. I suppose they were on the
                    place some two or three hours. The property was taken in the day time about 9 or
                    10 o(clock. There was no camp nearner than Staunton
                    about 6 or 7 miles distant. I heard that the army was Gen'l. Hunters. I heard
                    the soldiers say that the camp had broken that morning. I do not remember the
                    time, month or the year. There had been a battle a few days before. I think it
                    was called the battle of Piedmont. The soldiers said that day that they were
                    then going to Lynchburg. The sorrel horse I suppose was 10 or 11 years old. He
                    was very large and valuable. I would think he was worth at least S175. The black
                    was 6 or 7 years old. He was a fine family horse, rode finely I think he was
                    worth to a man who wanted a good riding horse $150. The bay was abut 4 years old
                    well formed, well broken to the saddle of fine mettle, and beautiful I think he
                    was worth $160. (P. 11). The corn was on the cob and the oats shelled. I should
                    judge from the pile there were between 50 and 100 bus. I think the garner
                    containing the oats would hold 50 or 60 bushels, and the garner was very near
                    full. I never had a particular conversation with the claimant about the value of
                    the horses or grain. (P. 12).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>HORSES.</p>
                <p>1 sorrel horse: $175.00; 1 black horse: 175.00; 1 bay riding horse: 150.00;
                    total: 500.00.</p>
                <p>Claimant testifies: farm mantained 207 acres, about 172 in cultivation. Property
                    taken in June '64. Estimates there were five hundred soldiers present with
                    officers. That the officers told him they needed the property (P. 2). Saw one of
                    the horses in their possession. This horse was taken from out of the plow and
                    the other two were taken from the stable. He asked them to give him the horse
                    that he saw at the time not knowing that the other two had been taken. Was
                    refused. Said they needed the horse and he would be paid. The sorrel horse was 9
                    or 10 years old, 17-1/2 hands high, fine order fine action. Frequently refused
                    $200 for him. (P. 3). The black horse six years old, medium size, fine order,
                    had only one eye worth $150. The hay horse was about five years old fine order,
                    sound and worth $175.</p>
                <p>MOLLIE E. KOINER testifies: daughter, saw the bay horse taken from the stable by
                    a soldier Went immediately to the stable and found the black horse was gone. Did
                    not see him taken. This was about the 10th of June '64. One soldier led the bay
                    horse off, but several hundred on the premises (P. 4). Think there was an
                    officer present. He said if I would show him the soldier who took the black
                    horse he would make him give him up. They were all good horses (P. 5).</p>
                <p>Wm. P. Jamison testifies: Saw the horse taken out of the plow and cornfield, then
                    went to the house and saw the two horses taken out of the stable. There were 30
                    or 35 soldiers that came to the field. There were three at the stable when the
                    black horse was taken. They rode him off bare back. In about ten minutes there
                    was quite a number of soldiers at the stable when the bay horse was taken and he
                    was rode off by wounded soldier. One man seemed to be in command. There was no
                    camp nearer than Staunton, six or seven miles distant (P. 6). The sorrel horse,
                    I suppose was 10 or 11 years old, very large and valuable. Think worth at least
                    $175. The black was six or seven years old. Fine family horse. Fine rider, worth
                    $150. The bay was about four years old, well broke to the saddle formed well
                    Beautiful horse, think worth $160</p>
                <p>This testimony establishes the taking of the three horses charged for at time the
                    Govt. was paying $160 to $170 for serviceable horses.</p>
                <p>For the three horses the claimant should not be allowed less than $150 each:
                    $450.00.</p>
                <p>BACON</p>
                <p>500 lbs. bacon, 20 cts: $100.00.</p>
                <p>Claimant testifies that he was present and saw the bacon taken in June '64 by a
                    Federal command of officers supposes that 500 soldiers were present. The
                    officers said they needed the property (P. 2). The bacon they carried off in
                    bags and in hand. (P. 3). Was sound, good bacon. Don't think I have overcharged
                    for any of the articles, estimate the quantity from the number of pieces.</p>
                <p>Mollie E. Koiner testifies: Was present and saw the bacon taken from the meat
                    house. Several hundred soldiers on the premises (P. 4). Think there was an
                    officer present. Saw some of the bacon in sacks. Soldiers were marching. The
                    bacon was good. Was not weighed that she knows of (P. 5).</p>
                <p>Wm. P. Jamison testifies: did not see the bacon taken.</p>
                <p>The taking of the bacon is proven by two witnesses. There is no reason for
                    doubting the estimate made by the claimant. The price charged is reasonable.</p>
                <p>There should allowed for 500 lbs. bacon: $100.00</p>
                <p>CORN &amp; OATS.</p>
                <p>40 bus. corn: $40.00; 50 bus. oats: 25.00; Total: $65.00</p>
                <p>Claimant testifies he was present and saw the corn and oats taken from his grainary in June '64, about 500 men &amp; officers
                    present (P. 2). The grain was carried off in bags. The grain was sound. Estimate
                    the oats and corn by the bulk. Don't think the charge is more than at the
                    articles were worth.</p>
                <p>Mollie E. Koiner testifies: Was present and saw the corn and oats taken. There
                    was several hundred soldiers on the premises with officers. (P.4). The oats were
                    all fed before they left. Some corn was fed the balance carried off in bags. Saw
                    the oats and part of the corn fed. The grain was not measured that I know of.
                    (P. 5).</p>
                <p>Wm. P. Jamison testifies: I helped to fill up the oats. Did not see the corn
                    taken. The oats were nearly all fed before they left. (P. 6). The corn on cob
                    and oats shelled. Judging from the pile there was between 50 and 100 bus. Think
                    the garner containing the oats would hold 50 or 60 bus. It was very near full.</p>
                <p>Ther should be allowed for corn and oats: $65.00.</p>
                <p>SUGAR.</p>
                <p>50 lbs. sugar: $8.00.</p>
                <p>Claimant's testimony shows that this sugar was taken from the cellar of his
                    dwelling house, the same time the other property was taken, and by the same
                    command. (P. 2). The soldiers carried it off in their hands. (P. 3). Quantity
                    estimated.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Koiner also saw the sugar taken from the cellar, part of it was maple sugar
                    and part coffee sugar. (P. 4). Was not weighed that she knows of (P. 5).</p>
                <p>Mr. Jamison saw the sugar taken. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>There is no reason why an allowance should not be made for the sugar as charged.</p>
                <p>50 lbs. sugar: $8.00.</p>
                <p>The item for butter will be omitted.</p>
                <p>The account should be stated as follows:--3 horses, $150 eacjh:
                    $450.00; 500 lbs. bacon: 100.00; Corn &amp; Oats: 65.00; 50 lbs. sugar:

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>John A. Stover, Adm'r. Jacob Stover, Deceased,
                    v. The United States No. 6816 Congressional.</p>
                <p>Defendants' Brief on Merits.</p>
                <p>This claim seems to have been rejected by the Southern Claims Commission on the
                    question of loyalty; and it is now admitted on merits on the same evidence
                    presented to the Claims Commission on this term.</p>
                <p>That evidence consists of the testimony of three witnesses. These include:
                    deceased claimant, his daughter, Molly E. Koiner, and
                    William P. Jamison, the two latter witnesses seeming from the evidence to have
                    been 15 years of age at the time the property is alleged to have been taken.</p>
                <p>Three horses are alleged to have been taken, but the testimony as to their having
                    been taken by Federal forces is hardly satisfactory, considering the fact that
                    there were at the time they are alleged to at have been taken
                    Confederate forces in that neighborhood or locality with which the Union forces
                    were engaged in occasional skirmishes.</p>
                <p>Decedent did not see any of the horses taken, but says he saw one of the horses
                    in the possession of Federal soldiers; hence it is clear that he did not see
                    either of the other two horses taken by, or in the possession of Federal
                    soldiers; while his daughter, Mrs. Koiner, testifies to seeing but one horse
                    taken.</p>
                <p>If the court should consider the evidence sufficient to warrant a finding for any
                    of the horses, the finding should, at the most, be fore not more than two of
                    them. As to the rate of valuation of the horses, it is certainly excessive, and
                    in this connection we call attention the fact that, according to claimant's
                    testimony, one of the horses, for which $175 is charged, was blind in one eye.</p>
                <p>As to the 500 pounds of bacon at 20 cents per pound, the only testimony in regard
                    to this item is that of decedent and his daughter entirely to the effect that
                    they saw the bacon taken. There is nothing upon which to have a finding for this
                    item, i.e. as to the quantity taken, excepting the allegation of the
                    petition as to the amount taken, and it not being competent evidence, we submit
                    therefore that no allowance should be made for this item.</p>
                <p>As to the items of corn and oats, decendent and his daughter testify to having
                    seen the corn and oats taken, but neither of them give any testimony as to the
                    quantity taken. William Jamison says he helped "to fill up the oats," but did
                    not see the corn taken; and estimates that there were perhaps 50 bushels of oats
                    taken. It seems to me that the evidence offered in support of these items is
                    wholly insufficient to merit a finding.</p>
                <p>As to the 50 pounds of sugar for which claim is made, claimant and his daughter,
                    Mrs. Koiner, claim to have seen it taken. Decedent says he estimates the
                    quantity taken to be about 50 pounds. Mrs. Koiner makes no estimate, and says
                    that the sugar was not weighed that she knows of.</p>
                <p>The item for butter has been abandoned by counsel for claimant.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Chas. F. Kincheloe Assistant

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1899-1900.</p>
                <p>JOHN A. STOVER, Administrator, JACOB STOVER, Deceased, VS. THE UNITED STATES. No.
                    6816 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>The conclusions reached by defendants' counsel for the testimony submitted are
                    not justified. The charge is for three horses. Defendants' counsel says that the
                    findings should at most be for not more than two. There is no avowed reason for
                    this request for findings. The testimony very clearly establishes the taking of
                    all three of the horses. Mr. Jamison, for instance, saw the horse which was
                    taken from the plow, and then, he states, he went to the house and saw the two
                    horses taken out of the stable; that there were 30 or 35 soldiers who came to
                    the field and three at the stable. He describes how the black horse was removed;
                    says they rode him off bareback, and in about ten minutes quite a number of
                    soldiers were at the stable, when the bay horse was rode off by a wounded
                    soldier. This certainly proves conclusively the taking of all three of the
                    horses.</p>
                <p>It is true that the claimant saw only one of the horses in the possession of the
                    Federal forces, which had been taken from the field. He asked for the return of
                    this horse, not knowing at the time that the other two had been taken.</p>
                <p>His daughter saw one of the horses taken from the stable, the bay horse, and went
                    immediately to the stable and found the black horse gone. This all occurred
                    while the soldiers were there and is conclusive as to the taking of all three of
                    the horses.</p>
                <p>These horses were taken in 1864, when the government was paying $150 for
                    serviceable stock. The finding should, therefore, be as requested.</p>
                <p>Defendants' counsel is equally at fault as to the corn and oats taken. He says
                    that neither of the witnesses give any estimate as to the quantity taken. The
                    proof does not sustain him in this assertion.</p>
                <p>The claimant estimates the oats and corn in a very proper manner by the bulk. He
                    say that from the bulk they took 40 bushels of corn and 50 bushels of oats. A
                    farmer can make a very correct as to the quantity in the bulk. His judgment in
                    that regard is quite accurate.</p>
                <p>Mr. Jamison also estimates from the pile of corn and oats shelled that there were
                    between 50 and 100 bushels of corn, and from the garner containing
                    the oats would hold 50 or 60 bushels.</p>
                <p>We have quite definite proof as to the quantities of both of these items end
                    there should be no change in the findings as requested. The same applies as to
                    the bacon.</p>

                    vs. The United States</p>
                <p>STATEMENT OF CASE:</p>
                <p>The claim in the above-entitled case for supplies, or stores, alleged to have
                    been taken by or furnished to the military forces of the United States, for
                    their use during the late war for the suppression of the rebellion, was
                    transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims of the House of
                    Representatives on the 15th day of February 189, 1889.</p>
                <p>On a preliminary inquiry the Court, on the 2nd day of November 1896, found that
                    the person alleged to have furnished the supplies or stores, or from whom they
                    were alleged to have been taken, was loyal to the Government of the United
                    States throughout said war.</p>
                <p>The case was brought to a hearing on its merits on the 23d day of October
                        189 1900. Gilbert Moyers, Esq., appeared for claimant, and the
                    Attorney General, by Charles F. Kincheloe, Esq., his assistant, and under his
                    direction, appeared for the defense and protection of the interest of the United

                    where decedent resided during the late was of the rebellion; that at different
                    times during said period the United States forces, by proper authority, took
                    from said decedent quartermaster stores and commissary supplies of the value of
                    $680.00, and appropriated the same to the use of the United States Army;</p>

                    <u>BRIEF ON MERITS.</u>
                </p>
                <p>This motion is based upon the fact that there are in the Confederate Archives
                    Division of the War Department nine vouchers, receipted by claimant's decedent
                    as paid, for supplies furnished and services rendered the Confederate military
                    authorities by him throughout the War, said vouchers being as follows: One dated
                    at Staunton, Va., Dec. 13, 1862, for hay, $100. One dated at Staunton, Va., Dec.
                    13, 1862, for hay, $930. One dated at Tinkling Spring, Va., May 26, 1863, for
                    pasture of horses, $180. One dated at Staunton, Va., Sept. 18, 1863, for pasture
                    and <u>care</u> of horses, $146.75; One dated at Staunton,
                    Va., Sept. 27, 1863, for pasture of horses, $55.20; One dated "11th Reg. Va.
                    Cavalry" March 11, 1864, for straw, $10.40; One dated at Waynesboro (state not
                    given), March 13, 1864, for straw, $70.40; One dated at Staunton, Va., Sept. 13,
                    1864, for hay, $300. One dated at Staunton, Va., Sept.  1864, for hay,
                    $54. Which said vouchers were not before, or considered by, the court in the
                    trial of the case on the question of loyalty.</p>
                <p>It is but proper to say that they were on file, at the time the case was tried on
                    loyalty, report of the War Department stating that there were on file in said
                    Department nine Confederate vouchers signed by one Jacob Stover; and to say that
                    the failure of the court to inspect and consider said vouchers was doubtless due
                    to the fact that the attorney then in charge of the case for the defence stated, in his brief on loyalty, that he was
                    satisfied that none of the disloyal acts referred to in the reports of the War
                    and Treasury Departments related to claimant's decedent; but while such
                    statement by the then attorney for the defendants was doubtless based on his
                    best judgment in the matter, we are satisfied, after having carefully compared
                    the signatures of Jacob Stover on said vouchers with the known signatures of
                    claimant's decedent on file in this case, that all of said vouchers were
                    positively and unmistakably receipted by claimant's decedent, and we feel
                    satisfied that like commission by the court can only convince the court that
                    such is the fact.</p>
                <p>And besides, in additon to the first report of the Treasury Department, stating
                    that "the name of claimant appears on the copy of the list of those who voted
                    for the Ord<sup>i</sup>nance of Secession in Augusta County..."
                    (the county in which he resided during the war), the Treasury Department, in a
                    recent report, dated December 7, last, says, after referring to its former
                    report above quoted from, "Moreover it may be stated that eleven other Stovers
                    voted the same way, and not one of that name is found as having voted against
                    the Ratification."</p>
                <p>As explanatory of why the claim has been allowed to proceed to finding on merits
                    before our making this motion for a new trial, we wish to say that the our
                    absence on leave, but with an express verbal agreement that the case should be
                    remanded in case we should have reason therefor and
                    so desired. In addition, we also called attention to the fact that
                    the recent Treasury report in question was not received until December 21, last,
                    some two months after the case was submitted on Merits.</p>
                <p>We will further add that the evidence offered by claimant to establish loyalty,
                    is of rather weak character, although sufficient to warrant a finding of loyalty
                    in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>
                <p>In view of the above stated facts, we feel justified in asking, and feel that the
                    court should grant a new trial on loyalty.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Reply to Defendant's Brief</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1900-01.</p>
                <p>JOHN E. STOVER, Administrator of JACOB STOVER, Deceased, vs THE UNITED STATES No.
                    6816 Cong.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANTS' BRIEF ON MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case, Jacob Stover, was found to be loyal November 2nd,
                    1896. The case then proceeded to trial on merits, and on October 29th, 1900 the
                    Court found in favor of claimant for $405.00.</p>
                <p>Now, after all this time has elapsed the defendant comes in with a motion filed
                    on January 12th, 1901, asking for a new trial on loyalty. This motion should not
                    be entertained for the following reasons:</p>
                <p>1st. That the report of the Confederate Archives upon which defendants' counsel
                    relies of nine vouchers was before the Court when this case was tried originally
                    for loyalty. These vouchers were investigated and it was found that no
                    disloyalty attached to them. The case was ably defended by competent counsel, so
                    this is not newly discovered evidence. Counsel now excuses himself for making
                    this motion on the ground that his predecessor erred in stating that he was
                    satisfied that none of these vouchers related to the claimant. Counsel defending
                    this case should have had those vouchers produced in court and had them
                    exhibited for the examination of the Court to determine as to their genuineness
                    so this whole matter was before the Court on the original trial. But, admitting
                    for the sake of argument that these vouchers were signed dy the claimant, they
                    do not import disloyalty for the reason that the claimant states in his
                    deposition in this case taken in 1873 that he had 15 horses taken and all kinds
                    of Grain by the Confederates and they paid him for part of this in currency; so
                    more then what is covered by the vouchers in question is testified to by the
                    claimant as having been taken from him by the Confederate forces, more in
                    value.. With this testimony before the Commissionens of Claims and the reports
                    of these vouchers the Commissioners did not reject this claim on the Ground of
                    these vouchers, but it was on another and entirely and different
                    ground, and the second ground upon which defendantS' attorney bases his motion for a new trial on loyalty which
                    will be considered in its order.</p>
                <p>In the first place these vouchers are all with one exception for small amounts,
                    for what a Confederate scout would use stopping a night or a day at a
                    plantation, and they are for just what scouting services would require, just
                    what a Confederate c command on the march would need
                    stopping over night at a plantation; they are for hay taken at different times
                    ranging from December 13th, 1862, to September 13th, 1864 and in amounts from
                    $10.40 up to $300, one only of $930; that is for hay taken December 15th, 1862,
                    in the winter season when much hay was needed. The claimant doubtless refers to
                    these same transactions in giving his testimony. He may have called hay grain
                    inadvertently referring to what was required to be fed to animals, and he
                    acknowledges that his property was taken. There is no evidence of it being sold,
                    but that he received pay. No disloyalty attaches to these transactions and the
                    Court has so ruled repeatedly. Furthermore, I insist, that inasmuch as these
                    same vouchers were before the Commissioners and before the Court necessarily at
                    the former hearing this notion cannot be entertained on the strength of these
                    vouchers as newly discovered evidence.</p>
                <p>2nd. This motion should be dismissed for the reason that the claimant did not
                    vote, for secession as alleged by defendants
                    counsel. On September 21st 1900 the war Department reported to the Department of
                    Justice, which report was filed by the Assistant Attorney General as evidence
                    for the defense, that "Nothing has been found in said Archives to show whether
                    or not Jacob Stover voted for the ordinance of secession: and nothing additional
                    has been found touching the question of loyalty or disloyalty of the within
                    named man". This report was before the Court when the case was decided on
                    loyalty, and also the oath of the claimant to the following effect: "I used my
                    influence in favor of the Union and voted for Union candidates to the State
                    convention; didn't vote for the ordinance of secession". Now, counsel in support
                    of this contention that this claimant did vote for the ordinance of secession
                    refers to the report of the Treasury Department dated December 17th, 1900 while
                    he overlooks or disregards the report made by the Treasury Department of July
                    23rd, 1892, (which was before the Court inwhen this case
                    was decided on loyalty) in which the Secretary reports that he "has the honor to
                    state that the name of claimant appears in a copy of the list of those who voted
                    for the ordinance of secession in the county of Augusta, Virginia, the original
                    of which is presumed to be in the custody of the Clerk of the Court of said
                    county"; so this whole matter was before the Court when the case was peviously
                    decided.</p>
                <p>There is nothing here in the nature of newly discovered evidence; there is
                    nothing whatever that justifies this motion on either ground, that is, on the
                    ground of the vouchers for forage, etc. or on the ground of claimant having
                    voted for secession.</p>
                <p>The Court was satisfied upon the trial of this case that this claimant was not
                    the same Jacob Stover whose vote was cast at his precinct, but a different
                    precinct in that county where there was a Jacob Stover resided who was a
                    secessionist; and he was the man undoubtedly who cast the vote in favor of
                    secession, so it must have arrived at that conclusion in order to have held this
                    claimant loyal. The vote for secession waas was at a precinct called
                    Middlebrook, while claimant himself voted at Fisherville, and the certificate of
                    the clerk shows that he does not find the name of Jacob Stover, who resides in
                    the precinct of Fisherville on any of said poll books of that county. So, this
                    would seem to settle the question of claimant's vote for secession. But, in
                    order to make this matter more conclusive still the antentive
                    attention of the Court is directed to certain affidavits bearing upon this
                    question herewith filed in support of the defense, which were sworn to in 1875.
                    These affidavits are substantially as follows:</p>
                <p>William A. Burnett, Clerk of the County Court, Augusta County (the same County
                    where claimant resided) certifies that he has made a careful examination
                        onfrom all the poll books of said county upon the vote
                    taken on the ordinance of secession on the 26th of May 1861 and that the name of
                    Jacob Stover appears upon the Middlebrook poll book of said county as having
                    voted for said ordinance of secession; that there was a person by that name
                    residing in the vicinity of Middlebrook at the date mentioned; that William R.
                    Dunlap, William Thompson, and E. Hogshead were the Commissioners who conducted
                    the election at said Middlebrook precinct on the 26th day of May 1861. And be
                    further certifies that the name of Jacob Stover, who resided in the vicinity of
                    Fisherville, Augusta County, does not appear on any one of said poll books of
                    the 26th of May 1861. Given under my hand this 4th day of February 1875.</p>
                <p>Also the attention of the Court is directed to a statement made by some 19
                    citizens of Augusta County, who state they have known Jacob Stover intimately
                    both before and during the late war and having had perfect knowledge of his
                    loyal sympathies at that period we unhesitatingly declare that we have full
                    confidence in all statements contained in the annexed affidavit; and we further
                    declare that to the best of our knowledge he did not vote for the ordinance of
                    secession. The affidavit referred to is substantially as follows:</p>
                <p>Jacob Stover states on oath that he did not vote for on the question
                    of the ratification of the ordinance of secession at the election in May 1861;
                    that he did not attend the election on may that day; that he was in
                    the County of Rockingham and only returned home on the evening of the day of the
                    election, returning under cover of night having given free expression to his
                    sentiments o of uncompromising hostility to secession
                    threats of violence a against him had been freely indulged, and in
                    order to escape the threatened violence he remained away. In February, he
                    states, he voted for the Union candidates; that he never cast a vote from that
                    day until after the close of hostilities between the sections. Furthermore, he
                    affirms that he was several times arrested and would no doubt have been
                    incarcerated in Castle Thunder had not my guards been compelled to
                    relieve release himme on account of being hard
                    pressed by the Federal troops. He further states on oath that the Confederate
                    States took from him property to the amount of several thousand dollars,
                    vouchers for which he now has and for which no payment was received. (Of course
                    this does not refer to where they paid him in currency). This was sworn to
                    before a Notary Public on the 1st of February 1875. G.W. Sutker states that he
                    knew Mr. Stover intimately at the time of the submission to the people of the
                    ordinance of secession in 1861, and that he did not vote at Fisherville, his
                    voting precinct on that day, but that he was considered an uncompromising Union
                    man.</p>
                <p>Mr. D W. Coiner makes affidavit on the 1st day of February 1875 that he is well
                    acquainted with Mr. Jacob Stover and has been for many years before the breaking
                    out of the war, and knew him to be an uncompromising Union man and that he
                    continued so during hostilities and has so continued to this time. He further
                    states that he was severely denounced by those of a different political opinion
                    at the time and during the war; that he has known Mr. Stover personally for more
                    than 30 years and belives that his statements are entitled to full faith and
                    credit, that he and Mr. Stover had several discussions at the beginning of our
                    late troubles touching the question of secession; that one prediction of his was
                    "that secession would stink in my nose before we got through with it."</p>
                <p>Another affidavit is that of David Myers sworn to February 4th, 1875, in which he
                    states substantially that he has known Jacob Stover, the claimant, for a number
                    of years prior to the war and at that time and since; he further states that he
                    knew him as an uncompromisingly opposed to secession, and he is
                    satisfied that he, Stover, did not vote for the ratification of the ordinance of
                    secession for the reason that on the day the vote was taken the said Jacob
                    Stover stopped at his house on his return from Rockingham county; that he reamined at his house until near sunset of said day
                    and could not have reached the voting place before dark and that he did not wish
                    to be at home or in the neighborhood on that day as threats had been made
                    against him.</p>
                <p>Also the following affidavit made by I.L. Timberlake on February 4th, 1875:
                    resides at Staunton, Va., was frequently at Jacob Stover's near Fisherville in
                    Augusta County in an offical character and in ever instance on which he did
                    visit him for supplies or other aid to the Confederate cause found him opposed
                    to doing anything and whenever it became his duty to take from him he had to do
                    it under his protest. He further states that he believed him to be an honest
                    Union man and that he prevented his arrest on several occasions; he further
                    states that he never knew said Stover to receive a dollar for any supplies taken
                    from him and that he was satisfied hundreds of dollars worth were taken, but
                    invariably under his protest; he further says he ragrded him as uncompromising in his opposition to the Confederacy and
                    never heard a doubt expressed as to his sincerity. This affiant was a
                    quartermaster's sergeant for the Confederate army at Staunton.</p>
                <p>H.B. Jones makes affidavit on the 1st day of February, 1875, to the following
                    effect: That he is a citizen of Augusta County; that Jacob Stover was at his
                    house in the County of Rockingham,--my residence being thene in that
                    county-on the day of election held for taking the vote on the question of the
                    ratification of an ordinance of secession passed by the Virginia Convention, and
                    that I had then a perfect knowledge of his political sympathies and know him to
                    have been uncompromisingly opposed to secession, and do not believe that he
                    would have voted for said ordinance had he been at home.</p>
                <p>G.W. Sutler also says under oath that such had been Mr. Stover's known character
                    as a Union man that certain parties boldly declared their intentions
                    of violently subjecting him to a "ducking" if he voted against the ordinance of
                    secession.</p>
                <p>Now, in contention with the testimony of claimant in this case and these
                    affidavits, and the evidence that there was a secessionist residing near
                    Middlebrook where by the name of Jacob Stover where the secession
                    vote was cast the presumption is irressistible
                    that he was the Jacob Stover who voted for secession and not this claimant.
                    Therefore in view of the foregoing facts both as to the vouchers and as to the
                    vote the Court will certainly overrule the defendants' motion and allow the
                    claimant to receive the small amount that has been awarded him.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant.</p>
