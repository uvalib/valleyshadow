<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The Claimant is forty three years old now. He took Oath of Allegiance to the
                    Confederate Government, &amp; then sympathised with all his might for the Union.</p>
                <p>Joseph Click a Witness talked with him during the War and regarded him as loyal.</p>
                <p>The loyalty of Claimant is of too feeble and and negative a Character to find
                    recognition here. After swearing Allegiance to the Confederate Government, if he
                    had made his escape to the Union lines, and enlisted in the Union Army as some
                    of his neighbors did we might let his oath of Allegiance to the Confederacy pass
                    but he sat still accepted the situation and at the most simply sympathised, and we regard such loyalty as that
                    under the circumstances as falling short of the requirements of the Statute and
                    therefore reject the claim.</p>

                <p>Peter S. Miller, a witness introduced by the Claimant to prove the taking of
                    property named in the petition being duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Ques 1<sup>st</sup> Witness Says - I am 22 years old, I reside
                    in Augusta Co. Va., farmer by occupation - I was not present at the actual
                    taking, but saw the property soon after in the possession of officers and
                    soldiers belonging to the United States Army.</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - the property was taken on the
                        29<sup>th</sup> of September 1864, from the claimants farm
                    by officers and soldiers of the United States Army.</p>
                <p>6<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - I think there was a Captain
                    present, who belonged to either Gen<sup>l</sup> Custer or
                        Gen<sup>l</sup> Sheridan.</p>
                <p>7<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - When I saw them some were being
                    rode and others led.</p>
                <p>9<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - the Horses were taken to Mt.
                    Sidney, I did not follow it.</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - I suppose the Horses were taken
                    for use of the Army. I did not see them after they were taken away.</p>
                <p>11<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - I don't know of any complaint,
                    being made.</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - I understood there was a receipt
                    given for two of the horses but heard the claimant had lost it.</p>
                <p>13<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - The property was taken in the day
                    time, between 11 o'clock A.M. and 4 P.M.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - The Army was encamped at Mt.
                    Sidney, about one mile away. They only remained there a part of a day. I did not
                    know the Quarter master.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - The horses were all in good
                    condition. Horse No 1 was about 12 years old, he was worth $100 to $125. Mare No
                    2 8 years old, she was worth about $175 - Grey horse No. 3 4 years old worth
                    $165, Mare No 4 - 3 years old worth $100 to $125.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness Says - I suppose the horses were taken
                    for the use of the Army - and not for gratification. I suppose the horses were
                    absolutely needed for the use of the Army. The Army horses were very much broken
                    down. </p>
                <p>21<sup>st</sup> Witness Says - I believe there was such a
                    necessity as justified them being taken.</p>
                <p>22 Witness Says - I believe the necessities were so urgent as to require the
                    Government to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup> Witness Says - I believe the officers and
                    soldiers who took the horses were acting under orders and were justifiable in
                    taking them.</p>

                <p>I do not know that he done anything for the United States, except he may have
