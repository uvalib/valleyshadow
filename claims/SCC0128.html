<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John D. Price,
                            September 13, 1871, Claim No. 6901</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                John D. Price's claim for two horses was rejected because the Commissioners were
                    not convinced of his loyalty. Details of his claim correspond with those of his
                    father, John Price. His claim was forwarded to the Congressional Court of Claims
                    with that of his father, although only the senior Price seems to have been
                    involved in the appeal.
