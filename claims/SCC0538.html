<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>One question proponded to this claimant he was better
                    qualified to answer than any other person. It is the question which calls on him
                    to state with which side in the Civil War he sympathised. He evades the question
                    &amp; tells us he don't know how he "felt at the battle of Manassas" -
                    "didn't feel for either side" - "Did not vote either for or against the
                    ordinance of secession" The record of the votes in Augusta Co. saves us all embarrassment if we should other wise have any in
                    disposing of this case.</p>
                <p>The Claimant testifies untruthfully - the record shows that he voted for the
                    adoption of the Ordinance of Secession.</p>
                <p>We reject this claim.</p>

                <p>Ques 1 I am 66 years old. I reside in Augusta. I am a farmer and tanner, I was
                    present and saw one horse - Item No.4 - bay horse &amp; 12 bushels corn
                    taken. The property was taken in June 1864, under Genl. Hunter. The horse was taken by about 10 soldiers, &amp; so was
                    the corn. There was an officer present who said his name was Capt. Smith of Genl.
                    Averill's command, he said his horse had given out &amp; he must have the
                    horse. He said he also needed the corn. The Army was on the march when the
                    property was taken, the horse I saw taken was 13 or 14 years old &amp; was
                    worth $125. I saw 12 bushels of corn taken, it was shelled &amp; in the
                        hhd, I estimate the quantity by the bulk. Corn
                    was worth at the time .95c per bushel. This is all I saw taken, this all I know
                    about the case, except that the property belonged to the claimant &amp; was

                <p>Deposition of Alb. Wayland recalled - to prove the loyalty of the claimant.</p>
                <p>Ques 1 I have known the claimant 40 years. I lived near him during the war
                    &amp; saw him nearly every day. I talked some little to him about the war.
                    He seemed to be opposed to the war, this killing one &amp; another. I looked
                    upon him rather as a Union man, I think he was looked upon as a Union man by his
                    neighbors. I don't think he voted at all upon the Ordinance of Secession (he did
                    not vote) I don't think he was threatened because he was a union man, he was a
                    very quiet man. I don't think he did anything for either the U.S. or Confederate Governments. He owned no
                    Confederate Bonds, &amp; did nothing to support the credit of the
                    Confederate States. He did not give any information to any Union officer. Never
                    heard him rejoice over any Union or Confederate Victory. I was a Union Man in
                    the beginning &amp; after the State seceded I went with the State. The
                    claimant is a man of character, &amp; good standing, don't think he would

                <p>Deposition of John Mitzer (recalled) to prove the Loyalty of the claimant</p>
                <p>Ques 1 I have know the claimants 50 years. I lived very near him during the war.
                    Saw him often during the war. I never heard him say anything about the war
                    during the war. I looked upon him as a Union man, because he did nothing for the
                    Confederate Government. I think he was regarded by his neighbors as a union man.
                    he did nothing for either Government that I know of, he did not own any Confed. bonds, &amp; did nothing to support
                    the credit of the Confed. States so far as I
                    know. I don't think he voted upon the ordinance of Secession. Never heard him
                    rejoice over a union or Confederate victory. He gave no information to any
                    officer of the US Army. I the witness had
                    nothing to do with the war. He never was threatened because he was a Union man,
                    he was a quiet peaceful citizen. I have always found him a man of truth.</p>

                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>From my personal knowledge of him regarded him as a Union man at heart.</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>Wasn't there a sentiment prevailing in the community, which prevented good Union
                    men from voting against the ordinance of Secession?</p>
                <p>Answer There was.</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>From the character of the man do you think he would show much feeling either
                    side?</p>
                <p>I do not think he would, he was quiet modest and retiring</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>Does the claimant own the land mentioned in your former deposition?</p>
                <p>Answer. He does not, it has been sold under a Deed of Trust. I believe he is
                    dependent upon his friends, the taking of the horses mentioned in the claim
                    deprived him of the means of cultivating his land, &amp; of supporting
                    himself &amp; family. The slaves owned by the claimant an old man
                    and an old woman were really of no value but I believe rather a tax to him. The
                    ownership of these slaves could not possibly have influenced anyone to espouse
                    one side or the other in the war - they were in fact an expense to the party
                    keeping them.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Hayes Moffett claimant recalled</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>In your former deposition you said you did not vote either way on the Ordinance
                    of Secession. Why didn't you vote?</p>
                <p>Answer. I was sick at the time, &amp; could not go.</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>How would you have voted, had you gone to the polls?</p>
                <p>Answer. I would have voted for the State to stay in the Union, I was opposed to
                    secession.</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>In your former deposition you say you would have gone to the bushes rather than
                    fight. Had you been within the military age, what you have done, which side
                    would you have fought on, had you been left free?</p>
                <p>Answer. I desired to see the Government kept as it was.</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>What were the ages &amp; conditions of the slave owned by you?</p>
                <p>Answer. They were very old &amp; worthless &amp; I think it would have
                    been better for me to have broken up long before I did their posession would
                    have been inducement for me to wish the success of the North.</p>
                <p>Question by Attorney</p>
                <p>What is your relation to the land mentioned in your former deposition?</p>
                <p>Answer. My land has been sold for debt, and after my horses were taken &amp;
                    could not work it, I was left entirely dependent.</p>
