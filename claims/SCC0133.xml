                <p>29<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - I never was a paroled prisoner of

                    I took no oath to get it.</p>
                <p>32<hi rend="super">nd</hi> Witness Says - I was under no disabilities

                <p>33<hi rend="super">d</hi> Witness Says - My sympathies were at the
                    beginning with the Union - I did not vote at all on the Ordinance of Secession,
                    and after its adoption I went for the Union and against the State.</p>

                    sympathies were constantly in favor of the Union - I never done or sought to do
                    anything against the Union or its Cause, or retard its success, and I was always
                    willing and ready to aid and assist said cause, so far as my means, power and
                    the circumstances of the case permitted. </p>

                    property named in the petition being duly sworn answers as follows.</p>
                <p>Ques 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Witness Says - I am 22 years old, I reside
                    in Augusta Co. Va., farmer by occupation - I was not present at the actual
                    taking, but saw the property soon after in the possession of officers and
                    soldiers belonging to the United States Army.</p>
                <p>4<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - the property was taken on the
                        29<hi rend="super">th</hi> of September 1864, from the claimants farm
                    by officers and soldiers of the United States Army.</p>
                <p>6<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - I think there was a Captain
                    present, who belonged to either Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Custer or
                        Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Sheridan.</p>
                <p>7<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - When I saw them some were being
                    rode and others led.</p>
                <p>9<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - the Horses were taken to Mt.
                    Sidney, I did not follow it.</p>
                <p>10<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - I suppose the Horses were taken
                    for use of the Army. I did not see them after they were taken away.</p>
                <p>11<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - I don't know of any complaint,
                    being made.</p>
                <p>12<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - I understood there was a receipt
                    given for two of the horses but heard the claimant had lost it.</p>
                <p>13<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - The property was taken in the day
                    time, between 11 o'clock A.M. and 4 P.M.</p>
                <p>14<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - The Army was encamped at Mt.
                    Sidney, about one mile away. They only remained there a part of a day. I did not
                    know the Quarter master.</p>
                <p>15<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - The horses were all in good
                    condition. Horse No 1 was about 12 years old, he was worth $100 to $125. Mare No
                    2 8 years old, she was worth about $175 - Grey horse No. 3 4 years old worth
                    $165, Mare No 4 - 3 years old worth $100 to $125.</p>
                <p>19<hi rend="super">th</hi> Witness Says - I suppose the horses were taken
                    for the use of the Army - and not for gratification. I suppose the horses were
                    absolutely needed for the use of the Army. The Army horses were very much broken
                    down. </p>
                <p>21<hi rend="super">st</hi> Witness Says - I believe there was such a
                    necessity as justified them being taken.</p>
                <p>22 Witness Says - I believe the necessities were so urgent as to require the
                    Government to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23<hi rend="super">d</hi> Witness Says - I believe the officers and
                    soldiers who took the horses were acting under orders and were justifiable in
                    taking them.</p>

                <p>Joseph Click a witness introduced to prove the loyalty of the claimant to the
                    United States, being duly sworn. Answers as follows</p>
                <p>Ques 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Witness Says - I am 52 years old, I reside
                    in Augusta Co. Va., and am a farmer. I have known him from his childhood - I
                    live about 3/4 mile from the Claimant, I saw him a great deal during the we were
                    very intimate. We talked about the War, he was in favor of the Union and opposed
                    to the rebellion - and he was so regarded by all his neighbors.</p>
                <p>I do not know that he done anything for the United States, except he may have
                    helped persons to leave the Confederacy. He done nothing for the Confederate
                    States, but what he was obliged to do. I do not think that he would have been
                    regarded as at all loyal to the Confederate Government had it succeeded.</p>
