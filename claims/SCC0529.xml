                <p>David W. Landes filed this claim in 1879 for $150, claiming Union forces under
                    General Hunter took one horse in 1864. David was a 43 year old farmer who lived
                    near Middle River during the war. He hid in the woods to avoid Confederate
                    service and helped others reach Union lines. Included is testimony from two men
                    he helped to escape, Joseph Sheets and George White as well as a Dunker named
                    Abraham Cline. Former Confederate Conscript Officer William J.D. Riley also
                    testified that he attempted to capture David while rounding up deserters but
                    David escaped. The commission allowed $140.</p>

                    constantly in favor of the cause of the United States, and that I did nothing of
                    my own free will and accord nor offered, sought or attempted to do anything by
                    word or deed to injure or retard its success, and I was at all times, when
                    called or if called upon, to assist the cause of the Union, or its supporters,
                    so far as my means and power and the circumstances of the case permitted.</p>
                <p>Testimony on Taking Property</p>
                <p>1 Ans. I was not present when the horse was taken. Nor did I see him taken, but
                    saw him in the possession of a soldier.</p>
                <p>4 Ans. The Mare was taken from the grass field of W<hi rend="super">m</hi>.
                    Link, on Thursday after the Piedmont battle, in June 1864. I knew no name. There
                    were 6 or 7 soldiers, in company when I saw my mare, I supposed one to be a
                    Captain.</p>
                <p>5 Ans. There was no one present.</p>
                <p>6 Ans. I think there was a Captain, but I did not hear his name. <del hand="h1">but</del> I
                    heard no regiment or Command. I did not say anything to any of them about my
                    taking my Mare.</p>
                <p>7 Ans. I did not see the Mare taken.</p>
                <p>8 Ans. When I saw my Mare, she was mounted by a Soldier, with all the rigging on
                    her.</p>
                <p>9 Ans. I suppose she was taken to Staunton as they were going in that direction.</p>
                <p>10 Ans. I do not know what use they made of the Mare.</p>
                <p>11 Ans. I made no complaint to any one.</p>
                <p>12 Ans. I asked for no receipt.</p>
                <p>13 Ans. The Mare was taken in the day time about 12 Oclock when I saw my Mare in
                    their possession.</p>
                <p>14 Ans. The nearest encampment was at Staunton, about 6 miles distant. The Army
                    was in Command of <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>.
                    David Hunter. They had been at Staunton 2 or 3 days. I do not know how long it
                    stayed. The battle at Piedmont on the previous Sunday. I knew no officer
                    connected with the Army.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The Mare was a bay, about 7 years old, I suppose 15 hands high, every way
                    sound, in good condition, well broken every way. I would not have taken less
                    than $150.00. I never received any pay for her.</p>

                <p>Deposition of W<hi rend="super">m</hi>. A. Houff</p>
                <p>Ans. to first question My name is William A. Houff, my age 50 years, residence
                    near Staunton, my occupation a farmer. I am not related to the claimant, and
                    have no interest in the claim. I was present and saw the claimants Mare taken.</p>
                <p>3 Ans. The Mare was in pasture in a field of W<hi rend="super">m</hi>.
                    Link, and about 1/2 dozen soldiers engaged in catching the Mare, after cathcing
                    her, they took her out of the field and started leading her off in the direction
                    of Staunton. They were probably a regiment of Soldiers a short distance around.</p>
                <p>4 Ans. The Mare was taken from a field, about 12 or 12 Oclock, on Thursday after
                    the Piedmont fight in June 1864. They were only a few minutes in the field.</p>
                <p>5 Ans. There was no one present with me.</p>
                <p>6 Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not.</p>
                <p>7 Ans. The Mare was caught in the field, and <orig reg="led">lead</orig> off. I
                    heard them say they had gotten to good ones, (the other being the Mare of James
                    Y. Quick)</p>
                <p>8 Ans. The Mare was led from the field by a soldier who was mounted.</p>
                <p>9 Ans. They left in the direction of Staunton, I did not follow to see.</p>
                <p>10 Ans. I never saw the Mare after that time, and do not <hi rend="super"
                        >know</hi> for what she was used.</p>
                <p>11 Ans. I know of no complaint being made. Nor of no voucher being given or asked
                    for.</p>
                <p>13 Ans. The Mare was taken in day time, about 11 or 12 oclock</p>
                <p>14 Ans. I knew of no Camp nearer than Staunton, about 7 miles off. General David
                    Hunter commanded the Army. I understood they got to Staunton on Monday, some 3
                    days previous to taking the Mare, I heard they left Staunton on Friday. The
                    battle at Piedmont took place on the Sunday previous. I knew no officer
                    connected with the Army.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The Mare was a bay. I suppose about 7 years old, of good size, she was a
                    fine condition, perfectly sound as far as I knew. She was well broken to harness
                    and saddle. I would have been willing to give $175. in good money for her. I
                    have never consulted with the claimant about the value of the Mare. He never
                    received any pay that I knew of.</p>

                <p>Ans. to 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> question-My name is James Y. Quick, my
                    age 37 years residence near Staunton, and a farmer. I am not related to the

                    taken and did not see her taken.</p>
                <p>3 Ans. I saw the Mare in the possession of Soldiers, <del hand="h1">soon after</del> not
                    far from the field, where I know the claimants Mare was.</p>
                <p>4 Ans. I suppose the Mare was taken from a grass field of W<hi rend="super"
                        >m</hi> Link, for I know she was in that field. This was on Thursday after
                    the Piedmont fight, June 1864. There were I suppose there was about 6 soldiers
                    together when I saw the horse, but a large number not far off.</p>
                <p>5 Ans. I was alone when I saw the Mare.</p>
                <p>6 Ans. I know of no officer being present.</p>
                <p>7 Ans. I did not the Mare taken.</p>
                <p>8 Ans. A soldier was riding the Mare when I saw her.</p>
                <p>9 Ans. I do not know where the Mare was taken.</p>
                <p>10 Ans. I never saw the Mare after that day.</p>

                <p>12 Ans. I know of no receipt being given.</p>
                <p>13 Ans. The Mare was taken in the day time I suppose about 10 to 12 Oclock.</p>
                <p>14 Ans. The nearest camp was at Staunton about 7 miles. The Army camped there was
                    commanded by <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi></abbr>.
                    Hunter. They remained in Camp about 4 days. I knew no officer in the Army.</p>
                <p>15 Ans. The Mare was a bay, she was not old, of good Medium size. She was sound
                    as far as I know. She worked well and rode tolerably I think she would have been
                    cheap at $150- and would have brought more I think where she was known. I do not
                    think I ever talked with the Claimant about the value of the Mare.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Same witness as to the loyalty of the claimant.</p>
                <p>Ans. I have known the claimant 15 years. I was intimate with him during the War,
                    we lived about 300 yards a part, we talked together about the war nearly every
                    day. He was very bitter against secession. We have talked in presence of others,
                    and he was always firm for the Union. His neighbors all had confidence in his
                    integrity as a Union Man. He regarded me as a Union man. I never knew him to do
                    anything for the Confederacy. I knew that he assisted all he could in feeding
                    and keeping men out the rebel Army. This was in the two first years of the War,
                    and the last he was hiding and escaping himself. I am sure that he could not
                    have proven any loyalty to the Confederate States, had they gained their
                    independence.</p>

                <p>Ans. My name is Josiah W. Sheets, my age is 30 years. My residence is near M<hi

                    from the claimant. I was with him a great deal during the War. When I was hiding
                    he sent for me to come to his house, he fed me, and helped me me all he could in
                    keeping out the clutches of the rebels. He knew I was a Union. I have no
                    recollection of hearing him talk in the presence of others. His Union neighbors
                    had confidence in him as a Union man. I never knew him to do anything for the
                    rebels in any way. I know that he fed and lodged Union men who were escaping the
                    rebel service. I went North in 1863 April.</p>
                <p>I would not have testified to his being at all loyal to the Confederate

                    had gained their independence.</p>

                    express himself to others, and he never changed, he knew my sentiments. The
                    general opinion of the neighborhood was that he was a Union loyal man. I know of
                    nothing that he ever did for the rebel cause. I knew <del hand="h1">him</del> him to use
                    his influence to keep men out of the rebel Army, and he fed and lodged many, who
                    were escaping from the rebel service. The last part of the War, he was hiding
                    himself. He could not shown any loyalty by witnesses in his own neighborhood. I
                    am satisfied from what I know of the claimant that he was and is a true friend

                <p>I am 55 years old, farmer, &amp; live on Middle River about 7 miles from
                    Staunton, &amp; about 1 1/2 miles from where claimant lived during the war.
                    I have known him ever since about 1852. During the war there were two little
                    farms between us. I had to pass right through his place to go to Cline's
                    Merchant mill, and would nearly always see him then, and I often met him at
                    other times &amp; places, &amp; the most of our conversation in those
                    days was about the war. I do not know how he voted, or whether he voted at all
                    on the ordinance, but I remember that I went to Mt Sidney that day intending to
                    vote against it, but I found the excitement so great that I went home without
                    voting. I cannot now recall any particular conversation that I had with Mr
                    Landes in 1861 or at any other time during the war, but I know that I thought he
                    was a union man all the time, and his neighbors thought so too. I heard some of
                    the neighbors abuse him for not going into the rebel army or service. As early
                    as February 1863 the conscript officers got after us, and I left house the 15th
                    of February &amp; went west, and was gone about 6 months, paid my fine as a
                    Dunkard &amp; then came home &amp; <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig>
                    there. After that I knew that Mr Landes &amp; some others were hiding out in
                    the cliffs along the river. Their head-quarters <del hand="h1">was</del> a part of the
                    time were on the hill near my house. They would stay there in the day time and
                    go other places &amp; stay at night. From that time on to the end of the war
                    I know Mr Landes was hiding out whenver there was any danger from conscript
                    officers. I know that he hid Jo Sheets in his own house for several weeks, and
                    this was before I went west. Geo. White was with Jo Sheets, and they were hiding
                    together. Mr Landes did not go into the Rebel Service at all as I know of, and I
                    never knew of his doing any thing for the rebels, and don't believe he ever
                    sympathized with the rebel cause.</p>

                    deserters. I went into Mr Landes' neighborhood after him and 6 or 7 others. Mr

                    "halt." He wouldn't halt. The I shot at him &amp; got down off my horse
                    &amp; took after him, but he escaped. I continued to look after him up to

                    Staunton. I was a democrat before the war, &amp; voted for Stephen A. <orig
                        reg="Douglas">Douglass</orig> for President in 1860. I never believed in the
                    doctrine of secession, nor in the Virginia doctrine that it was my duty to go
                    with my State. I beleived that my first allegiance was due to the National
                    Government. I think I voted for the Union candidates for the Convention; if I
                    voted at all I voted for them. On the day the vote was taken on the Ordinance, I
                    did not go to Mt Sidney at all, which was the voting place of any precinct. But
                    I came here to Staunton and was here in front of the voting place at the Court
                    House. My neighbor, Peter Houff, tried to persuade me to vote for the Ordinance.
                    At that time I could have voted at the Court House. But I refused, and did not
                    vote at all. My name is not on the Staunton poll-book, &amp; it ought not to
                    be <hi rend="super">on</hi> any book, and I have not seen it on any book.
                    The names of D. Landes, and David Landes that appear on any of these poll-books
                    are the names of other persons, and all relatives of mine. I was a Union Man
                    from the beginning to the end of the war, was always opposed to secession, and I
                    always wanted the Union causee to succeed.</p>

                <p>Washington, Oct. 21, 1879</p>
                <p>I saw the claimant in Staunton, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, where he now
                    lives on the 15th instant, and took the deposition of Abraham Cline, a former
                    neighbor, who happened to be in town that day, and who testified to Claimant's
                    loyalty. I also took the deposition of W<hi rend="super">m</hi> D. J.
                    Riley, who was a conscript officer for the Confederates, and testified that he
                    got after claimant at one time and shot at him because he would not "halt," and
                    says that he continued to look after him till the Surrender.</p>
                <p>I also took the deposition of claimant mainly for the purpose of having him
                    explain fully as to his voting or not voting on the ordinance. He said that he
                    left his home precinct (Mt Sidney), and went to Staunton that day, and did not
                    vote at all any where. I went with him and his attorney, A. H. Fultz, Esqr, and
                    examined the poll books in the Clerk's office containing the Votes on the
                    Ordinance in May 1861. I took particular care in reading the names on the Mt
                    Sidney and Staunton poll boooks, and several others, and did not find the name
                    of David W. Landes on either of them. Mr Landes is carrying on a grocery
                    &amp; provision store in Staunton, and seemed to me to be a substantial
                    business man, straightforward + truthful. I <orig reg="believe">beleive</orig>
                    he was loyal to the cause and governmet of the Union throughout the entire war.</p>
