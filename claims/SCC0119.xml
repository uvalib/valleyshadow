                <p>Engleman's claim for more than a thousand dollars worth of livestock, produce,
                    and household goods was disallowed by the Commissioners in 1872 on the grounds
                    that he voted for the Ordinance of Secession. When appealling this decision to
                    the Congressional Court of Claims between 1893 and 1897, Engleman and his heirs
                    went to great lengths to prove that he had not, in fact, voted for secession.
                    The Court of Claims ruled in 1896 that Engleman had been loyal to the United
                    States, but it is not clear that his heirs ever received compensation.</p>

                    and not with the Rebellion. I did not vote for the ordinance of secession. After

                    the South.</p>

                <p>Jacob Engleman a witness to prove the taking of the Claimant's property, being
                    first duly sworn answereth as follows</p>
                <p>Quest 1 Witness says-I am twenty two years old. I reside in Augusta County Va. by
                    occupation a farmer. I was present when the property mentioned in the claimants
                    petition was taken.</p>
                <p>2 Witness says-I did not see them all taken.</p>
                <p>4 Witness says-The articles that I saw taken were taken in 1864 from the farm of
                    the Claimant they were taken by Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Crook's men, he
                    was an officer in the United States Army. I suppose it was by the orders of
                        Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Crook that the property was taken</p>
                <p>8 Witness says-The property was removed by soldiers</p>
                <p>9 Witness says-The property was removed to the Camp on the adjoining farm. I saw
                    some of the property after it was carried to the encampment</p>
                <p>10 Witness says-I suppose all the property mentioned in the Claimants petition
                    was taken for the use of the Army</p>
                <p>11 Witness says-He complained to Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Crook and
                        Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Averill both meaning the Claimant. Gen<hi
                        rend="super">l</hi> Crook gave the Claimant an order to get his
                    horses, he got one, the others he did not get.</p>
                <p>12 Witness says-No receipt was asked for and none given.</p>
                <p>13 Witness says-The property was all taken in the day time from two O'clock until
                    dusk</p>
                <p>14 Witness says-When the property was taken the Army was encamped on the
                    adjoining farms about a mile distant, under Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi>
                    Crook who was under the Command of Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi> Hunter. They
                    stayed until next morning. There had been no battle before the property was
                    taken.</p>
                <p>15 Witness says-The horses were in good condition. They were young horses, two of
                    them were worth about one hundred and seventy five dollars apiece, and I think
                    the other was worth two hundred dollars they were all three young and in good
                    condition. There were five head of cattle taken they were good beef cattle, and
                    I think they were worth fifty dollars apiece. There was clothing taken for spies
                    as mentioned in the claimants, which I suppose was worth forty five dollars.
                    There was four and a half barrels taken worth about seven dollars &amp; a
                    half a barrel I saw one box of tobacco taken containing sixty two or three
                    pounds we were selling it at that time at forty cents a pound. I saw some soap
                    taken. I dont know how much, nor do I know how much it was worth. I saw some
                    vinegar taken. I dont know how much nor do I know how much it was worth. Some
                    bags and a wagon cover were taken I do not know what the bags were worth. The
                    wagon cover I dont know it's valuation. Saddle bags and a bridle were taken, but
                    I did not seem them taken. I do not know what they were worth. There was no
                    harness taken that I know of. There was between nine and ten bushels of grain
                    taken. I dont know whether it was corn or oats corn was worth a dollar a barrel
                    oats thirty five cents. All the property mentioned was taken by Gen<hi
                        rend="super">l</hi> Crook's men. I think the property mentioned in the
                    claimant's petition was worth what he has charged the Government for it</p>
                <p>19 Witness says-I think the property described in each item was taken for the
                    actual use of the Army, and not for individual officers or soldiers</p>
                <p>21 Witness says-I think the property was taken in consequence of some necessity
                    for the articles taken which necessity justified the officers in taking them</p>
                <p>22 Witness says-I think the property was taken for some purpose so necessary that
                    the Government ought to be required to pay for it</p>
                <p>23 Witness says-I think it was taken by the order of officers who had the
                    authority to take it or order it to be taken. A soldier told me he had orders to
                    take it and further the deponent saith not. August the 20<hi rend="super"

                    State, and know that during the war of rebellion, said Engleman suffered heavy
                    losses through property taken by the U.S. forces in 1864, that we believe his
                    claim as presented by him for damages is just and fair, that the prices therein
                    charged are reasonable and just. We do further state that we know that said John
                    Engleman was a thoroughly loyal citizen of the U.S. and consistently maintained
                    his loyal sentiments, by harboring and concealing Union men and refugees
                    escaping, that he throughout the rebellion, never served the Confederate
                    Government in any capacity, or rendered any aid or support to said Confederate
                    Government, its officers or adherents.</p>

                    has always been a very firm man doing what he thought right to himself and

                    <del hand="h1">drin</del> during the war I frequently conversed with him on that subject
                    and always found him decidedly in <orig reg="favor">favour</orig> of the united

                    the Impressment for the <orig reg="Rebel">Reble</orig> government saying that he

                <p>John Engleman, vs. The United States No. 6817 Cong.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the late war of the
                    rebellion.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims disallowed his claim, and in their report to Congress
                    state:--</p>
                <p>"The poll lists show that claimant voted for the adoption of the ordinance of
                    secession. This was a disloyal act for which we are constrained to reject the

                <p>Report not signed by any of the Commissioners.</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims on Feb.
                    15th, 1889.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following tesimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners of Claims.</p>
                <p>This testimony was taken in Aug. '71.</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testifies: Age 60; residence Augusta Co., Va., farmer. Have resided
                    here for fourteen years. Never passed beyond the military or naval <orig
                        reg="lines">miles</orig> of the United States and entered the rebel lines.
                    Never took an oath or affirmation to bear allegiance to the so-called
                    Confederate states. (P. 1). Took the amnesty oath in '65, in Augusta Co., Va.
                    after the war. Never been pardoned by the president. Never directly or
                    indirectly connected with the civil service of the United States. Never held any
                    office or place of trust, honor or profit under the Confederate Govt. Questions
                    8 to 16 inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. Never furnished
                    a substitute. (P. 2 &amp; 3). Was arrested by the Confederate Govt. in May
                    '64, in Augusta Co., Va., by the Confederate Provost guard. Was under arrest two
                    days and two nights. Took no oath to the Confederate Govt. to get released. They
                    told me to to home and raise corn for the Confederate army. I did not promise
                    that I would do it. Never arrested by the U.S. Govt. Had a horse, corn, hay and
                    oats taken by the Confederate authorities at different times during the war for
                    the use of the Confederate army. Received no pay for the saw. (P. 4). Was
                    threatened with damage and injury to my person, family and property on account
                    of my Union sentiments by rebel soldiers and my neighbors threatened to take my
                    property and put me and my wife in castle thunder at Richmond. I contributed
                    money to get my sons into the Union lines. I gave Union men directions how to go
                    to the Union lines. I gave Union men directions how to go to the Union lines. I
                    harbored them at my house and fed them in the brush until they could go into the
                    Union lines. Had nephews in the Rebel army. Had no relatives in the Union army
                    that I know of. Never did anything to supply them with military equipments or
                    with money. Never owned any Confederate bonds, did nothing to support the credit
                    of the Confederacy. (P. 6). I have never given aid or comfort to the rebellion.
                    Questions 26 to 32 inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. (P.
                    6). At the beginning of the rebellion I sympathized with the Union and not with
                    the rebellion. I did not vote for the ordinance of secession. After the
                    ordinance of secession was adopted I adhered to the Union cause and not to the
                    South.. Solemnly declares that from the beginning of hostilities to the end
                    thereof, his sympathies were with the cause of the U.S., etc., etc. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>JACOB CARWELL testifies: Age 28; residence Augusta Co., Va., farmer. I have known
                    the claimant fifteen years. Resided near him. Saw him often during the war.
                    Talked with him about the war. He was loyal to the United States Govt. during
                    the war. So regarded by his neighbors. He harbored men from the Confederate army
                    who were deserters. He helped his sons away I never knew him to do anything
                    voluntarily for the Confederate army. I think the claimant was too good a Union
                    man to have been considered loyal to the Confederacy, if it had succeeded. (P.
                    12).</p>
                <p>JOHN H. CARWELL testifies: Age 26; residence Augusta Co., Va. Farmer. I have
                    known the claimant fifteen years. Resided about three miles from him, saw him
                    often during the war. Talked with him about the war. He was loyal to the United
                    States Govt. during the war. Think he was so regarded by his neighbors. I was in
                    the Confederate army, and I left it, and he concealed me in his house. Three of
                    us <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> at his house off and on until we could get
                    into the Union lines. I never knew him to do anything for the rebel cause. He
                    was too good a Union man to have been considered loyal to the Confederacy if it
                    had succeeded. (P. 13).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court. This testimony was taken pursuant to notice, on Oct. 5th 1894.</p>
                <p>WM. T. FAUBER testifies: Age 69; farmer; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not related
                    or interested. (P. 1). I knew the claimant personally. My acquaintance began
                    before the war. Knew him intimately during the war, and resided a mile and a
                    half from him, in his immediate neighborhood. Saw him frequently and conversed
                    with him as a neighbor often. Conversed with him often about the war and its
                    results, and he always expressed himself that he desired the success of the
                    Federal Govt. and hoped the Yankees would soon whip the South. He said that the
                    people in this section had to be very careful how they talked about the war, and
                    our conversations were not in the presence of others to my knowledge I was an
                    adherent of the Union cause and was recognized as such by the people of my
                    neighborhood and county. (P. 2). He was looked upon and regarded as loyal to the
                    Government of the United States by his neighbors and those who knew him during
                    the late war. He never flinched from that position. His neighbors who were loyal
                    always regarded him as such. The Confederates said he was a dangerous man, and
                    regarded me in the same way. I know that the claimant never had the opportunity
                    to aid the Union army. He never contributed anything to aid the Confederate
                    Government to my knowledge. He told me that he never voted at all. If he voted
                    he certainly would have voted against secession. His views never changed during
                    the entire war. (P. 3). There were three bearing the name of John Engleman that
                    I know of in Augusta Co., Va., and they were qualified voters. One lived in the
                    Middlebrook neighborhood, another in the Hebron Church neighborhood and the
                    third in Staunton, Va. I know the claimant was not in <abbr expan="Kentucky"
                    >Ky.</abbr> at any time during the war up to the month of Jan. '64 when I left
                    and passed through the lines into Ohio. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>JAS. E. BEARD testifies: farmer, age 72; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not
                    interested or related. (P. 5). I was acquainted with the claimant, John
                    Engleman, He moved to my neighborhood in the Spring of '56 on the farm adjoining
                    mine. I had known him previously, but more intimately after his removal to our
                    neighborhood. My acquaintance was intimate with him during the war except the
                    first ten months when I was absent from my home. I resided about a quarter of a
                    mile from him. Saw him two or three times a week, and on an average at least
                    once a week, except the first ten months of the beginning of the war. He was a
                    very near neighbor, and we were frequently thrown together. We conversed often
                    about the war and its causes and Mr. Engleman always expressed himself in
                    sympathy with the Government of the United States. Conversations generally
                    alone, but sometimes in the presence of particular friends. Names them. I voted
                    for secession, but when I went to vote it was my preference to have voted
                    against it, I was told that my vote would only be received by voting for
                    secession or not otherwise. (P. 6). I knew his reputation and he was regarded by
                    others who knew him as loyal to the Government of the United States during the
                    entire war. He was regarded as a Union man by his loyal neighbors. He was always
                    spoken by others in the same way. He had no opportunity to aid the Union army,
                    except to aid persons in going through the lines, which he did. He never aided
                    the Confederacy to my knowledge, and if at all by compulsion. I don't think he
                    voted at all in '61. His views grew stronger in favor of the Northern side. (P.
                    7). I only knew of two John Englemans in Augusta Co. Heard of a third one. The
                    claimant John Engleman lived near Middlebrook, and the other one John B.
                    Engleman lived at Staunton, Va. I am certain the claimant was not in <abbr
                        expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> during the war, unless during the first ten
                    months of the beginning of the war, when I was absent. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>ROBT. A. HELMS testifies: Occupation boot and shoe trade; age 56; residence
                    Augusta Co., Va. Not interested or related. (P. 9). I was acquainted with the
                    claimant. My acquaintance commenced in '61. Intimately acquainted with him
                    during the whole war. Resided in the same neighborhood about 2-1/2 distant from
                    him, and during that time I boarded in his family for several weeks. Saw him
                    frequently, and once a week when he came to Middlebrook for his mail generally.
                    Conversed with him often about the war; most every time we met. He invariably
                    expressed himself opposed to the war and in favor of the Federal Govt.
                    Conversations alone and in the presence of others. Names those who were present.
                    (P. 10). I was in favor of the Union, and was known to the claimant as such. (P.
                    10). I knew his public reputation for loyalty. He was regarded by the people of
                    his neighborhood as loyal to the Federal Govt. and know the fact that he was
                        <orig reg="criticized">criticised</orig> because of his Union sentiments. He
                    was regarded by his loyal neighbors as loyal to the U.S. Govt. and was talked
                    about my others who were not loyal. Knew of nothing the claimant did to aid the
                    Union army, except to aid persons in crossing the lines to avoid service in the
                    Confederate army. He never aided the Confederacy to my knowledge, and if it all
                    by compulsion. I don't know of my own knowledge how the claimant voted in '61,
                    but remember hearing him say that he did not vote at all. His views never
                    changed at all. (P. 11). I knew of two John Englemans living in Augusta Co.,
                    that is the claimant, John Engleman, who resided near Middlebrook and John B.
                    Engleman who resided at Staunton, Va., both of whom were qualified voters. I am
                    satisifed that the claimant was not in <abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> from
                    April '61 to Nov. '64. (P. 12).</p>
                <p>JACOB B. CARWELL testifies: Farmer; age 51; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not
                    interested or related. I was acquainted with the claimant having known him from
                    my early childhood up to his death. Acquaintance intimate during the war. Live
                    in the same neighborhood about two miles distant from him. Saw him often in the
                    neighborhood and at his home <abbr expan="near">nr.</abbr> Middlebrook, Va. I
                    talked with him often about the war and its consequences. He never expressed
                    himself favorable to the Confederacy, but always against it and in favor of the
                    Government of the United States. (P. 13). Conversations alone and in the
                    presence of others. Names those who were present. I was an adherent of the Union
                    cause, and was known as such to the claimant. I knew his public reputation as to
                    his loyalty, from general repute in his neighborhood and from acts in harboring
                    and protecting Union men during the war. He was regarded by his loyal neighbors
                    as loyal to the U.S. Govt., and never questioned otherwise. Claimant never aided
                    the Union army to <orig reg="my">me</orig> knowledge, because he never had any
                    opportunity. He never contributed anything to aid the Confederate Govt. to my
                    knowledge. I am sure his inclination was opposed to such aid. (P. 14). I don't
                    think the claimant voted at all in '61. His views never changed. I only knew of
                    two John <orig reg="Englemans">Engleman's</orig> living in Augusta Co., Va. John
                    Engleman the claimant, who lived near Middlebrook, and John B. Engleman who
                    lived in Staunton, Va. I am satisified the claimant was not in <abbr
                        expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> during the war. (P. 15).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Mr. Engleman was 50 years of age in '61. He was a farmer living in Augusta Co.,
                    Va., during the war. Never took any oath to the Confederacy; never held any
                    position under the Confederacy. Was arrested by the Confederates in May '64;
                    detained two days and two nights. The Confederates took forage for which he says
                    he received no pay. He was threatened on account of his Union sentiments.
                    Furnished money to send his sons into the Union lines. Harbored and fed Union
                    men, until they could go into the Union lines, and gave them directions how to
                    go there. Never gave any aid to the rebellion. Did not vote for secession in
                    '61. Adhered to the Union cause throughout.</p>
                <p>MR.CARWELL testifies to the local reputation of the claimant; that he harbored
                    deserters from the Confederate army, and helped his sons to get away.</p>
                <p>JOHN H. CARWELL testifies to the loyal reputation of the claimant,and to his
                    concealing him and two other deserters from the Confederate army until they
                    could get into the union lines.</p>
                <p>MR.FAUBER testifies that he knew claimant intimately during the war; conversed
                    often, he always expressed himself as desiring the success of the Federal Govt.,
                    and wishing the success of the Yankees. Testifies to his loyal reputation, and
                    that his neighbors who were loyal always regarded him as such. That his views
                    never changed. That there were three men bearing the name of John Engleman, in
                    Augusta Co., Va., who were qualified voters. Gives their location. Further
                    states that the claimant was not in Ky. at any time to Ohio.</p>
                <p>MR. BEARD, age 72; testifies that the claimant lived on at adjoining farm, and
                    they were intimate during the war, frequently together. Conversed often, and
                    that Mr. Engleman, always expressed himself in sympathy with the U.S. Govt.
                    Testifies to the loyal reputation of the claimant; that he aided men to get
                    through the lines. That his views grew stronger in favor of the Northern side.</p>
                <p>Witness says he knew of two John Englemans in Augusta Co., and heard of a third
                    one.</p>
                <p>MR. HELMS testifies that he was intimate with the claimant during the war,and
                    that the claimant invariably expressed himself opposed to the war and in favor
                    of the Federal Govt. That he was regarded by the people of his neighborhood as
                    loyal to the Federal Govt. Remember hearing claimant say he did not vote in '61.
                    Knows of two John Engleman's in Augusta Co.</p>
                <p>MR. CARWELL testifies, lived in the same neighborhood with the claimant; always
                    expressed himself against the Confederacy, and in favor of the U.S. That he
                    harbored and protected Union men. Testifies to loyal reputation. Testifies to
                    knowing two John Engleman's in Augusta Co., Va.</p>
                <p>Guided by the foregoing testimony the conclusion is irresistible, that, John
                    Engleman was always a Union man and loyal to the U.S. Govt. It is also evident,
                    that he did not vote for secession.</p>

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1894-95.</p>
                <p>John Engleman, vs. The United States No. 6817 Cong.</p>
                <p>BRIEF OF EVIDENCE FOR DEFENSE.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken on behalf of the defense, on Feb. 14th, 1895.</p>
                <p>WM. A. BURNETT testifies: age 58; residence Augusta Co., Va., Not related or
                    interested. (P. 1). I knew a man by the name of John Engleman, who lived in this
                    county during the period between '60 and '63. I knew a man by that name at that
                    time who lived in this county. The John Engleman referred to lived about eight
                    or nine miles west of Staunton, and within about two and a half miles of
                    Middlebrook. His usual place of voting was Middlebrook Precinct, in this county,
                    but he could have voted at the Court House Precinct, or any other precinct in
                    the Co. The poll books for the elections referred to in the question, are on
                    file in the Clerk's office of the county Court of Augusta Co., Va., and I am the
                    custodian of them as the Clerk of that Court. As shown by the poll books of the
                    year '61 an<del hand="h1">d</del> election was held on the 4th day of Feb. '61, for the
                    election of three delegates to the convention called by act of Assembly to
                    provide for electing members of the convention and to convene the same, passed
                    Jan. 14, 1891. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>The candidates voted for at that election were John D. Imboden, (afterwards a
                    general in the Confederate army) John B. Baldwin, (afterwards an officer for a
                    short time in said army), Alex. H.H. Stuart, Geo. Baylor, Kenton Harper, and
                    Jas. H. Skinner, (the two last named, of whom were also afterwards both officers
                    in the said army) John B. Baldwin, Alex. H.H. Stuart, and Geo. Baylor were Union
                    candidates. At the same election, as appears in the same Poll book, the
                    questions for referring action of convention to the people, and against
                    referring action of Convention to the people, were voted on. On the 23rd of May
                    '61 a poll was taken of the sense of the voters upon the ratification or
                    rejection of an ordinance to amend the constitution of Va., by striking out the
                    22nd and 23rd sections of the 4th article of the then constitution. The name of
                    John Engleman appears recorded on the poll book of the Court House precinct of
                    date May 23rd, 1861, as having voted for Bolivar Christian for the Senate, Hugh
                    W. Sheffey, Wm. M. Tate, and John A. Harman, for the House of Delegates, and
                    Thos. L. Brown, for Board of Public Works, and also for the ratification of the
                    Ordinance of secession. I never knew of but one John Engleman in this county in
                    '61. There were three other Englemans, bearing the name of John, one was John J.
                    Engleman, and the other two were named John B. Engleman, each. No John Engleman
                    voted there, so far as the Poll Books show, at either of the elections referred
                    to in my previous annswers. (P. 3). I see the name of Wm. F. Smith, who lived at
                    Greenville, where there was a precinct and who lived four miles further from the
                    Court House than John Engleman lived, recorded on the Poll Book as having voted
                    at the Court House Precinct, at that election. There may be others, but I do not
                    recognize the names of any others whose residences at that time I can remember
                    as being as far away from Staunton, the Court House Precinct, as John Engleman
                    lived. The Court House Poll Book of the election of Feb. '61 shows that John B.
                    Engleman, Peter F. Engleman, D. Engleman, John Engleman and John J. Engleman
                    voted at said Court House Precinct at said election. And at Middlebrook Precinct
                    at the same election Wm. D. Engleman voted. At the election held May 23rd, '6l
                    at the Court House Precinct, the Poll Book shows that John B. Engleman, Peter
                    Engleman, Jr., David Engleman, John Engleman and John J. Engleman voted. At the
                    same election Wm. D. Engleman voted at Middlebrook Precinct. I have not examined
                    the record of votes of the election of Feb. '61, further than the Middlebrook
                    and Court House Precincts. I have examined the record of votes of all the
                    precincts in the county at the May election, and I do not find the name of John
                    Engleman on any of the poll books except as already stated. (P. 4). My
                    information is that D. or David Engleman, was John Engleman's brother. The names
                    of D. Engleman, and John Engleman appear so recorded on the Poll Book one
                    immediately following the other. I was Asst. or Deputy Clerk from '54 to '64. I
                    was then elected to the office of the Clerk in '64 and have been elected to the
                    office of the Clerk in '64 and have been continuously elected every six years
                    since down to the present time, with the exception of a short time in '66, I
                    think, elected by the people of the county. I am acquainted with a very large
                    majority, if not all, of the voters in the Staunton or Court House Precinct, as
                    well as with their residences and occupations.</p>
                <p>The poll books in Staunton and Middlebrook were kept with accuracy and are
                    correct. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>At the date referred to '61, John B. Engleman son of Geo. Engleman, lived lived
                    at Staunton. And John B. Engleman son of Peter Engleman lived about four miles
                    West of Staunton. Staunton was the voting place of both of these men. There was
                    but one John B. Engleman appeared on the Poll Book of Staunton, or Court House
                    Precinct, at that election. There was no person to my knowledge by the name of
                    John Engleman, whose regular voting place was Staunton. Only one John B.
                    Engleman appears on the Poll Books of the election of May '61. (P. 6). At each
                    of these elections at Staunton there appears upon the poll books one John
                    Engleman, and one John B. Engleman. I have already stated that I believed the
                    books accurate, and I still believe them to be so. I find, in one instance,
                    however, the name of a voter, Mr. Bagby, with the omission of the middle letter
                    of his given name, or christian name, and his first name mis-spelled. His name
                    is Shapley N. Bagby, and it is recorded simply Chapley Bagby. Again I notice the
                    name of John K. Wood, which should be John K. Woods. Also the name of James P.
                    Bryan, appears, which should be James B. Bryan. Old Mr. John Engleman, was not a
                    person who travelled about a great deal; and unless other business called him I
                    hardly think it <orig reg="probable">probably</orig> that he would have left his
                    Precinct, Middlebrook, to have travelled eight or nine miles for the purpose of
                    voting. A middle letter of either one of the John B. <orig reg="Englemans"
                        >Engleman's</orig>, could have been made an omission of, but cannot speak of
                    that of my own knowledge. Knew John Engleman from two years previous to the war
                    to his death. My first information as to John Engleman's reputation, as to
                    loyalty to the U.S., was gathered with reference to Mr. Engleman and several
                    others in his neighborhood during the war, and afterwards. He was always opposed
                    to the Government of the U.S. Heard him express himself to that effect since the
                    war. Know he was generally regarded so by the people of his immediate
                    neighborhood during the war.</p>
                <p>RE-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>At the Court House Precinct, at election Feb. 4th, '61, there were cast 807
                    votes; very few omissions in this poll book, or inaccuracies in names recorded,
                    discover none, except as stated in my cross-examination. Knew names,
                    occupations, and residence of the majority of them. (P. 8). When I first came to
                    the name of Thos. C. Coleman, I thought it a mistake,, and ought to be Thos. E.
                    Coleman. On reflection became satisifed that the poll book was right. Met with a
                    similar incident and experience in another case,, except I am not now entirely
                    satisifed, whether Coleman's name is Thos. C. or Thos. E.. Consideration of
                    these names I think pretty well illustrate the care and accuracy with which I
                    examined the poll book. I kept the poll book at the Court House Precinct at May
                    election in '61, It is in my hand writing. Both the name of John Engleman, and
                    John B. Engleman apear on that book. (P. 9). I hardly think I would have left
                    out the middle letter of one John B. Engleman, when two John B. <orig
                        reg="Englemans">Engleman's</orig> voted., but am not <orig reg="infallible"
                        >infalible</orig>. The votes recorded by me were announced by an officer or
                    crier and as announced were entered on the poll book. The voting was viva voce.
                    The clerk who kept the poll book at the Court House precinct, Feb. 4th, '61. Mr.
                    Arnowl was considered a very good clerk, liable to make very few mistakes. (P.

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Estate of John Engleman, dec'd, vs. The United States. No. 6817--Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>This claim is for stores and supplies, valued at $1262., alleged to have been
                    taken from the decedent near Middlebrook, Augusta Co., Virginia, about June 6,
                    1863, by United States troops. It was rejected by the Commissioners of Claims on
                    the ground of disloyalty.</p>
                <p>The brief of the evidence, prepared by the claimant's counsel, errs on the side
                    of over-accuracy, inasmuch as it recites <hi rend="underline">everything</hi>,
                    making no distinction between hearsay, opinion, and competent testimony.
                    Statements as to how a claimant <hi rend="underline">said</hi> he voted, or how
                    the witness <hi rend="underline">thinks</hi> he voted, such as were made by the
                    witnesses in this case, are inadmissible and should have been omitted.</p>
                <p>In the testimony taken in 1871, the late claimant stated that he did not vote for
                    the Ordinance of Secession. The Commissioners reported, however, that he did so
                    vote, and found him disloyal on that account.</p>
                <p>The Treasury Department having reported in 1892 that a list of voters for the
                    ordinance of secession in County, Virginia, contained the name of John Engleman,
                    testimony was taken in 1894 in order to show that there was more than one man of
                    that name in the county.</p>
                <p><hi rend="underline">Fauber</hi> stated as to this, "There were three bearing the
                    name of John Engleman that I knew. All three were qualified voters; one lived in
                    the Middlebrook neighborhood, another in Hebron Church neighborhood, and the
                    third one at Staunton."</p>
                <p><hi rend="underline">Beard</hi> stated, "I only knew of two, though [I] heard of
                    a third one. The claimant John Engleman lived near Middlebrook, and the other
                    one, John <hi rend="underline">B</hi>. Engleman, lived at Staunton."</p>
                <p>The statements of <hi rend="underline">Helms</hi> and <hi rend="underline"
                        >Carwell</hi> agreed with that of Beard as to there being a John Engleman,
                    (the late claimant) at Middlebrook, and a John <hi rend="underline">B</hi>.
                    Engleman at Staunton. Fauber was not asked whether any of the three to whom he
                    referred had middle names, no counsel being present in behalf of the defendant.</p>
                <p>Subsequently the Treasury Department reported that the Augusta County list showed
                    that John <hi rend="underline">B</hi>. Engleman, John <hi rend="underline"
                    >J</hi>. Engleman, and John Engleman had all three voted for secession in
                    Augusta County, and in consequence the testimony of William A. Burnett was taken
                    for the <orig reg="defense">defence</orig>. He had kept the official poll book
                    in the Court house precinct at the secession election in May, 1861, and as court
                    clerk had been its custodian ever since. He stated that as deputy clerk from
                    1854 to 1864, and as court clerk ever since, except for a short interval, he
                    was, and had been in 1861, acquainted with most if not all the voters in the
                    Court House precinct, and with their residences and occupations. He knew John
                    Engleman, the late claimant, who lived near Middlebrook, as also John J.
                    Engleman and two men named John B. Engleman, but he never knew of but one John
                    Engleman. David Engleman was his brother. The poll book of the Court House
                    precinct for the election of May, 1861, showed that David Engleman, John
                    Engleman (the latter immediately following the first), Peter F. Engleman, John
                    B. Engleman and John J. Engleman had voted there. The Middlebrook precinct poll
                    book showed that William D. Engleman had voted there, but no others of the name
                    of Engleman. The poll books for the election of February, 1861, have precisely
                    the same names, except that of Peter Engleman, Jr., instead of Peter F.
                    Engleman. John-- Engleman could have voted at Middlebrook if he had wished, it
                    being nearer his home than the Court House voting place. John Engleman voted for
                    secession. The poll-books of the Court House and Middlebrook precincts were
                    carefully kept and the witness believed them to be accurate, though on a careful
                    investigation he had detected four errors in the 807 names on the Court House
                    book. The poll-book for the Court House precinct at the election of February 4,
                    1861, was kept by the then court clerk, a very careful man.</p>
                <p>It is submitted that this testimony is practically conclusive to the effect that
                    John Engleman, the late claimant, voted for secession. The only possible chance
                    to the contrary is that the second John B. Engleman, who lived four miles away
                    from Staunton, was of age in 1861 (which is not proved) and voted, and that the
                    witness Burnett, who kept the poll-book, omitted to write down the middle
                    initial. A public officer cannot be <hi rend="underline">presumed</hi> to have
                    made a mistake, but on the contrary must be presumed to have done his duty
                    properly until the reverse is proved. Moreover the testimony of the witness
                    Burnett is that of a careful methodical man, and his hand-writing, even at his
                    present age of 58, is remarkably clear and clerkly.</p>
                <p>That the late claimant (who did not vote at Middlebrook, in February and May
                    1861, though he usually did so) should have come with his brother to vote at the
                    Court House precinct, is thoroughly natural. On such momentous occasions a man
                    would naturally go where he would meet the greatest number of his acquaintances,
                    and talk over the questions of the day with them. The late claimant was only 50
                    years old at the time, and while he may not have been in the habit of traveling
                    much, there is nothing to suggest any improbability in his having voted at the
                    Court House. He lived eight or nine miles away, but the witness referred to
                    another man, living four miles farther off than Engleman did, who yet came to
                    the Court House to vote instead of going to the nearest precinct.</p>
                <p>Against this practically conclusive testimony from the official record stands the
                    solitary word of the late claimant himself that he did not vote for secession.
                    It is evident either that his mind was failing when he gave this testimony or
                    that he yielded to the temptation of interest. The Commissioners, with much less
                    exact evidence before them <add hand="h1" place="inline">than now exists,</add> controvert his statement,
                    did not believe him, and there can be no reason why the court should do so now.</p>
                <p>In other respects the testimony of the claimant's witness is in general favorable
                    to loyalty, but Burnett, the court clerk, stated, "He [Engleman] was always
                    reputed by people of his neighborhood as opposed to the goverment of the United
                    States. In fact I have heard him express himself to that effect since the war:
                    and I know he was generally regarded so by the people of his immediate
                    neighborhood during the war".</p>
                <p>As the people of Augusta County have elected Burnett to the responsible position
                    of court clerk every six years beginning with 1864, it is evident that he
                    commands their confidence, and as his position since 1854, when he became deputy
                    clerk at about 18 years of age, has made him exceptionally well acquainted with
                    the people of the county, his unhesitating statement as to Engleman's disloyal
                    reputation and expression of disloyal sentiments carries great weight. Were
                    there no evidence whatever about the vote for secession, the court could
                    scarcely find Engleman loyal in the face of the direct statements of such a man
                    as Burnett, and it is clear that with the conclusive evidence as to the vote
                    there can be no question as to the finding to be made.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that the poll books referred to by Burnett appear to have
                    been before the counsel for both parties when his testimony was given, and that
                    no objection was made by claimant's counsel to the giving of testimony as to the
                    contents of the poll-books. Should the court, for any reason, desire to have
                    certified copies put in evidence, this can of course be done.</p>

                <p>Jacob F. Engleman, <abbr expan="Administrator">Adm'r.</abbr>, John Engleman,
                    Deceased vs. The United States No. 6817 Cong.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in May 1895.</p>
                <p>WM. D. HEMP testifies: Farmer; age 65; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not interested
                    or related. I remember the election held in Augusta Co., May 23rd, 1861. On that
                    day I was in Middlebrook in this county. I saw John Engleman on that day. He was
                    in Middlebrook. (P. 1). It was about nine o'clock in the morning, I suppose, I
                    first saw him. I talked with him there about three or four hours after I first
                    saw him. He told me he was going home from there while I was talking to him. He
                    told me that last of our conversation that he was not going to vote He said he
                    could not vote the way he wanted to and he was not going to vote the secession
                    ticket.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I did not vote at all. I did not vote because I always voted the Union ticket,
                    and was not going to vote the secession ticket Can't tell how many times I voted
                    the Union ticket. There was a vote taken to send me to the convetion. I voted
                    the Union ticket then. It was Union or secession. I voted for the Union man to
                    go down there. They went, and when they came back, it was reported that the
                    Union men would <add hand="h1" place="inline">not</add> be allowed to vote; if you did not vote the
                    secession ticket you would not be allowed to vote at all. If you did not vote
                    the secession ticket you would be considered a Union man, and if the south
                    gained its independence they would run you out. At that time the old whig party
                    was called the Union party. That is why I say I always voted the Union ticket.
                    (P. 2). I had a child about a month old, who died in the spring of '53. Had
                    another child to die after that, think it was in '62. Dr. McChesney attended the
                    first one that died; and Dr. Abrelius, McChesney &amp; Dunlao attended the
                    last one. I was sick at the same time, and during the war there was so much
                    demand for physicians they had to take turn about in attending my family. Don't
                    remember what persons were in the room the day I was born, don't remember that
                    far back. I remember seeing the claimant and conversing with him as stated,
                    because it was the year that the war broke out. I was not in favor of the war,
                    and it was war times and there was right smart excitement. We had no particular
                    conversation, except talking about the election and voting, and some other
                    business. I know <orig reg="our">out</orig> first conversation occurred at Nine
                    o'clock, because I know very well I was not in Middlebrook at 8 o'clock It was
                    after 8 o'clock when I left home, and I know I could not have been there at 8
                    o'clock. I looked at the clock before I left home, and can give you the reason
                    why I did. The reason why I did that my brother came to my house and was talking
                    about voting, and he did not want me to go and were talking about voting, and he
                    did not want me to go and were setting in the house talking, and I asked him if
                    he was going. (P. 3). He said he was not because they would not allow him to
                    vote the Union ticket. I told him I was going up there to see and if they didn't
                    I would not vote; and during the time we were talking the clock struck eight. I
                    started after that. Guess it was sometime about 12 o'clock when I next saw him,
                    can't tell. Staunton is not quite 12 miles from Middlebrook.</p>
                <p>Q. How do you know that Mr. Engleman, the claimant had not risen early, say 4
                    o'clock, come to Staunton and voted, as he chose, and returned to Middlebrook by
                    9 o'clock at which time you say you first saw him, and in this way have avoided
                    any personal comment upon his vote by his neighbors particularly by yourself in
                    whose presence he had acted differently from the manner he voted in Staunton, as
                    shown by the poll books, or perhaps came to Staunton after he left you, saying
                    he was going home?</p>
                <p>A. I can't tell you that. I was not with him all the time during the day, except
                    when he was in Middlebrook. I don't know except by what his son said.</p>
                <p>I don't know that the claimant did anything to betoken his sympathy with the
                    Confederacy. He was an independent man and could live without Confederate
                    sympathy There were enough Union men where he lived for him to associate with
                    and he did not do anything for the Confederacy, except what he was forced to
                        do<orig reg=".">..</orig> I was not there all the time. Don't know whether
                    he furnished anny meals or lodging to the Confederate soldiers or not. He did
                    not sell them anything I know. Whatever they got they pressed (P. 4). I have a
                    claim against the Govt. I don't expect any of the <orig reg="Englemans"
                        >Englemen's</orig> to testify in my case. They don't know much about it, I
                    don't think. I cast my vote for the Union candidate, Lawyer Geo. Baylor. (P. 5).</p>

                    Not interested or related. I am the same Jas. E. Beard, whose deposition was
                    heretofore taken in this case. I was at the election in Middlebrook, on May
                    23rd, 1861. I saw the claimant at Middlebrook on that day, talked with him. It
                    was not earlier than 10 o'clock in the morning, perhaps 11. Somewhere along
                    there. He just remarked to me, a man can't vote his sentiments I am not going to
                    vote at all. I am going home. I did not see him after that on that day. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I have not a claim against the Govt. In just thinking over it I recollect it very
                    well now the date I saw Mr. Engleman at Middlebrook. I don't know how it was I
                    did not remember it on my previous examination. I have thought of it often
                    since. Talked about it. There was no one else at Middlebrook on that day that
                    used similar expression of feeling. I can't say positively now, but I think
                    there was others at Middlebrook who opposed secession. I was opposed to
                    secession. I voted at Middlebrook on that day. I did not vote against it. They
                    did not want to take my vote. At last I voted for it, and I would have been
                    considered a Union man, and become unpopular if I had not, though that was not
                    my sentiment. I had two brothers of the same sentiments with mine. (P. 7). One
                    of them did not vote at all. My brother voted for secession at last. I don't
                    remember if any one vote against it in that precinct, but I think there were
                    some. I had this conversation with John Engleman right in front of the building
                    in which they were taking the votes. We were on our feet. There were others
                    around, but no one taking notice of our conversation, so far as I know. If there
                    was I don't know it now. Don't remember any other similar conversation. I
                    remember the above conversations, because we talked it over afterwards, next
                    day, I think. He said he went away from me and went home, and did not go back to
                    the polls at all. I don't think this conversation was later than 11 o'clock.</p>
                <p>J.W. ENGLEMAN testifies: Age 53; farmer, son of claimant. I was not present at
                    the election at Middlebrook on May 23rd, '62. I was living with fater at the
                    time. He resided from Middlebrook about 2-1/2 miles. He was absent from home
                    that day, think he left home a little after sun up. He returned home a little
                    after dinner. Might have been a little after 12 o'clock (P. 9). He took the road
                    leading in opposite direction from <orig reg="Staunton">Stanton</orig>. After
                    his return home, I remember he stated that he wanted to vote the Union ticket,
                    but they refused to record his vote</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I did not vote that day, not old enough. I was 53 years old the 1st of July
                        1895<orig reg=".">..</orig> I was at home when father rode away on the
                    morning of the election. (P. 10). I think I was in the house when he was making
                    preparation to go. I was in the yard, and saw him go off, the road goes by the
                    front yard. (P. 10).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>This testimony would seem to remove all doubt as to Mr. Engleman's voting for
                    secession. And also materially strengthens the proof of loyalty throughout the
                    war. He certainly had no feelings in common with the secession movement. On the
                    contrary was fixed and zealous in support of the Union cause throughout the war.</p>

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Estate of John Engleman, dec'd vs. The United States. No. 6817--Cong.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>As shown by the defendant's original brief, the <orig reg="defense"
                    >defence</orig> rests on evidence of disloyalty in two respects, viz., first,
                    voting for secession, and, second, disloyal expressions and reputation.</p>
                <p>In regard to the first point, the <orig reg="defense">defence</orig> has shown
                    conclusively that <add hand="h1" place="inline">the name of</add> John Engleman is recorded as that of a
                    voter in favor of secession at Staunton, in Augusta County, Virginia, that there
                    was no other John Engleman, without any middle name, in that county, and that
                    John B. Engleman and John J. Engleman are also recorded as having voted, so that
                    the name "John Engleman" could not have referred to either of them, as suggested
                    in the claimant's first brief.</p>
                <p>Since the defendant's original brief was filed, the claimant has taken the
                    testimony of William D. Hemp, James E. Beard, and J.W. Engleman. Hemp states
                    that he saw John Engleman at Middlebrook on the day of the election at about 9
                    A.M., and again about three or four hours afterwards. Beard states that <orig
                        reg="he">nhe</orig> saw him at Middlebrook on that day not earlier than 10
                    A.M., or perhaps 11. James W. Engleman, the decedent's son, states that his
                    father rode away from home on the day of the election, May 23, 1861, a little
                    after sunrise, taking the road leading in the opposite direction from Staunton,
                    and that he returned after dinner, "it might have been a little after 12
                    o'clock."</p>
                <p>The above statements, which are all that the witnesses say that can be regarded
                    as admissible as to this point, seem to be introduced in order to prove a sort
                    of alibi--to show that John Engleman was not in Staunton the morning of the day
                    of election. They relate however, solely to the morning, and do not cover the
                    afternoon. Even if they proved conclusively (which they are very far from doing)
                    that John Engleman was not at Staunton in the morning, they would not be held to
                    impeach the record of his vote, because, as he lived only eight or nine miles
                    from Staunton (see Burnett's testimony), he had plenty of time left to go there
                    and vote in the afternoon. The witness Beard states that he himself did not vote
                    'till nearly night, when he voted for secession, apparently under persuasion.</p>
                <p>Even as to the morning the alibi is not conclusively established. Engleman left
                    home soon after sunrise, i.e. probably about five o'clock. The fact that he did
                    not start out on the direct road to Staunton is no proof that he did not
                    eventually go there. The precise hour or hours at which he was seen at
                    Middlebrook are not positively certain, but he seems to have had time enough to
                    have gone to Staunton before he was seen at Middlebrook.</p>
                <p>In addition to the statements above quoted, these three witnesses also gave
                    hearsay evidence (under objection by the defendant's attorney) of Engleman's
                    declarations that he had not voted up to that time, and that he would not vote
                    for secession. While this may perhaps be admissible evidence of loyal
                    sentiments, it is manifestly inadmissible as evidence on the question of the
                    vote. In answer to one of defendant's attorneys' objections, claimant's local
                    attorney states that these declarations were admissible as <hi rend="underline"
                        >res gestae</hi>, but it is well established that delcarations are only
                    admitted as <hi rend="underline">res gestae</hi> when "illustrative of a
                    particular litigated act", but never to prove or disprove such act. Wharton on
                    Evidence, 3rd ed. secs. 259, 266. For instance, if John Engleman be proved to
                    have voted for secession, his contemporaneous denials of having done so or
                    having intended to do so might be admissible, though hearsay, to show that he
                    deceived his neighbors, or that he changed his mind; while if he be proved not
                    to have voted, such hearsay statements might be admissible to show that he was
                    willing to have the fact known, or that he acted in accordance with a fixed
                    intention. Such hearsay statements cannot possible be admitted, however, as
                    themselves <hi rend="underline">proof</hi>, in any degree whatever, that
                    Engleman did not vote. Until the main fact, <add hand="h1" place="inline">viz., that he refrained from
                        voting,</add> be proved to have occurred, it cannot be shown to have had any
                    attending circumstances-any <hi rend="underline">res gestae</hi>-about it, such
                    as would warrant the admission of hearsay statements.</p>
                <p>Even were this otherwise, even if these statements could be admitted as
                    contemporaneous evidence, they would not disprove the contemporaneous official
                    record of what John Engleman did, not only because such record commands more
                    confidence than the memory of men who testify after an interval of thirty-four
                    years, but also because these statements were made in the morning or about noon,
                    and there remained the afternoon in which Engleman could have voted, just as
                    Beard did.</p>
                <p>Beard's statement of what Engleman told him <hi rend="underline">the day
                    after</hi> the election is, in any view of the case, hearsay pure and simple,
                        <orig reg="because">becauss</orig> it was after an "opportunity for
                    concoction." (Wharton on Evidence, sec. 265.)</p>
                <p>Then it is remembered that there was no other John Engleman (without a middle
                    name) in Augusta County, that he had voted at Staunton at the election in
                    February, 1861, that the name occurs directly after that of his brother David,
                    that John B. and John J. also voted, and that the general accuracy of the
                    poll-book is testified to, the new testimony cannot possibly be regarded as
                    impeaching, even in the slightest degree, the contemporaneous official record of
                    John Engleman's vote for secession.</p>
                <p>As to the second point, that of expressions and reputation, the new testimony
                    adds very little to that already in the case. It cannot possibly weigh against
                    Mr. Burnett's testimony, referred to in the original brief, that Engleman's
                    reputation was that of a disloyal man, and that he expressed himself as such to
                    the witness.</p>

                    Honorable Court for a new trial of the issue of the loyalty of John Engleman,
                    now deceased, for the reasons stated in the accompanying brief.</p>

                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>
                <p>This claim is for stores and supplies, valued at $1262., alleged to have been
                    taken from the decedent at Middlebrook, Augusta Co., Virginia. It was rejected
                    by the Commissioners of Claims because the poll book of the secession election
                    held at Staunton showed that the decedent had voted for secession, although in
                    answer to the interrogatories he had stated that he did not vote at that
                    election. Loyalty was found by this court January 13, 1896.</p>
                <p>It was in evidence that the Staunton poll-book showed John Engleman, John B.
                    Engleman, and John J. Engleman as having all voted to ratify the ordinance of
                    secession, and further that there was in the county but one John Engleman and
                    but one John J. Engleman. Several of the witnesses also knew of but one John B.
                    Engleman, a man living at Staunton, but the defendant's witness, Burnett, stated
                    that there were <hi rend="underline">two</hi> men of that name, and the other
                    being a son of Peter Engleman, and living about four miles west of Staunton.</p>
                <p>Upon this state of the evidence, claimant's counsel contended that the name of
                    John Engleman on the poll-book must have been meant for the second John B.
                    Engleman, with the middle initial accidentally omitted, and the court appears to
                    have adopted this view.</p>
                <p>Counsel for defendant has now secured and filed the deposition of this second
                    John B. Engleman, who says:</p>
                <p>My father's name was Peter Engleman. My father lived, at and after my birth, four
                    miles west of Staunton on the Middlebrook road, in Augusta county, Virginia. I
                    moved from my father's in 1845 to near <orig reg="Waynesboro"
                    >Waynesborough</orig>, Augusta county, Virginia. In about 1850 or 1851 I moved
                    to near Marshall in Saline county, Missouri.......I was not in Augusta county,
                    Virginia on either of the above occasions (the election for delegates to the
                    convention and the election on the ratification of the ordinance). I did not
                    vote in either of these elections.</p>
                <p>An affidavit from Mr. Burnett, admitting his error, has also been secured and
                    filed.</p>
                <p>As the evidence now stands, therefore, there was but one John Engleman, but one
                    John B. Engleman, and but one John J. Engleman in Augusta County at the date of
                    the election, and no other Engleman named John. Each of these men are recorded
                    as having voted for secession, and there is no evidence whatever that the
                    poll-book, which was an official record, the election being <hi rend="underline"
                        >viva voce</hi>, was not properly kept. <add hand="h1" place="inline">On the contrary, its general
                        accuracy is testified to.</add> The John Engleman who is recorded as having
                    voted for secession <hi rend="underline">must</hi>, therefore, have been the
                    decedent, and it is submitted that a new trial should be granted.</p>

                <p>John Engleman, vs. The United States No. 6817 Cong.</p>
                <p>MOTION TO VACATE ORDER OF COURT GRANTING A NEW TRIAL IN THE ABOVE ENTITLED CAUSE.</p>
                <p>The claimant by his attorney, Gilbert Moyers, moves this honorable Court to
                    vacate order of May 4th granting a new trial in the above entitled cause on the
                    question of loyalty, for the reason that said motion was remanded to the law
                    calendar the date of filing the same, Mar. 24th, 1896. And on the 23rd of April,
                        <hi rend="underline">Thursday</hi> of the week, not a day upon which cases
                    upon the law calendar are considered, Mr. Binney, the attorney for the defense,
                    it seems from the docket, came into Court and submitted this motion in my <hi
                        rend="underline">absence</hi>, &amp; in the absence of any brief on my
                    part and without any notice to me that he was to take any such action. This
                    proceeding I regard as in the <hi rend="underline">highest degree
                    unprofessional</hi>. It is well known to the attorneys for the defendants in my
                    cases, and the Court is doubtless well aware of the same that I have been busily
                    engaged for the past few weeks at the Capitol in my efforts to secure justice in
                    the way of an appropriation for my clients in cases that have been allowed by
                    the Court.</p>
                <p>The delay on this motion has certainly not been unreasonable on my part less than
                    one month, notwithstanding my engagements elsewhere.</p>
                <p>I have written for affidavits and expect them daily by which together with the
                    testimony on file, I expect to make it appear to the Court that there is not the
                    slightest foundation in point of fact for defendant's motion.</p>
                <p>In view of the foregoing, and believing that I have been dealty <hi
                        rend="underline">unjustly</hi> and <hi rend="underline">unfairly</hi> by, by
                    defendant's counsel, and that I am entitled to be heard on this motion as well
                    as being afforded an opportunity for filing counter affidavits, I respectfully
                    submit that the order of Court granting a new trial in this case should be
                    revoked and defendant's motion remanded to the law calendar where it properly
                    belongs.</p>
                <p>In this connection I will add that I have never in all my practice in the Court
                    of Claims taken advantage <add hand="h1" place="inline">of the absence</add> of an opposing counsel in
                    submitting my case<del hand="h1">s</del>. And in all candor I submit that such a practice
                    should not obtain where an attorney is attentive to his business.</p>

                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the war.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected the claim because they were not convinced of

                    $1262.00</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners of Claims, in Aug. '71.</p>
                <p>JACOB ENGLEMAN testifies: Age 22; residence Augusta Co., Va. Farmer. I was
                    present when the property mentioned in the claimant's petition was taken. Did
                    not see them all taken. The articles I saw taken were taken in '64 from the farm
                    of the claimant, by Gen. Crook's men. He was an officer of the U.S. Army. I
                    suppose it was by orders of Gen. Crook that the property was taken. The property
                    was now removed by soldiers. The property was removed to the camp on the
                    adjoining farm. I saw some of the property after it was carried to the
                    encampment. (P. 8). Suppose all the property <orig reg="mentioned">e
                    mentioned</orig> in the claimant's petition was taken for the use of the army.
                    Claimant complained to Gen. Crook &amp; Gen'l. Averill, Gen. Crook, gave the
                    claimant an order to get his horses. He got one, the other he did not get. No
                    receipt asked for or given. The property was all taken in the day time from two
                    o'clock until dusk. when the property was taken the army was encamped on the
                    adjoining farms about a mile distant, under Gen. Crook, who was under the
                    command of Gen. Hunter, they <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> until next morning.
                    There had been no battle before the property was taken.</p>
                <p>The horses were in good condition, young horses, two of them worth about $175
                    apiece, and I think the other was worth $200.00 (P. 9). They were all three
                    young and in good condition.</p>
                <p>There were five heads of cattle taken, I think they were worth $50 apiece.</p>
                <p>There was clothing taken for spies as mentioned in the <orig reg="claimant's"
                        >claimants</orig> petition which I suppose was worth $45. There was four and
                    a half barrels taken, worth about $7.50 a barrel. I saw one box of tobacco taken
                    containing sixty two or three pounds. We were selling it at that time at 40 cts.
                    a pound. I saw some soap taken, don't know how much, nor do I know how much it
                    was worth. I saw some vinegar taken, don't know how much, nor how much it was
                    worth. Some bags and a wagon cover were taken. Don't know what the bags were
                    worth. Don't know the valuation of the wagon cover. Saddle bags and a bridle
                    were taken, but I did not see them taken. I don't know what they were worth. (P.
                    10). There was no harness taken that I know of. There was between nine and ten
                    bus of grain taken. I don't know whether it was corn or oats. Corn was worth a
                    dollar a bushel, oats 35 cts<orig reg=".">..</orig> All the property mentioned
                    was taken by Gen. Crook's men. think the property mentioned in the claimant's
                    petition was worth what he has charged the Government for it.</p>
                <p>I think the property described in each item was taken for the actual use of the
                    army, and not for individual officers or soldiers<orig reg=".">..</orig> Taken
                    in consequence of some necessity for the articles taken, which necessity
                    justified the officers in taking them. Think the Govt. should be required to pay
                    for it. I think it was taken by order of officers who had the authority to take
                    it or order it to be taken. A soldier told me he had orders to take it, (P. 11).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court, in May 1897.</p>
                <p>JAMES E. BEARD testifies:- farmer; age 75; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not
                    interested or related. The farm that the claimant lived on June 6, '64, adjoined
                    the one I lived on and the distance between his house and mine was less than
                    half a mile. (P. 2). About that time Gen'l. Crook's command of the U.S. occupied
                    the place first. Then after that Gen'l. Averill's troops of the same army came.
                    Gen'l. Crook's soldiers took claimant's horses and cattle. There were four
                    horses taken, but he got one back. He got an order from Gen'l. Crook for the
                    return of one of the horses, and got it back. He got an order from Gen'l. Crook
                    for the return of all his horses but could only find one. Crook's headquarters
                    on the night of the day those horses were taken was at James Brittain's place
                    about two miles from John Engleman's. The three horses that were not recovered
                    were worth from $150 to $200 each, at that time in U.S. Money, or greenbacks. As
                    near as I can remember now there were five cattle taken. Suppose they were worth
                    $35 or $40 in U.S. currency. My father had sold one a few days before that for
                    $40 in gold which was no better than those taken from Mr. Engleman. Horses and
                    cattle taken during the day time, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. (P. 3).
                    Horses and cattle taken for the use of the army. At least they used them for the
                    army. That was what they did with what they took of ours. Officers present and
                    ordered the taking. I saw them driving them out of the field.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINED.</p>
                <p>They were driving them out of the field when I saw them taken, horses and cattle
                    together. There was no firing there them. I did not hear a gun fired that day. I
                    was at home on my own place, in the lane at the end and next to the Engleman
                    farm, and where I could see the field in which the horses and cattle were. It
                    was half a mile or less between the houses, and the field was between the
                    houses. I was within less than half a mile of the horses and cattle when they
                    were driven out of the field. It might have been a little more than 300 yards,
                    but not much more, I think. I recognized the officer by his uniform. He went
                    cross our field to the Engleman field, to the soldiers who were driving them up.
                    There were two or three officers together, I could tell them by their uniform.
                    (P. 4). The field from which they took the horses was 300 yards from where I was
                    standing at the time. It was the same field, and the same time they took the
                    horses and cattle. John Engleman had sole control of the horses and cattle, and
                    I suppose they belonged to him. I know that one horse was recovered by order of
                    Gen'l. Crook, because I saw the horse when he brought it back. I saw the order
                    too.</p>
                <p>W.H. BEARD testifies: age 42; residence Augusta Co., va., Not interested or
                    related. (P. 5). On the 6th of June '64 I lived half mile from the claimant. I
                    lived with my father James E. Beard, who has just testified in this cause. About
                    that time John Engleman's place was occupied by the troops of the Federal army,
                    Gen'l. Crook in command. I did not see any of claimant's property taken, but
                    have every reason to believe his property was taken. He had three horses taken.
                    I think I was too young <orig reg="then">them</orig> to know or put value on a
                    horse. I can't say of my own knowledge how many cattle were taken Horses and
                    cattle taken sometime late in the evening. Can't state the hour. By evening, I
                    mean in the afternoon. I was at my father's house at the time I was not with my
                    father in person when they were taken. (P. 6). I remember very distinctly
                    hearing it spoken of the next morning. (P. 6 &amp; 7).</p>
                <p>ITEMIZED SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>HORSES.</p>
                <p>3 horses..........$550.00</p>
                <p>J. Engleman testifies was present when all the property was taken. Did not see
                    all taken. Saw the articles taken in '64 by Gen'l. Crook's men. Gen'l. Crook
                    gave the claimant an order to get his horses. Got one, but did not get the
                    others. (P. 3). Horses in good condition, young, values 2 at $175 each, the
                    other $200. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>Mr. Beard testifies that Gen'l. Crook's soldiers took claimant's horses. Four
                    taken, but he got one back. Gen'l. Crook gave an order for the return of all,
                    but only could find one. The three horses taken were worth from $150 to $200
                    each in U.S. Money. (P. 6). Horses taken about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
                    Officers present. (P. 7). Was about 300 yards from where the horses were taken.
                    Saw them taken.</p>
                <p>W.H. Beard testifies that claimant had 3 horses taken by Gen'l. Crook's command.
                    Taken in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>This testimony justifies a finding for 3 serviceable horses. The Govt. at that
                    time was paying at least $150 for such horses. The finding should be for</p>

                <p>Jacob Engleman testifies to the taking of five head of cattle. Values them at
                        $50<del hand="h1">$</del> each. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>Jas. E. Beard testifies to five cattle being taken. Values them at $35 or $40 in
                    U.S. currency. Says that his father sold one a few days before for $40 in god,
                    which was no better than those taken from Mr. Engleman. (P. 6). The cattle were
                    taken for and used by the army. Officers present ordered the taking Saw them
                    driving the cattle out of the field. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>W.H. Beard testifies the cattle were taken late in the evening, in the afternoon.
                    Can't say of my own knowledge how many were taken. (P. 8).</p>

                <p>This claim is for stores and supplies valued originally at $1262.00, but now
                    reduced to $612.00, alleged to have been taken from the decedent near
                    Middlebrook, Augusta County, Virginia, in June, 1864. It was rejected by the
                    Commissioner of Claims on the ground of disloyalty.</p>
                <p>Loyalty was found by this court, January 13th, 1896.</p>
                <p>The testimony in the case appears to be fairly set out in the claimant's brief,
                    but it is to be noted that only two witnesses testify to facts within their own
                    acknowledge. The testimony of William H. Beard is admittedly based altogether on
                    hearsay, and was objected to on that ground at the time it was taken.</p>
                <p>The property is alleged to have been taken by the orders of General Crook and
                    General <orig reg="Averill">Averell</orig>, but the decedent made no attempt to
                    secure evidence in support of his claim, in the way of vouchers or receipts, and
                    the testimony fails to show what regimental officers actually took the property,
                    so that it is impossible for the Government to make any special inquiry among
                    its officers as to the facts of the case. The Treasury Department's report on
                    file states that an examination of the accounts of all officers known to have
                    been on duty in the Quartermaster's or Commissary's Departments, in the vicinity
                    of of Augusta county, Virginia, during June, 1864, furnish no evidence that any
                    property whatever was taken from the decedent. Whatever doubt may exist as to an
                    actual taking, for the use of the Army, of the precise quanity of property
                    alleged, must, therefore, necessarily weigh against the claimant.</p>
                <p>Although the claim has been somewhat reduced; the prices charged are still above
                    those usually allowed by the court. While a number of miscellaneous articles
                    have been stricken out of the claim, the item for tobacco has been retained,
                    although it was not a part of the ration, and therefore cannot have been taken
                    as stores and supplies.</p>

                <p>III. That no payment has ever been made for said stores and supplies or any
                    portion thereof.</p>

                <p>STATEMENT OF CASE.</p>
                <p>The claim in the above-entitled case for supplies, or stores, alleged to have
                    been taken by or furnished to the military forces of the United States, for
                    their use during the late war for the suppression of the rebellion, was
                    transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims of the House of
                    Representatives on the 15th day of Feb. 1889.</p>
                <p>On a preliminary inquiry the Court, on the 13th day of January, 1896, found that
                    the person alleged to have furnished the supplies or stores, or from whom they
                    were alleged to have been taken, was loyal to the Government of the United
                    States throughout said war.</p>
                <p>The case was brought to a hearing on its merits on the 3d day of March, 1898.

                    direction, appeared for the defense and proptection of the interests of the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <del hand="h1">The claimant in his petition makes the following allegations:</del>
                </p>
                <p>The claimant in his petition in substance alleges:-</p>

                    Virginia, where decedent resided during the late war of the rebellion; that on
                    or about the 6th day of June, 1864, the United States forces under Generals
                    Crook and Averill took, by proper authority, from said decedent, and
                    appropriated to the use of the Army, quartermaster stores and commissary
                    supplies, <add hand="h1" place="inline">which</add> in part <add hand="h1" place="inline">are</add> as follows 3 horses, $450; 5

                    Virginia, during the late war of the rebellion, by the military forces of the
                    United States, for the use of the Army, stores and supplies of those above
                    described, which at the time and place of taking were reasonably worth the sum
                    Five hundred and ten dollars ($510), for which no payment appears to have been
                    made.</p>
