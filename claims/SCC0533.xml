                <p>Samuel D. Stover filed this claim in 1879 for $158, claiming Union forces under
                    General Hunters Command took one horse and two sheep in 1864. Samuel was a
                    carpenter and farmer during the war. In 1864 he went crossed over into Union
                    territory and stayed until after Lee surrendered in 1865. His two sons also fled
                    to the Union. The commission allowed $116.</p>

                        expan="Virginia">V<hi rend="super">a.</hi></abbr> in June 1864 by

                    Hunters Army. There were two Soldiers who took the property. My son, <abbr

                    away &amp; the sheep were carried off on horses. The property was taken in

                    asked for. The property was taken in the day time. The army was encamped at
                    Staunton 2 or 3 days. They left the day after they took my property. The
                    property was all in good condition when taken.</p>
                <p>Item #1 I saw a horse taken 5 years old, worth $150.</p>

                        >Co</abbr>. I am a farmer. I have known the claimant 12 or 13 years. I lived
                    near him during the war. Saw him frequently, &amp; talked to him about the
                    War. He was always opposed to the war, &amp; said if it ever came his time
                    to go in the army that he should leave the State &amp; go north. I always
                    regarded him as a union man. He was so regarded I think by his neighbors. I
                    don't know that he ever did anything for the Confederate Government. Nor for the
                        <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr><abbr expan="Government">Govt</abbr>.
                    He left <abbr expan="Virginia">V<hi rend="super">a</hi>.</abbr> &amp;
                    went north. I think he went to keep out of the Army. Don't know that he was ever
                    threatened because he was a Union man. Don't know that he owned any <abbr
                        expan="Confederate">Confed</abbr>. bonds, or to support Confederate credit.
                    Don't know how he voted on the ordinance of secession. Don't know that he ever
                    gave any information to Union Officers as to the movement of the Confederate
                    Armies. I think he was in the Union lines when <abbr expan="General"
                    >Genl.</abbr> Lee surrendered. I don't know what he would have done had the
                    South gained its independence. And further this deponent saith not.</p>

                        >Co</abbr>. I am a farmer. I have known the claimant 15 years, lived near
                    him during the war, saw him often, &amp; talked to him about the war. He
                    always said he was a Union man, &amp; that before he would go in the army he
                    would go North. I heard men say they saw him in the North. Don't remember what
                    year he went North, he came back after the surrender of <abbr expan="General"
                        >Genl.</abbr> Lee. I regarded him as a Union man, &amp; so far as I know
                    he was so regarded by his neighbors. I don't know that he was threatened because
                    he was a Union Man. I don't know how he voted on the ordinance of secession. I
                    don't think he voted at all. Did nothing to support the credit of the
                    Confederate States. Don't know that he gave any information to the Union
                    officers in regard to the movements of Confederate Armies. I, the witness, was a
                    Union man all the War, according to my opinion. I don't think he could have

                    am a farmer. I am the son of the claimant. I was present and saw one horse
                    &amp; two sheep belonging to the claimant taken. I was ploughing the horse
                    on the farm of the claimant. The sheep were in the next field, on the same farm.
                    It was during the War I don't remember the year. They were taken by <abbr
                        expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> Soldiers. Don't know whose command they
                    belonged to. One soldier took the horse &amp; thereafter sheep. My Father,
                    Mother &amp; Sister saw them taken. I don't think any officer was present.
                    The horse was led away, &amp; the sheep were carried on the horses before
                    them. The property was taken in the direction of Staunton, where the Federal
                    army was encamped about 3 1/2 miles distant. No complaint was made, &amp; no
                    receipt was asked for &amp; none given. The horse was in good order. Was 4
                    or 5 years old, was worth $150. good riding &amp; work horse. The soldier
                    who took him said he must have him, wanted him to ride. I saw the horse taken.
                    Saw two sheep taken, were grown sheep &amp; fat were worth $4.00. My Father
                    is the sole owner of this claim &amp; has never been paid for it. And
