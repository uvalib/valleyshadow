<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Amelia McCray,
                            September 14, 1871, Claim No. 6898</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Amelia McCray claimed the value of three horses. The Commissioners rejected her
                    claim, designating her behavior during the war as neutral, rather than truly
                    loyal to the United States Government. There is some dispute in the historic
                    record as to whether McCray lived in Augusta County or Rockbridge County.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Mrs M<sup>c</sup>Cray has resided in Virginia over 40 years. Had
                    three sons in the Confederate Army. She made for one of her sons a suit of
                    clothes as she says to keep him from freezing. She says her sympathies were with
                    the Union. She felt she wanted nothing to do with the war any way.</p>
                <p>One witness James M<sup>c</sup>Cutchan 66 years of age is called
                    to prove her loyalty. He has known her from childhood &amp; as far as he
                    knows she did not take an active part either way in the war. Did nothing for
                    either army. "Was regarded as opposed to the war being a lady she said nothing
                    either way."</p>
                <p>Giving the utmost force to her testimony Mrs M<sup>c</sup>Cray
                    at best was but a neutral, a very fair record for a Virginia lady with three
                    sons in the Confederate Army. It is not enough to entitle her for compensation
                    for property taken for the use of the Union Army. The claim is rejected.</p>
