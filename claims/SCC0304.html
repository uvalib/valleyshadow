<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of John Bumgardner,
                            September 5, 1871, Claim No. 9293</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                John Bumgardner filed this claim September 5, 1871, for $210, claiming that Union
                    troops confiscated 1 horse with saddle and bridle, 1 patch of corn, and 1 hog
                    from his farm in 1864. A witness, Humphrey Ware, testified that 2 horses were
                    taken; one sheet within the claim includes a second horse in a varying claim of
                    confiscated property: 2 large bay horses, both 5 years old, one valued at $250
                    and one at $200; also, 40 bushels of corn, valued at $40.00. Why the lists vary
                    is unclear. The claim was disallowed December 9, 1872.

                    Deputy Marshall. I have known Mr. Jno. Bumgardner about 10 years. I lived about

                    strong Union man &amp; loyal to the U.S. Government. He was threatened with
                    arrest during the War for expressing Union sentiments. I have never heard from

                    the country before he would go in the Army that he believed the was to be unjust

                    told me he never wanted the South to gain its independence that he could not
