<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claim rejected.</p>
                <p>The claimant voted for Secession - says "he was scared into it" "as they told me
                    if I did not they would punish me severely." He does not tell who said so, or
                    where, or give any data by which we can ascertain whether he tells the truth or
                    not. - It is not by such general assertions, which can neither be proved or
                    disproved by investigation, that such claimants can be allowed to establish
                    duress.</p>
                <p>He says he served six weeks as a guard to guard wagon trains - says he "was
                    forced in" nothing more.</p>
                <p>There is little in the Evidence to show loyalty - nothing sufficient to
                    counterbalance this Evidence.</p>

                    soldiers under the command of Genl Hunter in June 1864</p>

                    was led</p>
                <p>9 Witness says - I think they were removed to Staunton</p>
                <p>10 Witness says - The soldiers said when they took them that they wanted them for
                    Cavalry horses I did not see them after that</p>
                <p>11 Witness says - There was complaint made but it did no good they said they
                    wanted to mount Cavalry</p>
                <p>12 Witness says - No receipt was given and none asked for</p>
                <p>13 Witness says - The horses were taken in the daytime about nine o'clock they
                    were taken boldly</p>
                <p>14 Witness says - When the property was taken the army was encamped at Staunton
                    Virginia under the command of Genl Hunter. The encampment was three miles from
                    where the property was taken they remained there about a week there had been a
                    battle at Piedmont a few days before the property was taken. I did not know the

                    amount the Government has been charged in the petition</p>
                <p>19 Witness says - I think they were taken for the use of the Government because
                    the officers and soldiers said so and I suppose they were needed by the
                    Government or else they would not have taken them</p>
                <p>22 Witness says - I believe they were taken for some purpose so useful and
                    beneficial that the Government ought to pay for them and Further the deponent

                    them or ordering them to be taken. The horses were in good condition when taken

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>James A. Scott</b>
                <p>I am acquainted with Lewis Defenbaugh who lives on Stribling road about 4 miles
                    from Staunton I worked for him several months during the war cutting cord wood
                    on shares the second year after the war commenced. He was then about 48 years of
                    age and a Union man.</p>
                <p>I talked with him frequently at this time he seemed a very quiet man and a great
                    man to his own business he had at this time two sons at home about 16
                    &amp; 18 years of age. I don't think they were either of them in the war at
                    any time he expressed himself freely as a Union man. He was opposed to owning
                    slaves. I do not know of his voting for or against Secession. I never knew of
                    his doing any thing for either side during the war a kind of
                    neutral man.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>L. V. Hupman</b>
                <p>I am a farmer and during the war lived about 3/4 of a mile from him Lewis
                    Deffenbaugh have known him all my life. I know him to have been a Union man if
                    there ever was one. There is no question about that. I have heard him talk often
                    he was opposed to the War. He done all he could to keep his son out of the
                    Confederate Army, who was old enough to do service the second year of the War.
                    And when he came home on furlough he concealed him and sent him through the
                    Union lines. They had him in the home guard a while, that he could not help. He
                    done all he could to any one that wanted to keep out of the Confederate Army. he
                    lost some horses by the Union troops I do not know how many, but I know he lost
                    some horses not less than two. I did know how many but I have forgotten. I never
                    knew of his doing anything for the Confederates. I was in the Confederate Army,
                    and always regarded him as a strong Union man and he was known as such by all of
                    his neighbors.</p>

                <p>Claims Commissioner</p>
                <p>Gentlemen</p>
                <p>I herewith transmit the Statements of L.D. Hupman and James A.
                    Scott pertaining to the claim of Lewis Deffenbaugh 11202</p>
                <p>From all the information that I am able to obtain Mr.
                    Deffenbagh was considered a Union man during the war, a hard working 
                    farmer illiterate but honest in all respects he frequently
                    expressed himself opposed to the war. He was in the Home Guard for a
                     time but went reluctantly and was compelled to go. he had a son in the
                    Rebel Army against his will, and the very first opportunity he had he aided him
                    to escape over the Union lines. Maj. P.M. at his place
                    says of him "I know Lewis Defenbaugh well knew him during the war and lived near
                    him he was a timid man but a Union man he refused to sell me some clover and at
                    one time during the war because I was a rebel, he voted for the ordinance of
                    secession through the influence of Col. Geo. Baylor who was
                    elected as a Union man to the convention he told him that it would be the best
                    thing to do to prevent war he can not read or write but is a very sensible man
                    and there is no better citizen"</p>
                <p>The evidence given by Mr. Fuller was in connection with the names of several
                    other claimants on the printed list Defenbaughs case then not
                    being placed in my hands for investigation.</p>
                <p>Very Respectfully Yours</p>
