<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Peter Sheets,
                            September 1, 1871, Claim No. 1729</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Sheets' claim for horses, livestock, and farm implements was disallowed by the
                    Claims Commission in 1878, despite evidence of his loyalty to the United States,
                    because they ruled that the Union Army had not taken Sheets' property for
                    strictly military use. Sheets appealed this decision in 1901, when the
                    Congressional Court of Claims ruled in his favor. Sheets' son George died while
                    serving in the Union Army. In one of the briefs filed by Sheets' attorney,
                    witness William Houff stated that Sheets' neighborhood, Mt. Sidney, was known as
                    "the little United States" due to its high population of Unionists.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>The property in this claim was taken or burned in the fall of 1864 at the time of
                    the Sheridan raid or the "Burning raid" as it is more frequently called. Horses
                    cattle sheep &amp;c were not then taken for the "use of the Union army" but
                    for the purpose of devastating the Shenandoah Valley. The animals were mostly
                    sent to Maryland or Pennyslvania &amp; sold &amp; the proceeds paid into
                    the Treasury. Our jurisdiction is limited to "stores or supplies" <u>taken</u> for the use of the Army or navy. Ordinarily use
                    by the army is strong presumptive evidence that the property was taken for such
                    use. But where it appears positively that it was not taken for use, we have
                        no jurisdiction.the fact that some part of it was subsequently
                        used for army purposes does not conver jurisdiction. The claim is
                    disallowed.</p>

                    Augusta Co. Va. My occupation is a farmer. I was present when a Mare was taken
                    from the Claimant, and afterwards they took four other horses and two sucking
                    colts. The soldiers were in the field and took them away.</p>
                <p>4<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The property mentioned the
                    Claimants petition was taken in September 1864. They were taken by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Talbert's and Col. Wilson's soldiers and
                    Officers. I was among them and talked with them. I think they belonged to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Sheridan's command.</p>
                <p>7<sup>th</sup> Witness Says The property was taken by the
                    soldiers belonging to Gen<sup>l</sup>. Talbert's command.</p>
                <p>8<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The horses were carried off by
                    Officers and soldiers</p>
                <p>9<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says They were removed down the
                    Shenandoah Valley. I did not see any of the property after its removal</p>
                <p>10<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The Horses were taken for the Use
                    of the Army. I did not see the property afterwards.</p>
                <p>11<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says, There was no complaint made that
                    I heard</p>
                <p>12<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says It is my opinion that there was a
                    receipt given for one horse taken. I do not who the Officer was There was no
                    receipt asked for, for the others that I know of.</p>
                <p>13<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says The property was taken in the day
                    time, between 1 and 5 Oclock in the afternoon. The property was taken publicly.</p>
                <p>14<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says When the property was taken the
                    Army was encamped about One mile from claimants The had
                    been there not more than two days. There had been two little skirmishes. I knew
                        Gen<sup>l</sup>. Talbert and talked with Col. Wilson.</p>
                <p>15<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says, The Horses were fine condition.
                    One bay Mare 14 hands high, about 6 years old. She was worth $150.00. One bay
                    horse 17 hands high, 4 years old, worth $160. One light bay horse, about the
                    same age, worth $150.00. One bay Mare about 6 years old 16 hands high, worth
                    $150 or $160. Two bay Colts, worth each $50. There were sheep taken I dont know
                    how many. They were worth $4.00 a piece. I suppose the Saddle was worth $20.00
                    it was <u>new</u>. I know nothing of the bridles.</p>
                <p>19<sup>th</sup> Witness says, I think the property was certainly
                    for the use of the Army.</p>
                <p>20<sup>th</sup>. Witness Says, I am satisfied that it was taken
                    for the benefit of the Army, but do not know their necessities.</p>
                <p>22<sup>d</sup> Witness Says, I believe that the property was so
                    necessary and useful, as to justify and require the Government to pay for it.</p>
                <p>23<sup>d</sup> Witness says, My opinion is that there was orders
                    given to take property needed by the Army. Further this deponent saith not.

                    loyalty to the United States, and he was so regarded by his neighbors, both
                    friend and foe. I never knew him to do anything for the United States Government
                    except sending three sons into the Union lines, one of whom entered the Union

                <p>I believe he was too loyal to the United States Government to have established

                    reside in Augusta Co. Va. I am a farmer. I have known the claimant for 23 years.
                    I live on an adjoining farm and saw him nearly every day I never doubted his
                    loyalty to the Union Cause, and he was so regarded by his neighbors.</p>
                <p>He aided the Union cause by sending his sons into the Union lines and one of them
                    died as a soldier of the Union Army.</p>
                <p>He was too loyal to the United States Government, to be regarded as at all loyal
                    to the Confederacy had it been a seperate

                <p>Sir:-The reason that I did not hear the other witness in the case of Peter
                    Sheets, vs. the U.S. Gov<sup>t</sup>. was that the witness
                    called at my Office, when I was very ill, in October last. I was being treated
                    at the time by three Physicians but I will take the testimony of Mr Cline before
                    I leave this part of the State, as this is the first opportunity I have had to
                    do so since I was sick.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Peter Cline</b>
                <p>U.S. Commissioner's Office, Harrisonburg, Virginia</p>
                <p>In the matter of the Claim of Peter Sheets of Augusta County, Virginia, for
                    re-imbursement for supplies taken by the Federal forces during the late
                    Rebellion.</p>
                <p>Peter Cline, a witness introduced by Claimant, being under solemn affirmation,
                    deposeth and saith-</p>
                <p>During the late war, in the Fall that the Federal General Sheridan occupied the
                    Valley of Virginia, his forces took from Peter Sheets, two horses and two colts.
                    I do not know the age of the horses, but they were very fine mares, and the
                    colts were standing by them, and were not weaned. I saw them in the possession
                    of the Federal troops, the soldiers who had them, passed right through my yard
                    with them. I should think that before the war, such mares besides the colts,
                    would have been worth from $135 to $140 each, the colts before the war would
                    have been worth some $40 each. I knew the mares and colts, and recognized them
                    as Peter Sheets' property. I do not know whether there were any officers with
                    the soldiers or not, but suppose there were, as the whole army was moving, and
                    the stock was within one hundred yards of the main body of the army.</p>
                <p>And further this deponent saith not. Peter Cline</p>

                <p>Sir I Drop you a fiew lines in answer to your note which I
                    was very glad to receive from your hands.</p>
                <p>I have bin paying out about $25 Dollars to different
                    persons to see to my Claim and they flattered me with the idea that it was all
                    right. I cant see why it was that my Claim has bin
                    Suspended. I can prove by any amount of persons that would be required to show
                    my loyalty. I never did Vote the Democratic Ticket Nor for the ordinance of
                    Secession I harbored Soldiers during the war untill
                    they could get a chance to get through the lines to the Federal Troops. I had
                    but three Sons, And one of them went west before the war And Enlisted in the 69
                    Ind. Volenteers &amp; Died in prison. My
                    Second Son also Volenteered, But never was in
                    service. My 3 and last son i sent through the lines before
                    he was 16 yrs old to keep them from fighting for the Confederacy. So mutch confidence did i have in the
                    Union that i thought they would not disturb a Union man. I
                    never have voted any other Ticket but the Republican Whilst many others whos claims have bin paid have
                        bin Voting with the Rebels ever since the war. I
                    will be very glad for any information in Regard to getting my claim Reinstated I
                    can get any number of Witnesses that is needed to prove my loyalty. And to prove
                    that the Federal Troop got the property for which

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                
                <b>Peter Sheets</b>
                <p>Peter Sheets being introduced and first duly sworn by Special Commissioner, W.B.
                    Harrison, deposes as follows.</p>
                <p><u>To question numbered 72 the witness answers</u>. I was
                    present when some of the property was taken. I saw the bay mare and the light
                    bay horse, marked as items No. 1 &amp; 2 under the hand
                    of "Quantities and Articles" in my claim, and also the two saddles &amp;
                    bridles therein mentioned as item No. 7, actually taken.</p>
                <p><u>To question No. 73 the witness answers</u> No property was
                    taken in the night time, nor secretly.</p>
                <p><u>To question No. 74 witness answers</u> Complaint was made
                    by me to Col. Lowell, and he said I ought to let the horses go to put down the
                    rebellion, of course after this I couldn't do anything, but went home. It was in
                    Staunton that I saw Col. Lowell, having gone there for the purpose of seeing
                    some officer for protection.</p>
                <p><u>To quesiton No. 75, the witness answers</u> A paper was
                    given me by Col. Lowell when the bay mare was taken, in Staunton, I dont know
                    what it was, I lost it, dont know where or when, no other vouchers or receipts
                    or papers were ever asked for by me, nor were any ever given to me by
                    any one. The paper that Col. Lowell gave me, was given voluntarily by him,
                    without my asking for it. I did not ask for receipts or vouchers for the
                    property because I dident know that they would give
                    them, I dident know that I had a right to ask for
                    them. All the property that was taken (excpet the bay mare, taken in Staunton)
                    was taken at the time my barn, straw tick, fences &amp;c were all on fire, I
                    thought the house would burn up too, my wife was an invalid &amp; I had to
                    take care of her, as well as to try &amp; protect the house from the fire. I
                    might have seen the rest of the stock mentioned in my claim as item numbers 3,
                    4, 5 &amp; 6, taken, if it had not been that I was too much employed in
                    protecting my house from the fire, for they were all taken about that time.</p>
                <p><u>To question No. 76, the witness answers</u> No payment has
                    been made for any property charged in this claim. Nor for any property
                        chargedtaken at the same time as the property charged
                    in this claim. No payment has ever been made for any property taken from me
                    during the war. The property in this claim nor any part of it, has never been
                    included in any claim heretofore presented to Congress or any other authority
                    whatever.</p>
                <p><u>To question No. 77, the witness answers</u> The property
                    was not taken by troops camped in the vicinity. I think they were camped near
                    Browns gap. The came from that direction, Brown's gap is about 12 miles from my
                    place maybe a little more. I dont remember whether there had been a recent
                    battle or skirmish or not.</p>

                    the property mentioned in the claim of Peter Sheets taken, but I did see, at the
                    time that Peter Sheets' barn was on fire, the two bay mares mentioned in items
                    number 3 &amp; 4, and the two bay colts mentioned in item No. 5 in
                    possession of the army, while passing my residence. These horses &amp; colts
                    were being driven along with a great number of horses cattle &amp; sheep. I
                    was well acquainted with the two mares &amp; two colts mentioned &amp;
                    am positive that they belonged to Peter Sheets. I dont know what became of them

                    the burning of the barns in the Valley and at the time that Peter Sheets' barn
                    was on fire, that I saw the mare in question, in possession of the army. 7<sup>

                    burning and carrying off property. It was a portion of his troops that had this
                    animal in possession at the time I saw it.</p>
                <p>As to the mare mentioned in item No. 4 and the two colts mentioned in item No. 5
                    The same facts apply to them in every particular that I have just given in

                    mentioned in item No. 4, I suppose was worth from $140 to $150. The two Colts

                <p>Peter Sheets, vs. The United States. No. 8118 Cong.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT OF THE CASE.</p>
                <p>This is a claim in favor of Peter Sheets, of Augusta county, Virginia, state at
                    $1926. It was presented to the Commissioners of Claims and was by them
                    disallowed because they were not convinced that the property was taken for the
                    use of the army.</p>
                <p>The claim was referred to this Court under the Bowman Act by the Committee on War
                    Claims of the House of Representatives March 2, 1891.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following evidence was taken under the rule of the Commissioners of Claims,
                    September 1, 1871.</p>
                <p>PETER SHEETS testifies as follows: I am 59 years old, I reside in Augusta county,
                    Virginia, I reside at the same place previous to April 1st, 1861. I am a farmer
                    by occupation. I resided at the same place from April 1st, 1861 to June 1st,
                    1865.</p>
                <p>I never passed beyond the military or naval lines of the United States and
                    entered the rebel lines. I never took an oath of any kind to the so-called
                    Confederate States.</p>
                <p>I took an amnesty oath after the close of the war, in Staunton, Va. I received no
                    pardon from the President. (P. 4 Record.)</p>
                <p>I never was directly or indirectly connected with the so-called Confederate
                    States in any capacity. I never held any office or place of trust, profit or
                    honor, clerkship or have any agency or employment of any kind whatever for or
                    under the so-called Confederate States. I never was in any capacity in the
                    military or naval service of the so-called Confederate States. I never was an
                    officer in the military or naval service of the Confederacy. I never furnished a
                    substitute for the Confederate army or navy. Never was in any department or
                    bureau of the Confederate Government. I never had at any time charge of any
                    stores or supplies, teams, wagons, vessels or other munitions of war for the use
                    of the army or navy of the Confederacy. I never was in any service or business
                    of any kind for the Confederate Government. I never furnished any stores or
                    supplies for the Confederate States. I never gave any information to any
                    officer, soldier, sailor or marine of the Confederate States. (P. 5 Record.)</p>
                <p>I never was engaged in the manufacture of munitions of war, clothing, boots,
                    shoes, harness or anything else for the use of the Confederate Army or Navy.</p>
                <p>I never was employed directly or indirectly in collection or impressment of any
                    article at all for the Confederate Government. I had no interest or share or
                    contracts with the Confederate Government, army or navy. (P. 6 Record.)</p>
                <p>I never was engaged in blockade running or illicit traffic. I never had any
                    interest in any article brought into or exported from any part of the so-called
                    Confederacy. I never left the county of Augusta, Va., between the 19th of April
                    1861 and June 19th, 1865. I never was the owner or part owner of any vessel or
                    boat used in navigating the ocean or any waters of the Confederacy. (P. 6
                    Record.)</p>
                <p>I never was arrested by the Confederate Government but was threatened with being
                    hung. I never was arrested by the United States Government. (P. 6 Record.)</p>
                <p>The Confederate Government took a wagon, and grain generally, in 1861 and 1864,
                    for use of the Confederate Government. I was paid for the wagon and some corn in
                    the currency of the Confederacy. (P. 7 Record.)</p>
                <p>I was threatened with being cut to pieces for my Union sentiments. I never was
                    injured on account of my Union sentiments.</p>
                <p>I sent three sons into the Union lines; one was in the Union army and one in the
                    Home Guard in Indiana. I sent a wagon and two horses, with beds and bedding. I
                    had a son in the Union army and a son in the Indiana Home Guards. I gave them
                    money.</p>
                <p>I did nothing at all to support the credit of the Confederate States. I never
                    gave any aid or comfort to the Confederacy. I had no sympathy for it. I never
                    was engaged in making raids into the United States from Canada nor in the
                    destruction of the commerce of the United States. I never was engaged in holding
                    in custody any prisoners of war held by the Confederate States. I never was a
                    member of any society for the prosecution or persecution of any person on
                    account of his loyalty to the United States. I never was a paroled prisoner of
                    the United States. I never received any pass from the Confederate Government or
                    any of its authorities. I was under no disability and have held no office since
                    the war.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the rebellion I sympathized with the Union. I always rejoiced
                    when I heard the Union army was coming for then I thought we would be free. I
                    did not vote on the ordinance of secession after its adoption. I went for the
                    Union and against the State. (P. 8 Record.)</p>
                <p>I solemnly declare that from the beginning of hostilities against the United
                    States, my sympathies were constantly with the Union and that I did nothing of
                    my own free will and accord to assist the rebellion, and was willing at all
                    times to aid the Union cause so far as my power, means and the circumstances
                    would permit. (P. 9 Record.)</p>
                <p>SIMON P. STOVER testifies as follows: I am 48 years old, I reside in Augusta
                    county, Va. I am a farmer by occupation. I have known the claimant about 40
                    years. (P. 13 Record.)</p>
                <p>I saw claimant frequently during the war and talked with him about the war and I
                    never had a doubt of his loyalty to the United States and he was so regarded by
                    his neighbors, both friend and foe. I never knew him to do anything for the
                    United States Government except sending his three sons into the Union lines, one
                    of whom entered the United States Army and died in it. He never did anything for
                    the rebel government except what he was forced to do. I belive he was too loyal
                    to the United States Government to have established any claim of loyalty to the
                    Confederacy, in fact I do not believe he would or could have remained in the
                    South had it maintained a separate government. (P. 13 Record.)</p>
                <p>DAVID ALEXANDER testifies as follows: I am 58 years old, I reside in Augusta
                    county, Va. I am a farmer. (P. 14 Record.)</p>
                <p>I have known the claimant for 23 years. I live on an adjoining farm and saw him
                    nearly every day. I never doubted his loyalty to the Union cause and he was so
                    regarded by his neighbors.</p>
                <p>He aided the Union cause by sending his sons into the Union lines and one of them
                    died as a soldier of the Union Army. He was too loyal to the United States
                    Government to be regarded as at all loyal to the Confederacy had it been a
                    separate government. (P. 14 Record.)</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case was a farmer who resided in Augusta county, Virginia,
                    during the war of the rebellion. He was regarded as a Union man by both friend
                    and foe and his Unionism was so pronounced that it left no room for doubt. His
                    own testimony bears all the impress of truth and honesty and the evidence of two
                    of his neighbors who had known him many years prior to the war and lived near
                    him during that time unreservedly and in the strongest terms to claimant's loyal
                    acts and reputation.</p>
                <p>Claimant had three sons that he sent into the Union lines and furnished them with
                    money and supplies. One of these sons joined the Union army and died in the
                    service; the other belonged to the Homes Guards in
                    Indiana.</p>
                <p>The Confederate Archives show one voucher signed by claimant for a very small
                    amount, but this is fully explained in claimant's testimony and he is in nowise
                    responsible for stores impressed from him by the Confederates.</p>
                <p>It is respectfully submitted that the evidence establishes claimant's loyalty
                    beyond a doubt.</p>

                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                <p>Peter Sheets, v. United States. No. 8,118, Congressional.</p>
                <p>Defendants Brief on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>The testimony of loyalty in this case is confined to three witnesses which are
                    the claimant himself, Samuel P. Stover, and Daniel Alexander.</p>
                <p>The claimant resided in Augusta County, Virginia, during the war, and was a
                    farmer by occupation. He claims that he never took an oath of any kind to
                    support the Confederacy, but took an oath after the close of the war and was not
                    pardoned by the President. That he was not employed directly or
                    indirectly with the Confederate States in any capacity, and that he never served
                    in any any capacity in either the military or Naval service of the said
                    Confederate States, nor was he employed in any service of any kind for them. He
                    also claims that he did not furnish any stores or supplies to the Confederates,
                    nor gave any aid or information to them during the war. He answereds
                    the followingusual questions concerning his loyalty in the
                    usual manner. He saidys that he never left his county between the
                    19th of April, 1861, and 1865. He also says that he was never arrested by the
                    Confederate Government of<sup>or</sup> the United
                    States Government, but claims to have been threatened with hanging by the
                    Confederate Government. (This testimony as to this threat is wholly
                    uncorroborated by the testimony of any other witness.)</p>
                <p>He also said that he was threatened to be cut to pieces for his Union sentiments.
                    (This threat as testified by the claimant is also un-corroborated.) The claimant
                    claims that the Confederate Government took some property from him in 1861 to
                    1864, and that he was paid for the same in the currency of the Confederacy.
                    (page 7, record). He states that he sent three sons into the Union lines, one of
                    whom was in the Union army, and one in the Home Guards, and one in the Indiana
                    Home Guards, and that he sent a wagon and two horses with beds and bedding, and
                    that he gave his son who was in the Union Army and the one in the Indiana Home
                    Guards money. He also claims that he sympathized with the Union at the beginning
                    of the Rebellion and that he did not vote on the ordinance of Secession after
                    its adoption, and that he rejoiced at the approach of the Union army. This
                    testimony comes from the mouthes of witnesses Stover and Alexander.</p>
                <p>Stover claims to have seen the claimant frequently during the war, and that he
                    never doubted his loyalty to the United States, and he was so regarded by his
                    neighbors both "friend and foe". That he never knew him to do anything for the
                    Union cause except to send three sons into the army, one of whom died in the
                    army; that he never did anything for the Rebel Government except what he was
                    forced to do.</p>
                <p>Witness Alexander's testimony is to the effect that he has known the claimant for
                    23 years and lived on the adjoining farm, and saw him every day, and never
                    doubted his loyalty, and that he was regarded as loyal to the United States by
                    his own neighbors. That he aided the Union cause by sending his sons into the
                    Union lines where one died as a soldier in the Union army. It is to be regretted
                    that additional witnesses had not been called by the claimant to establish his
                    loyalty, as while the testimoy testimony of the two who have been
                    called, tends very strongly to support this contention, yet these questions
                        while it is 
                        not
                    alwaysunsafe for the court to find loyalty upon
                    meagre testimony particularly where it is not shown that diligent search has
                    been made to obtain additional testimony, and that said search has been
                    unsuccessful. It would seem that two of the sons are still living, and yet
                    neither of them have been called to testify in his behalf.</p>
                <p>The claimant's counsel states that the voucher shown by the Confederate Archives
                    is fully explained in the claimant's testimony in a favorable light to claimant,
                    but this is very largely inference, in as much as beyond the statement that the
                    Confederate Government took the wagon and bedding in '61 and '64 from claimant
                        and that he was paid for the same in the currency of the
                    Confederacy, the said explanation does not seem to explain. any particulars
                        which are given. It may have been that this man was loyal to the Union
                    cause and the testimony tends to establish his loyalty as suggested before.
                        However It is to be questioned whether the testimony adduced is
                    in all respects sufficient to establish his loyalty to the United States
                    Government throughout the war, beyond a doubt or question.</p>
                <p>We are suretold that one of the sons of the claimant
                    entered the Union army, and one, as he said, the Home Guard of Indiana, but he
                    does not state as did witnesses Stover and Alexander, that said son died in the
                    Union army, the company or regiment in which said son enlisted and fought is not
                    given, nor is the testimony of the two remaining sons whom the
                    claimant says he sent into the Union lines, and it does not anywhere appear in
                    the testimony that either of these sons are not living.</p>
                <p>We submit that the court is entitled to the fullest possible information and
                    testimony obtainable bearing upon all of the above matters, and that nothing
                    should be left to inference, but that loyalty should be proven by sufficient and
                        satisfactorly testimony.</p>

                <b>Claimant's Reply to Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. No. 8118 Congressional.</p>
                <p>Peter Sheets, vs. The United States.</p>
                <p>Claimant's Reply Brief on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>Counsel for the United States submits a brief in which he practically admits the
                    loyalty of the claimant but contends that the evidence is rather meagre on some
                    points. Since counsel has filed his brief the depositions of four witnesses have
                    been taken which explain clearly and fully all objections raised by counsel for
                    the Government. The substance of the new evidence is as follows:</p>
                <p>Charles H. Sheet testifies: That he was living at home
                    with his father (Peter Sheets) at the commencement of the war and lived with him
                    until October, 1864, when he sent him to Indiana; that his father gave him the
                    money to go with and told him to get away from the Confederacy and said if the
                    condition of his mother's health would permit he would go there also. That his
                    brother D.S. Sheets went out there a year or more before witness did and that
                    the claimant assisted him in the same way; that his oldest brother George went
                    out to the same state just before the outbreak of the war. That he came back in
                    August after the surrender in 1865, D.S. Sheets came back in February, 1866, and
                    his brother George died from illness contracted while in the Union army; that
                    the last named was a volunteer in the 89th Ind.Inft. (P. 36 Record.)</p>
                <p>That his father freely expressed his opinions in favor of the Union and would
                    have gone away from the Confederacy had it not been for the crippled condition
                    of his wife. That he was a known Union man throughout the neighborhood and that
                    his sentiments became stronger as the war progressed; that he never did anything
                    to aid the Confederate cause.</p>
                <p>Dr. William Bell testifies: That he is not related to the claimant and no
                    interest in this claim; that he was well acquainted with claimant before and
                    during the war and saw him often during that period up to 1864 when witness
                    entered the Confederate army; that claimant was regarded as a Union man by all
                    his neighbors, Confederates as well as Union men; that claimant was loyal to the
                    Union during the whole war; that he did not hesitate to express his sentiments
                    and they all knew where he stood; that he lived within a mile and a half of him,
                    was his family physician for a number of years and talked to him frequently. (P.
                    38 Record.)</p>
                <p>William A. Houff testifies: That he is not related to claimant and has no
                    interest in this claim; that he was well acquainted with claimant during the
                    war; that he (witness) was a Union man during the war; that he saw claimant
                    frequently during that period and often talked to him about the war, its causes
                    and claimant always expressed himself strongly in favor of the Union and had
                    made arrangements to go west and stay within the Union lines but was prevented
                    on account of his wife's health; that claimant was a well known Union man and in
                    connection with some other Union men in that vicinity he was called "The little
                    United States"; that he grew stronger as the war progressed; that he was a
                    member of the United Brethren church and the members of that church were strong
                    against secession. That claimant sent his two sons, Charles H. and D.S. Sheets
                    out to Indiana and furnished them with the necessary money and supplies to get
                    there with. That both his Union and Confederate neighbors knew him to be a good
                    Union man. (P. 41 Record.)</p>
                <p>D.S. Sheets testifies: That he is a son of the claimant. That he lived with his
                    father until March 20th, 1863 when he went to Indiana and remained there until
                    the close of the war; that his father advised him to go; that he was young and
                    hardly knew what was best but his father made arrangements for him to go,
                    arranged for my guide through the lines and gave him money to pay his way; that
                    the claimant sheltered a number of people who sympathized with the Union; that
                    he took a young man by the name of Chris Peters and concealed him and he finally
                    escaped through the lines; that he helped his two brother, George and C.H.
                    Sheets, both of them going to Indiana; that C.H. Sheets returned to his home
                    sometime after the close of the war George D. Sheets died at Kokomo, Indiana, of
                    disease contracted while he was in the Union army; that witness was in the
                    Middletown, Indiana Home Guards, and did not return to his home until February,
                    1866.</p>
                <p>The balance of the evidence of this witness fully corroborates the other
                    witnesses as to his father's loyal reputation and his sentiments and opinions,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>On cross-examination witness says that his brother George D. Sheets, belonged to,
                    he thinks, the 69th or 89th Ind.Inft., Company E, and he thinks John E. Williams was
                    the captain; he says that this brother went to Indiana in 1861 just before the
                    lines closed and that he died in 1862. (P. 45, Record.)</p>
                <p>The evidence in support of claimant's loyalty filed before the Commissioners of
                    Claims was strong and conclusive, but was lacking in some details, for instance
                    the company and regiment in which claimant's son enlisted, and more definite
                    evidence in regard to claimant sending two other sons into the Union lines,
                    being the principal points raised by counsel for the Government. Four additional
                    witnesses have been called since counsel for the Government filed his brief, two
                    of them claimant's sons, and the objections raised have beene
                    explained in detail. Claimant sent three of his sons through the lines to
                    Indiana and furnished them with money and supplies for their trip; one of them
                    joined the Middletown, Indiana Home Guards; another volunteered in the 69th or
                    89th Ind.Inft. Co. E.
                    and died while in the service; the other two returned to their home in Virginia
                    after the close of the war. There appears to be no doubt whatever as to
                    claimant's loyalty to the United States throughout the war.</p>
