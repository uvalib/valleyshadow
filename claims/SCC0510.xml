                <p>Harriet Doom filed this claim in 1879 for $150, claiming the Union army took on
                    horse from her deceased husband Jacob Coffman in 1864 after the battle of the
                    Piedmont. Harriet was a 31 year old who had remarried to George Doom, a
                    Unionist, and resided near New Hope. The claim was disallowed due to her
                    deceased husband's disloyalty to the Union.</p>

                <p>I was the widow of Jacob Coffman Sr. He died in March 1869. He was a Union man. I
                    have <del hand="h1">four</del><add hand="h1" place="inline">3</add> children by Mr Coffman my first husband. Jacob

                    Henry 4 years old. My husband left a will but he named no Executor and Mr.
                    Samuel Kennedy qualified in May 1869 as Administrator. I think he was named as
                    executor in the will. He died not file this petition because he said he was a
                    southern man and wouldnt have anythin to do with it. I told him to make the
                    claim and he just laughed at it. I saw the mare charged taken. It was the day
                    after the Piedmont fight in June 1864, about 7 oclock in the morning. She was
                    hitched to a cherry tree not 5 yards from our house and a mar came in from the
                    road and took her out to a colonel who was waiting in the road about 100 yards
                    from my house, when he reached the <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr>, a saddle
                    and bridle was put on our horse and the Colonel got on

                    forwards in front of my house and she frequently neighed to come in. His army
                    was there several hours. It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon before they left. I
                    don't know the name of the Colonel. I don't know whether he belonged to a

                    My husband, myself and a step-grandson saw the horse taken. Noone else saw the
                    horse taken. My Grandson who was present then is now out in Kansas. It was a
                    dark bay with a blaze face about 7 years old, She was a tolerable large brute,
                    she was sound and a good beast too as ever lived. She was worth $150, at that
                    time, I got no receipt we did not ask for any, we were confused and scared, I
                    saw the Col on our mare. I knew he was some officer by his uniform, I know no

                    day after the Piedmont fight June 7th 1864. The Horse was hitched to a Cherry

                        >Co.</abbr> Va. I was intimately acquainted with Jacob Coffman the owner of

                    before and during the war. At that time when the vote was taken here as to the

                    know that before that time Jacob Coffman was very bitter on the abolitionists
                    and Rebupblicans at the North. he was in the habit of using very bitter language
                    about them, a while after the war began he seemed to change and my impression
                    was that he was in favor of the Union. I cannot State a Single act of his that

                <p>Harriet Doom the Claimant testifies that the horse for which claim is made
                    belonged to her husband Jacob Coffman. That the Horse was taken by a Federal
