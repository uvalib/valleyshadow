<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of James T. Quick,
                            February 25, 1873, Claim No. 7885</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                The Commissioners rejected Quick's claim for one horse because he provided
                    supplies to a Confederate army wagon maker for 5 months in 1863. Quick
                    successfully appealed this decision in 1896.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                
                <p>Mr Quick is about 43 years of age; a farmer residing in Augusta Co. Va. The
                    testimony relating to his loyalty is far from satisfactory. He opposed
                    secession, but after that there is very little to show that he adhered to the
                    Union cause. He certainly aided the Confederacy. The Confederates had wagon
                    shops at Staunton. Mr Quick was engaged for five months in furnishing materials
                    for these shops.</p>
                <p>The claim is disallowed.</p>

                    and assist the cause of the Union, or its supporters so far as my means and
                    power and the circumstances permitted.</p>

                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. I was on one side of the Middle river and they on other side. I had
                    my horse in the grass field. I could not see the field from my house.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. I suppose the horse was taken from the field, as I had put him in
                    the field that same morning. This was about the 12<sup>th</sup>
                    of June 1864. I did not know any one engaged. I suppose there were 100 in sight
                    of my house, at the time I saw my horse in their possession. They were riding
                    around in sight they remained about 4 or 5 hours.</p>

                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I do not know what use they made of my horse. I never saw the horse
                    afterwards.</p>

                    miles. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's Army was camped there, it had

                    Piedmont occured in the Sunday previous. I knew no officer connected with the
                    Army.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. It was a bay Mare, in very good condition. She was well broken to
                    the saddle and harness. She was six or seven years old, and of medium size,
                    sound every way. I never received any pay, and tried until now.</p>

                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. I saw them drive the horse to the bars of the field, and either
                    bridled or haltered him. They said we have got a good one this time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. The horse was taken the grass field, on the Thursday after the
                    Piedmont battle, in June 1864. There were a good many soldiers in the field, but
                    only 5 or 6 engaged in catching the horse. They only remained in the field a
                    short time.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5 Ans. There was no one present with me.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. I do not know whether there was an officer present or not.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7 Ans. The horse was driven to the bars, and there caught. All I heard said
                    was they "had got a good one this time."</p>
                <p>Ques. 8 Ans. The horse was led away, by soldiers whom I supposed were Cavalry
                    men.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. They started in the direction of Staunton. I did follow after them.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I do not know how they used the horse, I never saw the horse after
                    they left.</p>

                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. The horse was taken in day time, before 12 Oclock, probably about
                    11 Oclock A.M. The horse was taken boldly.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. There was no camp, nearer than Staunton that I know of, which is
                    about 7 miles. I did not know what company or regiment, but the Army was
                    commanded by Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter. They had been at Staunton
                    3 or 4 days, &amp; left I understood the day after taking this horse. The
                    Piedmont battle was fought on the Sunday previous. I did not know any Officer at
                    all.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. The horse was a light bay Mare, in fine condition. She was young. I
                    suppose five or six years old, in size a good medium. She was well broken and
                    moved finely. I think she was worth from $150 to $175. I never talked with
                    claimant about the value of the Mare.</p>

                <p>Answer to general question</p>
                <p>My name is Geo. W. White, my age 45 years residence near Verona, Augusta Co. Va.
                    occupation a farm laborer. I am not related to the claimant, and have no
                    interest in the claim. I was not present when the Mare of claimant was taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 2 Ans. I did not see them take the Mare from the field, but saw them have
                    her in possession, when I saw the Mare she was about 1/2 mile from the field.
                    There was I suppose 300 or 400 Soldiers together when I saw the Mare. There was
                    a Soldier riding her, he was bare back. I knew the Mare and could not have been
                    deceived. I was by myself at the time, and was not more than 10 or 15 steps from
                    her. The Company did not halt, I said nothing to them about the Mare. It was a
                    little after 12 Oclock in the day. This was in June 1864, and the Thursday after
                    the Piedmont fight. They were officers in command, I think there was one Major,
                    but no Colonel. I did not hear him say anything at all. I suppose they took the
                    Mare to Staunton. They were moving in that direction. I never saw the Mare after
                    they passed me in the road. I never heard of any complaint being made to any
                    one. I never heard of any receipt being given or asked for. There was no camp
                    nearer than Staunton about 7 miles. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter's

                <p>The Mare was a bright bay, about 6 or 7 years old of good size, and well broken.
                    She was a cheap Mare at $150. I never consulted the claimant as to her value.</p>

                    foregoing deposition.</p>
                <p>I have known the claimant 12 or 13 years, &amp; was intimate with him during
                    the War. I lived over 1/2 mile from him during the entire War. I saw him at
                    times every day in the week. I often talked with him about the War, he always
                    spoke in favor of the Union and against rebellion. I do not recollect any
                    particular language, but was very against the Confederates. He knew that I was a
                    Union man, I have often heard him speak in the presence of others with reference
                    to the War, and he was always the same thing. His loyal neighbors had full
                    confidence in him as a true Union man, I never knew him to contribute anything
                    to the United States Government or its Army, but I know that he did all he could
                    to keep men out of the Confederate Army, and help those Union men who were out.
                    From what I knew of the Claimant, he could never have produced any
                    testimony in favor of his loyalty to the South, had it gained its independence.</p>

                <p>Deposition of W<sup>m</sup>. A. Houff.</p>
                <p>This witness is the same examined as to taking of the property.</p>
                <p>Ans. to 1 general question</p>
                <p>I have known, the claimant for 25 years, and intimately during the War, we lived
                    about 3/4 of a Mile apart during the war. I saw him frequently, part of the time
                    every day, we conversed about the war a great deal, and he always was against
                    rebellion and in favor of the Union, he knew my sympathies were with the Union.
                    Sometimes there would be half dozen or more together and the claimant was
                    invariably the same. I have often heard him wish that the Union Army
                    would be victorious. He was regarded by his Union neighbors, as strictly a Union
                    man. I never knew him to do anything or the United States Government or Army,
                    but he aided the Union men who were hiding to keep out of the Confederate Army.
                    He could not have proven any loyalty to the Confederate Government or cause, in
                    fact I do not think he would have been allowed to stay in the South, had it been
                    successful.</p>

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1894-95.</p>
                <p>James T. Quick, vs. The United States No. 8810 Cong.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT:</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va., during the war.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim, and in their report to Congress
                    state:--</p>
                <p>"Mr Quick is about 43 years of age; a farmer residing in Augusta Co. Va. The
                    testimony relating to his loyalty is far from satisfactory. He opposed
                    secession, but after that there is very little to show that he adhered to the
                    Union cause. He certainly aided the Confederacy. The Confederates had wagon
                    shops at Staunton. Mr Quick was engaged for five months in furnishing materials
                    for these shops.</p>
                <p>The claim is disallowed".</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, March
                    23rd, 1892.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken in Feb. '73.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT TESTIFIES: Age 37; residence near Staunton, Va., Farmer. (P. 1). Resided
                    in Augusta Co., during the war, lived on rented land, did not change my
                    residence or business. Did not pass the lines. Never took any oath of any kind
                    to the Confederate states. Took the Amnesty oath at Staunton after the close of
                    the war in '65. Never asked for a pardon. Never connected with the civil service
                    of the Confederate states. Never held any office or place of trust, honor or
                    profit under the Confederate Govt. I was in the detail service of the military
                    service for five months in '63. My detail was to furnishh material for
                    Government wagon makers, shops in Staunton. I never was an officer or soldier in
                    the Confederate army. I never was in any state militia during the war. (P. 2). I
                    did not belong to any home guard, or vigilance committee. I was exempted several
                    times by the medical board and finally was conscripted and obtained the detail
                    referred to. Furnished no substitute. I never was employed in any service,
                    except as a detail to furnish material for the workshop referred to. I never was
                    employed on any railroad or engaged in transporting of soldiers or anything at
                    all for the benefit of the Confederate Govt. Had charge of nothing for the use
                    and benefit of the Confederate army or navy. Never gave any information to any
                    one connected with the army or navy of the Confederacy. Never employed in any
                    way or assisted others in the manufacture of any articles whatever. (P. 3).
                    Never employed in collecting, impressing or purchasing articles for the
                    Confederacy. Never engaged in blockade running. I did not leave the Confederate
                    states at any time during the war. Never owned or had interest in any vessel
                    used for any purpose. Never arrested by either Govt. The Confederate took only
                    small quantities of corn. Never paid for any taken. Never threatened, except at
                    the election on ratifying the ordinance of secession. Never molested or injured
                    that I know of.. Never made a contribution to aid the U.S. Govt. or Union cause.
                    (P. 4). I never did anything for the U.S. Govt., or its army, or Union cause,
                    except to give information to Union men who were escaping the service of the
                    Confederate army. I had two brothers-in-law in the Confederate army. Jas. M.
                    Houff for a short time and then he went through the lines, and B.F. Houff. The
                    are both living near Staunton, Va. I furnished them nothing. My brother John S.
                    Quick was in the Union army. He belonged to an Ill. Regt. Owned no Confederate
                    bonds, and did nothing to support the credit of that Govt. Never gave any aid or
                    comfort to the rebellion. Never was in Canada and destroyed nothing belonging to
                    the U.S. Never engaged in holding in custody any prisoners of war. Never
                    belonged to any society or association for the punishment in any way for loyalty
                    to the U.S. (P. 5). Never was a paroled prisoner. Never held any office in the
                    army or navy of the U.S., nor educated at any military school of the U.S. I
                    never had a pass. Under no disabilities. My sympathies at the beginning were
                    with the Union. My feelings were against secession, and I used my influence
                    against it. I voted for Union candidates to state convention. I did not vote for
                    the ordinance of secession. After its adoption I still supported the Union. In
                    conclusion I do most solemnly declare that from the beginning of hostilities
                    against the United States to the end thereof, my sympathies were constantly in
                    favor of the cause of the U.S. and I never of my own free will or accord did
                    anything to injure said cause, but was at all times ready and willing to assist
                    the cause of the Union. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>GEO. W. WHITE testifies: Age 45; residence Augusta Co., Va., Farm laborer; not
                    related or interested. (P. 11). Testifies as to property. I have known the
                    claimant 12 or 13 years. Intimate with him during the war. Lived over 1/2 mile
                    from him during the war. Saw him at times ever day in the week. I often talked
                    with him about the war, and he always spoke in favor of the Union and against
                    rebellion. I don't recollect any particular language, but was very against the
                    Confederates. He knew I was a Union man. I have often heard him speak in the
                    presence of others and he was always the same thing His loyal neighbors had all
                    confidence in him as a true Union man. I never knew him to contribute anything
                    to the U.S. Govt. or its army. Know he did all he could to keep out of the
                    Confederate army and help those Union men who were out. From what I know of the
                    claimant he could never have produced any testimony in favor of his loyalty to
                    the South had it gained its independence.</p>
                <p>WM. A. HOUFF testifies: I have known the claimant 25 years; intimately during the
                    war. We lived about 3/4 of a mile apart during the war. I saw him frequently.
                    (P. 13). Part of the time every day. We conversed about the war a great deal,
                    and he always was against rebellion and in favor of the Union. He knew my
                    sympathies were with the Union. Sometimes there would be half dozen or more
                    together, and the claimant was invariably the same. I have often heard him wish
                    that the Union army would be victorious. He was regarded by his Union neighbors
                    as strictly a Union man. I knever knew him to do anything for the U.S. Govt. or
                    army, but he aided the Union men who were hiding to keep out of the Confederate
                    army. He could not have proved any loyalty to the Confederate Govt. or cause, In
                    fact I don't think he would have been allowed to stay in the South had it been
                    successful. (P. 14).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court. This testimony was taken in Nov. 1895.</p>
                <p>M.A. HOLDERMAN testifies: Farmer; age 52; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not
                    interested or related. I have known the claimant since before the war. I lived
                    right near him, and saw him often before the war. I do not remember having
                    conversations with him directly on the war and its causes. He was conceded to be
                    a Union man. I was too young to have any special politics, but was in the
                    Confederate service. He was generally regarded by both his Confederate and Union
                    neighbors as a Union man.. I don't think he made any attempt to conceal his
                    opinions on the subject at all. I don't know whether he voted on secession or
                    not. I am unable to say what he did to aid the Union side, except he knew of
                    persons who were seeking to get out of service and through the Confederate
                    lines, and did not inform on them. (P. 2). His Confederate neighbors regarded
                    him as against the Confederacy. He was generally known as a Union man throughout
                    the war. It is a fact that a man who made himself active on the Union side was
                    not very unpopular in that neighborhood during the war. Claimant couldn't
                    possibly have established his loyalty to the Confederacy had it succeeded.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>
                <p>I suppose I lived a half mile from claimant. We both lived on farms, and our
                    farms adjoined. I went into service the latter part of the first year of the
                    war. I don't remember of meeting him after my entering the army for the
                    remainder of the war. Those that were liable to military duty avoided us,
                    concealed themselves from us, and in that way I don't remember seeing him after
                    I had gone into the army.. I don't remember how often I saw him during the first
                    year of the war, it has been so long ago. I may have seen him once a week or
                    oftener, or I may have seen him once in two weeks. My recollection is Mr. Quick
                    had a spell of typhoid fever at the breaking out of the war. After recovering
                    from that he did not go into service. Then when he was called into service he
                    would keep out of the wra of the conscript officers: (P. 3). He kept himself out
                    of public places. I never heard of his being away from home during the war. He
                    was a farmer. Mr. Quick was on detail somehwere during the war within the
                    Confederate lines, but I don't know where. I think though, he was detailed and
                    worked in a nursery; but I am not positive. I don't know whether he was
                    conscripted and detailed or not. He was married when the war broke out. There
                    were others in that neighborhood who did leave and cross the lines. Mr. Quick is
                    present in the room. I don't know that the claimant was very unpopular in the
                    neighborhood. I don't think he was very active on the Union side. (P. 4). I
                    don't think a Union man could have been very active, he not only would have made
                    himself very unpopular but would have been liable to arrest. Claimant did not
                    have a brother or uncle in the Confederate army, that I know of. I heard the
                    claimant make the statement, or rather he had a talk with you and the statement
                    as you put was written down and then what was written was read to him and he
                    said ye that was right, except that the volunteer company
                    was formed before the war broke out and not after the war begun. I don't remember that I ever had a talk with the claimant
                    during the war on the subject of secession, the cause of the war, etc.. I don't
                    remember that I ever heard any say particular that claimant was a Union man. We
                    all knew him as such. That was the general reputation. I may have heard some one
                    state so, but I don't know that I ever did.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>The men who went through the lines in claimant's neighborhood, were without
                    families, while the claimant had a family to support. (P. 6). There were men
                    there well known to be Union men, but hardly a man took an active part for the
                    Union. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>D.W. LANDES testifies: livery man; age 58; residence Staunton, Va. not interested
                    or related. (P. 8). I have known the claimant since 1857. I saw the claimant
                    often prior to and during the war, and he expressed himself as a Union man. I
                    lived within three hundred yards of him.. I was a Union man. Claimant was always
                    regarded by his Union neighbors as in sympathy with and ome of their number. Claimant had no hesitation in expressing his
                    sentiments to those who knew him. Don't know how he voted. We had made
                    arrangements to go through the lines with some neighbors. His wife as I
                    understood was opposed to his going. He then said whatever I would do he would
                    do. I considered the matter, and thought if anything happened to us in going
                    through the lines that I would be to blame for it. I declined to go on that
                    account. Just about that time we were notified that the lines were closed
                    throughout which we were to go to escape. And because of my advice and his
                    wife's opposition he did not go. (P. 9). I think a man was safe in expressing
                    himself on the Union side, but don't think it would have been safe for him to
                    aid the Union side in an active way. Some of our best friends were
                    secessionists. There was a number of Union men in that neighborhood, well known
                    to be Union men who took no active part against the Confederacy. Claimant was
                    one of that number. I was a Union man and before I was liable to military duty,
                    I concealed him for six months. He slept in my house with another deserter.
                    Claimant could not have established his loyalty to the Confederacy had it been
                    successful.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Just by expressing himself as opposed to the war at the first was
                        was what he did to prevent him from proving his loyalty to the
                    Confederacy. (P. 10). Certainly we were neighbors and would help one another in
                    case of sickness, or anything of the kind. Certainly we would have told a
                    Confederate soldier who happened to be at home on a furlough, that the Federal
                    scouts or army were around. We never had occasion to do it.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Would have done so simply as a neighborly act. Certainly I would have helped a
                    Union neighbor, and I did as a matter of fact warn them in time of danger. (P.

                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>The claimant was 25 years old in '61. Resided near Staunton during the war
                    farming. He was conscripted and obtained a detail to furnish material for
                    Government wagon maker shop in staunton. He was threatened at the time of the
                    election on ratifying the ordinance of secession. He gave information to Union
                    men who were escaping the service of the rebellion. Had a brother in the Union
                    army. In '61 he used his influence against secession voted for Union candidates.
                    Did not vote for the ordinance of secession. Adhered to the Union cause after
                    the state seceded.</p>
                <p>His witnesses who were intimate with him during the war, and who were themselves
                    Union men testify that the claimant always spoke in favor of the Union and
                    against the rebellion. That his loyal neighbors had full confidence in him as a
                    true Union man. That he did all he could to keep men out of the Confederate
                    army. That he aided Union men who were hiding out. That his Confederate as well
                    as Union neighbors regarded him as against the Confederacy. That he tried to
                    avoid conscription. At one time made arrangements to go through the lines with
                    some neighbors, but his wife was opposed to his going.</p>
                <p>These facts justify a favorable decision on loyalty.</p>

                <p>James T. Quick vs. The United States Cong. 8810.</p>
                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The Report of the commission rejecting this claim is as follows:</p>
                <p>Mr Quick is about 43 years of age; a farmer residing in Augusta Co. Va. The
                    testimony relating to his loyalty is far from satisfactory. He opposed
                    secession, but after that there is very little to show that he adhered to the
                    Union cause. He certainly aided the Confederacy. The Confederates had wagon
                    shops at Staunton. Mr Quick was engaged for five months in furnishing materials
                    for these shops.</p>
                <p>The claim is disallowed.</p>
                <p>A.O. Aldis, O. Ferris, Commissioners of Claims.</p>
                <p>The War Department Report shows a voucher signed by claimant for forage.</p>
                <p>The claimant had abundant opportunity to go across the lines into the Union
                    lines, as other men in his neighborhood did, but did not do so. He voluntarily
                    remained in the confederate territory and was engaged in furnishing materials to
                    a confederate wagon factory. This bars the claim under the Bowman Act and under
                    the decision of this court in Watson's case 25 Ct. Cls. 119.</p>
                <p>Two witnesses testify to a little talk which is abstracted on pages 6-9 of claimants brief. One of them was a young confederate
                    soldier who never saw clmt. after the first year
                    of the war and who never conversed with him about the war.</p>
                <p>The other one says claimant could have gone into Union country but his wife
                    persuaded him not to do so. Says if confederate soldiers had been about witness
                    and claimant would have apprized them of the
                    approach of the federals, "of course."</p>

                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1895-96.</p>
                <p>James T. Quick, vs. The United States No. 8810 Cong.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Defendant's attorney advances no substantial reasons why the claimant in this
                    case should be held disloyal. On the other hand his brief is without point or
                    force. He garbles extracts from one or two witnesses and this is about all there
                    is of the defense.</p>
                <p>Now the facts are that Mr. Quick was a young man in the time of the war, only 25
                    years of age and yet he avoided in the main serving the Confederacy in any way.
                    He was finally conscripted, however, in '63 and was retained in the service for
                    some five months. This was compulsory. He cannot be held responsible for this
                    service. He was active, however, in aiding the Union cause. He gave information
                    to Union men who were escaping the service of the rebellion. He had a brother in
                    the Union army. He voted for the Union in '61. His influence was for the Union.
                    His witnesses corroborate his statement as to aiding Union men, and keeping out
                    of the Confederate army. He was known and respected in the community where he
                    lived as a union man by the loyal element; also was regarded by the disloyal as
                    loyal to the U.S. Govt., such was his general reputation. He arranged at one
                    time with some of his neighbors to go into the Union lines, but was persuaded
                    not to accompany them by the influence of his wife.</p>
                <p>Now certainly these facts justify a favorable finding on loyalty. If not, the
                    Bowman act is fruitless in its results so far as securing justice to those who
                    lived in the South and were loyal adherents to the Union cause during the war.</p>

                <p>CLAIMANT'S REQUESTS FOR FINDINGS OF FACT.</p>
                <p>The claimant considering the facts hereinafter set forth to be proven, and
                    deeming them material to the due presentation of this claim in the findings of
                    fact, requests the Court to find the same as follows:</p>
                <p>I. That the claimant James T. Quick, a citizen of the United States residing in
                    Augusta Co., Va., did not give any aid or comfort to the rebellion during the
                    late war, but was throughout that period loyal to the Goverment of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>II. That during the said war the United States forces by proper authority took
                    from him for their use 1 horse, $150.00.</p>
                <p>III. That no payment has ever been made for said horse.</p>

                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co. Va., during the late war.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected the claim because they were not convinced of
                    loyalty.</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims of the
                    House of Rep.</p>
                <p>The claimant was found loyal by the Court June 14, 1897.</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>The claimant alleges in his petition that there was taken from him about the 1st
                    part of the month of June '64, by U.S. troops commanded by Maj. Gen'l. Hunter: 1
                    mare, in good condition, about 6 yrs old..$150.00</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the Southern
                    Claims Commission, in Feb. 1873.</p>
                <p>JAMES T. QUICK testifies: age 37; residence near Staunton, Va., farmer. Claimant.
                    (P. 1). Testifies as to loyalty. I was not present when my horse was
                    taken. I saw the horse in possession of soldiers just after he was taken. I was
                    on one side of middle river, and they on other side. I had my horse in the grass
                    field. I could not see the field from my house. Suppose the horse was taken from
                    the field, as I put him in the field the same morning. This was about the 12th
                    of June '64. I did not know any one engaged. I suppose there were 100 in sight
                    of my house, at the time I saw my horse in their possession. They were riding
                    around in sight. They remained about 4 or 5 hours. There was no person with me
                    when I saw my horse. Don't know whether there was an officer present or not. I
                    think they were leading my horse when I saw them first. There was nothing said.
                    I was not in speaking distance. (P. 7). I don't know whether the horse was rode
                    or led off. I don't know where he was removed. I did not follow. I don't know
                    what use they made of my horse. Never saw the horse afterwards. Made no
                    complaint. Got no receipt. Horse taken in day time, between 10 and 11 A.M. There
                    was no encampment nearer than Staunton, distant about 7 miles. Gen'l. Hunter's
                    Army was camped there. It had been there three or four days, and left the day
                    after taking my horse. The battle of Piedmont occurred on the Sunday previous. I
                    knew no Officer connected with the army. It was a bay mare in very good
                    condition. She was well broken to the saddle and harness. 6 or 7 years old.
                    Medium size, sound in every way. Never received any pay, and tried until now.
                    (P. 8).</p>
                <p>WM. A. HOUFF testifies: age 50; residence near Staunton, Va., farmer. Claimant
                    married my sister. Not interested. Was present when the horse was taken. Saw the
                    horse taken. Saw them drive the horse to the bars of the field, and either
                    bridled or haltered him, They said, we have got a good one this time. The horse
                    was taken in the grass field on Thursday after the Piedmont battle, in June
                    1864. There were a good many soldiers in the field, but only 5 or 6 engaged in
                    catching the horse. They only remained in the field a short time. There was no
                    one present with me. I don't know whether there was an officer present or not.
                    The horse was driven to the bars, and there caught. All I heard said was they
                    "had got a good one this time". Horse led away by soldiers, whom I supposed were
                        Cav. men. (P. 9). They started in the direction
                    of Staunton I followed after them. I do not know how they used the horse. Never
                    saw the horse after they left. No complaint made that I know of. I knew of no
                    receipt being given. Horse taken in day time, before 12 o'clock, probably about
                    11 o'clock A.M. Taken boldly. There was no camp nearer than Staunton that I know
                    of, which is about 7 miles. I did not know what company or Regt., but the army
                    was commanded by Gen'l. Hunter. They had been at Staunton 3 or 4 days and left I
                    understood the day after taking the horse. The Piedmont battle was fought on the
                    Sunday previous. I did not know any officer at all. The horse was a light bay
                    mare, in fine condition, young, suppose 5 or 6 years old, good medium size, well
                    broke, moved finely, think she was worth $150 to $175. Never talked with
                    claimant about the value of the mare. (P. 10).</p>
                <p>GEO. W. WHITE testifies: age 45; residence Augusta Co., Va., farm laborer. Not
                    related or interested. Not present when the claimant's mare was taken. I did not
                    see them take the Mare from the field, but saw them have her in possession, when
                    I saw the Mare she was about 1/2 mile from the field. There was I suppose 300 or
                    400 Soldiers together when I saw the Mare. There was a Soldier riding her, he
                    was bare back. I knew the Mare and could not have been deceived. I was by myself
                    at the time, and was not more than 10 or 15 steps from her. The Company did not
                    halt, I said nothing to them about the Mare. It was a little after 12 o'clock in
                    the day. This was in June '64, and the Thursday after the Piedmont fight. They
                    were officers in command, I think there was one Major, but no Col. I did not
                    hear him say anything at all. I suppose they took the Mare to Staunton. They
                    were moving in that direction. (P. 11). I never saw the Mare after they passed
                    me in the road. I never heard of any complaint being made to any one. I never
                    heard of any receipt being given or asked for. There was no camp nearer than
                    Staunton about 7 miles. Gen'l. Hunter's Army was at Staunton. It arrived at
                    Staunton on Monday and left the next Friday. There had been a battle at Piedmont
                    on Sunday before. I knew no officer. The Mare was a bright bay, about 6 or 7
                    years old of good size, and well broken. She was a cheap Mare at $150. I never
                    consulted the claimant as to her value. (P. 12).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>This claim is for only one horse taken by the Federal forces for their use in
                    June '64 for which there is charged $150.00. The claimant saw this horse in the
                    possession of the Federal forces. and in their use.</p>
                <p>Mr. W.A. Houff, saw the horse taken. Describes how he was taken, good many
                    soldiers present. (P. 5). He never saw the horse afterwards. Describes the horse
                    as in good condition, 5 or 6 years old, medium size, well broke worth $150 to
                    $175. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>Mr. White did not see the animal taken but saw her being rode in the command of
                    300 or 400 soldiers. Says this was in June '64.</p>
                <p>The Government was paying $150 for horses at that
                    time. Upon this testimony there should certainly be an allowance
                    for 1 serviceable horse, $150.00.</p>

                <p>Defendants' Brief on Merits.</p>
                <p>Claimant in this case resided in Augusta county, Virginia, during the late war,
                    and presented his claim to the Commissioners of Claims, who rejected it on the
                    grounds of loyalty. The claim was transmitted to this court by the House
                    Committee on War Claims, and the claimant was found loyal June 14, 1897.</p>
                <p>The charge in the petition is for one mare, six years old, valued at $150.00. No
                    testimony whatever has been taken on the subject of merits since the reference
                    of the case to this court, and the testimony on that subject consists solely of
                    the depositions of James T. Quick, the claimant, William A. Houff and George W.
                    White, taken before an agent of the Southern Claims Commission in February,
                    1872. The claimant says (page 7) that he was not present when his horse was
                    taken, but he saw the horse in the possession of some soldiers. He was on the
                    west side of the Middle river, and they were on the other side. "I had my horse
                    in a grass field. I could not see the field from my house. I suppose my horse
                    was taken from the field, as I had put him in the field that same morning. This
                    was about the 12th of June '64. I did not know any one engaged. I suppose there
                    were 100 in sight of my house, at the time I saw my horse in their possession.
                    They were riding around in sight. They remained about 4 or 5 hours. There was no
                    person with me when I saw my horse. Don't know whether there was an officer
                    present or not." He does not know whether the horse was ridden or led off, nor
                    does he know where he was taken to. He made no complaint; got not receipt. There
                    was no encampment nearer than Staunton, about seven miles off.</p>
                <p>William A. Houff says that he saw the horse taken; that he saw them drive the
                    horse to the bars of the field, and either bridle or halter him; that the horse
                    was taken from the grass field on the Thursday after the Piedmont battle in
                    June, 1864; that there were a good many soldiers in the field, but only five or
                    six engaged in catching the horse; that they remained there but a very short
                    while. There was no one present with the witness when he saw this. He does not
                    know whether there was any officer present or not. The horse was led away in the
                    direction of Staunton, but the witness did not follow. Witness never saw the
                    horse afterwards. No complaint was made that witness knows of. He never heard of
                    any receipt being given. He does not know what company or regiment the soldiers
                    belonged to. This witness and his brother, E.L. Houff, both had claims pending
                    before this court under the Bowman act, and both were defeated on the question
                    of loyalty in a manner highly discreditable to their veracity. See cases No.

                <p>George W. White says that he did not see them take the mare from the field, but
                    saw the mare in the possession of some soldiers. "When I saw the mare she was
                    about half a mile from the field. There were 300 or 400 soldiers together when I
                    saw the mare. There was a soldier riding her. She was bare-backed." The witness
                    was by himself when he saw this. The company was moving along and did not halt,
                    and witness was ten or fifteen steps away. Witness said nothing to them about
                    the mare. Witness never saw the mare after that.</p>
                <p>This is all the testimony there is in the case. I submit that it is not
                    sufficient to establish the taking of this mare by any proper officer or
                    authority, or that the same was used for the benefit of the United States army.
                    It smacks decidedly of a marauding theft. If, however, the court is of opinion
                    that the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding of taking of the animal, I
                    submit that the valuation of it should not exceed $100.00.</p>

                <p>James T. Quick vs. The United States</p>
                <p>STATEMENT OF CASE:</p>
                <p>The claim in the above-entitled case for supplies, or stores, alleged to have
                    been taken by or furnished to the military forces of the United States, for
                    their use during the late war for the suppression of the rebellion, was
                    transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims of the House of
                    Representatives on the 24th day of March 1892.</p>
                <p>On a preliminary inquiry the Court, on the 14th day of June 1897, found that the
                    person alleged to have furnished the supplies or stores, or from whom they were
                    alleged to have been taken, was loyal to the Government of the United States
                    throughout said war.</p>
                <p>The case was brough to a hearing on its merits on the 16th day of March 1898.
                    Gilbert Moyers Esq., appeared for claimant, and the Attorney General, by Geo. H.
                    Gorman, Esq., his assistant, and under his direction, appeared for the defense
                    and protection of the interests of the United States.</p>
                <p>The claimant in his petition makes the following allegations:</p>
                <p>That he is a citizen of the United States residing in Augusta County, State of
                    Virginia where he resided during the late war of the rebellion; that there was
                    taken from him about the first part of June 1864 from the farm of Wm. Link, a
                    neighbor, on Middle River, about 6-1/2 miles from Staunton, Augusta County,
                    Virginia by a Regiment of U.S. Troops commanded by Maj. Gen'l. Hunter 1 mare in
                    good condition, about 6 yrs old, $150.00.</p>
                <p>The Court, upon the evidence and after considering the briefs and arguments of
                    counsel on both sides, makes the following Finding of Fact.</p>
                <p>There was taken, in June, 1864, in Augusta County, State of Virginia, from the
                    claimant by the military forces of the United States, for the use of the Army, a
                    horse which at the time and place of taking was reasonbly worth the sum of One
                    hundred and thirty-five dollars ($135), for which no payment appears to have
                    been made.</p>
