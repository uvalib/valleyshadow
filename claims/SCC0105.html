<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of William D. Hemp,
                            March, 1873, Claim No. 1385</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Hemp's claim for horses and farm products was rejected because the Commissioners
                    did not believe there was sufficient proof of his loyalty. He appealed this
                    decision to the Court of Claims in 1900 and again in 1902.

<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claimant was within conscription ages he served some months in the militia and
                    was discharged on account of sickness. How he kept out of the Confederate Army,
                        don't appear. He says he did not vote for
                    secession His witnesses testify that he was loyal but there is nothing appears
                    in the evidence in regard to his conduct during the war. We could infer it. He
                    does testify  but to all appearance since we learnt of peace and good
                    terms with his neighbors during the war. We are not satisifed with sufficiency
                    of the evidence in support of loyalty and we therefore reject the claim.</p>

                    anything, or offered, or sought or attempted to do anything by word or deed to
                    injure said cause or retard its success, and was at all times ready and willing
                    when called upon to aid and assist the cause of the Union or its supporters, so
                    far as my means and power and the circumstances would permit.</p>
                <p>Ques. 1 Ans. I was not present and did not see the property taken. The property
                    was taken about the 11<sup>th</sup> of June 1864. I was
                    told there were three soldiers, one of whom said he was a Seargeant
                    Quartermaster. Mrs. Bosserman was present when the property was taken I heard
                    that one of the Soldiers present said he was a Quarter Master. I do not know
                    where the property was removed, as the Army was then Marching. I never saw the
                    property after being taken. I made no complaint as I never saw any officer or
                    soldier. I got no receipt. There was no Camp nearer than Staunton, about 9 miles
                    distant. There had been no fight, by Gen<sup>l</sup>.
                    Crooks Army, who got my property. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter
                    had had a fight at Piedmont Crooks &amp; Hunter united at Staunton. My two
                    horses were in fine order, one was 4 years old, large and well formed a good
                    work animal, I think she was worth $175. The other was 7 years old. She was a
                    good medium size, well broke to the harness. The Wheat had not been harvested.
                    There were between 12 or 13 Acres in Wheat, and was good. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Crook's camped over night, near the field, and
                    pastured the Wheat. Flour was selling at $10 in good money. The bridles were
                    good as also the halters.</p>

                <p>My name is Sarah Bosserman my age is 47 years. I am a sister of the claimant, but
                    have no benefit in the claim. I was present and saw the property taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3 Ans. The two horses were in the stable. The soldiers went to the stable
                    and opened the doors and took them out. When we asked them to leave the horses,
                    the one who said he was a Quarter Master replied that they needed horses and
                    could not leave them.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4 Ans. I do not recollect the time. There were three in all. The Officer
                    and one soldier went to the stable and the other remained in the house yard,
                    holding bread which we had given them. They were only a few minutes at the
                    stable.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5 Ans. Lucy Myers, Lizzie Sansabaugh, Jane Cale, were present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6 Ans. One of the men said he was a Quarter Master, he did not give his
                    name. I have forgotten the name of the Commanding Officer of the Army. They had
                    crossed the mountain from the West. The Quarter Master said that they needed the
                    horses. The Quarter Master, &amp; both soldiers were mounted when they came.
                    They led claimants horses away. I did not see them pasturing the Wheat.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9 Ans. The Quarter Master said they were going to take the horses to
                    Staunton. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10 Ans. I do not know what use they made of the horses. The Officer said
                    there were some soldiers, who had none. I never saw them after they left the
                    house.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11 Ans. There was no complaint, except asking them to leave the horses, but
                    the Quarter Master replied they needed them.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12 Ans. There was no receipt asked for.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13 Ans. It was day time, about 9 o'clock A.M.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14 Ans. The Army camped about one mile off, the night previous. I dont remember the name of the General Commanding They
                    only remained in Camp one night they said they were on their way to Staunton to
                    meet Gen<sup>l</sup>. Hunter. There had been a battle at
                    Piedmont. I do not know how long they staid at
                    Staunton. I knew no officer.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15 Ans. The horses were very nice, in good order, and large sized. If they
                    had belonged to me, I would not have taken less than two hundred dollars a piece
                    for them. I know nothing about the Wheat, as the field was a mile off.</p>

                <p>Deposition of Henry Mish</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup> Gen<sup>l</sup>. qestion. My name is Henry Mish, my age is 60 years. I am a farmer and
                    reside near Middlebrook Augusta Co. Va. I have known the claimant for 15 years.
                    I am not related to him and have no benefit in his claim. During the war, the
                    claimant lived on my land for a part of the time and the balance very near me. I
                    saw him very often, more than once a week, and he always told me that he was in
                    favor of the Union, he complained very much of being forced into the rebel Army.
                    He was out in the Militia about two months, he was taken sick, and he told me he
                    would rather die than fight. I think most of his Union neighbors regarded him as
                    a Union man. He knew that my sympathies were with the Union. I never knew him to
                    do anything for the Union cause, he was a very poor man. The two mares taken
                    from him, was given to him by a brother who had died. The claimant was a very
                    quiet man, and talked but little, on any subject. I do not believe from what I
                    have heard him say repeatedly that he could have proven loyalty to the South, if
                    they had succeeded in gaining an independence.</p>

                <p>Answer to first general question. My name is John Engleman, my age is 62 years.
                    My residence near Middlebrook, Augusta Co. my occupation is a farmer. I am not
                    related to the claimant, and have no interest in his claim. I have known the
                    claimant about 30 years. I lived about two miles from him during the War. We
                    were intimate during that time. I saw him very often, upon on average
                    once a week. I hauled a load of wheat to his house and he hid it for me and kept
                    it until the close of the War. We talked about the War, every time we met
                    &amp; he was always opposed to the War and in favor of the Union. I know
                    that he exerted himself to help me to keep out of the rebel army. I have heard
                    him talk in presence of others, and he was invariable in his opposition to the
                    War. He was regarded byas a Union man, by all his
                    neighbors. He done nothing in favor of the Confederacy
                    except what he was compelled to do.</p>
                <p>I do not suppose he could have shown any loyalty to the South, if he had tried.</p>

                    called out as a state militia and reported at Staunton in 1861. Was released and
                    again in 1862 was called out and was then left on sick list and was then
                    discharged. (Answers to interrogatories 12 to 24 favorable to loyalty) (pp.
                    1-2). Had about two tons of hay and some corn taken by the Confederates. Was
                    never paid. Was never threatened except by hearsay. Never was molested. Never
                    had an opportunity to contribute anything to the Union cause. Did nothing except
                    to feed Union soldiers. (Questions 30 to 39 inclusive answered favorably to
                    loyalty) (p. 3). At the beginning of the rebellion I sympathized with the union.
                    Told the rebels that the North would whip. Voted for Union candidates to the
                    convention. Did not vote for the ordinance of secession. Afterwards went for the
                    Union and did not go out with my state. I do solemnly say that from the
                    beginning to the end of the war my sympathies were constantly with the cause of
                    the United States; that I never did anything to injure said cause, and was at
                    all times ready aid willing to aid it as far as the circumstances permitted. (p.

                <p>HENRY MISH testifies: Age 60. Farmer. Residence near Middlebrook, Va. Have known
                    claimant fifteen years. Not interested or related. During the war claimant lived
                    on my land for a part of the time and the balance very near me. Saw him very
                    often, more than once a week, and he always told me that he was in favor of the
                    Union. He complained very much of being forced into the rebel army. He was out
                    in the militia about two months. He was taken sick and told me he would rather
                    die than fight. I think most of his Union neighbors regarded him as a Union man.
                    He knew that my sympathies were with the Union. I never know him to do anything
                    for the Union cause; he was a very poor man (p. 8). The two mares taken from him
                    was given to him by a brother who had died. Claimant was a very quiet man and
                    talked but little on any subject. Do not believe from what I have heard him say
                    repeatedly that he could have proven loyalty to the South, if they had succeeded
                    in winning their independence.</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testifies: Age 62. Residence near Middlebrook, Va. Farmer. Not
                    interested or related. Have known claimant about 30 years. Lived about two miles
                    from him during the war. We were intimate during that time. I saw him very
                    often, on an average once a week. I hauled a load of wheat to his house and he
                    hid it for me and kept it until the close of the war. We talked about the war
                    every time we met and he was always opposed to the war and in favor of the
                    Union. I know that he exerted himself to help men to keep out of the rebel army
                    (p. 9). Have heard him talk in presence of others and he was invariable in his
                    opposition to the war. He was regarded as a Union man by all his neighbors. He
                    did nothing in favor of the Confederacy except what he was compelled to do. I do
                    not suppose he could have shown any loyalty to the South if he had tried (p.
                    10).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken at Staunton, Va. commencing Oct. 3, 1900:</p>
                <p>JACOB AREHART testifies: Age 69. Residence Middlebrook, Augusta County, Va.
                    Resided before and during the war about a Mile and a half from Middlebrook, and
                    was a farmer. Was acquainted with claimant; have been living beside him for
                    forty years and knew him intimately (p. 1); resided about half a mile from him.
                    Met him during the war and talked about it. He always stuck to his own side of
                    the question, that is, the Union side. He always talked for the Union side to
                    me. Could not say how he voted, never saw him vote. Think I have heard him
                    express himself on the question of secession. His views were always that the
                    secession side would never gain. I was not a Union Man. Think claimant was just
                    as loyal as any man could be. I lived beside him all that time and he never said
                    anything any other way that I know of. Know he was commonly spoken of and
                    regarded by his neighbors and those who knew him as a loyal Union man (p. 2).
                    Don't know of his doing anything in favor of the Union cause. He did not aid the
                    Confederates that I know of. I saw him frequently during the war.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>Claimant always voted at Middlebrook. I was well acquainted with the Hemp family;
                    don't knew the name of his father; his brother was John Hemp. There was no other
                    family by the name of Hemp in the neighborhood of Middlebrook that I know of
                    during the war. Don't know of claimant's doing anything to aid the Union cause.
                    When the ordinance of secession was voted upon there was another
                    William C. Hemp living in the neighborhood of Middlebrook, a son of claimant.
                    Expect he is forty-five or fifty year old now (p. 3). I think that the conduct
                    of claimant duiring the war was such that he could have established his loyalty
                    to the Confederacy. He always talked like a loyal Union man. He was a Union man
                    and stuck to his side; never heard him talk in any other way. He did not that I
                    know of have any brothers or sons in the Confederate Army. I was at home during
                    the entire war except about three weeks, when I was in the reserves. Don't think
                    claimant wes ever in the service of the Confederacy. There were not a great many
                    Union men in my neighborhood during the war. Claimant was never molested or
                    threatened.</p>
                <p>Redirect-examination.</p>
                <p>When I stated on cross-examination that claimant could have established his
                    loyalty to the Confederacy I understood it of the Union; never heard him say
                    anything about the Confederacy, that is, I never heard him say anything in favor
                    of it (p. 4). (In answer to the question whether claimant could have established
                    his loyalty to the Confederacy) He was always a Union man; he had nothing to say
                    about the Confederacy.</p>
                <p>Re-cross-exami nation.</p>
                <p>Have heard claimant say a good many times that the Confederacy would never be
                    successful and so on; don't know exactly what he said now. Never heard him say
                    whether he desired the Confederacy to succeed (p. 5).</p>
                <p>JOHN W. MISH testifies: Age 51. Farmer. No interest or relation. Resided before
                    and during the war near Middlebrook, and was a farmer. Was acquainted with
                    claimant; acquaintance intimate. At the commencement of the war resided about
                    three miles from him, and the latter part a mile and a half. Saw him frequently
                    during the war. He and my father conversed about the war frequently in my
                    presence, and both condemned the war and predicted the results. I know claimant
                    was regarded as a Union man. Don't know how he voted. Don't think I ever heard
                    him express his opinion on secession (p. 6). The impression of everybody was
                    that he was a Union man and what I heard myself led me to believe that he was a
                    Union man. He was commonly spoken of and regarded as a Union man by his
                    neighbors. He gave no aid to the Confederacy that I know of and was regarded
                    during and since the war as a Union man. Don't know of his having done anything
                    in favor of the Union cause. He was never in the Confederate service that I know
                    of; if he was there he was under compulsion. The only way that people in my
                    neighborhood had chance to to render any aid or assistnace to the Union cause
                    would be in helping deserters through. We were in the Confederate lines except
                    on the occasion of Hunters raid up the valley, which was a few days (p. 7).</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I an the son of Henry Mish, who is the owner of a war claim. I was born Oct. 1,
                    1849. Claimant lived on my father's place the first two years of the war. They
                    had frequent talks in regard to the war and the conversation was always in favor
                    of the Union; don't know the exact words of it. Don't know of any man living in
                    Augusta County by the name of Wm. C. Hemp, but there are a good many Hemps in
                    the county. Claimant did not that I know of furnish any supplies to the
                    Confederate Army. Every time that I heard claimant's loyalty spoken of the
                    impression of ever<sup>y</sup>one was that he was a Union
                    man (p.8).</p>
                <p>G.L. AREHART testifies: Retired farmer. Age 72. Residence near Middlebrook, Va.
                    Not interested or related. Resied before and during
                    the war about two miles from Middlebrook, Va.; was a farmer. Have known claimant
                    about fifty years. Knew him intimately before and during the war. We talked
                    right smart together. Resided about three miles from him during the war. Met him
                    a good many times. We talked about the war. He and I were opposed to it (p. 9).
                    I was a Union man and am today. Claimant was always a Union man. Could not tell
                    whether he voted at all or not. I think he wes opposed to secession all the
                    time. Think his public reputation among his neighbors and in the community in
                    which he resided was all right as a Union man; people looked upon him as a Union
                    man. Don't know of his having done anything in favor of the Union cause. He
                        didn not do anything to helpe
                    Confederate cause; they came and took his property by force, just as they did me
                    and never paid him a cent for it. Don't recollect of his being in the
                    Confederate service; if he was he was forced in and did not go in of his own
                    account (p. 10). My section was in the Confederate lines most of the time, and
                    we had no chance of helping the Union people. I can state positively, as far as
                    I knew, Mr. Hemp was a Union man.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>I was away from home from Jan. 20, 1864 till July 7, 1864. Could not tell
                    anything claimant did to aid the Union, words or actions. I was acquainted with
                    most of the people living in and around and if there was any man living there
                    named Wm. C. Hemp, I have forgot him. Did not see any of the Union soldiers
                    around claimant's house during the war (p. 11).</p>
                <p>J. R. CALE testifies: Farmer. Age 62. Residence Arbor Hill, Va. No interest or
                    relation Resided before and during the war in Augusta County, Va.; was a farmer.
                    Knew claimant intimately before and during the war. As near as I can recollect I
                    resided about a mile from him (p. 13). Don't recollect meeting him very often;
                    talked with him sometimes, can not say how often. As far as I know, he always
                    talked in favor of the Union. He was opposed to the war. He was on the Union
                    side as far as he had any influence. He did not vote at all. Don't believe they
                    allowed the Union people to vote. Don't recollect any particular expression upon
                    secession, but when he did express himself it was against secession. I was not a
                    Union man. I was in the Confederate Army a little while. Did not hear much of
                    claimant's public reputation, but when I did hear it spoken of he was spoken of
                    as a Union man. He did not that I know of do anything for the Confederacy. Don't
                    know of his being threatened or abused on account of his being a Union man (p.
                    14) The section in which claimant resided was throughout the war within the
                    Confederate lines. Don't think the Union people residing in that section had any
                    opportunity for rendering aid or assistance to the Union cause.</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>It has been so long that I cannot recollect who I heard speak of Mr. Hemp as a
                    Union man. There were not many Union men in this neighborhood during the war.
                    (Names several Union men in that neighhorhood during the war). Had the
                    Confederacy been successful I could have established my loyalty to it. Don't
                    think claimant could have established his loyalty to the Confederacy. I was at
                    claimant's house frequently the war. Don't recollect being there when the Union
                    soldiers were there (p. 15).. Don't recollect seeing any
                    Union soldiers in or around his house. I have never testified before in this
                    case. W. D. Hemp was in the Confederate Army a little while; he was forced in;
                    they drafted him.</p>
                <p>Redirect-examination.</p>
                <p>I don't know of any Union soldiers being about claimant's neighborhood during the
                    war, except on the occasion of Hunter's raid up the valley in 1864 (p. 16).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>William D. Hemp, the claimant, was a poor man during the war, and lived during
                    the entire time within the Confederate lines, the Federals not being in that
                    neighhorhood except on one occasion, in 1864, when Hunter made a short raid of a
                    few days. In consequence of this claimant had no opportunity of directly aiding
                    the Union cause. He voted against secession and was at all times in sympathy
                    with the Union. He was forced into the rebel army but only remained two months.
                    All of the witnesses testify that his reputation was that of loyal man and that
                    his Union neighbors regarded him as one of them. They all agree that in
                    conversation he always strongly upheld the Union and opposed secession and that
                    whatever service he may have rendered the Confederacy was compulsory, and not
                    willingly performed. Although he was only able to aid the Union troops by
                    feeding a few of their number, it is urged that this, together with the other
                    facts in his favor, is amply sufficient to justify a finding of loyalty.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>William D. Hemp -vs- The United States. No. 8635, Congressional.</p>
                <p>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty.</p>
                <p>This is a claim for stores and supplies alleged to have been taken by the United
                    States troops from William D. Hemp; the claimant, in Augusta County, Virginia,
                    during the civil war. It was originally presented to the Commissioners of Claims
                    and rejected by them on the ground of the claimant's disloyalty. The claim was
                    referred to the Court of Claims, under the Bowman Act, March 1, 1892, by the
                    Committee on War Claims of the House of Representatives.</p>
                <p>The claimant in his brief appears to have correctly abstracted the testimony.</p>
                <p>The depositions of the following witnesses were taken while the claim was pending
                    before the Commissioners of Claims, in March, 1873:</p>
                <p>WILLIAM D. HEMP (the claimant) testifies: Was engaged in farming,- rented land
                    during the war. Took the amnesty oath in 1865 at Staunton, Virginia. The
                    claimant was called out as a state militia man and reported at Staunton in 1861;
                    was released and again in 1862 was called out and served in the valley in the
                    militia for over two months, when he left on sick list and was discharged. He
                    had about two tons of hay and some corn taken by the Confederates, for which he
                    was never paid. Was never threatened, except by hearsay, and never molested. He
                    never had an opportunity to contribute anything to the Union cause. At the <u>beginning</u> of the rebellion he sympathized with the
                    Union; told the rebels that the North would whip. (pp. 1 &amp; 2, Claimant's
                    Brief).</p>
                <p>HENRY MISH (who has a claim pending) testifies: claimant complained very much
                    about being forced into the rebel army. Never knew him to do anything for the
                    Union cause, as he was a very poor man. (p. 3, Claimant's Brief).</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testifies: He did nothing in favor of the Confederacy except what
                    he was compelled to do. (p. 3, Claimant's Brief).</p>
                <p>The attention of the court is called to the fact that the claimant in his
                    testimony makes no excuse whatever for his services upon two occasions in the
                    Confederate army. His two witnesses pretend that he was forced into the
                    Confederate service but there is nothing whatever to substantiate the<sup>i</sup>re contention. They do not state by
                    whom or in what manner he was forced to do service; and their testimony,
                    moreover, in this respect is in direct conflict with the testimony of claimant
                    himself.</p>
                <p>The claimant served in the Confederate army for over two months; and that fact
                    alone, without a valid and sufficient excuse for so doing, is enough to render
                    him disloyal within the purview of the Bowman Act.</p>
                <p>After the foregoing testimony had been taken, the Commissioners of Claims
                    rejected the said claim in the following finding:</p>
                <p>Claimant was within the conscript age; he served some months in the
                    militia, and was discharged on account of sickness,- how he kept out of the
                    Confederate army don't appear. He says he did not
                    vote for secession. His witnesses testify that he was loyal, but there is
                    nothing that appears in the evidence in regard to his conduct or career from
                    which we could infer it. He don't seem to have been threatened or molested, but
                    to all appearances lived on terms of peace and good fellowship with his
                    neighbors during the war.</p>
                <p>We are not satisfied with the sufficiency of the evidence in respect to loyalty,
                    and we therefore reject the claim.</p>
                <p>After the reference of the claim to the Court of Claims, the depositions of four
                    witnesses were taken on behalf of claimant at Staunton, Va., on the 8th of
                    October, 1900.</p>
                <p>JACOB AREHART testifies: Residence Middlebrook. Witness thinks that he has heard
                    claimant express himself on the question of secession,- his views were that the
                    secession side would never win. Don't know of his doing anything in favor of the
                    Union cause. He did not aid the Confederates that witness knows of.</p>
                <p>On cross-examination: Claimant always voted at Middlebrook. Witness was well
                    acquainted with the Hemp family. There was noanother
                    family by the name of Hemp in the neighborhood of Middlebrook that witness knows
                    of during the war. When the ordinance of secession was voted upon there was a
                    William C. Hemp living in the neighborhood of Middlebrook, a son of claimant,
                    who is forty-five or fifty years of age (October 8, 1900). Witness thinks that
                    the conduct of claimant during the war was such that he could have established
                    his loyalty to the Confederacy. Never heard claimant say whether he desired the
                    Confederacy to succeed. (pp. 4 &amp; 5, Claimant's Brief).</p>
                <p>JOHN W. MISH testifies: Age 51. Residence Middlebrook, Va. Claimant and witness'
                    father conversed about the war frequently in witness' presence, and both
                    condemned the war and predicted the results. Don't know how claimant voted, and
                    witness don't think he ever heard him express his opinion on secession. Don't
                    know of claimant having done anything in favor of the Union cause, and he was
                    never in the Confederate service that witness knows of, and if he was there he
                    was under compulsion. "We were in the Con-federate lines except on the occasion
                    of Hunter''s raid up the valley, which was only for a few days."</p>
                <p>On cross-examination witness says that he is the son of Henry Mish, who is owner
                    of the war claim, and was born October 1, 1849. Claimant lived on the farm of
                    witness' father the first two years of the way. Don't
                    know of any man living in Augusta County by the name of William C. Hemp. (pp. 6
                    &amp; 7, Claimant's Brief).</p>
                <p>G. L. AREHART testifies: Residence Middlebrook, Va. Don't recollect of claimant
                    being in the Confederate service, if he was he was forced in and did not go in
                    of his own account. Don't know of his having done anything in favor of the Union
                    cause. Witness' section was in the Confederate lines most of the time, and they
                    had no chance of helping the Union people.</p>
                <p>On cross-examination witness could not tell anything the claimant did to aid the
                    Union, either by words or actions. Was acquainted with most of the people living
                    in and around Middlebrook, and if there was any man named William C. Hemp living
                    there witness has forgotten him. Did not see any of the Union soldiers around
                    claimant's house during the war. (pp. 7 &amp; 8, Claimant's Brief).</p>
                <p>J. B. CALE testifies: Was not a Union man. Was in the Confederate army a little
                    while. Did not hear much of claimant's public reputation. He did not, that
                    witness knows of, do anything for the Confederacy. Don't know of his being
                    threatened or abused on account of his being a Union man.</p>
                <p>On cross-examination the witness says it has been so long that he can not
                    recollect whom he heard speak of Mr. Hemp as a Union man. There were not many
                    Union men in this neighborhood during the war. Was at claimant's house
                    frequently during the war. Don't recollect being there when Union soldiers were
                    there, or seeing any Union soldiers in or around his house. W. D. Hemp was in
                    the Confederate army a little while,- they drafted him. (p. 9, Claimant's
                    Brief).</p>
                <p>The following report, dated May 4, 1901, was received from the War Department:</p>
                <p>There is on file in the Confederate archives of this office, one voucher dated
                    Augusta County, December 23, 1864, signed William D. Hemp, for $500 for hay
                    furnished the Confederate States Government.</p>
                <p>The following report was received from the Treasury Department, dated April 27,
                    1892:</p>
                <p>I have the honor to state that the name of William C. Hemp appears in a copy of a
                    list of those voting for ordinance of secession in Augusta County, Virginia.</p>
                <p>The claimant states in his deposition that he never received payment for any
                    supplies furnished the Confederate army. This statement has been proven to be
                    untrue by the above quoted report from the War Department, for according to that
                    report he undoubtedly received at least $500 from that source. His contention
                    that he feed Union soldiers is also flatly contradicted
                    by the testimony of several of the witnesses who lived a short distance from him
                    - one of them only a mile - and who state positively that they never saw any
                    Union soldiers in or around claimant's house. There can be no doubt that
                    claimant was the man referred to in the report from the Treasury Department as
                    having voted for the ordinance of secession. His witnesses state that he voted
                    at Middlebrook; and they also state, with the exception of one witness, that
                    they knew of no man around Middlebrook by the name of William C. Hemp. One
                    witness testifies that he knew of no one by the name of William C. Hemp in
                    Augusta County, Va., and one witness testifies that he knew of one William C.
                    Hemp, a son of claimant, whose age was forty-five or fifty on the 8th of
                    October, 1900. This man (if his name was William C. Hemp) would have been far
                    below the voting age at the time the ordinance of secession was passed.</p>
                <p>In the confusion of taking down the names of voters nothing would have been more
                    natural than to have written a <u>C</u> for a <u>D</u> when claimant's name was called out at the polls.</p>
                <p>This man was so clearly disloyal that it is a waste of time to argue the case
                    further.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, George M. Anderson, Special
                    Attorney.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Reply Brief on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1900-1901.</p>
                <p>WILLIAM D. HEMP VS. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8635 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY TO DEFENDANTS' BRIEF ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>On page 2 of defendants' brief we find claimant quoted as saying that "At the
                    beginning of the rebellion he sympathized with the Union." Counsel for the
                    defense has underscored the word "beginning." Therefore it becomes necessary, on
                    account of the erroneous impression this might make, to call the Court's
                    attention to the fact that this was given in reply to the printed form of
                    questions asked by the Commissioners. "At the beginning of the rebellion did you
                    sympathize with the Union cause or with the rebellion?" In reply to said
                    question claimant does not even use the word "beginning."</p>
                <p>He testifies that he told the rebels that the North would whip; voted for Union
                    candidates to the convention, but did not vote for the ordinance of secession.
                    Afterwards went for the Union and did not go out with his state.</p>
                <p>Another fales impression created by defendants' abstract
                    of testimony occurs on page 5, where Jacob Arehart is quoted as saying that he
                    thought the conduct of claimant during the war was such that he could have
                    established his loyalty to the Confederacy. The testimony on this matter is as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>Cross-examination.</p>
                <p>Q. "Was the conduct of the claimant during the civil war such that he could have
                    established his loyalty to the C.S.A. had they been successful."</p>
                <p>A. "I think so."</p>
                <p>Redirect-examination.</p>
                <p>Q. "In answer to the 6th question on cross-examination you have stated that the
                    claimant, W.D. Hemp, could have established his loyalty to the Confederacy in
                    the event that it had been successful, did you understand this question when you
                    answered it?"</p>
                <p>A. "I understood it of the Union, I never heard him say anything about the
                    Confederacy."</p>
                <p>Q. "When you say you never heard him say anything about the Confederacy do you
                    mean that you never heard him say anything in favor of it?"</p>
                <p>A. "Yes Sir."</p>
                <p>Q. "Now that you understand the 6th question above referred to, which the notary
                    will now read to you, what answer do you make to it??"</p>
                <p>A. "He was always a Union man; he had nothing to say about the Confederacy."</p>
                <p>On page 6 of defendant's brief we find J.B. Cale as testifying that he did not
                    hear much of claimant's public reputation. In his testimony he does make the
                    statement, but, as quoted by the defense, it is only a partial statement, the
                    completed sentence reading, "But when I did hear it spoken of he was spoken of
                    as a Union man."</p>
                <p>Claimant states that he had about 2 tons of hay and some corn taken by the
                    Confederates and was never paid. He was undoubtedly correct in his statement and
                    there is nothing in the Confederate archives indicating that he was paid for 2
                    tons of hay and some corn. The Court, on examination of the original voucher
                    referred to by the defense, will find that a mistake has been made by the War
                    Department in its report and that this should have read 500 <u>pounds of hay and not $500</u>. These small transactions
                    involving supplies of this nature speak for themselves and bear evidence of said
                    supplies being taken by a passing command to meet the immediate needs of said
                    command.</p>
                <p>It is denied that there is any proof that claimant voted for secession. His own
                    statement regarding his vote is clearly and well given and in this he is borne
                    out by the very report from the Treasury Department itself in the difference
                    appearing in the initial of the middle name, and further by the fact that John
                    W. Mish testifies that there were a good many Hemps in that county.</p>
                <p>Another question raised is claimant's service in the Confederate Army. He
                    belonged to the state militia and was twice called into service. He evidently
                    was connected with said militia prior to the war and was therefore subject to
                    orders which as a soldier under the strictest discipline he was compelled to
                    obey or suffer arrest for disobedience. His connection with the militia was the
                    reason for this service, which can therefore be regarded in no way as voluntary,
                    and is thus relieved from the stigma of willing service. All of the witnesses
                    testifying on this point state that if claimant was in any way connected with
                    the Confederate service it was because he was forced.</p>
                <p>All of the witnesses state that claimant bore the reputation among every one of
                    being a Union man and many of them met and conversed with him often and found
                    him always in speech loyal to the Union. Further than this he was powerless to
                    show his loyalty, being all the time within the Confederate lines and coming
                    very little in contact with Union soldiers. These, however, he fed when
                    opportunity offered.</p>
                <p>It is reasonably insisted that the entire evidence shows that claimant gave no
                    voluntary aid to the Confederacy, but was a true Union man in sentiment and so
                    acted and expressed himself whenever occasion offered.</p>

                <p>CLAIMANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Comes now the claimant in this cause, and moves that this Honorable Court do
                    grant a new trial upon the issue of his loyalty, and as grounds for this motion,
                    alleges that in its decision of December 2, 1901, holding that loyalty had
                        not been proven, this Honorable Court erred, as follows, to-wit:-</p>
                <p>1. Said decision is contrary to the evidence and to the weight of the evidence
                    submitted in this cause.</p>
                <p>2. Said decision is contrary to law in that it must have been predicated upon the
                    hypothesis that claimant either voted for Secession or voluntarily served in the
                    Confederate army, neither of which facts have been proven in this case.</p>
                <p>3. It is conclusively shown by the affidavits filed herewith that the claimant
                    William <u>D.</u> Hemp is not the person who under the
                    name of William <u>C.</u> Hemp voted for Secession and
                    volunteered in the Confederate service.</p>

                <p>CLAIMANT'S BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The testimony in this case, condensed and summarized, is substantially, as
                    follows:-</p>
                <p>WILLIAM D. HEMP testified: Resided during the war near Middlebrook, Augusta
                    County, Va. Did not change my business or residence. Never took any oath to the
                    Confederate States. Took the Amnesty Oath in 1865 at Staunton, Virginia. Was
                    called out as a state militia and reported at Staunton in 1861. Was released and
                    again in 1862 was called out and was then left on sick list and was then
                    discharged. Had some hay and corn taken by the Confederates. Was never paid for
                    it. Was never threatened except by hearsay. Never was molested on account of
                    Union sentiments. Did nothing for Union cause except to feed Union soldiers;
                    never had the opportunity to contribute otherwise. Had no near relatives in the
                    Confederate army. Never owned Confederate bonds and never assisted the
                    Confederacy. Never took a pass. I sympathized with the Union and told the Rebels
                    that the North would whip. I voted for Union candidates to the convention. Did
                    not vote for the Ordinance of Secession but went for the Union. I do solemnly
                    say that from the beginning to the end of hostilities, my sympathies were
                    constantly with the Union cause, and I never sought or attempted to injure said
                    cause, etc.</p>
                <p>HENRY MISH testified: Age 60. Farmer. Residance near Middlebrook, Virginia. Have
                    known claimant since 1856. Not interested or related. During the war, claimant
                    lived on my land for a part of the time. Saw him very often, more than once a
                    week, and he always told me that he was in favor of the Union; he complained
                    very much of being forced into the Rebel army; he was in the militia about two
                    months; told me he would rather die than fight; think that most of his Union
                    neighbors regarded him as a Union man; never knew him to do anything for the
                    Union cause; he was a very poor man; he was very quiet and talked but little on
                    any subject. Do not believe from what I have heard him say repeatedly that he
                    could have proven loyalty to the South.</p>
                <p>JOHN ENGLEMAN testified: Age 62. Residence near Middlebrook, Virginia. Not
                    interested or related. Have known claimant about 30 years; lived about two miles
                    from him during the war; we were intimate during that time. I saw him very
                    often, on an average once a week. He hid a load of wheat for me. We talked about
                    the war every time we met; he was always opposed to the war and in favor of the
                    Union. I know that he exerted himself to help men to keep out of the Rebel army.
                    Have heard him talk in presence of others always in opposition to war. All his
                    neighbors regarded him as a Union man. He did nothing for the Confederacy except
                    under compulsion. Don't think that he could have shown any loyalty to the South
                    if he had tried.</p>
                <p>JACOB R. HART testified: Age 69 years. Residence:
                    Middlebrook, Virginia. During the war, resided one and half miles from
                    Middlebrook. Was intimately acquainted with claimant before and during the war.
                    Lived about one-half mile from him. Talked to him about the war, and he always
                    stuck to his own side, the Union side. He always talked that side to me. Could
                    not say how he voted; did not see him vote. His views were that the Secession
                    side would never win. I was not a Union man. Think he was as loyal as a man
                    could be. He was commonly spoken of and regarded as a Union man. Don't know of
                    his doing anything for the Union cause. He gave the Confederacy no aid that I
                    know of. Claimant voted at Middlebrook. Know of no other Hemp family in this
                    neighborhood. His son William C. Hemp, lives above Middlebrook; I suppose he is
                    45 or 50 years old now (in 1900), and he always talked for the Union and never
                    said anything in favor of the Confederacy. He had no brothers or sons in the
                    Confederate army that I know of. Don't think he was in the service. There were
                    not many Union men in this neighborhood. Heard him say many times the South
                    would not be successful.</p>
                <p>JOHN W. MISH testified: Resided near Middlebrook before and during the war.
                    Intimately acquainted with claimant. At beginning of war, lived about three
                    miles from him and later about one and one-half miles from him. Saw him
                    frequently during the war. He and my father conversed frequently during the war;
                    both condemned it; know that claimant was regarded as a Union man; don't know
                    how he voted; impression of everybody was that claimant was a Union man. He was
                    commonly so spoken of and regarded by his neighbors. He gave no aid to the
                    Confederacy that I know of. Don't know of his aiding the Union cause. He was not
                    in the Confederate service that I know of. If he was, it was done under
                    compulsion. Union people here had no chance to aid the Union except helping
                    deserters through, as we were in Confederate lines except for a few days.
                    Claimant lived on my father's place the first two years of the war, and they had
                    frequent talks about the war. Don't know any William C. Hemp here, but there are
                    a good many Hemps in the county. Claimant never furnished supplies to the
                    Confederacy that I know of. Every time I heard claimant spoken of it was the
                    impression of everybody that he was a Union man.</p>
                <p>G.L. R. HART testified: Age 72 years old. Residence
                    near Middlebrook, Virginia. Not interested or related. Have known claimant
                    intimately about 50 years; we talked together during the war; lived about three
                    miles apart. Met him many times; he was opposed to the war and so was I. He was
                    always a Union man but I could not say whether he voted at all. I think that he
                    was opposed to Secession all the time. Think his public reputation was that of a
                    Union man; the people so looked upon him. Don't know of his aiding the Union
                    cause, nor the Confederate cause. Confederates took his property and never paid
                    him. Don't recollect of his being in the Confederate service; if he was he was
                    forced in. This section of the country was in Confederate lines most of the
                    time, and we had no chance to help Union people. I can state positively that
                    claimant throughout the war was a loyal Union man, so far as I know. I was away
                    from January to July, 1864. If there was a William C. Hemp living at Middlebrook
                    during the war, I have forgotten him. Never saw Union soldiers at claimant's
                    home.</p>
                <p>J.B. CALE testified: Age: 62 years. Residence: Arbor Hill, Virginia. Not
                    interested or related. Lived in Augusta county, Virginia, during the war.
                    Intimate with claimant before and during the war. Lived about one mile apart.
                    Talked with him some times; can't tell how often. So far as I know he always
                    talked in favor of the Union; he was opposed to the war. He was on the Union
                    side so far as he had any influence. He did not vote at all; I don't believe
                    they allowed Union people to vote. When he did express himself he was against
                    Secession. I was not a Union man. Did not hear much said about claimant, but
                    when I did hear him spoken of it was as a Union man. He did nothing for the
                    Confederacy that I know of. This section was throughout the war in the
                    Confederate lines. Don't think Union people here had any opportunity to aid the
                    Union cause. Not many Union men here. Don't think that claimant could have
                    established loyalty to the Confederacy. Was at claimant's house some times.
                    Don't recollect seeing Union soldiers there. Claimant was in Confederate army
                    but a little while. He was forced in; they drafted him. No Union soldiers in the
                    vicinity during the war except on the occasion of Hunter's Raid.</p>
                <p>The affidavits, filed herewith in support of this motion, read as follows:-</p>
                <p>I, H.T. SWARTZEL, of the County of Augusta, in the State of Virginia, do solemnly
                    swear that I am well acquainted with William D. Hemp; that I have known him
                    since long before the Civil War; that I have resided in the same community with
                    him continuously ever since; that at the time the question of Secession was
                    first agitated he was a strong Union man, and remained loyal to the Union during
                    the entire war, being outspoken in his views on the subject; that he was
                    impressed into the Confederate service sometime during the second year of the
                    war, but remained only a short time, when he came home and was never afterwards
                    put into service. I also knew one, William <u>C.</u> Hemp
                    quite well; William <u>C.</u> Hemp was a son of Peter
                    Hemp and an old school-mate of mine before the war. William <u>C.</u> Hemp and William <u>D.</u>
                    Hemp were separate and distinct persons, and William <u>C.</u> Hemp has been dead for many years, according to my best recollection,
                    since some time about the close of the war.</p>
                <p>I, J.P. CALE, of the County of Augusta, in the State of Virginia, do solemnly
                    swear that I am well acquainted with William D. Hemp, having known him since
                    long before the war, and having resided continuously ever since in the
                    neighborhood and community of which he is a member. I know that from the time
                    the question of secession was first agitated until the close of the war, he was
                    a strong Union man, and outspoken on all occasions in his convictions and views
                    on the subject. He was impressed, against his earnest protest and despite every
                    effort to escape, into the Confederate Militia Service sometime during the
                    second year of the war, and remained therein for about two months, when he came
                    home on account of sickness, and was never again molested or forced into
                    service, but managed to keep out and stayed in and about his home for the rest
                    of the war. I also know that William <u>C.</u> Hemp who
                    was in the Confederate service, as a volunteer, was a separate and distinct
                    person from William <u>D.</u> Hemp. William <u>C.</u> Hemp died some time about the close of the war
                    and now lies buried in Mt. Tabor Church grave-yard in Augusta County.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that it is in evidence:-</p>
                <p>1. That claimant used what influence he had against Secession and voted for the
                    Union candidates, and that he did not vote for Secession.</p>
                <p>2. That from the beginning to the end of the war, he uniformly expressed himself
                    in opposition to Secession and to the war.</p>
                <p>3. That during the war, he was always confident that the Union cause would win.</p>
                <p>4. That his general reputation in the vicinity in which he lived, both among
                    Union men and Confederate sympathizers was that of a loyal Union man.</p>
                <p>5. That he never voluntarily aided the Confederate army but that he was forced to
                    serve about two months in the State Militia in 1861 and 1862 and had some
                    property taken from him by the Confederate forces.</p>
                <p>The above are the facts which we have proven by legal evidence and concerning
                    which there is no room for any possibility of doubt. What, if anything, has the
                    defense adduced in this case unfavorable to claimant's loyalty? Counsel for the
                    defendant in his brief upon loyalty, after stating that claimant had correctly
                    abstracted the testimony, proceeded to place before the Court a very much
                    garbled abstract of his own, which is exceedingly unfair upon several points as
                    indicated in our reply brief. Practically, however, he brings forth but two
                    points in his brief, which are as follows:-</p>
                <p>1. That claimant is shown by evidence in the Confederate Archives to have sold
                    $500.00 worth of hay to the Confederate Government.</p>
                <p>2. That one William <u>C.</u> Hemp voted for Secession in
                    Augusta County, Virginia.</p>
                <p>As pointed out in our reply brief, the report of the War Department concerning
                    the voucher for hay is entirely erroneous and is exceedingly misleading, the
                    fact being that said voucher was for <u>500</u> pounds of
                    hay and not for <u>$500.00</u> worth-a decided difference
                    to say the least. Nothing can be made out of said voucher by the defense as it
                    was testified in this case by claimant before he knew of such a voucher that the
                    Confederates took about two tons of hay, and also some corn, for which he was
                    not paid.</p>
                <p>Now as to the allegation of the defense that claimant voted for Secession.
                    Claimant's name is shown throughout the record as William <u>D.</u> Hemp. The report of the Treasury Department discloses the fact
                    that one William <u>C.</u> Hemp voted at Middlebrook,
                    Virginia, for Secession. The learned counsel for the defense states:-</p>
                <p>"There can be no doubt that claimant was the man referred to in the report from
                    the Treasury Department as having voted for the Ordinance of Secession."</p>
                <p>When the testimony was taken in this case in 1900, it was sought by the defense
                    to bring out on cross-examination the identity of claimant with said William
                        <u>C.</u> Hemp. In this the defense signally failed.
                    We did not at the time regard it as at all incumbent upon us to show by evidence
                    that William <u>D.</u> Hemp and William <u>C.</u> Hemp were different persons. We did not consider
                    that we were at all concerned with the loyalty or disloyalty of any William
                        <u>C.</u> Hemp, as we were trying the issue of
                    loyalty of William <u>D.</u> Hemp. Certainly no
                    presumption could arise that William <u>D.</u> Hemp, the
                    claimant, voted for Secession under the name of William <u>C.</u> Hemp. The defense took no testimony for the purpose of showing
                    any such identity, and on the face of the record William <u>D.</u> Hemp was not William <u>C.</u> Hemp any
                    more than he was William Jones or William Smith-the names being different, no
                    presumption of identity can obtain; on the contrary, if there is any presumption
                    whatever, it is that of diverse personality.</p>
                <p>In view of the fact that this Honorable Court has seen fit, however, to declare
                    that claimant has not proven his loyalty, we are forced to the conclusion that
                    the Court regarded claimant disloyal by reason of a vote in favor of Secession.
                    We think that our conclusion in this regard is reasonalbe as it would seem to be
                    the only hypothesis upon which to base the finding of the Court. In order to
                    show to the Court, however, by affirmative evidence that the claimant William
                        <u>D.</u> Hemp is not the person William <u>C.</u> Hemp, we have submitted herewith the affidavits
                    of H.T. Swartzell and J.P. Cale.</p>
                <p>We are perfectly willing to submit the evidence of these affiants should the
                    Court so require. We think that the record as it now stands shows with all
                    reasonable certainty that this claimant was loyal and that this Court would be
                    fully warranted in making a finding of loyalty upon the present record instead
                    of remanding the case for a new trial with all the delay incident to such a
                    proceeding.</p>
                <p>We maintain with the utmost respect to this Honorable Court that an injustice-a
                    great injustice has been done in this case, and we pray that a finding be made
                    upon the present record in favor of claimant's loyalty.</p>

                    Claimant. Chas F Consaul, I.M.

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1902-1903.</p>
                <p>WILLIAM D. HEMP, vs. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8635 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>Since the filing of previous briefs in this case upon the motion for a new trial
                    on loyalty, two further affidavits have been secured, which are below abstracted
                    as follows:-</p>
                <p>JACOB B. CALE deposes and says: I reside in Augusta County, Virginia. Age :63
                    years. Am well acquainted with William <u>D.</u> Hemp.
                    Have known him since and long before the Civil war and lived continuously in the
                    same neighborhood with him. I know that he was loyal to the United States before
                    and during the war and was outspoken in his sentiments from the time Secession
                    was first mooted until the close of the war. I know that he was drafted into the
                    Confederate Militia in March, 1862. I was drafted with him and am familiar with
                    all the facts as to his service in the Confederate army. I remained until June,
                    1862, and he left before I did, so he was in less than 90 days. I also solemnly
                    swear that I knew one William <u>C.</u> Hemp, who was a
                    cousin of William <u>D.</u> Hemp. William <u>C.</u> Hemp and I were at school together as boys and I
                    knew him well. He favored Secession and was in the Confederate army. He died
                    some time about the close of the war, either shortly before or shortly
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>JACOB S. ENGLEMAN deposes and says:- Residence: Augusta County, Virginia. I am
                    well acquainted with William <u>D.</u> Hemp; have known
                    him all my life and lived in the sane community with him. I know that he was
                    loyal to the Union before and during the war and outspoken in his sentiments
                    during the whole time. He was drafted into the Confederate Militia in March,
                    1862, and remained in the Confederate service under compulsion for about 60
                    days, when he came home sick and never returned. I also swear that I knew one
                    William <u>C.</u> Hemp, who was a cousin of William <u>D.</u> Hemp. I know that William <u>C.</u> Hemp and William <u>D.</u> Hemp were
                    separate and distinct persons. William <u>C.</u> Hemp has
                    been dead a long time according to my recollection, ever since about the close
                    of the war.</p>
                <p>The above affidavits are filed primarily for the purpose of showing beyond any
                    possible doubt or question that the William <u>C.</u>
                    Hemp who was shown to have voted for Secession was not the Claimant in this
                    case, whose name is William <u>D.</u> Hemp. Affidavits
                    previously filed also fully cover this point.</p>

                <p>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON CLAIMANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>The ground upon which this motion is made is that the court decided the question
                    of loyalty contrary to the evidence. The claimant's attorney has laid no
                    foundation for the introduction of newly discovered evidence and therefore the
                    court is barred from considering the two affidavits which have been filed by him
                    since the finding of the court. The claimant's attorney has made motions for new
                    trials in a large number of cases, in the great majority of which there does not
                    appear to have been much excuse for the trouble caused in going over the same
                    ground and again thrashing out the old straw.</p>
                <p>In any event, the effect is the same, as it compels the defendant to practically
                    enter into the trial of each one of these cases twice, and, if a new trial
                    should be granted, three times. Even if the court should determine to re-open
                    this case and consider the motion upon the evidence, there is no reason whatever
                    for a reversal of the finding of the court. Let us consider the evidence of the
                    claimant himself as to his loyalty. In his original deposition, page 1, (the
                    deposition is taken instead of claimant's brief because an important statement
                    is therein omitted):</p>
                <p>Q. 11. Answer:- I was called out as a State militia and reported at Staunton in
                    1861. I was released and again in 1862 was called out and was in the Valley. I
                    remained in the militia over two months. I then left on sick list and than was
                    discharged.</p>
                <p>Q. 13. Answer:- I never was conscripted.</p>
                <p>(Page 1, claimant's deposition before Commissioners.)</p>
                <p>The claimant states positively and emphatically that his services in the
                    Confederate army were voluntary, and that he was discharged on account of
                    disability. Such being the case, he was clearly disloyal under the provisions of
                    the Bowman act. A number of witnesses were afterwards produced in his behalf who
                    show either remarkable ignorance as to his services in the Confederate army or
                    else they have failed to testify as to what they really know of the claimant's
                        enlistment..</p>
                <p>Henry Mish testifies that claimant was in the militia about two months, was taken
                    sick and and told him that he would rather die than fight. (P. 3 claimant's
                    original brief). Claimant himself does not make any such statement in his
                    testimony. This witness Mish also had a claim before the court, No. 8618
                        Cong.. The case was tried and his loyalty was not
                    found.</p>
                <p>John Engleman testifies that he did nothing in favor of the Confederates except
                    what he was compelled to do. (P. 3 claimant's brief).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken under the rules of court October 8, 1900:</p>
                <p>Jacob Arehart testifies that claimant did not aid the Confederacy that he knows
                    of (p. 4 claimant's brief); don't think he was ever in Confederate service;
                    there were not a great many Union men in neighborhood during war; claimant was
                    never molested or threatened. (P. 5 claimant's brief).</p>
                <p>John W. Mish, a son of Henry Mish, testifies that claimant was never in
                    Confederate service that he knows of, and that if he was he was under
                    compulsion. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>G.L. Arehart testifies that he does not recollect of claimant being in
                    Confederate service; if he was there he was forced in and did not go of his own
                    accord. (P. 7).</p>
                <p>J.B. Clae testifies that W. D. Hemp was in the
                    Confederate army a little while; he was forced in. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>It is rather peculiar that the witnesses produced on behalf of the claimant know
                    more about claimant's services in the Confederate army than he knew himself.
                    Nearly all of then testify that they do not know whether he was in the
                    Confederate army or not, but that if he was he was forced in. He himself
                    testifies that he was not conscripted. In fact in regard to his service in 1861
                    it was impossible for him to have been conscripted. It is hardly possible that
                    the court will consider the two affidavits filed in this case when no foundation
                    has been learnedlaid for the introduction of newly
                    discovered evidence. However, an inspection of them will disclose the fact that
                    they are of no value whatever so far as this case is concerned. They were
                    evidently prepared before hand for the signatures of the two witnesses, H. T.
                    Swartzel and John P. Cale. They recite the fact that there was another William
                    C. Hemp in Augusta county, Virginia, but they do not recite the fact that this
                    William C. Hemp resided in Middlebrook District of Augusta county, whereas the
                    testimony of the witnesses previously examined in this case state that the only
                    William C. Hemp near Middlebrook was a William C. Hemp, son of William D. Hemp,
                    claimant, and that he was 45 or 50 years of age when his testimony was taken on
                    October 8, 1900. The claimant himself has testified that he did not vote for the
                    ordinance of secession (p. 2 claimant's brief. Jacob Erehart (who, by the way, states that he himself was not a Union man)
                    testifies that he cannot say how claimant voted. Never saw him vote, but on
                    cross-examination states that claimant always voted at Middlebrook. There was no
                    other family by the name of Hemp in the neighborhood of Middlebrook that witness
                    knows of during the war. (P. 4 claimant's brief). John W. Mish testifies that he
                    don't know how claimant voted; don't think he ever heard him express any opinion
                    on secession (p. 6 claimant's brief). G.L. Erehart
                    testified that he could not tell whether claimant voted at all or not (p. 7
                    claimant's brief). J.B. Cale testified that claimant did not vote at all on
                    secession (p. 8 claimant's brief). Claimant testifies that he was never molested
                    on account of his Union sentiments, and that the only thing he did for the Union
                    was to feed soldiers. (p. 2 claimant's brief). Nearly all of his witness testify
                    that the neighborhood in which claimant lived was in possession of the
                    Confederates all the time, with the exception of a raid up the valley by General
                    Hunter. G.L. Erehart, who lived only two miles from
                    the claimant, testifies that he did not see any of the Union soldiers around
                    claimant's house during the war (pp. 7 and 8 claimants brief).</p>
                <p>Since this claim was dismissed by the Commissioners of Claims on the ground of
                    disloyalty of claimant, it is respectfully submitted that this motion ought to
                    be dismissed.</p>

                <b>Claimant's Reply Brief for a New Trial on Loyalty</b>
                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term 1901-1902.</p>
                <p>WILLIAM D. HEMP, vs. THE UNITED STATES. No. 8635 Congressional.</p>
                <p>CLAIMANT'S REPLY BRIEF ON MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL ON LOYALTY.</p>
                <p>This reply is addressed to the brief filed herein by the defense on November 28,
                    1902.</p>
                <p>Referring to the statements of defendant's attorney made on page 1 of his brief,
                    we have only to state that we do not feel in any way called upon to apologize
                    either to this Honorable Court or to the learned counsel for the defense for
                    taking what to us seems a necessary step to secure justice for our client.</p>
                <p>Referring to the matter of claimant's service in the Virginia Militia, referred
                    to on page 2 of defendant's brief, we have only to state that it appears on the
                    face of claimant's testimony that his service in this State Militia was anything
                    but voluntary. Claimant states: "<u>I was called out</u>"
                    in the State Militia in 1861. He then states that he was "<u>released</u>" and that he again was "<u>called
                    out</u>" in 1862, and was in the militia about two months. In face of this
                    statement, Counsel for the defense still insists that the claimant has
                    emphatically testified that his services in the Confederate army were voluntary.
                    We submit that this statement by defendant's counsel is not borne out in any way
                    by the testimony in this case.</p>
                <p>Counsel for the defense says that it is very peculiar that a number of claimant's
                    witnesses were ignorant of the fact that claimant was ever in the Confederate
                    service, but, in view of the fact that he never was in the Confederate service
                    but was simply serving in the State Militia, we see no occasion for surprise
                    with regard to this matter. The witnesses did not know that claimant was in the
                    Confederate service for the very good reason that he was not in said service. We
                    concede that claimant was not conscripted in 1861 under the general conscript
                    laws of the Confederacy, but it is a fact well known to this Court that many men
                    were forced to perform service in the Confederate State Militia during the Year
                    of 1861; as claimant states, he was "<u>called out</u>"
                    into this service.</p>
                <p>Under the peculiar circumstances of this case, we are confident that this
                    Honorable Court will accord consideration to the affidavits filed in support of
                    this motion, even though it is not sworn that the evidence is newly discovered,
                    for the reason that the facts set forth in said affidavits were not such as came
                    properly within the scope of claimant's testimony when the same was taken in
                    this case. At the previous taking of testimony we did not consider it incumbent
                    upon us to prove affirmatively that William <u>D.</u>
                    Hemp was not William <u>C.</u> Hemp.</p>
                <p>As it is our desire to present this case more fully to this Honorable Court on
                    oral argument, we do not deem it necessary to extend this brief further.</p>
                <p>Respectfully submitted, Gilbert Moyers Attorney for
                    Claimant. Chas F Consaul, IM
