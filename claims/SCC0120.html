<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                
                Lavell's claim for the value of two horses was disallowed for lack of evidence of
                    active loyalty. His widow appealed this decision to the Court of Claims in
                1893.

                <p>Giving full weight &amp; credit to the statement under oath of claimant
                    himself, he was at best, but a neutral He does not remember whether he took the
                    oath of Allegiance to the Confederate government. He says he had no sympathy
                    with the Confederate government, only wanted the war to cease. His sympathies
                    were with the whole human family &amp; he did not take rides with either
                    party. This is doing pretty well considerig he had two sons in the Confederate
                    army &amp; no relatives in the Union Army, but it is not enough to entitle
                    him to renumeration upon the recommendation of this Commission. The two
                    witnesses called to prove his loyalty testify to nothing material. The claim is
                    rejected</p>

                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the

                <p>ABRAHAM LAVELL, the claimant, testifies age 76; residence Augusta Co., Va. I
                    resided in Augusta Co., Va. six months before April '61. I never passed the
                    Military or Naval lines of the U.S. and entered the Rebel lines. Don't remember
                    to having taken the oath of allegiance to the Confederate Government. Took the
                    amnesty oath in '65 at Staunton, Va. It was required of every one. Have never
                    been pardoned. (P. 1). Questions 6 to 10 inclusive answered in the negative
                    favorable to loyalty. I fed the soldiers of both armies. Questions 12 to 17
                    inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. (p. 2). Had no property
                    taken by the Confederate Government except what was stolen when I was asleep.
                    Never was threatened on account of my Union sentiments. Contributed nothing for
                    the U.S. Govt. during the war, either for the army or navy. I had two sons in
                    the Confederate army. Had no relatives in the Union army. Did nothing to supply
                    them with military equipments or money (P. 3.) I owned 8% bonds of the
                    Confederate Government; did nothing else to support the credit of the
                    Confederate Government. I have never given aid or comfort to the Rebellion.
                    Questions 26 to 32 inclusive answered in the negative favorable to loyalty. (P.
                    4.) I had no sympathy with the Confederate Government; only wished the war to
                    cease. I neither voted for nor against the ordinance of secession. My sympathies
                    were with the whole human family. I did not take sides with either party. The
                    fact is as I said before my sympathies were with the whole human family (P. 5).</p>
                <p>JAS. W. BEARD testifies age 43; residence Augusta Co., Va.; farmer. Live about
                    three miles from claimant Saw him often during the war. Talked with him about
                    the war. He was loyal to the United States Government and so regarded by his
                    loyal neighbors, so far as I know. Never knew him to do anything for either the
                    U.S. or Rebel Governments during the war. Think he was too loyal to the U.S.
                    Government to have been loyal to the Confederate Government, had it succeeded.
                    (P. 8).</p>
                <p>N.K. TROUT testifies age 52; residence Staunton, Va. Lawyer. Have known the
                    claimant 30 years He has lived within five miles of Staunton since I have known
                    him. Saw him frequently during the war. Had no doubt as to his loyalty to the
                    U.S. Government during the war. He was opposed to the war in the beginning and
                    desired the restoration of the Government. I think he was too loyal to the
                    United States to have been loyal to the Confederate Government, had it
                    succeeded. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court. This testimony was taken Oct. 12th, 1893.</p>
                <p>LUCY A LAVELL, testifies housekeeper; age 47; residence Staunton, Va. Interested;
                    widow of the deceased claimant. (P. 1). I was married to Mr. Lavell in 1862.
                    Knew him about four years before I was married. Didn't live very far from him.
                    About a mile and a half. He was sixty years old when I married him. I heard him
                    talk a good deal about the war. He was against it. He talked with Mr. Myers and
                    Mr. Beard about the war. They were neighbors of ours and came to see us right
                    often. They were against the war; Union people. (P. 2.) They said they had
                    better let the war alone; it would be a bad day's work. I heard them talking
                    sitting on the porch at my house. Mr. Lavell was not in favor of his two sons
                    going into the Confederate army. He told them it would be a bad day's work if
                    they went into that army. They had families at the time. He told them that he
                    would not take care of their families; they would have to do the best they
                    could. My husband did not vote for secession. He was at home on election day.
                    (P. 3.) He did not go to the election at all. He was not in the Confederate
                    army. He had two sons in the Rebel army and he was opposed to it. Their names
                    were David Lavell and Abraham Lavell. The Confederates got property from my
                    husband. They came and took the hay out of the barn and a barrel of flour and
                    killed some shoats. They took seven sheep skins. They took two horses. One was a
                    dark bay and the other an iron gray. My husband did not tell them they might
                    have the horses and the other property. (P: 4.) They did not take any of this
                    property at his request. They came in the fore part of the day and took the
                    horses and at night they took the hay and flour. Mr. Lavell did not allow them
                    to have this property for the purpose of helping the war along. He did not want
                    to help the war along. From what I know of my husband's feelings and sentiments,
                    I can say that he was in favor of the United States Government from the
                    beginning to the close of the war. The people in our neighborhood in favor of
                    the U.S. Government, thought he was all right in believing what he did. His son
                    enlisted April 18th, '61 at Lexington, Va., in Co. "C", First Va. Cavalry,
                    Confederate Troops. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>I was married on Sept. 8th, 1862. The matters I have related to and conversations
                    with him occurred after we were married. The sons enlisted in the army after we
                    were married. They were both married. They were living away from home when they
                    went into the war. (P. 6). One lived about 36 miles and the other three miles.
                    (P. 7):</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Abraham Lavell the claimant, was 66 years of age at the commencement of the war.
                    He resided during the war in Augusta Co., Va. He did not vote for nor against
                    secession. Did not take sides with either party. He owned 8% bonds of the
                    Confederate Government.</p>
                <p>His witnesses testify that he expressed loyal sentiments during the war. He had
                    two sons in the Confederate army. It appears however, that they had families and
                    were living by themselves. One of his sons was named Abraham.</p>
                <p>It is very evident from the testimony that it was his son and not himself that
                    voted for secession.</p>

                <p>IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>Estate of Abraham Lavell, dec'd vs. The United States. No. 8616--Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <u>Defendant's Brief on Loyalty.</u>
                </p>
                <p>This claim is for two horses, valued at $300, alleged to to have been taken from
                    the decedent near Minot Spring, just south of Staunton, Augusta Co.,
                    Va. by United States troops on June 6, 1864.</p>
                <p>It was rejected by the Commissioners of Claims for lack of proof of loyalty.</p>
                <p>The decedent, who testified before a special commissioner in Sept. 1871, did not
                    claim to have been more than neutral, explaining his neutrality by the statement
                    that his sympathies were with "the whole human family". As a portion of that
                    family the people of the Confederate States necessarily came in for their share
                    of that sympathy. In answer to the 34th interrogatory, he utterly failed to
                    respond to the searching questions as to loyalty, therein propounded, and merely
                    repeated his former statement as to his sympathy with the human family. The
                    decedent did not vote on the question of secession, but did not claim that it
                    would have been dangerous for him to vote against it. He <u>did not remember</u> having taken an oath of all allegiance to the
                    Confederacy. He took the amnesty oath in 1865. He owned some 8% bonds of the
                    Confederate Government, and had two sons in the Southern army.</p>
                <p>The Confederate Archives contain two vouchers for payments to A. Lavell at
                    Staunton, viz.: $28. for two dozen sheep skins, June 14, 1862, and $55O. fora
                    bay mare, Dec. 1. 1863. The signatures appear to have been written by the
                    decedent. In his testimony in 1871, the decedent said, "I had no property taken
                    by the Confederate Government except what was stolen when I was asleep"; and
                    hence the property mentioned in tne vouchers must have been sold to the
                    Confederacy and not "taken" by it. The decedent's widow, in her recent
                    depositions, states that the Confederates took two horses, seven sheep skins,
                    and some other articles, the latter at night, but the horses in the day time. As
                    he did not himself say that any horses were impressed it cannot be presumed that
                    they were so taken.</p>
                <p>The Archives also present<sup>contain</sup> a voucher
                    for the services of two slaves paid for near Lexington, Va., but although the
                    signature resembles that of the decedent it may be his son's. A quartermaster's
                    return of hay purchased of A Lavell near Lexington, Va, June 24, 1864, but not
                    paid for, may also refer to the son.</p>
                <p>In conclusion it is submitted that the depositions in favor of the decedent's
                    loyalty (that of J.W. Beard and N.K. Trout in 1871, and of the decedent's widow
                    in 1893) would be too meagre and indefinite to prove loyalty even if they were
                    not completely refuted by the decedent's own admissions of mere neutrality, and
                    of ownership of Confederate bonds, and by the evidence of his dealings with the
                    Confederacy.</p>
