<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Harriet Doom filed this claim in 1879 for $150, claiming the Union army took on
                    horse from her deceased husband Jacob Coffman in 1864 after the battle of the
                    Piedmont. Harriet was a 31 year old who had remarried to George Doom, a
                    Unionist, and resided near New Hope. The claim was disallowed due to her
                    deceased husband's disloyalty to the Union.

                <b>Harriet Doom</b>
                <p>My name is <u>Harriet Doom</u>, my age <u>31</u> years, my residence <u>New Hope Augusta Co.</u>, in the State of <u>Virginia</u>, and my occupation a ____, I am the claimant, and have
                    beneficial interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>I was the widow of Jacob Coffman Sr. He died in March 1869. He was a Union man. I
                    have four3 children by Mr Coffman my first husband. Jacob
                    Jr., 8 years old, John Samuel, Wm H. 6 years old next october, W.
                    Henry 4 years old. My husband left a will but he named no Executor and Mr.
                    Samuel Kennedy qualified in May 1869 as Administrator. I think he was named as
                    executor in the will. He died not file this petition because he said he was a
                    southern man and wouldnt have anythin to do with it. I told him to make the
                    claim and he just laughed at it. I saw the mare charged taken. It was the day
                    after the Piedmont fight in June 1864, about 7 oclock in the morning. She was
                    hitched to a cherry tree not 5 yards from our house and a mar came in from the
                    road and took her out to a colonel who was waiting in the road about 100 yards
                    from my house, when he reached the Col, a saddle
                    and bridle was put on our horse and the Colonel got on
                    himher himself and rode up to my gate and backwards and
                    forwards in front of my house and she frequently neighed to come in. His army
                    was there several hours. It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon before they left. I
                    don't know the name of the Colonel. I don't know whether he belonged to a
                    Cavalry, Infantry, Command, I did not go out of my house. I was of me
                    My husband, myself and a step-grandson saw the horse taken. Noone else saw the
                    horse taken. My Grandson who was present then is now out in Kansas. It was a
                    dark bay with a blaze face about 7 years old, She was a tolerable large brute,
                    she was sound and a good beast too as ever lived. She was worth $150, at that
                    time, I got no receipt we did not ask for any, we were confused and scared, I
                    saw the Col on our mare. I knew he was some officer by his uniform, I know no
                    more about it. Further saith not</p>

                    all the time it was going on, I don't know that I remmeber what he said. I heard

                    to do the way they want us to do. I judged from that that he was had
                    voted for secession, I think he was scared into it. I never knew him to
                    contribute anything in aid of either gov't
                    during the war. I never knew him to own any Confederate bonds or to do anything

                    knew. He was generally regarded as a Union man. He was so regarded by his loyal
                    neighbors, I never knew him to be molested or threatened with injury on account
                    of his Union sentiments. I was a Union man during the war and the claimant so
                    regarded me. I no of nothing he said or done during the

                    it. a man of the name of Thos. Turk brought him up to the polls at the time and
                    told him to vote for Secession &amp; he done it. I
                    know that before that time Jacob Coffman was very bitter on the abolitionists
                    and Rebupblicans at the North. he was in the habit of using very bitter language
                    about them, a while after the war began he seemed to change and my impression
                    was that he was in favor of the Union. I cannot State a Single act of his that
                    Showed him to be loyal to the Federal Government he was too old to take any
                    active part in the war.</p>

                <p>In the matter of the Claim for Harriet Doom No. 16243</p>
                <p>Harriet Doom the Claimant testifies that the horse for which claim is made
                    belonged to her husband Jacob Coffman. That the Horse was taken by a Federal
                    Colonel for his own use. Nathaniel Talley testifies, knowd Jacob Coffman. He voted for Secession was a strong confederate
                    &amp; done what he could to aid the confederate
                    cause.</p>
                <p>Henry K. Eakle testifies knowd Jacob Coffman. he voted
                    for Secession and was bitter on the abolitionists &amp; Republicans of the
                    North. That a while after the war began he seemed to change, and was now of the
                    impression he was a Union man.</p>
                <p>This claim ought not to be paid. The horse did not go to the Use of the Army
                    officers were obliged to furnish their own horses of their own expense, not at
                    the expense of the Government. Jacob Coffman to whome
                    the horse belong<sup>d</sup> was
                    disloyal. Respectfuly Submitted to the Claim<sup>s</sup>Coms. Washington
