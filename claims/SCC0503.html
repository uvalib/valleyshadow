<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>David Dull Jr.</b>
                <p>Deposition of David Dull jr.</p>
                <p>Answer to 1<sup>st</sup>gen<sup>l.</sup> question. My name is David Dull jr. My age is 47 years. My occupation a Cooper. My
                    residence near Arbor Hill in Augusta County. I am not related to the Claimant
                    and have no interest in the claim. I was present and saw the property taken.</p>
                <p>Ques. 3. Ans. The Stallion was in the stable and the others in a field adjoining
                    the barn. The Corn was in the granary and the Bacon in the Smoke house and also
                    the flour.</p>
                <p>Ques. 4. Ans. It was about the 9<sup>th</sup> of June 1846. I
                    have no idea of the number of Soldiers. I suppose two companies of Cavalry.
                    There was an officer present whom the soldiers called Captain. I did not hear
                    any name.</p>
                <p>Ques. 5. Ans. Mrs. Hanger's (the claimant) children were present.</p>
                <p>Ques. 6. Ans. The soldiers called one man Captain. I heard no name. He the
                    Captain told me that they needed the property.</p>
                <p>Ques. 7. Ans. The Stallion was taken out of the stable and the other horses out
                    of a field the Bacon &amp; flour from the Smoke house &amp; the Corn out
                    of the granary.</p>
                <p>Ques. 8. Ans. The horses were led except the Stallion he was rode a soldier
                    getting off his horse and mounted him. The Corn was shelled and carried away in
                    three bags by Soldiers on horse back. The Flour was carried in Sacks, and the
                    Bacon (3 pieces) carried in hand.</p>
                <p>Ques. 9. Ans. The Command was then en route towards Staunton. I did not follow
                    after.</p>
                <p>Ques. 10. Ans. I never saw the property after they left claimants house.</p>
                <p>Ques. 11. Ans. I made complaint to the Captain stating that the owner of the
                    property was a Union man and he replied that they needed the property but for me
                    to keep a list of the articles and that they would be paid for after awhile.</p>
                <p>Ques. 12. There was no receipt given nor asked for.</p>
                <p>Ques. 13. Ans. The property was taken in the day time about 10 A.M. and 3 P.M.</p>
                <p>Ques. 14. Ans. There was no camp nearer than Staunton. Gen<sup>l.</sup> Hunter had a battle at
                    Piedmont on the Sunday before the property was taken. Gen<sup>ls.</sup> Crook and Averall were on
                    their way to Staunton where they united with Gen<sup>l.</sup> Hunter. Then camped at that place and
                    remained in Camp until the Friday after the Piedmont battle. I knew no Quarter
                    Master.</p>
                <p>Ques. 15. Ans. The Stallion was in fine order 4 years old of good size near 16
                    hands high, well broken. The large bay mare was 6 years old, large and in fine
                    order. The next 4 years old was a good animal. The horse (bay) 9 years old, was
                    a noble good horse. All the horses were sound and I think worth all
                    that is charged. There 3 sacks filled with Corn. 3 pieces of Bacon, which I
                    judged would weigh 40 pounds and two barrels of flour emptied into bags. I do
                    not think any of the charges are too much.</p>
                <p>Deposition of Same witness as to the loyalty of Claimant.</p>
                <p>I have known the claimant for 20 years and her deceased husband from his boyhood.
                    I lived about 200 yards from them during the War. I was very intimate with both.
                    I saw one or the other every day. I never heard either of them express
                    themselves but the bitterest terms against the rebellion. I have heard them
                    converse frequently in the presence of others and were always and invariably in
                    favor of the Union. And whenever the rebels gained a victory the claimant and
                    her husband were depressed and sorry. I often heard them wish the Union Army
                    would come. I think his Union neighbors believed him to be a sincere friend of
                    the Union. I was a Union man and I had full confidence in the claimant and her
                    husband. I heard the claimant advise her brother to go through the lines to the
                    Union Army. I never knew them to do anything for the United States. The only
                    thing that claimants husband did was to burn Charcoal a short time. The claimant
                    did nothing he did not vote for the Ordinance of Secession, nor put in a
                    substitute. I am satisfied that if the South had gained its independence, they
                    could not have staid in it.</p>

                <p>Deposition of David Thornton</p>
                <p>Answer to first general question. My name is David Thornton, my age is 64 years.
                    My occupation is a farmer. I am not related to the claimant and have no benefit
                    in the claim. I have known the claimant for 10 years or more and her husband 15
                    years. After the first year of the War I lived about 1/4 mile from claimant. We
                    were intimate during the War. I saw him very often and talked about the War and
                    his sympathies were constantly with the Union and I think the claimant was
                    always loyal to the United States. I think the Union men of the
                    neighborhood regarded them both as good and loyal to the United States. I never
                    knew them to do anything to aid the rebellion. The claimant and her husband both
                    knew me to be a Union man. If the South had been successful I do not believe
                    they could have staid in the South at all.</p>
