                <p>18. I never was in the service of the Confederate Government, of any kind
                    whatsoever. I did sell some Tobacco to soldiers, as a trade of business which I
                    did for the support of my family. I never give any information, except once to a
                        Col. W.S. Jackson, who asked me if I knew where
                    the Union Army where. I told him in Staunton and when he
                    afterwards heard that I was a Union man, he tried to have me arrested, but I had
                    left home.</p>
                <p>19. I never, in any manner, was employed in the manufacture of munitions of war,
                    clothing, boats, shoes, saddles, or any article whatever, nor did I ever assist
                    others so engaged.</p>
                <p>20. I never was directly or indirectly employed in any collections or
                    impressments of any stores, supplies or of any article whatever for the benefit
                    of the Confederate Government, or any State in rebellion, or the army Navy or
                    other forces thereof. Nor had I any share or interest in any contract with, or

                    rebellion, or its forces.</p>
                <p>21. I never was engaged in blockade running, or illicit traffic between the
                    lines. I never had any interest in any goods, wares, merchandise, stores, or

                <p>22. I did leave the so called Confederate States, in the summer 1864. I went from
                    my home in Augusta Co, to New Creak Station W.Va. I went to keep out of the rebel service,
                    taking with me my two sons and sixfourteen (14) other men, I remained
                    in the Union lines until June 1865, when I returned home. I worked at my trade

                <p>24. I never was arrested, always managing to keep out of the way, of the rebels
                    who were seeking me. I was arrested by the Union forces, in W.Va. but released in a few hours. The arrest
                    was made to send all refugees farther west, thinking that they might make
                    communications to the rebel forces, commanded by Genl. Rosser, but upon an investigation I was honorably released. I had
                    taken the oath, previously at New Creek Station.</p>

                <p>29. I never done anything for the U.S.
                    Government, or its Army or for the Union cause during the war, except by going

                <p>30. I had one brother, James F. Acord, in the rebel army. He is now living, and
                    resides near Mt. Solon in Augusta Co. I never
                    furnished him with any military equipments clothing or money. I did nothing for
                    him while he was in the rebel service.</p>
                <p>31. I never owned any bonds or any interest or share therein, or had any shares

                    contribute to support the credit of the so called Confederate States during the
                    late rebellion.</p>
                <p>32. I never voluntarily give aid &amp; comfort to the
                    rebellion.</p>
                <p>33. I never was engaged in making raids into the United States, from Canada, nor
                    in the destruction of the commerce of the United States in any lake or river,
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>34. I never engaged in holding in custody, directly or indirectly any persons
                    taken by the rebel government as prisoners of war, or any persons imprisoned or
                    confined by the Confederate government or the authorities of any State in
                    rebellion, for political causes.</p>
                <p>35. I never belonged to any company or association for imprisoning, expelling,
                    executing or persecuting any persons on account of their loyalty to the United
                    States Government.</p>
                <p>36. I never was parolled.</p>

                <p>38. I never had any pass, from any officer, or others, acting for the Confederate
                    Government.</p>
                <p>39. I was under no disabilities at all. I have held no office since the war.</p>
                <p>40. I sympathised with the union cause. My
                    feelings and language was always in favor of the Union and against the
                    rebellion. I exerted my influence in favor of the Union and voted for Union
                    Candidates to the State Convention in 1861. I did not vote on the ratification
                    of the ordinance of Secession, after its adoption, I still adhered to the Union.</p>
                <p>41. I do declare that from the beginning of hostilities against the United States
                    to the end thereof, my sympathies were constantly with the cause of the United
                    States; that I never of my own free will and accord, did anything or offered, or
                    sought or interrupted to do anything, by word or deed to injure said cause or
                    retard its success and that I was at all times ready and willing when called
                    upon, or if called upon, to aid and assist the cause of the Union or its
                    supporters, so far as my means and power and the circumstances of the case
                    permitted.</p>
                <p>1. I was not at my house when the property was taken, had gone to a mill 1/2 mile
                    off, for some flour, and did not see the property taken, but saw the property in
                    the possession of Union forces, when I met them between the Mill and my house.
                    The property consisted of two Mares, a black and brown, the black was six years
                    old and the brown five years, they were both in good condition. They also took
                    two saddles and two bridles. I spoke to some of the officers about my property
                    and wanted a receipt, but they were marching and said if I would come to their
                    Camp that night they would do so. I did not go for the reason that the distance
                    was too great, and I had no way to go except on foot. The property was taken in
                    June 1864, about the 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> I think. It was by a force in charge of prisoners captured at
                    Piedmont, detached from Genl David Hunter, and on their march to Parkersburg
                        W.Va. I suppose there was not less than
                    1500 in the command.</p>
                <p>5. Wm. J.D. Riley, was present with my family and saw them taken.</p>
                <p>6. I did not learn of the names of the officers.</p>
                <p>7. I was not present when taken.</p>
                <p>8. The soldiers were riding the horses when I saw them.</p>
                <p>9. They were marching. I did not follow.</p>
                <p>10. I suppose for the use of the Cavalry, as they were mounted on the Mares, when
                    I met them.</p>
                <p>11. I did not make any complaint but merely asked for a receipt. I told them I
                    had always been for the Union, and for that reason had left my horses in the
                    stable. I did not know the name of any officers.</p>
                <p>12. I asked for a receipt, but was refused for the reason that they were then
                    marching, that was the only objection given.</p>
                <p>13. The property was taken in the morning, about 7 Oclock. There was no secrecy
                    in taking the property.</p>
                <p>14. There was no encampment in that vicinity. The main Army was in and around
                    Staunton. There had been a battle on the Sunday previous at Piedmont in Augusta
                        Co.</p>
                <p>15. The Mares were in good condition sound and healthy. The saddles &amp;
                    bridles were about half worn, but I think worth all that I have charged as also
                    the Mares. I never received any pay.</p>

                    interest in the claim.</p>
                <p>1. I was within a very short distance, just across the street of the village.</p>
                <p>2. I saw them take the two horses.</p>
                <p>3. I did not hear anything said, particularly. The horses were taken out of the
                    stable, which stood a short distance from the claimants dwelling house. I do not
                    recollect whether there were any officers at the stable or not. There were a
                    number of men in the alley leading to the stable. The horses were taken by men
                    in the main force, and not by followers or stragglers.</p>
                <p>4. They were taken at West View, a village, six miles west of Staunton on the
                    Parkersburg Turnpike road. In June 1864, probably the 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup>. They were taken by a command in
                    charge of prisoners, en route to Parkersburg W.Va. There were a number of soldiers in the stable alley. I suppose
                    there were 1500 or more in the command, and very nearly all present when the
                    horses were brought from the stable. The claimants house was seperated from the street or road by a small yard.
                    They were only a few minutes engaged in taking the horses and then marched on.</p>
                <p>5. No one that I recollect except claimants wife and children.</p>
                <p>6. I saw officers there, I do not know what their rank was, or their names, nor
                    the regiment. The command was a part of Genl.
                    Hunter's Army, detached in charge of prisoners, captured at Piedmont. I heard no
                    orders given, or anything said at all.</p>
                <p>7. The horses were taken from the stable, and lead out of the Alley.</p>
                <p>8. As well as I recollect they were leading the horses the last I saw of them, as
                    I left when they came out of the Alley.</p>
                <p>9. The command was marching west in the direction of Parkersburg. I did not
                    follow them. I saw the the horses in their possession, as I have before said.</p>
                <p>10. I suppose the horses were for the use of the cavalry. Though I do not know,
                    as I never saw them afterwards.</p>
                <p>11. There was no complaint that I recollect of.</p>
                <p>12. There was no receipt or voucher given that I know of. None asked that I
                    heard.</p>
                <p>13. The property was taken in the morning after sunrise.</p>
                <p>14. There was no encampment nearer than Staunton, there had been a battle at
                    Piedmont a few days previous. I knew no officer or any rank at all.</p>
                <p>15. The horses were in good condition, both Mares, brown color one darker than
                    the other. I am not certain about their ages, probably five and six years old. I
                    think the darker colored one was worth one hundred and seventy five dollars, and
                    the other, one hundred and fifty dollars. They were good horses.</p>
                <p>I know nothing about the saddles and bridles.</p>
                <p>I had a conversation with claimant at one time about the value of the horses, and
                    my opinion then was as now, that they were worth $175.00 &amp; $150.00.</p>
                <p>Further this deponent saith not.</p>

                <b>Andrew J. Palmer</b>
                <p>Deposition of Andrew J. Palmer</p>
                <p>Ans. to 1st general question-My name is A.J. Palmer, my age 43 years, residence
                    near Staunton Va. My occupation a Miller. I was
                    not present when the property specified in claimants account was taken.</p>
                <p>2. I saw them a very short time after they were taken, in the possession of the
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>3. I was at the valley Mill, about 1/2 mile from the claimants house, when I saw
                    the property, the Command was marching when I saw them, in the direction of
                    Parkersburg, and were then on the Parkersburg Turnpike road. There was a soldier
                    riding the bay or brown Mare, and another soldier was leading the black Mare.
                    The soldier, that was leading the black Mare, was walking. I am not mistaken
                    about the two Mares mentioned being the property of the claimants.</p>
                <p>4. As I did not see them taken, I do not know where they were taken from, but
                    suppose the claimants stable or lot, as they were coming directly on the road
                    from his house. They were taken on the _____ day of June, 1864. I should judge
                    there were about 1400 soldiers, in charge of the prisoners captured at Piedmont.</p>
                <p>5. I do not recollect how many were present other than officers. I do not
                    recollect any names.</p>
                <p>6. There were several officers along with the command. There was a Colonel who
                    told me his name, but I have forgotten it.</p>
                <p>7. I did not hear anything said by officers or soldiers or officers in
                    relation to the claimants property.</p>
                <p>8 &amp; 9. A soldier was riding one, and another soldier was walking and
                    leading the other Mare. The command was en route toward Parkersburg W.Va. I did not follow, nor do not know where
                    the went to.</p>
                <p>10. I know nothing of the use made of the horses. I only know that I saw them in
                    the possession of the soldiers.</p>
                <p>11. I do not recollect of hearing of any complaint being made.</p>
                <p>12. I know of no receipt being given or asked. I heard no conversation about the
                    taking of the property.</p>
                <p>13. The property was taken in the morning, directly after breakfast.</p>
                <p>14. Staunton was the nearest encampment, about 6 miles from claimant. They
                    remained in Staunton about four days. The battle of Piedmont took place a few
                    days before.</p>
                <p>15. The horses were in good working order, both young. The bay was 5 years and
                    the black 6 years, both of good size. I suppose the black worth $140.00 and the
                    bay $120.00. I dont recollect of talking with claimant about the price. I have
                    no interest in the claim.</p>

                <p>My name is Samuel Driver, my age is 38 years, my residence near Swopes Depot,
                    Augusta Co.Va.
                    occupation a farmer &amp; minister in the German Baptist or Dunkard Church.
                    I have known the claimant 14 years. We have been all that time very intimate, we
                    lived one mile apart for 12 years, the past two years, he has resided in
                    Staunton, Va. I saw him very often during the war. I saw him at times every day,
                    and again not for two or more weeks. Our conversation was generally about the
                    war, when we met. I think from all the information I could get from him that he
                    was untiringly a union man. Our sympathies were both in favor of the Union. I
                    think that the claimant regarded me as in favor of the Union. When the subject
                    of the Ordinance of Secession came up we talked about it, and he told me that he
                    would not vote for it, and after the war commenced, there was a Military board
                    organized at Staunton to examine men for the army, he &amp; I were exempt,
                    and afterwards the order for our exemption was revoked.</p>

                    known the claimant for 30 years. I was intimate with him during the war, resided
                    in about two miles of him. I saw him frequently during the War, and conversed
                    with him about the war, and never heard him say a word in favor of the Southern
                    Confederacy. He regarded me as a Union man, my sentiments were well known to all
                    that knew me. I knew him the claimants Union sympathies by his words and acts. I
                    do not recollect of hearing him converse in the presence of others. We were
                    always alone, in our conversations about the War, as far as I ever heard, his
                    reputation as a Union man, was unquestioned by his loyal neighbors. I never knew
                    him to contribute any property or money in aid of the Union cause. There was no
                    chance for any of us to do so. I do not know that he was ever in person or
                    family molested or threatened by the Confederate authorities. I do not know that
                    he ever contributed anything to aid the Confederate cause, my impression is he
                    did not. I do not know that he ever owned any bonds, or that he done anything to
                    sustain the credit of the Confederate States. From his language and acts, he
                    never could have maintained loyalty to the Confederate government, if it had
                    gained its independence.</p>
