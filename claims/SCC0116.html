<h3>Southern Claims Commission: Claim of Jacob B. Carwell,
                            August 17, 1871, Claim No. 1380</h3>
<div id="mainResults">
<p class="psummary"><b>Summary:</b> 
                Carwell's claim for farm animals was disallowed because he purchased a substitute
                    for Confederate Army service, despite the fact that he left the Confederacy and
                    worked in a U.S. Quartermaster's office in West Virginia. Carwell appealed this
                    decision to the Court of Claims in 1895. Of particular interest is Carwell's
                    brother's testimony, which claims that Carwell also served in the Home Guards of
                    a town near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.

                    Confederate Govt. Nor by the U.S. Had no property taken by the Confederate
                    authorities I never was threatened with damage for my Union sentiments. Never
                    molested, except to be cursed at. I never contributed any money in aid of the
                    Union army., except being employed in the Q.M. Dept., in W. Va. I never did anything, except to
                    leave myself, and help to take 37 men beyond the Confederate lines. Had a cousin
                    in the Union army, and a brother in the Confederate army. I gave no aid to the
                    rebellion. (P. 4). Never engaged in making raids. Never a paroled prisoner.
                    Never held an office of any kind, nor educated in any school of the U.S. Never
                    received a pass from any officer of the Confederate Govt. Not under any
                    disabilities, and held no office since the war. I sympathized with the Union
                    cause from the beginning to the end of the war. I exerted my influence on the
                    side of the Union. Did not vote for the ordinance of secession. Solemnly
                    declares from the beginning of hostilities to the end sympathies with the U.S.,
                    Never did anything to injure said cause, but was always ready and willing to aid
                    it. (P. 5). I am 30 years old, reside in Augusta Co., Farmer. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>GEO. RUBUSH testifies: Age 60; residence Augusta Co.,
                    Va., farmer. I have known the claimant 18 years. Knew him well during the war.
                    He was a good Union man, and as far as I know so regarded by his neighbors. I
                    have heard him speak against the war, He went North with a number of other men
                    to keep out of the rebel service. He could not have shown any loyalty to the
                    Confederacy. (P. 9).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court. In Aug. 1895.</p>
                <p>R.A. HELMS testifies: Boot &amp; Shoe dealer; age 56; residence Middlebrook,
                    Va. Not interested or related. (P. 1). My acquaintance with the claimant began
                    in '61. Intimate throughout the war; resided within a half mile of him. Saw him
                    very frequently, nearly every for their mail. He was always opposed to secession
                    and the Confederate cause. . I was an adherent of the Union cause, and known as
                    such to the claimant. (P. 2). He went North shortly after the commencement of
                    the war, and so I did not see much of him for awhile, until he returned. He was
                    regarded by his loyal neighbors as a Union man. At the first of the war, or
                    shortly after he went North. He afterwards returned to the Confederate lines and
                    took other men with him into the Union lines. I know on his second trip through
                    the lines he took fourteen men with him, one of them being his younger brother.
                    Did not do anything to aid the Confederate Govt. that I know of. He did not vote
                    at all in '61., not having yet reached his majority. He was too young to do much
                    but was regarded as a Union man. His views never changed. (P. 3). His father and
                    brother were both loyal man. He was outside the
                    Confederate lines, most of the war. He did not return permanently before the
                    close of the war.. I don't know if he was employed in the Q.M. Dept. of the
                    Union army, in W. Va.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Some of the deserters he assisted through the lines were acquaintances of his,
                    and some were not. He assisted them both to aid them, and aid the Union army. I
                    have heard you (referring to Govt. Atty.) ask claimant to allow you to
                    cross-examine him, and he firwt refused, and afterwards
                    upon directing the notary to summon him, consented to cross-examination. Names
                    those whom claimant assisted through the Union lines. (P. 4). He assisted them
                    all at the same time. This was when he went the second time. We all went
                    together as far as Beverly, W. Va. there the crowd dispersed, and went to
                    different points. Claimant did not return until after the close of the war. Wm.
                    Letchew, John Harris, James Beard and the others went to Middlebrook. Those of
                    claimants acquaintances were all on good terms with claimant, there was some not
                    intimately acquainted with claimant. They met at Mr. Carwell's house one night,
                    according to the arrangement we had all made together, and started off together.
                    Claimant might have been slightly acquainted with all of them. Claimant was
                    familiar with the road; he was pilot. (P. 5). We were not simply away from the
                    country to keep from fighting, and out of the war. I didn't suppose that was the
                    sentiment of all. They didn't fell any interest in
                    fighting, or rather I did not.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>I would not have fought on either one, if I could have avoided it. (P 6).</p>
                <p>J.B. CARWELL testifies: Farmer; age 48; residence Middlebrook, Va. Brother of
                    claimant. (P. 7). I was with the claimant the first and latter part of the war.
                    He was not in for secession at all; he was opposed to that. He did not vote at
                    all, he was not old enough. I don't remember about conversations, but I know he
                    was bitterly opposed to the war: He was regarded as a Union man by his loyal
                    neighbors. He did not do anything for the Confederacy. He took about 15 persons
                    across the lines into the Union lines. He went North and staid until after the war had gone on some time, then came back, and
                    went a second time. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>I was with him all the time after he went away the second time, and we didn't
                    come back until after the war was over. I was a Union man. I was one of the men
                    he assisted through the lines. All my family were Union people. He and I were in
                    the Q.M. Dept. of the Union army at Martinsburg. I can't say positively, but I
                    think from his sentiments his service would have been on the Northern side. He
                    took the amnesty oath. Think he lost the certificate.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Names some of the men claimant took into the Union lines. (P. 9). Geo. Bowers was
                    with us. Don't remember Smith., nor Thos. B. Reed, nor Crisp. There was a man by
                    the name of East. I don't suppose he went to get out of the range of bullits, because he joined the Home Guards in Pa. I
                    couldn't answer whether he took the crowd with him to help the Federals. (P.
                    10). I know it was very dangerous for a man to go from this country then going
                    through W. Va., to speak of one's doing so in time of war. When claimant took
                    these men, I suppose he wanted company, and he wasn't in sympathy with the
                    Confederate cause. My blood does not grow hot when any body speaks of
                    Confederates as rebels. I was in Pa. when my brother joined the Home Giards. That Home Guards did not do any fighting while
                    we were there. I don't think the company ever left the town where it was
                    organized. It was close to Chambersburg. I don't remember the county. We worked
                    in Chambersburg awhile. I can't exactly tell how long my brother was in Pa. From
                    Pa. we went to Martinsburg, W. Va. (P. 11). My brother and I were in the
                    Commissary Department, in the wood dept. we were engaged to haul wood for
                    whatever troops came in.</p>
                <p>We were in Martinsburg the latter part of '61, I think.</p>
                <p>RE-DIRECT.</p>
                <p>It was more dangerous for a man of Union sentiments to stay in this County, than
                    to go through to W. Va. alone. If the Home Guards at Chambersburg, has been
                    called out, claimant as a member of that company, would have had to serve on the
                    Union side. (P. 12).</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken on behalf of the defense Aug. 15th, 1895.</p>
                <p>J.B. CARWELL testifies: Farmer; age 50; residence Middlebrook, Va Am the
                    claimant. (P. 1). When the war broke out I was called out in the Militia.
                    Reported first at Staunton. Then taken to Mt. Jackson, Va. We were divided out
                    to fill up broken companies. Believe I was assigned to Hoge's batallion, Co. A. Was there about two weeks. Then
                    came home. At home a couple of months, then went to New Creek Sta., W. Va., then to Clarksburg, W. Va., where I
                    staid about six months, till the following spring, in '64, or maybe in '63. Then
                    went to my uncles 16 miles West of Clarksburg, there I staid till the next
                    Spring, when I came home, then I staid home and staid about three months near Middlebrook, then I went
                    with fifteen or sixteen men to Beverly, where I staid
                    three or four days, then I went to Franklin Co., in Chambersburg, (P. 2). where
                    I worked as carpenter, pumpmaker, or whatever else I could get to do. There I
                        staid two or three months, I reckon. Then I went
                    to Smoketown, same county, and worked for him on his farm, for a month or two,
                    then I went to Martinsburg, there I worked in the fuel Dept. for maybe a month
                    till the war closed, when I came home. I think I went to Mt. Jackson with the
                    militia in '63 or '64. I was drafted. No one came to Middlebrook for me. There
                    was a general order that all who were over 16 years old were to report at
                    Staunton. I don't remember how I heard of that order. We were all taken to Mt.
                    Jackson and of course, I was with them and had to go along. I was in Staunton
                    two or three days before taken to Mt. Jackson. I did not know the route through
                    W. Va. when in Staunton, or of any one to go with that I could find out. I hired
                    a substitute. (P. 3). When I was in Mt. Jackson I wrote home to my father to
                    hire me a substitute, which he did. My father was not a dunkard,. I did not
                    apply to any officer, some one told me about hiring a substitute. A man that
                    hired a substitute for a short time was exempt from service. After I hired my
                    substitute, and during this time, I staid home. When
                    they passed the new law requiring every man to serve, I left home and
                    as stated. I was a member of Capt. McKnight's company. It never did anything,
                    but it was ready to go. I couldn't tell how long it would have taken me to go
                    back home, or somewhere. That wasn't my intention to skip through. We started
                    down to an engagement once, but were ordered back before we were engaged.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>If the Home Guards had been called out, I would have had to serve on the Union
                    side. I was opposed to the Confederacy from the day it commenced. I thought it
                    unsafe not to go to Mt. Jackson, went under a feeling of intimidation. I left
                    the first opportunity. The sentiments of my father and other members of my
                    family were strongly for the Union. I was about 17 or 18 at that time. My father
                    was a strong Union man, and I was greatly influenced by his views. (P. 5).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners rejected this claim, because as they allege that the claimant
                    served 10 days in the Confederate army, and then furnished a substitute, while
                    the proof shows that the claimant was conscripted, and he furnished a substitute
                    because he was compelled to in order to get out of the army. His hiring a
                    substitute therefore, was justifiable.</p>
                <p>His loyalty is shown by the following facts: He left his home in Augusta Co., Va.
                    to avoid rebel service and went to Pa., where he served as a clerk in the U.S.
                    Army. He returned home in '64 for the purpose of taking his brother and others
                    to the Union lines, which he did. A part of the time during his absence he
                    labored on a farm in Pa.. He was cursed by the Confederates on account of his
                    Union sentiments. He aided 37 men to pass beyond the Confederate lines into the
                    Union lines.</p>
                <p>His witnesses in their testimony confirm these facts, also that he was in his
                    expressions a decided opponent of secession and rebellion. He was too young to
                    vote in '61., being only 20 years of age, but his influence was for the Union
                    cause</p>
                <p>I do not see how there can be any question as to this man's loyalty throughout
                    the war.</p>

                <p>STATEMENT.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this case resided in Augusta Co., Va.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners of Claims rejected his claim Dec. '72 not convinced of loyalty.</p>
                <p>The claim was transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims, Feb. 15th,
                    1889.</p>
                <p>The claimant was held loyal by the Court Nov. 2, 1896</p>
                <p>BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>It is alleged in the petition that there was taken from the claimant June 6th,
                    1864, by a command of U.S. troops under Gen. Crook, 1 horse $175.00, 1 head
                    cattle (bull) 50.00: Total $225.00</p>
                <p>The following testimony was taken while the claim was pending before the
                    Commissioners, in Aug. 1871.</p>
                <p>JACOB B. CARWELL testifies: Residence Augusta Co., Va.; farmer. Testifies as to
                    loyalty. (P. 2).</p>
                <p>ELIZABETH CARWELL testifies: Was present when the property was taken. Taken in
                    June '64, from my father's farm by U.S. soldiers commanded by Gen. Crook. My
                    sister was present. I don't know that there was any officer present at the time
                    of the taking by Col. Allen was there after they were taken. The horse was rode
                    away and the cow drove by the soldiers. The army was marching in the direction
                    of Staunton, Va. The property was not followed. No complaint made that I know
                    of. No voucher or receipt taken that I know of. None asked for I suppose.
                    Property taken in the day time. I think about 12 M
                    It was not taken secretly. The army camped for a night about a mile from the
                    premises Gen. Hunter had a battle at Piedmont about 22 miles off. (P. 7).
                    Property in good condition when taken. The horse was young, and so was the cow.
                    I believe it was taken for the use of the army. I believe they needed horses and
                    cattle. I believe there was a necessity and the Govt. should pay. The soldiers
                    said that there were general orders to take the horses and cattle. I am 21 years
                    old; residence Augusta Co., I have known the claimant all my life. (P. 8).</p>
                <p>The following testimony has been taken since the reference of the claim to the
                    Court in Jan. 1897.</p>
                <p>SUSAN E. HEMP testifies: housekeeper-age 57; residence Augusta Co., Va. Not
                    interested or related. (P. 1). I was living at Mr. Carwell's when the property
                    was carried off. I was there the day when it was carried off. Saw the Union
                    troops take off a horse and cow belonging to J.B. Carwell. Horse and cow taken
                    by regularly uniformed soldiers of the Union army. The Union army camped near
                    our house at the time of the taking of the property. I heard the soldiers say
                    they wanted the horse and cow for the use of the army, and to help to break the
                    Confederacy down. They did not pay for the stock, but said it would be paid for.
                    Soldiers claimed to have general orders. They said, I think, that some of the
                    property might be gotten back if the General was seen about it. That is they
                    told J.B. Carwell's father so, whose property was also carried off. I understood
                    that Gen'l. Crook was in command. (P. 2). The horse and cow were young and in
                    fine condition when taken. Claimant never received any pay, nor was the stock
                    returned to him.</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION.</p>
                <p>Property taken in '64. It was at the time of the burning. I thought it was
                    Crook's army. I heard them call Gen. Crook's name, and thought it was his
                    command. I always understood it was Crook's command. A dozen or two soldiers
                    took the horse and cow. Couldn't say for certain. There were as much as six or
                    seven, I should think. The men were on horses. Took both the horse and cow at
                    the same time, about noon or a little after. When I saw them with the horse they
                    were out in front of my yard. They must have taken it out of the stable, but I
                    couldn't see the stable from my house. My house and Mr. Carwell's were in the
                    same yard, about 50 yards apart. Couldn't tell the age of the horse. It was
                    about four or five years old. He had been using him for several years. People
                    break horses for use at the age of two or three years. (P. 3). Couldn't tell the
                    age of the cow. It was young. Wasn't old. In fine condition. Before the army
                    came along and took the cow, it would have brought a good price. Of course they
                    would. They were scarce  were worth. Witness is asked if it would have
                    brought as much as $10 and says: It would have come nearer ten hundred in such
                    money as we had then. I would think it was worth about $40 or $50. the way
                    cattle was selling about here then. (P. 4).</p>
                <p>AGNES A FORSYTH testifies: housekeeper-age 49; residence near Staunton, Va.,
                    sister of claimant. (P. 5). I resided with my father M. Carwell, and J.B.
                    Carwell's property was there. I saw the Union troops on the 6th of June '64 ride
                    J.B. Carwell's horse away and drive the cow away. They were regular soldiers,
                    and had on the regular uniform. I said to one of them that J.B. Carwell was away
                    from home, and he said well he would get paid for the stock. Property never
                    returned to him, and he was never paid for it. Horse and cow both young and in
                    good condition when taken. When the property was carried off there was an
                    officer in our house, and my mother gave him his dinner. They said it was their
                    orders from headquarters to take it. The Union army went into camp about a mile
                    from my fathers the evening the property was carried off. (P. 6).</p>
                <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION WAIVED.</p>
                <p>SUMMARY.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Carwell was present when the Horse and cow were taken. The
                    soldiers rode the horse away, and drove the cow. They were taken in the day
                    time. Both the horse and cow were young and in good condition.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Hemp also saw the Union troops take a horse and cow. They said they wanted
                    the property for the use of the army. Claimed to have orders for taking the
                    property (P. 3). Taken in '64. The soldiers who took the horse and cow were
                    mounted. The cow was in fine condition. Horse about four or five years old. (P.
                    4). Think the cow was worth about $40 or $50.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Forsyth testifies: That she saw the horse and cow taken in June '64. That
                    they rode the horse away and drove the cow. The soldiers said claimant would get
                    pay for the stock. An officer was in the house at the time, and said it was
                    their orders from headquarters to take the property.</p>
                <p>This proof establishes the taking of both these animals. The Govt. at that time
                    paid for serviceable horses. $150 There should be allowed at least $30 for the
                    cow.</p>
                <p>The account should therefore he stated: 1 serviceable horse, $150.00; 1 cow,
                    30.00; Total $180.00</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Defendant's Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF CLAIMS. December Term, 1898.</p>
                <p>Jacob B. Carwell v The United States No. 6836, Cong.</p>
                <p><u>DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ON MERITS</u>.</p>
                <p>This is a claim for a horse and a bull alleged to have been taken by the Union
                    troops in June, 1864, from the premises of the claimant near Clarksburg,
                    Harrison County, West Virginia.</p>
                <p>No objection is offered to the first and third requests of claimant for findings
                    of fact.</p>
                <p>Objection is made to the second request on the ground that the testimony is not
                    sufficient to uphold it, and furthermore, because of the variance from the
                    petition in the evidence presented.</p>
                <p>Counsel for claimant has made a correct abstract of the testimony submitted.</p>
                <p>The evidence of the taking of the property is not satisfactory. It is admitted
                    that no officer was in command of the soldiers alleged to have taken it. The
                    so-called soldiers might have been marauders who were plundering the people upon
                    their own responsibility. There is no evidence that the property was used by the
                    army.</p>
                <p>The charge for the horse is certainly excessive, even granting that it was a
                    first class animal and ignoring the testimony of Susan F. Hemp, who could not
                    just tell the age of the horse, but she knew that people broke horses at the age
                    of two or three years, and this particular horse had been in use for several
                    years.</p>
                <p>The claimant in this petition alleges that a bull was taken him while the
                    testimony as to <sup>the</sup> bovine <sup>genus</sup> regards the animal as one of the female sex, in other words, a
                    plain cow.</p>

<p><b>Testimony:</b>
                <b>Claimant's Reply Brief on Merits</b>
                <p>COURT OF CLAIMS. DECEMBER TERM 1898-99.</p>
                <p>Jacob B.Carwell Vs. The United States No. 6836 Cong.</p>
                <p>REPLY TO DEFT'S BRIEF ON MERITS.</p>
                <p>The contention of defendant's counsel the the proof is not satisfactory as to the
                    taking of the animals charged for for the me of the army is without force or
                    reason. Suppose there was no Officer present, the testimony shows that the
                    soldiers who took this property belonged to a regular command under General
                    Crook which was on the march at the time. It was not customary in the seizure of
                    property under like circumstances for an Officer to leave the column for the
                    seizure of stock. On the contrary a few soldiers were sent out to take what was
                    needed.</p>
                <p>It appears that the horse was taken away with the command, also the ox or cow.
                    Furthermore the soldiers said at the time they took these animals that they
                    wanted them for the use of the army. This was just such property as the army
                    needed at the time and there is no earthly reason for supposing for one moment
                    that they were not legitimately appropriated for such use.</p>
                <p>Now so far as the value of the horse is concerned counsel says it is certainly
                    excessive. Why excessive? Was not the Government paying as much as $150 for
                    serviceable horses at that time for army use? It must be remembered that this
                    horse was taken in '64, at which time the Government was paying from $150 to
                    $l60 for good horses. This horse is shown to have been in good condition fit for
                    service, hence there should he no scaling of the value. If any allowance is made
                    it should be for $150 as asked.</p>
                <p>So far as the cow is concerned the proof shows a value of at least $30, then why
                    not allow it if the proof is to govern? If it is not to control valuations in
                    the slightest then what is the use of taking any testimony. It is insisted that
                    the facts in this case as in others should he based upon the testimony and not
                    upon what we think, suspect or surmise.</p>

                <p>J.B. Carwell vs. The United States.</p>
                <p>STATEMENT OF CASE:</p>
                <p>The claim in the above-entitled case for supplies, or stores, alleged to have
                    been taken by or furnished to the military forces of the United States, for
                    their use during the late war for the suppression of the rebellion, was
                    transmitted to the Court by the Committee on War Claims of the House of
                    Representatives on the 15th day of February, 1889.</p>
                <p>On a preliminary inquiry the Court, on the 2nd day of November, 1896, found that
                    the person alleged to have furnished the supplies or stores, or from whom they
                    were alleged to have been taken, was loyal to the Government of the United
                    States throughout said war.</p>
                <p>The case was brought to a hearing on its merits on the 29 day of February 1899.</p>
                <p>Gilbert Moyers Esq., appeared for claimant, and the Attorney General, by George
                    H. Walker, Esq., his assistant, and under his direction, appeared for the
                    defense and protection of the interests of the United States.</p>
                <p>The claimant in his petition makes the following allegations: That he is a
                    citizen of the United States residing in Augusta County, State of Virginia where
                    he resided during the late war of the rebellion; that at different times during
                    said period the United States forces by proper authority, took from him and
                    appropriated to their use the following stores and supplies of the values
                    stated, to wit:--1 horse $175.00; Head of cattle (bull) 50.00; Total $225.00</p>
                <p>The court, after considering the briefs and arguments of counsel on both sides,
                    makes the following</p>
                <p>FINDINGS OF FACT.</p>
                <p>There were taken from the claimant, in Augusta County, State of Virginia, during
                    the war of the rebellion, by the military forces of the United States, for the
                    use of the army, stores and supplies of those above described, which at the time
                    and place of taking were reasonably worth the sum of One hundred and
                    seventy-five dollars ($175.00).</p>
                <p>It does not appear that any payment has been made for any part thereof.</p>
