<p><b>Claims Summary:</b>
                <p>Claimant swears to loyal Sympathies but not to loyal Conduct. On the contrary he
                    was over persuaded and voted for the disolution of the Union and the destruction
                    of the Government. He likewise furnished a Substitute for the Confederate
                    Serivce, having as he alleged been Conscripted and having no other way to Escape
                    personal Service. And he also received Vouchers from Confederate Officers for
                    supplies taken which would not have been given him had he been the reputation of
                    a Union Man. We therefore reject the Claim.</p>

                    only way upon Earth to keep off a war and I yielded to his advice for &amp;

                <p>Deposition of Jacob Bowman recalled to prove taking &amp; value of his
                    property.</p>
                <p>1. Witness says: I saw all the property mentioned in my petition mentioned the
                    flour &amp; corn from the mill, one horse from a meadow &amp; the other
                    from the yard gate on my farm. The bacon was in my house. This was
                    all taken in June 1864 by G<sup>en.</sup> Averill
                    &amp; Crooks soldiers of the U.S. Army.
                    There were about 150 soldiers engaged in takin the property. There were officers
                    present but I do not know their names or ranks. My family was present, &amp;
                        M<sup>r.</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Bosserman was
                    with me at the time near by. I had no conversation with any officer, the
                    officers said that they must have such property as this mentioned, it
                    was necessary to have it. They were driving off my young cattle, but at the
                    earnest request of my life to leave one special one, he said as that is the best
                    one I will leave all, which he did. The main body of the Army was at Staunton
                    about 7 miles, they took the property in direction of camp, except what they fed
                    on the ground. There were a great many sacks in mill, which they used in taking
                    property away. An officer rode one of my horses, &amp; told my wife it was
                    one of the best horses he had seen in V<sup>a.</sup> the other was led off. No complaint
                    was made to any officer, no receipt was given or asked for, all was taken in day
                    time. The horses were 4 &amp; 6 years old respectively, in fine condition,
                    &amp; worth richly $200 each. The flour was in lbls. 10 barrels &amp; worth $10 per lb<sup>l.</sup> There were 50 bushels of corn I had
                    measured it. it was all taken &amp; was worth $1 per bushel. There were 11
                    pieces of bacon, large hams weighing 20 lbs. each,
                    all taken from garret of the house to which it had been removed from the Smoke
                    house; was worth 25 cents per lb. The officer was
                    very kind, &amp; would suffer no soldier to enter the house. he pitched the
                    bacon out of the window. he left about as much bacon as he took. I was the sole
                    owner of the property taken, nothing was left in exchange, &amp; I have
                    never been paid for it, nor has the claim ever been presented before to the Gov.</p>

                    mentioned in Claimants petition.</p>
                <p>1. Witness says: I am 45 years of age, reside in Augusta County, and am a farmer.
                    Was on a hill near by hisClaimant house &amp; mill,
                    &amp; saw the property taken, or rather saw the soldiers enter the mill
                    where the corn &amp; flour were, &amp; when they left it was gone. I saw
                    one horse taken out of the meadow, &amp; the other from the yard gate of
                    Claimants farm. I did not see the bacon actually taken, but know from
                    information of others that it was. This was done in June 1864, by
                    soldiers of Gl. Hunter. I thought there were 150
                    men engaged in taking the property. The place seemed alive with them. The
                    Claimants family were present. There were officers there, but I did not know
                    them. The main body of the Army was encamped at Staunton, a part of it about 4
                    miles from Claimants; soldiers took the property towards their camp. No
                    complaint was made that I know of to any officer, no receipt given or asked for,
                    nothing left in exchange, it has never been paid for or presented to any Dep
                    that I know of. It was all taken in the day time. The horses were in fine
                    condition, one 6 &amp; the other 4 years of age, they were remarkably fine
                    horses &amp; richly worth $200 each. They took 10 lbls of flour worth $10 each. it was in the mill. There were 50 bushels
                    of measured corn in the mill. it was taken. it was worth $1 per bushel. I did
                    not see the bacon, but am satisfied from what I saw &amp; heard it was
                    taken. it was worth 25 cts.p<sup>r.</sup>lb.</p>

                <p>Deposition of W<sup>m.</sup> Bosserman recalled to prove the
                    loyalty of the Claimant.</p>
                <p>1. I have known the Claimant all his life, he was raised within two miles of my
                    fathers house. Saw him constantly during the war &amp; talked with him about
                    the war. He was the sickest man of the war I ever saw, he was opposed to the war
                    &amp; to secession. He advised every body to leave the South &amp; go to
                    the mountains. He aided all deserters, fed them &amp; concealed them. he
                    gave them while in the mountains, flour, bacon, &amp;. He said the day he
                    was parolled &amp; left Staunton that if he could not get off as a miller he
                    would certainly run off &amp; go North. I regarded him as a true
                    Union man &amp; he was so regarded by all his neighbors. I heard of no
                    threats against him. I am certain that he did nothing to aid the Confederate
                        Gov<sup>t.</sup> except as
                    stated above. The claimant is a member of high standing in the Lutheran Church.
                    I the witness was a Union man during the war, &amp; am also a member of the
                    Lutheran Church. He had no sons in Confed.
                    Army, was the owner of no Confed. bonds to my
                    knowledge, &amp; did nothing to aid the credit of the Confederacy. He
                        was rejoiced more than any man I ever saw at the conclusion of
                    the war &amp; at the sucess of the U.S. I
                    do not think he would have done as he did about not voting, had it
                    not been for the influence of D<sup>r.</sup> W<sup>m.</sup> S. M<sup>c</sup>Chesney
                    &amp; for the reason assigned that it would keep off a war. D<sup>r.</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Chesney had great
                    influence and was regarded as a true friend. The D<sup>r.</sup>
                    was as much distressed as I ever saw a man when the war commenced - he wept
                    bitterly. The State of affairs was such, that a great many good
                    friends citizens, &amp; Union men, were apt to be influenced by
                    men of more reading &amp; information than they possessed themselves, as to
                    what way proper to be done for the Country.</p>

                <p>Deposition of G. S. Arehart, to prove the Loyalty of Jacob Bowman.</p>
                <p>1. Witness says: I am 44 years old, reside in Augusta Co. I am a farmer, I have known the Claimant all his life. Lived near
                    him during the war. Saw him often &amp; talked to him about the war. When we
                    went in the mountains hiding to keep out of the Confederate Army, the Claimants
                    sent us us six (6) lbs. of flour to use, when I
                    returned from the West in 1864. I told him how every thing prospered in the
                    North &amp; that the South was already whipped. he seemed delighted. Said he
                    wanted the thing to close. I regarded him as a Union man &amp; his neighbors
                    regarded him as such. Don't know how he voted on the ordinance of Secession. If
                    he had been a rebel he would not have supplied us as he did while we were hiding
                    in the mountains. Never heard him threatened by the rebels. He was in the home
                    guards a few days. was forced into it. Did nothing voluntarily for
                    the Confederate Govt. Had no son in the
                    Confederate Army. Owned no Confederate blonds, did nothing to support the credit
                    of the Confederate States. He is a member of the Lutheran Church. I am a member
                    of the same Church. Can't say what the claimant would have done had the South
                    gained its independence. And further this deponent saith not.</p>
