    reasons.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Friday morning March 5th 1869</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I am in receipt of your kind letter. I will avail myself of your <i>[unclear: generous]</i>.
     &amp; I feel, very efficient will in securing to me my restoration. I suppose none of the
     bills passed at the late session, although I have not yet heard, and it may be <i>[illeg.]</i>
     to renew the application at once. &amp; I beg if you think so, that you will
     <i>[unclear: put]</i> me in the Docket for earliest action, as also the name of <u>Dr. Stribling</u></p>
<p class="p10">My original application was made more than <i>[unclear: five]</i> months ago <u>
      instance
     </u> of the military authorities of this state. &amp; I believe this Dr S of <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> were of the earlier problems from this quarters. They were warmly recommended
     by <i>[unclear: 
      Gen
     ]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i>. I understand &amp; <i>[unclear: forwarded]</i> by him, but having no
     "engineer" in Washington, they were probally "pigeon holed". Some
     months ago I had them renewed, they were recommended by <i>[unclear: Genl]</i> Mumford,
     Wickham, Mr <i>[unclear: Steams]</i> &amp; others, leading Republicans of Richmond.
     &amp; presented by Senetor Willey, and since then in the lower house in several shapes. -
     My name was put on a house bill in the Senate with others &amp; in that way was sent back
     and has I fear perished.</p>
<p class="p10">There is opposition to me before the Richmond <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Committee, I understand. The reason
      <u>
      assyned
     </u> is that I was nominated to preside by Col
     <i>[unclear: Fontenius']</i> friends at the late R.R. meeting. That by accepting the
     nomination I put myself in opposition with Republicans who were for Gen Wickham. This is an <u>assigned</u> reason &amp; Gen Wickham condemns it, and is one of my best friends. I have reason
     to believe that the opposition is in part from this place. Mr <i>[unclear: Fullz]</i> is
     chairman of Republican committee - <u>to be <i>[illeg.]</i></u> &amp;
     apprehends if I get eligible I may be in his way. Curse him! I dont want it. I refused it twice from Mr. Pierpont. Another enemy is Mr.
     Ally Gene Bowden the reason he will not give but certain records missing the rolls in Richmond
     will show. I was chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature to visit <u>
      Wmsburg
     </u> &amp; investigate abuses in the Lunatic Asylum. His family were deeply <u>implicated.</u>
     <i>[unclear: He]</i> was promised that when his brother was a candidate for the Legislature he
     (the Ally) offered the offices &amp; interests of the institution to those who
      <i>[unclear: meld]</i> vote for his brother - &amp; the result was that those who did not
     so <u>vote</u> were either themselves or their friends who had places turned
     out, this was the testimony. He appeared before the Committee afterwards &amp; moved to
     have the testimony offering him stricken out because he was not a <u>party</u> to the record. &amp; I overruled his motion- was sustained by a unanimous vote.
     &amp; he ceased to speak to me. &amp; now wants his <u>revenge</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Your 
       Hus.
