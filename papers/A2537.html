<p class="p10">My Dr Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you an acct. of the battle of Thursday &amp; a
     few words more. We are now at McDowell but go on today, the enemy have left Monterey and are
     retreating towards Moorefield -- We are still pursuing them, how far I cannot tell -- We spent
     last night at F. Hull's -- the Yankees abandoned a large quantity of
     stores here, baggage &amp;c -- I got quite a number of things and enjoyed plundering them,
     retaliating for Rich Mt. We lost about 36 killed &amp; had 300 wounded at the battle. The
     enemy retreated that night -- rapidly. We have buried about 30 of their dead -- they carried
     some off -- and had a very large number of wounded They abandoned some here -- We took a Col.
     and several prisoners yesterday -- Our men are weary but in good spirits. Young Harmon of Mt.
     Solon was killed. Col. Gibbons of the 10<sup>th</sup> was also killed -- Send this
     up for them to see at the Upper house I am enjoying excellent health -- Hope you are all well
     -- this country is a scene of desolation. Living scarce. I shall want to get some butter,
     pickles and crackers from home if we stay here long -- I will write. Send you letter to the
     Quarter M. at Staunton to forward to me -- write soon &amp;
     often. God bless you and the family -- Kiss the children for Pa -- </p>
