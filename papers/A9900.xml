                    <salute>Dear Miss Annie.</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>How I wish I could drop that "Miss" and substitute "my own darling Annie" for it.</p>

                <p>I am so sorry to learn from your letter <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr>
                    yesterday that my precious little sweet heart is sick.</p>

                <p>You <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know how I prize the compliment of a letter
                    written by you when you were suffering so much discomfort. That act more than
                        <pb n="2"/>all else you have said or done gives me hope, for when we are
                    sick we do not trouble ourselves about people we are indifferent to. But when
                    you tell me that in your hours of suffering I am remembered I know that your
                    dear heart begins to warm a little bit towards me. If I could only have been
                    with you last week to pet &amp; care for you while sick I believe my
                    tenderness would have met some little response. I have seen so much of human
                    suffering, so many <pb n="3"/>long, sad weary months &amp; years of my life
                    have been shaped by the Couch on which lay for the time the most loved one of
                    all the world to me, that I have acquired the tenderness of your own soft sex in
                    the presence of an invalid - I trust shall never see you sick &amp; a
                    sufferer, but if such should unhappily at anytime be the case how gently I would
                    try to alleviate your pains, and dispel by all the arts love could suggest every
                    thought and feeling of depression.</p>

                <p><pb n="4"/>Your sickness has given my thoughts a direction this morning that I am
                    conscious will affect the tone of my letter to you. It seems a strange
                    Providence that those I love should without any known cause suffer more than
                    falls to the general lot. Will you pardon me for alluding to those who were so
                    dear to me, and whose memory I shall always reverence with a tenderness of
                    feeling which their undying virtues merit.</p>

                <p><pb n="5"/>Lovelier women than were my wives never lived on earth and with each
                    one my happiness was complete till death destroyed <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >it</add>. I am not conscious of any difference in the degrees of my love
                    for them. Each had my whole heart - And it is now one of <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">the</add> sincerest pleasures I can enjoy to talk about them,
                    &amp; not let their names and memory die in my family. I will &amp; do
                    love you as well as I loved them, and if you are ever the wife of my bosom as
                    they were, I want you to appreciate my feelings on this <pb n="6"/>subject and
                    to feel that as the living possessor of a heart that was and is so true to them,
                    you can afford to listen sometimes to the recital of their love history. It is
                    because they were so good, so noble, so pure &amp; so beloved by me that I
                    feel that it were better for me to be dead than not to have a living object, in
                    all respects as lovely as they were, upon which to pour out the pent up
                    affection of my oft lacerated, wounded, but I know still loving nature. The
                    human heart is a curious study. It is in my opinion capa<pb n="7"/>ble of almost
                    infinite love. And I believe that the man whose whole soul has been dedicated at
                    the shrine of wedded love to the service &amp; worship of a pure &amp;
                    noble woman, is after her death capable of more devotion to a similar object of
                    adoration, than if he had never known the joys of this holiest of all relations
                    on earth. To be plainer, the widower whose married life was supremely happy can
                    renew that life with another, and unless he does so his existence becomes more
                    miserable every day he lives alone.</p>

                <p><pb n="8"/>No man knows fully the incalculable worth of a true woman till he is
                    called upon to part from one forever, who was "love of his life &amp; flesh
                    of his flesh." If he would honor her virtues rightly he can best do so by
                    finding another like her, and then the memory of his past loss makes him
                    appreciate more highly his newfound treasure. If you were this day my wife, how
                    I should watch over and guard you from all harm seeing in <pb n="9"/>you the
                    impersonation of all your sex I have ever loved. These are unusual topics of
                    discussion in such a correspondence as ours. But I feel as if I wanted to say
                    these things to you even before we meet again - for I address myself not alone
                    to your heart, but to your excellent sense. I know if I ever saw your <hi
                        rend="underline">whole</hi> heart, &amp; less I would not have, it must
                    be after your judgment has passed upon my history and character.</p>

                <p><pb n="10"/>I am not yet prepared to say on what day I will return to <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">V<hi rend="super">a</hi></abbr>. <abbr expan="Colonel"
                    >Col.</abbr> Flournoy went home yesterday. On Friday our Board of Directors
                    ordered books of subscription to be opened here this week for $200,000 cash
                    banking capital and I was appointed one of a Committee to attend to it. I hope
                    to get away now in a very few days, but I want you to write here again. If I
                    have gone the letter will be sent to Richmond after me. I am very anxious to
                    hear that you are well again. So <hi rend="underline">write at once</hi>.</p>

                <p><pb n="11"/>I did promise you that picture &amp; you shall have it, but I
                    think I would rather take it to you than to send it. I will send your sister one
                    to Atlanta. How you must miss her. You ought to love her very much for she is a
                    most loveable woman. If ever she is my sister I shall love her as devotedly as
                    ever an elder brother loved a sweet sister. Always remember me to her when you
                    write. I am glad I am sometimes spoken of in your family. Do they <hi
                        rend="underline">tease</hi> you about your old widower beau? Did <pb n="12"
                    />any body do so at Buffalo? Hang the Knights of that Tournament for their lack
                    of taste, if you were only <hi rend="underline">second</hi>, &amp; not first
                    at the coronation - I would put you <hi rend="underline">first</hi> every where.</p>

                <p>I am at the Grand Central Hotel here with a house full of Virginians - Major
                    Intherlin of Danville &amp; family, <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    Anderson &amp; family of Richmond &amp; many others. I spend my evenings
                    with the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> ladies of the party. I wish you were here
                    as one of the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> ladies, matronizing my pretty
                    daughters Jennie &amp; Russie, who would astonish the folks around in the
                    Parlor by addressing you as "Mama". Wouldn't you look grand &amp; old? In my
                    next I can tell you where I will be at Lombardy Grove. Flournoy wants me to go
                    to Tennessee first <pb n="13"/>but I won't do it. My business in Mecklenburg is
                    more important than his in Tennessee. There are but 12 days left in <abbr
                        expan="September">Sept.</abbr> &amp; my <unclear>hand</unclear> is out
                    to make you answer every time this month. Love to all - God bless you-</p>
