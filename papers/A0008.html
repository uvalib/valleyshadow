                    like to live here very much &amp; every thing looks nicly well now we have a good house containing five rooms a porch and a
                    large kitchen. There is a great chance of fruit trees on the place, the frost
                    killed a great chance of the fruit we think there will be as many apples as we
                    can make use of some of the peaches escaped the frost there is a good many
                    damsels and a few guineas. May you know i always talked so bitterly against the
                    pastures but i dont think it is as bad as we made it
