                <p>I suppose you have already learned of the death of your husband. I have just been
                    officially notified that Dr. S.M. Potter died at U.S. <abbr expan="General"
                        >Gen'l</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Hospital">Hosp</abbr>, <abbr expan="Point">Pt</abbr> Lookout, <abbr
                        expan="Maryland" cert="no">Ma.</abbr>, on the 6<hi rend="super">th</hi><abbr
                        expan="instant" cert="no">inst.</abbr> at 1 A.M. of chronic <orig
                        reg="diarrhea">Diarrhoea</orig>. I saw the Dr. at Cavalry Corps Hospital
                    City, <abbr expan="Point">Pt.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Virginia">Vir.</abbr> a short time before he was removed to <abbr
                        expan="Point">Pt.</abbr> Lookout. He thought &amp; so did I that it
                    might better his condition to be transferred to <abbr expan="Point">Pt.</abbr>
                    Lookout Hospital. I made every effort to get him sent to <abbr
                        expan="Washington">Wash.</abbr> City or <orig reg="Philadelphia"
                        >Philidelphia</orig> but the boats were receiving none but wounded men for
                    those points. The Dr. was a faithful Steward. He stood high in the estimation of
                    every officer &amp; man in the <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> We miss
                    him very much. His loss we deeply lament not only as a member of the
                    non-commissioned Staff of our regiment, holding the responsible position of
                    Hospital Steward but as a man and friend. The Doctor too had all the elements of
                    a good soldier. He shrank from no danger or hardship when duty called. I have
                    his pipe which I shall take care of and such other effect of his as I can find.
                    His accounts with the Government will be properly arranged as soon as possible,
                    when by application you can secure what may be due him. I think he has back pay
                    due since Feb. 29 1864 at the rate of 430 per month. I <orig reg="can't"
                    >cant</orig> think he has been paid since then. I know not whether you may make
                    an effort to have his body taken home to <abbr expan="Washington">Wash.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="County">Co</abbr>, or not. If you determine on the removal of his
                    remains home I will lend any <orig reg="assistance">assisstance</orig> or
                    furnish any information I can. Had he died here I should have had his <orig
                        reg="body">bodye</orig> embalmed &amp; sent to you. But I hoped by
                    sending him to <abbr expan="Point">Pt.</abbr> Lookout that he might be sent to
                        <abbr expan="Washington">Wash.</abbr> from there &amp; by a change of
                    climate, diet etc. finally recover. But God's ways are not our ways nor his
                    thoughts our thoughts. May His Grace temper this sad affliction to your stricken
                    heart. and may we all be reminded mortality &amp; be prepared as the Dr.
                    gave ample assurance that he was, for the great change that awaits us all,
                    whether at Home or abroad, whether surrounded by friends or among strangers at
                    Home or in the Army. Any inquiries you may wish to make concerning the deceased
                    or his effects or accounts with the goverment address me &amp; I will reply
                    promptly </p>
