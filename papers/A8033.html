<h4>Augusta County: George W. Imboden to John McCue,
                    February 12, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>George Imboden argues for secession, but admits "my opinion is contrary to the
                    opinion of the <u>people</u>."</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feby 12<u>h</u> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">Your draft on J D. Imboden came to hand through the Valley Bank and John was out
                    of town, and to save <u>protest</u> I paid it, and I have
                    drawn on you at 30 days which I hope you will <u>accept
                        payable at the Bank in Howardsville. or some other Bank and enclose Back to
                        me</u>. as I can not draw directly on you through the Bank, <i>[unclear: will
                        you]</i> accepting the draft <u>payable</u> at <u>some</u> Bank.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no news of interest to write We are all well, and John's Family are well.
                    John takes his defeat like <u>all other</u> defeated
                    candidates. Who wished to have their name placed on the <u>Book</u> of <u>fame</u>, or <u>declaration</u> of <u>independence</u>. Of course I
                    mean nothing personal!</p>
<p class="p10">I think V<u>a</u> has turned
                    fool, but my opinion is contrary to the opinion of the <u>people</u> and I will awate the arbitrament of time to prove who<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>is right! I can in a few lines tell you where I stand, I am in favor of a
                    united South, first last and all the time, whether right or wrong I go with the
                    South. I am anti- disunion and anti coercion, but the union is dissolved and
                    what's the use to shut our eyes to the fact, if we cannot reconstruct let's all
                    go together peacibly if we can, forcibly if we must. for we have but one and the
                    same destiny, one and the same interest, then what's the use to deny the true
                    state of the case, and fool &amp; cheat the people by singing hozanahs to
                    the union when there is no union! I am called a <u>fire eater
                        disunionist</u> &amp;c &amp;c, but I dont care what they call me, I
                    am going to say what I think and believe, and let consequences take care of
                    themselves.</p>
<p class="p10">Hoping you are well<br>I remain<br>Yours Truly</p>
