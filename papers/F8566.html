<h4>Franklin County: Kate Scott to Edward McPherson,
                    August 21, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Edward McPherson's sister, Kate Scott, mentions her preference for Democratic
                    candidates, complains of slow workmen, and shares news of friends and family.
                    She also notes that Edward's attention to politics is diverting his attentions
                    away from his friends and family.</p>

<p class="p10">August 21<sup>st</sup>/60</p>
<p class="p10">Hagerstown</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Brother.</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved a paper from you this eve which informs me
                    of your where abouts. I had not heard of your
                    return to G--. since your trip to N York. We all regretted very much you could not make us
                    a visit hope you will very soon. You are so absorbed in politics you seem not to
                    have time for your friends. this ought-- not to be, there are so few of us left
                    and we ought to see more of each other. I had a long letter from sister from
                        <i>[unclear: Altona]</i> but do not know where she is now. I wanted her to
                    come here but, I dont know whether she will or not we
                    are not fixed yet in our back building but -- could get- along. the workmen here
                    do try one's patience too much. I hardly know what to do <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>sometimes. I
                    get out of humour with them might all have been done
                    long since, <i>[illeg.]</i> by the paper to night
                    you are highly complimented and will likely be the Candidate again. I cannot
                    think you are on the right side. I am strong for Bell and Everett have just been
                    reading Crittendon's speech which pleases me mightily. We had a visit-- <i>[deleted: ]</i> Saturday from -- Professor Reynolds your old Teacher. he is
                    looking remarkably well and in fine spirits, he thinks I have changed very
                    little, he tells me he has quite a family <i>[illeg.]</i> 8 children, he called
                    in yesterday and for sometime with Dr in the Office and talked <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    many things, he seems to be very much pleased with your course, he says there
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> three young men he feels very proud <i>[illeg.]</i> Robert
                    Clarkson, William Paxton and you. <i>[illeg.]</i> I was so sorry to hear of
                    Miss Maria McClellen's death, she will be such a loss <i>[illeg.]</i> her
                    sister and brothers. I sometimes think <i>[illeg.]</i> going over to G--. for a day or two this fall <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    can't know yet. I still have a yearning after <i>[illeg.]</i> place. I see you
                    have the gas in operation <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> You must feel quite grand.</p>
<p class="p10">How long will you be in G--. now. You are <i>[deleted: ]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: kind]</i> of passage. I now know where to find you. I enclose this
                    note you wished me to sign. the glasses arrived safely and are <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    and look very well. The children are very well. Lillie and Mae are tired of
                    vacation and wish school would commence. The William's have not got home yet.
                    Mary <u>Emma and</u> her <u>Father
                    went</u> to the <i>[illeg.]</i> Springs, Nannie Findley went with them and
                    Cousin Nancy went to Jinnie's, <i>[illeg.]</i> all be home soon. It is late and
                    I will <i>[illeg.]</i> to stop. Write soon again. Love to all for <i>[deleted: ]</i></p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
