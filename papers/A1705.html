<p class="p10">June the 25th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Chambersburg Pennsylvania</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Pappy Ma and Mit</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself once more to write you a few more lines to let you know that I am
                    well and harty and I hope that when those few lines
                    reaches you they may find you all the same I haven't writting to you all in a good while nor haven't heard from you since
                    I left Culpepper and thare I wrote you a letter giving
                    you all the news up to that time but after that time wee
                    came very near having a fight thare but it turned out
                    so see did not fight and then wee took up our line of
                    march and marched to Berresville and thare
                    wee found 1600 Yankes and wee flanked their breastworks but
                    when wee marched up to fight they ware gone so wee did not get them but wee continued the march and wee soon
                    got to Bunker's Hill whare General Jinkins had a fight
                    killing two of the enemy and wounding 11 and took 16 prisioners and the Yankes
                    wounded two of our men wee drove them to Martingsburg and
                        wee rushed in there and run
                    them out wee captured a piece of artillery and a good deal
                    of provisions but they run so that wee did not get them so
                    the next day wee marched and waded the Potomac and then we
                    were in Williamsport Md and then wee came to Hagerstown
                    and thare
                    wee took up camp bud did not stay long thare before wee started again and when wee got to Middleburg wee
                    ware in Pennsylvania and the next town was named
                    Greencastle and you may believe that the people was very near skerd to death but wee treated them with
                    respect and yesterday wee marched through Chambersburg and
                    it is a very nice place but in thare I found a good
                    meny disbanded soldiers from the Yankes army the
                    militia here is going to fight us I suppose but wee will
                    not stop for them I reckond
                    wee will go to Harrisburg the capital of this state and
                        thare
                    wee will have to fight I guess but General Lee sais that he has got the Yankes
                    just whare he wants them it has been a grand move in
                    our army Brother Fuller is gone out on skirmish so I have to close his letter.
                        Un Jimmy Stewart is well and and harty send werd to Aunt Mary that Un
                    Junuis is well and he has n't time to write. The

                    will close for this time. Sister you must not be uneasy about us for we are all

                        wording of the letter also.)"]</p>
