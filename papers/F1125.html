<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to Rosenbery,
                    John Abraham (father), February 18, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery expects to be paid shortly. He mentions working on a new building, and
                    he theorizes that he will not be able to come home until the war concludes. He
                    discounts a rumor that troops will soon head to Tennessee; he still awaits his
                    repaired watch from home.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">February 18, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father-</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself to inform you that I am well. Hoping that these few
                    lines may find you all enjoying good health. There is nothing particular going
                    on here at present.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather is very cold. I signed the pay roll yesterday afternoon. I expect to
                    get some money today.</p>
<p class="p10">If I do get paide I will send you all I have to spare. I
                    will not have much after I pay here what I owe. The 15th of March our next pay
                    day comes then I will have 26 dollars more due me.</p>
<p class="p10">I am very anxious about my watch. I would like to have it as soon as possible as
                    I need it very much.</p>
<p class="p10">A few moments ago I was informed that the pay master
                    is in Our Corps. There is still hopes of being paide.</p>
<p class="p10">I should have been working at Division Headquarters. Well, we have the building
                    finished except making a lot of benches. The building is 40 by 60 feet. It is
                    calculated for a lecture room.</p>
<p class="p10">I think that it is very doubtful of us getting home in 9 months without the war
                    comes to a close.</p>
<p class="p10">The talk is of us going to Tenasee but I can't see
                    it.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father-I have just received 26 dollars. In this letter I will enclose five
                    dollars for you. If I can I will send more the other payment. I only kept 3
                    dolalrs-well, it went so long before I got paid that I had to borrow some money.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, till I pay up the old score I shan't have
                    much left but if I can I will send you some more in the next letter. The 15th of
                    March there will be 26 dollars due me.</p>
<p class="p10">I will then send you more then. If I am paide according
                    to promise, I will send you 20 dollars. I must have some money here as it is
                    very good to buy bread.</p>
<p class="p10">With no more at presents but send my watch as soon as
                    you can.</p>
<p class="p10">So farewell for this time.<br> Your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
<p class="p10">Write soon.<br> Just as I was about to fold up this
                        letter, Dear Step Mother, your letter of the 14th was handed to me.<br> The
                        postage stamps came all right. In my next letter I think I can send some
                        more money. No more at present but thankful for the stamps and so
                        forth.<br> Yours Truly,<br>
                        F. Rosenbery<br> Good bye</p>
