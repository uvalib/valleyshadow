                <p>I have the honor to make the following brief statement, and application, to
                    which, I venture to hope, you will accord a favourable consideration.</p>

                <p>I claim to have been strictly a loyal man to the <abbr
                        expan="United States Government">U.S. Gov.</abbr> during the Rebellion -
                    have ever been so - refusing to aid the Rebel <abbr expan="Government"
                    >Gov.</abbr>, at the point of the Bayonet, in this city. After suffering, more
                    than I should be willing to inflict upon you in a communication, or otherwise, I
                    made my escape through the lines.</p>

                <p>I am a native Virginian, and after the suppression of the Rebellion, returned to
                    Staunton (Augusta County), at which place I became connected with the Bureau
                        <abbr expan="Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">R. F. &amp; A.
                    L.</abbr> as <abbr expan="Commissioner">Comr.</abbr> or agent, <pb n="2"/>on the
                    part of the Freedmen; and also clerk for Mr. F. S. Tukey, then <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> of that Sub-<abbr
                        expan="District">Dist</abbr>. After the Freedman's Court was abolished by
                    orders I was connected with the <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> B.C. at
                    Staunton. Upon the completion of the work returned to Richmond where I have
                    attempted to resume my profession (I am a teacher of Music) but owing to the
                    fact of being well known as an uncompromising Union man, having been connected
                    with the Bureau, and having testified before the "Reconstruction Committee" (to
                    which I beg leave to call your attention) I find it <hi rend="underline"
                    >totally</hi> impossible to make a support for myself and child at my profession
                    on account of the direct and indirect influences operating against the interests
                    of loyal men. Having no means I have no resources but to seek employment in some
                    branch of the <abbr expan="Government">Gov</abbr>.</p>

                <p>In view of these circumstances, General, I herewith respectfully make application
                    to you for a clerkship or any situation in your gift in your <abbr
                        expan="Department">Dept.</abbr> where I could be useful and derive a support
                    for myself and child.</p>

                <p>I refer to Mr. F. S. Tukey, <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst.
                    Supt.</abbr> in Caroline County, <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Lahea
                        <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> at Farmville,
                    Prince Edward County, and will present the <unclear>endorsation</unclear>
                    <pb n="3"/>of loyal citizens of Richmond. I will have certificates from
                        <unclear>Messrs.</unclear> Tukey and Lahea in a few days.</p>

                <p>I take occasion to say General, that I should not have intruded thus upon your
                    time, but for the circumstances of my case, and the <hi rend="underline"
                    >urgent</hi> necessity of employment.</p>

                <p>Trusting to the kind consideration of this communication, at your hands,</p>
