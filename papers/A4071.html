<p class="p10">My Own Dear One:</p>
<p class="p10">I know you are expecting to hear from me &amp; I will not disappoint you by a longer
     delay. I wrote you on Sunday -- We got off on Monday &amp; got through to Hd. Qrs. the same evening - all in good spirits &amp;c -- I
     found my horses at the Depot -- they had stood the trip well -- Found Mrs. Ewell still here but
     making arrangements to move to Richmond -- she was much pleased with her things - butter, eggs
     &amp; flour -- She has been at work today packing up &amp; starts tomorrow We are all
     much gratified at the news of the capture of Plymouth N. C. by Gen. Hoke of our Army -- he took
     1600 Yanks &amp; many guns &amp;c, thus made possible some other movements that you
     will hear from before long -- I hope &amp; that will do us much good -- every thing seems
     to work well this &amp; by God's blessing I think it will be to us the most successful year
     of the war --</p>
<p class="p10"> Every thing here is very quiet but the storm may come at any time<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I think we are
     ready for it &amp; that we shall succeed -- Everything here is as quiet as the country away
     from the army -- we only see the soldiers now &amp; then as they go to or return from
     picket -- The General intends to go into camp in a day or so so that we may get used to it. The
     grass is very nice &amp; green here &amp; our horses are doing well -- if we can stay
     here a short time they will improve much --</p>
<p class="p10"> The Chief Commissary sent us some fine fish today -- I wish I could send mine up to you --
     they issue good rations to our troops, better than ever before -- but corn meal is the only
     bread stuff they issue now -- </p>
<p class="p10"> I have been a good deal amused by a Life of Gen. McClellan, by <i>[unclear: Portorn]</i>
     that they have here -- it was evidently gotten up under "Little Mac's" own eye for his benefit
     -- but there are many rich confessions in it.</p>
<p class="p10"> I sent a good many things home but want to send some more as soon as I can -- I do not
     intend to be troubled by much baggage, especially as we are not allowed much --<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Col.
     Faulkner was here a few days ago -- he desires to come back to the Army &amp; will come to
     our Hd. Qrs. I suppose -- he is not satisfied away -- Dr.
     Dabney will soon publish the 1<sup>
      <u>st</u>
     </sup> Vol. of his Life of Jackson -- it is said, by those that have seen it, to be very well
     written -- he makes no mention of "Maj. Gen" -- L. H. Smith of the V. M. I  in all the book - because he could say
     nothing creditable to him in reference to his dealings with Gen. Jackson.</p>
<p class="p10"> We now have a Maj. Gen. -- M. L. Smith as our Chief Eng -- I
     have not yet made his acquaintance -- he rides his horse as erect as a ramrod. Pendleton looks
     finely -- getting married has had a good effect on his appearance -- his wife has gone to
     Richmond to live with a cousin of his -- who is on duty there -- The change in water has made
     us all feel a little badly, but we are getting over it --</p>
<p class="p10"> I am working closely to get ready for the campaign -- Write to me often -- I shall be very
     anxious to hear -- Many kisses for you all -- Nelly &amp; Anna &amp; "My Dear" May the
     Lord bless you - </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff husband</p>
