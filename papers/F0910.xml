    <p>I would hereby make application to you for a leave of absence for the space of Twenty days in
     order to visit my family at Chambersburg, <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> and make
     provision for their comfort and happiness.</p>

    <p>I would state that four Years ago I was a citizen of the State of Virginia, and was obliged
     on account of my Union sentiments to leave my home which was in Augusta County. I took with me
     my family and settled in Chambersburg, <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Penn<hi rend="super"
     >a</hi>.</abbr> of which place I was a resident until it was burned by M<hi rend="super"
     >c</hi>Causlin. I was then compelled to find a home for my family, and through the kindness of
     one of the citizens, I received permission to occupy a portion of his house for my family,
     until I should have been able to make other arrangements. The period allowed me for such
     occupancy expired upon the 1st inst. and I am exceedingly anxious to visit Chambersburg and
     provide suitable accommodations and a home for my wife and family. I have no one capable of
     acting for me in my absence from home, hence my urgency in the matter.</p>

    <p>In October 1864 I entered the service as Asst. <abbr expan="Surgeon">Sg'n.</abbr><pb n="2"/>
     of this Regiment, and although there were many matters requiring my personal attention at home,
     I felt a delicacy in making application for a leave of absence from the fact that I had been in
     the service for so short a period of time. I have thought however that the present was an
     opportune moment, when my services might be spared for the period asked for, and my application
     meet with approval.</p>

    <p>Requesting that this application be forwarded to the proper authority, I am</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>Very Respectfully Yours</salute>
