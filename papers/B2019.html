<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to R.
                    M. Manly, October 18, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson reports Miss Rowell's arrival as the new teacher, and immediately
                    requests that she be sent a female companion, for Jackson fears the impropriety
                    of her being unaccompanied, and has also struggled to find housing for her.</p>

<p class="p10">Miss Rowell arrived safely at Staunton but I have had great difficulty in finding
                    a boarding place and at last had to rent part of a house occupied by a colored
                    man &amp; wife. I am somewhat embarrassed in this matter and this lady
                    question was the reason I asked so earnestly for a gentleman. Do send Miss R. an assistant and companion as soon as possible, you
                    will relieve me immediately for although far from young, I am not old enough to
                    have a solitary and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>amiable young lady under my charge without fear
                    of being misunderstood by the <i>[unclear: little world]</i> of disloyalty and
                    censoriousness.</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse my hurried letter but I have been working day or night to 9 or 10 at night
                    on Registration &amp; election and would not have written at all had I not
                    felt compelled to notice the <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: letter]</i>.</p>
