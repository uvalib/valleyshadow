                    you think I have forgotten you entirely as I have been so long in answering your
                    letter. Indeed we have hardly had time to wash our <orig reg="clothes"
                    >cloths</orig> for the past two months. You seemed to think when you wrote to me
                    last that the Valley was almost <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> but thanks to
                    Almighty God we have been able to drive them out <orig reg="there">thare</orig>
                    is some in Harpers ferry yet we attacked them on the 23rd &amp; have been
                    fighting less or more <orig reg="every">evry</orig> day since. We have entirely
                    routed <unclear>Banke</unclear> Army. I think that we have taken about 3
