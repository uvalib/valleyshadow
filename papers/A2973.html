<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">As I have a chance of sending you a few lines I hasten to improve it. My health
                    is very good hope this may find you enjoying the best of health I have nothing
                    to write worth detaining your attension. So you may
                    expect this epistle to be short. I imagine you wount
                    care if I would make it spicy. It is now ten oclock, time for (to use an old
                    saying) <i>[unclear: &amp;c]</i> all honest people to be in bed, But as a
                    Miller never gets that credit I suppose it dont matter
                    about me, when I was down in old Aug I recieved a loving disapointment. Hope you had an agree<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>able &amp;
                    pleasant viist. The girls told me the next time I came down to have things
                    better arranged, about that time I thought it excilent
                    advise &amp; I think I will make use of it, I
                    expect to come down next Sadurday three weeks
                    providence permitting I am doing a very good business. Dear Kate forgive me for
                    not being so neglectfull in my corispondence you are always near me in my
                    thoughts evry plan I form or evry hope I entertain you are with me I oftimes think you are mixed up
                    in the wib of my fate let it be good or bad. If God
                    spares me &amp; my health I wil try in some future day make what is now real
                    a riality I will now close remaining</p>
