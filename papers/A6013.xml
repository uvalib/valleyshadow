    <p>I take the opportunity this morning to let you know that I am not very well. I was taken with
     pains in my head and back and then in my arms and legs that I could not help myself. I was
     taken Sunday night. I have got so that I can sit up and write. I received your most kind letter
     Saturday. I was truly glad to hear from you and to hear that you was well and doing as well as
     you was. I hope when these few lines comes to hand they may find you and Willie well.</p>
    <p>I seen William Offlighter and Hiram Coyner last Saturday. They was well. They have got back
     from Richmond. They are in the brigade guard house. They have been courtmartialed but they have
     not heard their sentence yet. They told me that Castle Thunder was the worst place that they
     ever seen, but they said that they got plenty to eat. Hiram said that he expects he will have
     to go back to Castle Thunder again.</p>
    <p>We get plenty to eat now. They have raised our rations. We <unclear>get</unclear> one pound
     and an eight of flour and a half a pound of bacon and some sugar and some peas. We can do very
     well on that. We are camped at the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> old place yet but I don't know how long we
     will stay here. I don't hear of no moves at this time. I received that petition that was sent
     to me. I showed it to the Capt. and to the Col. They both said it was very good.</p>
    <p>Tell your pap that if he comes down to bring me some tobacco. Tell him that he can get in
     camp without any trouble. I would be very glad to see him. Mr. Able is well. He comes to me
     nearly every day to see if I get a letter or not. If you see any of them tell them he is well.
     Give my love to J. M. D. and J. D. B. and all the rest of my inquiring friends. Write soon. May
     the blessings of God rest upon you all. I remain your affectionate husband until death.</p>
