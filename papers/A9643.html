<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your kind letter some time ago I suppose
                    you think I have forgotten you entirely as I have been so long in answering your
                    letter. Indeed we have hardly had time to wash our cloths for the past two months. You seemed to think when you wrote to me
                    last that the Valley was almost gon but thanks to
                    Almighty God we have been able to drive them out thare
                    is some in Harpers ferry yet we attacked them on the 23rd &amp; have been
                    fighting less or more evry day since. We have entirely
                    routed <i>[unclear: Banke]</i> Army. I think that we have taken about 3
                    thousand Prisoners <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> all thare
                    Bagage &amp; governmint stores our Brigade was ordered to Charlestown yesterday. We
                    left Winchester early in the morning &amp; marched eighteen miles by the
                    middle of the day the enimy
                    ware drawn up in line of battle &amp; opened fire on
                    our skirmishers we run up four or five pieces of artilery &amp; fired on them. Thay fired
                    five times &amp; commenced retreating throwing of
                    thare
                    blanketts canteens &amp; hapersacks. We run them for four or five miles the boys say we run
                    them into thare den in the ferry. We captured fifteen
                    prisoners thay fired some large guns this morning. We
                    could see the smoke thay seemed to be on the Virginia
                        hights &amp; the hills of Boliven. I exspect we will we will march on them this evening as
                    two more brigads came down this morning.</p>
<p class="p10">I never seen people so rejoiced as we come in one end of Charlestown &amp;
                    the enimy going out ove the other
                    the peoppe
                    Chereed us &amp; told us that thare doors ware open &amp; ready to
                        recieve us the ladies asked us why we did hollow we told them it was against orders, thay said we
                        wee will doo the hollowing &amp; your all will doo the fighting. The citisans kept asking
                        whare was Jakson we told
                    them we left him in Winchester we cheered Gen.
                    Winder yesterday for the first time the men do not like him much because he is
                    so strict. The merchants have a full stock of Good &amp; sell them cheep I think coffee is a <i>[illeg.]</i> per lb. sugar<i>[deleted: s]</i> the same thare is plenty of all kinds of Goods.</p>
<p class="p10">I must bring my letter to a <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> close as we have orders to moove. My health is not very good at presant
                    <i>[deleted: but]</i> on account of a very bad cold. I hope this may find you
                    enjoing the blessings of health</p>
