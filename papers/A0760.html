<p class="p10">Dear papa </p>
<p class="p10">I saw Tip Griffin yesterday who told me that you were very uneasy about me. I got
                    to the Regt Saturday the 9 and would have writen yesterday but the mail was carried off before I
                        new it. I wrote to you once from Columbia and again
                    at Ashland. Tell Ma I am a better hand to take care of my self than she thought.
                    I flanked the Yankees until I got across the James R.
                    and please don't be so uneasy about me in the future.</p>
<p class="p10">
                    <i>[unclear: Col]</i> M &amp; Judge say that they think it best for me to
                    join the Wise Troop for three very good reasons. 1 that Capt. Steptoe is willing to take me in his mess. 2 you can get
                    nearly twice as much for your hors to eat as a general
                    thing in a small Company than you can in a large &amp; when they issue corn
                    you get a bag for each company and if the company is small you get as much more.
                    3 and best reason you will fare better in that line your
                        self. You can buy any thing you want from the government at their
                    price with his consent.</p>
<p class="p10">The mail is about to leave and I must close. Love to all the family &amp;
                    Cousin Kate. Direct your letter to Orang
                    CH. </p>
