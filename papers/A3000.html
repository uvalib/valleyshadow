<h4>Augusta County: Samuel Franklin Carson to Unknown
                    (Annie Harris), September 24<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Franklin (Samuel Franklin Carson) writes to someone, almost certainly Annie
                    Harris, describing life in camp. He explains that his unit recently retreated
                    across a river to Shepards Town and describes Yankee attempts to cross the
                    river.</p>

<p class="p10">Wednesday morning Sept 24th</p>
<p class="p10">Shepards Town</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">How are you this morning well I I hope. We are still here all in a pile /Are so
                    close together that we cant turn over without turning on someone I trust they
                    will soon <i>[unclear: scatter]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: us]</i> so that we may get more room in camp. After the battle of
                    Sharpsburg of which I last spoke we fell back to Shepards Town on this side of
                    the river. The Yankees following us closely, we had scarcely got out train
                    across untill they <i>[unclear: opened]</i> from the
                    opposite side. They made a bold attempt to cross but this they could not do -
                    however that night they succeeded in crossing part of their forces at another
                    ford <i>[illeg.]</i> attacked our forces left to guard the ford we had crossed
                    but they were driven into the river killing &amp; wounding some say several
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>thousand - some <i>[unclear: too]</i> were taken prisoners some
                    of whom had been "paroled" a short time <i>[unclear: before]</i> - these are
                    the kind of men we are fighting - but I guess they won't fight us soon again.
                    Well I must close for the present hoping to hear from you soon.</p>
<p class="p10">In haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin</i></p>
<p class="p10"> P.S. Give my love to all of my friends + relations. I am
                        sorry to hear of brothers ill health, had heard
                        he was better, but from Cousin Jarvis letter his case is hopeless. If it be
                        God's will, we hope &amp; pray he may be restored to his family, but if
                        not then may he be prepared for that great change that awaits him. And so
                        may we all be prepared. It is <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> mistake to <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; please don't show
                        this to any one. Some 50% of our boys have just gotten
                        in, all well<br>Jimmi Buck is somewhere guarding baggage, so is Stuart
                        Brown. <br>My care to Annie &amp; Hannah also my <i>[illeg.]</i>
