                <p>A woman from near Winchester, Maggie, writes to the mother of a dead soldier,
                    telling her of her son's death. Maggie describes the soldier's burial, and his
                    personal items that she will send to his mother. Based on references in this and
                    later letters, the dead soldier may be presumed to be John B. McGuffin, and the
                    recipient of the letter, Martha Roadcap, his mother. Maggie Heist was apparently
                    John's sweetheart.</p>

                </opener>

                <p>Yours of Oct 18th and Dec 10th only a few days ago were received - how they were
                    smuggled through the lines I am not aware, but sincerely hope I may be able to
                    get this through to you - yours were truly, truly welcome. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    think not I should not have been so negligent as not to send you some message
                    had I had but one moment of freedom that I could have written &amp; sent the
                    letter through, but you know we are in the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of <hi
                        rend="underline">tyrants</hi> that the penalty for receiving or sending
                    letter through the lines if known to them is so severe, that no one is willing
                    to risk carrying a letter &amp; I have never had one safe opportunity that I
                    could send you a long letter. I have written - wrote months ago - hoping some
                    day to send it to you. This must be brief from necessity, but rest assured as
                    soon as in my power I shall send you full particulars as far as I can of your
                    dear sons death. In this I will only answer your inquiries - Our Angel - our
                    beloved dead - <pb n="2"/> he died - I am told - in sight of my home, alone in
                    an ambulance - insensible - he must have spoken after wounded, as the driver
                    said he requested to be brought here. Oh! What comfort what consolation to us
                    all had we only heard him speak - seen him breathe - He was I know prepared for
                    the change - four nights before he fell - he was here - left the next day
                        <unclear>his tenth day</unclear> (just 26 years of age) went to camp - was
                    ordered to Martinsburg - reached there &amp; right back into this battle - I
                    received three notes from him during his trip - he seemed in good spirits,
                    cheerful, warning me to trust in God - to be cheerful &amp; happy - </p>

                <p>I will tell you all that passed between him &amp; myself - the last night we
                    spent together - in my next letter. I intend making an effort <unclear>to get
                        through the lines - to Staunton</unclear> if I succeed, I shall write you
                    immediately - also answer Sue's letter. It is well you did not make the <del
                        hand="h1"/> attempt to get through the lines as you in all probability would
                    have been detained months, in <hi rend="underline">their</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">power</hi>, having as <unclear>tho</unclear> to be <hi
                        rend="underline">slaves</hi>, do their will, it is so hard for me to behold
                    his murderers - countenance them I cannot. Would that we were only free -</p>
                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>I receive a few articles - taken from your son's body - his own testament - I
                    reserved for you, also have some of his hair, his tobacco bags - pipe - a
                    handkerchief - his money - the amount handed me was very little, it may have
                    been all he had with him at the time, although the night he was here he had more
                    but may have loaned it - I only received some 12 dollars his expenses - of
                    burial - nothing - our great regret is that we were unable to purchase him a
                    good coffin - but it was impossible, hundreds of our dear soldiers - Colonels -
                    Captains - officers of all rank - were wrapped in their blankets &amp;
                    placed low - Ma begged our undertaker to make as nice a one as possible, he says
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> were <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to pay me one thousand dollars, I
                    could not make you one I have no material. Ma offered boards he made him a plain
                    pine coffin not such as he deserved, but that was better than none at all, and
                    many others had to <pb n="4"/> sleep calmly in our private lot in the once
                    beautiful home of our dead but oh it pains me so deeply to tell you - even it
                    has been desecrated almost ruined by our merciless foes - that sacred spot - was
                    so beautiful - perhaps someday we can again replace it - &amp; it rest
                    undisturbed.</p>

                <p>Your son was the first loved one ever carried from our threshold to be placed in
                    the cold, dark grave (and this has been our home for twenty seven years) Oh!
                    would to Heaven - I could have been placed there instead of him, how willingly,
                    gladly I would have died to have saved him from so early a grave, but it was the
                    will of Him who who doeth all things for the best, for a great &amp; wise
                    purpose, to whom we should all bow in holy submisssion but oh I can never become
                    reconciled - it seems impossible, too hard, terrible a fate for me to become
                    resigned to any other sorrow on earth, I could have born but this - I pray - God
                    only knows how fervently, how consistently for strength to bear up - to bow
                    submissively. Have faith in His wisdom &amp; <unclear>good news</unclear> -
                    sometimes I think I would not call him from Heaven - from his God - from Bliss -
                    no, that I yield, then come this long <pb n="5"/>ing, this agony of soul. I am
                    selfish and - Oh would, would I could say, from the bottom of my soul -
                    truthfully - "Thy will be done" but I fear I never - never can. Time may soothe.
                    God may heal, but memory lives, the grave only can bury this my first deepest
                    the <hi rend="underline">one</hi> great sorrow of my life - I never can be
                    perfectly happy again. I may smile, be seemingly happy - as far as the happiness
                    of this world is concerned - for all is dark to be now there is no happiness
                    here - in a little while I hope to be there, but enough of this - forgive it.</p>

                <p>On the 19th I received a letter from Mac - written two hours before he fell -
                    telling me he was near &amp; hoped soon to be with me, at one o'clock his
                    dead body was brought to my home - had an only brother, an only son - been
                    brought in a corpse, the <unclear>screams, the sorrow of my mother
                    sisters</unclear> &amp; all could not have been more terrible that day
                    &amp; night can never be forgotten. you can imagine not the horrors of that
                    battle - but I forbear telling you now - he was shot through the head, just back
                    of the temple, his face not at all disfigured - but such a peaceful countenance,
                    perfectly natural, <hi rend="underline">only</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">too</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">pale</hi>
                    <pb n="6"/><unclear>see friends</unclear> - put down in their cold grave - Our
                    enemies of course took the best for their dead - we had a white shirt collar
                    necktie &amp; so on put on your son - he was buried as decently as was in
                    our power to have him, you cannot regret more than me, that it could not have
                    been otherwise -</p>

                <p>You ask to retain my <unclear>miniature</unclear> - certainly if you desire it -
                    I thank you kindly for your offer of one of his - I have one taken the first
                    fall of the war - he was here sick - Charlie was in town at that time - also
                    have two taken before the war - </p>

                <p>Has your son entirely recovered from his wounds? I hope you will look over all
                    errors - if I get to Staunton I will write. I will not ask you to attempt to
                    write me now as it is too dangerous to receive letters - but if ever free - I
                    will gladly welcome as many letters as you will favor me by writing - Mac's
                    friends are all very dear to me, he has often spoken of you to me, he loved you
                    so devotedly - Little Allie he loved too - May God bless, protect, heal your
                    sorrows - Guide you all safely through Life - is the sincere prayer of</p>
