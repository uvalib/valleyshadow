<p class="p10">September 9th, 1864.</p>
<p class="p10">CAMP COUCH, NEAR CHAMBERSBURG</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <i>To the Editor of the Telegraph</i>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, directly after "guard mount," the highly
                    interesting ceremony of "flinging to the breeze" our country's glorious flag
                    took place in front of Colonel Awl's quarters. The regiment was drawn up in
                    proper position -- the flag fastened to the guy ropes, and run up to the
                    masthead of the slender young hickory, by Orderly Sergeant Wm. M. Kinzer, of
                    Company E. The word "attention!" was given, when Lieutenant Colonel J. Wesley
                    Awl stepped forward and delivered the following neat, patriotic and appropriate
                    speech:</p>
<p class="p10">"FELLOW SOLDIERS: -- We have this day given to the breeze the emblem of our
                    country's nationality. It will daily float over our camp, to tell us our nation
                    still lives among the great powers of the earth -- that freedom and equal rights
                    is our birth-right -- that there is demanded from us sustenance and support in
                    this hour of our national peril. We have cut ourselves loose from the
                    associations of home -- severed ties which bound us to our wives and children --
                        <i>give ourselves to our country</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">"The loved ones whom it has been our pleasure to protect and sustain through
                    life, have been given over to the care of those from whose midst we came; and we
                    have assumed the task to protect and defend the common country, whose national
                    emblem we have this morning floated to the breeze. Our <i>duty</i> it will be to always stand by that emblem of our national
                    sovereignty. In the language of a celebrated poet:</p>
<p class="p10">"Lives there a man with soul so dead,<br> Who never unto himself has said,<br>
                    This is my own, my native land!"</p>
<p class="p10">"Yes, we have a glorious country! the best -- in spite of the dark clouds which
                    shroud us in gloom at present -- <i>on which God's sunlight ever
                        shown</i>! Ours it is to do our part in maintaining that land in its unity,
                    and to give to our children the whole legacy we received from our fathers.</p>
<p class="p10">"This flag tells the whole story of our duty. We must maintain the Union of these
                    States -- allow no star to be blotted from the blue field of our country's
                    nationality. <i>The Dominion is ours from sea to sea</i>! But,
                    I remember that soldiers should always be men of deeds -- not of words. Our
                    future conduct will tell better than any words of mine, whether we will protect,
                    defend and uphold this emblem of our country's faith and hope.</p>
<p class="p10">"In your hands the future reputation of this regiment is placed. Act well your
                    part. Your country asks no more!"</p>
<p class="p10">The order to "uncover" heads was then given, when our worthy chaplain offered up
                    to the throne of Almighty God the following appropriate, soul-inspiring and
                    patriotic prayer:</p>
<p class="p10">"God of our Fathers! we thank Thee that Thou hast preserved unto us a place among
                    the nations of the earth. Thou didst preserve our Revolutionary Fathers, and
                    gave unto them the victory. Grant unto us, their sons, thy blessing; and as we
                    this day assemble beneath the folds of "the dear old flag," inspire each one of
                    us with a true sense of patriotism, that we may <i>defend it to
                        the last</i>! May no traitor's hand ever trail it in the dust; and wherever
                    it is unfurled in the day of conflict, may we see victory written upon its
                    folds. Bless our army; and may the time speedily come when this rebellion shall
                    be crushed, and we return in peace to our homes, with victory and peace
                    inscribed upon our banner! And when the toils and conflicts of this life are
                    past, bring us all to that land of peace which has been purchased for us through
                    the blood of our Redeemer, and to Thy name shall be the glory, through Christ.
                    Amen."</p>
<p class="p10">After which three cheers and a "tiger" for Lieut.
                    Col. Awl were proposed by Captain G.W.
                    <i>[unclear: Fenn]</i>, of Company C, and were promptly responded to by the
                    entire regiment.</p>
<p class="p10">During the first part of the ceremony our fine Regimental Band discoursed a
                    favorite piece of music, appropriate to the occasion, to the world renowned air
                    of "Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue."</p>
<p class="p10">Or saucy-looking Regimental Flag now floats gaily in the
                    morning breeze, the pride and admiration of all in Camp Couch. </p>
<p class="p10">I am pleased to announce to your readers -- many of whom have an interest in this
                    regiment -- that in conversation with one of the attentive surgeons, this
                    morning, I learned that but few patients require hospital care and treatment.
                    Most of the men sick a few days ago are able to perform duty again. Thanks to
                    the skill and prompt treatment of Chief Surgeon Wagoseller and his gentlemanly
                    assistants, Drs. Henderson and Brant.</p>
<p class="p10">One poor fellow -- a German -- whose name an company I was unable to learn, from
                    some caused stumbled and fell to the ground, dislocating his right shoulder. The
                    surgeons took him in hand promptly, attended to the case, and this morning, (as
                    I have been informed) he is doing well.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Jefferson Black, of Company B, detached for special service in the mountains
                    some fifteen miles northwest from here, was in camp the other day, and requested
                    me to state that companies A and B are flourishing "up there" -- to tell their
                    friends not to be uneasy about them, for they have plenty of rations,
                    comfortable quarters, and the purest mountain water to be found. They are all as
                    "gay and happy" as grasshoppers in a clover field.</p>
