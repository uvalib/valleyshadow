<h4>Augusta County: Diary of Michael Reid Hanger (1861)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About Michael Reid Hanger:<br></b>Michael Reid Hanger was born in Staunton, Virginia on May 10, 
1840.  He worked as a carpenter in Lexington, Virginia, in 1860, and  
enlisted there in the "Rockbridge Rifles" on April 18, 1861, in 
response to Governor John Letcher's call for volunteers to defend 
Virginia.  During the war the Rifles became part of the 4th and 5th
Virginia Infantry.  In this diary Hanger describes in very detailed daily
entries the movement of the Rifles in the Valley and in central Virginia.

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">At 8 o'clock this morning we took the Cars, and came on to 
Strasburg for [from] here we walked to Winchester, a distance of 18 
miles.  We here stoped at the Taylor House, and staid all night and in 
morning took the Harpers Ferry and Winchester R.R..  Passed by edge of 
Charlstown [sic], and came on to the Ferry.  We quartered in the 
Armory, amongst machinery.  We remained here for a week or so, and 
then went on the Maryland Heights, and staid 1 day and a night, and 
got a pretty good ducking.  We then came back to the Armory, staid 
there about 1 week, and then moved to Bolivar. staid there week or so, 
and then went to Va Heights, we here knocked up some old shandies and 
went to cutting down trees and cleaning up generally.  burning brush 
&amp;c.  We cleared off about 30 acres of land and built one Block house. 
We were in one of the greatest Hail storms I ever saw.  The stones 
were as large as partridge eggs the ground was covered, an inch deep. 
it cut our shanties down and left us in the storm.  We staid here 10 
days and then came back to Bolivar.  The next place we went to was 
Martinsburg on the B. &amp; O. R.R.  We had a glorious time here, though 
it was a great Union place. the ladies sent us everything we could 
wish, and presented us with thousands of Bouquets.  We spent a very 
happy time here certain.  We were here about 1 week and started back 
to Ferry, and burned a bridge (Opequon) on the B. &amp; O. R&gt;R&gt; about 2 
1/2 miles from Martinsburg.  We came back to Bolivar, but didn't tarry 
long.  We were in Martinsburg during election.  We were quartered in 
Grantham Hall).  We again started and went to Shepherds-town, from 
there to the Neck or (Shepherd's Bend,) about 5 miles from the town. 
We saw some of the enemy, with red caps and blue uniform.  I shot at 
one of them, and all say I certainly killed him.  We were quartered in 
an old barn all night.  The next day we moved back about 1 mile to 
Mr. Chapman's house.  I was then ordered to go on Picquet. to Dam No. 
4.  We soon got orders to move.  We all came back to Shepherd's town 
joined the Regt. [5th Va. Infantry] and that night.  came to 
Charlestown.  about 11 o'clock that night, and camped in the 
Fairgrounds.  Early the next morning we started to Wonchester, and got 
there about 9 o'clock at night and camped in the Fairgrounds.  the 2nd 
day we were ordered to march to Martinsburg, but hearing of the enemy 
crossing the [Potomac] River, and overtaking Col. 
Johnston<a href="#hanger26">[26]</a> with 6 or 8 Regts at 
Bunker's Hill.  we halted and there formed 1 line of battle.  As we 
heard nothing of the enemy, we returned together with the other Regts 
to Winchester.  We here staid all night, and the next eveneing started 
again for Martinsburg.  We traveled that evening 14 miles, and as the 
Companies were very much fatigued &amp; c, we camped for the night at 
Bucklestown, alias, Darksville [Darkesville] 6 miles from 
Martinsburg.  We camped all night out side the town a piece.  In the 
morning came on through Martinsburg 4 miles below, on the road and

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Whilst eating our breakfast this morning we received orders, to 
pack up &amp;c. and be ready to move in 10 minutes.  The West Augusta 
Guards<a href="#hanger33">[33]</a> were put in front, our Co. 
next, for skirmish.  When we got about 2 miles from Camp, we were 
halted.  The Augusta Guards went crossed the fence, and demployed 
along a fence running perpendicularly to the road.  Our regimnet (the 
5th). Then formed into Platoons, and from platoons into a square 
[picture of a square] in the road.  The fire was opened by the Augusta 
guards, we (our Co) was then ordered to jump the fence and deploy a 
long with and in rear of W. A. G.'s.  the remainder of the Regt. 
pressed on in the road and commenced firing.  In deploying my three 
Companions were McCampbell  
<a href="#hanger34">[34]</a>,  A. C. McClure,  
<a href="#hanger35">[35]</a>, and McCoun  
<a href="#hanger36">[36]</a>. we all kept up a constant firing.  In 
a short time the enemy began to give way, running &amp;c.  We were still 
firing into them, we advanced then fell back.  We repulsed them 3 
times, at last they rallied their forces, and commenced to advance we 
then gave way.   Capt. Pendleton then opened of one of his 
6 pound cannon on them, but they still continued to advance, the 
Artillery then also gave way, we retreated on back, to withn 3 miles 
of Martinsburg, we here took our respective positions again to meet 
them. but they didn't come on , and we got orders to move on again, So 
we came on to martinsburg. and camped for the night at the big Spring 
2 1/2 miles from town.  In our Co. only 2 were wounded.   Mr 
McNamara <a href="#hanger37">[37]</a>, who was shot in 
left arm ball glanced and cut his breast considerably  Mr. Arthur 
McCluer <a href="#hanger38">[38]</a> got a slight wound on 
the head from a spent grape shot, it is just a mere sckrah [scratch]. 
In the W. A. G.s,  Jack Doyle  
<a href="#hanger39">[39]</a> received a slight wound from explosion 
of a shell.  One of Capt. Doyl's  
<a href="#hanger40">[40]</a> men was killed, and one Continental 
<a href="#hanger41">[41]</a> under Capt. Avis  
<a href="#hanger42">[42]</a> from Winchester.  Balls flew in every 
direction, the shell passed over our heads, and fell about 50 paces in 
the rear and exploded, the balls were whiselling in the trees above us 
in a hurry It is thought that the enemy numbered about 10,000. 
against us of about 380 men.  Col. Jackson <a href="#hanger43">[43]</a> says, 
we did most capitally.  Stewarts 
<a href="#hanger44">[44]</a> Cavalry brought in 40 prisoners 
this morning to martinsburg.  9 more were brought in whilst at Big 
Spring.  One was a Surgeon in Northern army, one Lieut, a cavalry man, 
and 6 others, privates.  I suppose, we had the post of honor in the 
retreat (the rear).</p></p>

Martinsburg.  We were waiting for reinforcements under 
Johnson [sic], from Winchester We came on from the Spring 
back to Bucklestown, alias Darksville, and here met Col Johnston and 
his force numbering I think about 12,000 men.  We camped in the same 
place we did before.  Col Johnston's camp is on the end of town 
towards Winchester his forces have now moved above us next to 
Martinsburg, in the fields and have divided up into different 
Companies in different fields, and have taken their positions, and I 
suppose will camp there the night.  We understand that the Yankees are 
in Martinsburg, there are about 10,000 of them.  We took every thing 
we could carry easily out of our knapsacks, they were talking of 
burning them, but L. M. Booker <a href="#hanger45">[45]</a> is going to take

this morning in great glee as usual. 2 o'clock we are now on Mason's Hill, We 
Can plainly see the Theological seminary near Alexandria. The river is in plain 
view. We can see 3 schooners floating beautifully on the waters oh! how 
beautiful is the view I cannot describe it. Magnificent, Picturesque. grand We can see for 
miles, away across the blue waters of the Potomac, into the 
land of the Yankee The waters lay as placid as eve. We can see the flags 
flying in the Camps of the enemy. We can see their breastworks. and 
entrenchments. &amp;c. We can see the smoke issuing from the Yankee Camps. As the 
scene is too magnificent for me to describe. Ill pass on, we soon got orders to 
go to Munson's Hill When we had gotten here, Were were again ordered to return

since, It is now day break. We can hear the Yankee drums beating Reveille. We 
can occasionally hear the repeat of agun. The Picquet firing at one another. The 
Yankees drums have been beating all morning. We can plainly see the Yankees. on 
guard. They wave a white hankercheif at us. They have white flags waving. We 
can see them moving about in every direction. It is raining now very hard 
We have to keep under shelter the best way we can. we are all waiting for 
breakfast now, The Yankees keep waveing their flags, for us to meet them half 
way, to have a talk &amp;c. Laird and McCluer went and met 
2 or 3 of them. One of them said he had a brother in one of the Va Regts his name was 
Butt. When we 
were releived we went to our quarters on the hill It did rain terribly, and the 
wind blew awfully, we had to cook in all the rain and wind. 10't o'clock (night) 
we were ordered to get ready to get a way from there as quiet as possible, the 
wind blew. It was a perfect hericane. Cold ("good gracious", we marched off. and 
about 12 o'clock. (at night) got to Anadale [Annandale]. (a little village about 
a miles west of the Hill.) We here made some fires. There was the greatest 
excitement, I ever saw. the enemy was advancing it was thought, Munson's Hill was 
also evacuated great excitement prevails. All our Picquet hadn't gotten in yet 
The Wheeling Co. was left behind. It was thought they were taken prisoners, We 
remained here for orders &amp;c until 3 o'clock. the following morning.</p></p>

Mason's Hill, and see about the Wheeling Company and if they were taken prisoners to 
rescue them at the risk or cost of our lives. We went in advance 
of an other Co. We had also a battery behind us. Which Col Preston <a href="#hanger97">[97]</a> said should protect us. We all moved back. every person 
we met said the Yankees were at the 
Hill. and were advancing. We moved on, determined to see them out, if we died in 
the attempt. We sliped along a little piece and then would halt awhile and 
listen. Then move forward again a piece and so. on. till we got to the Hill, 
without seeing or hearing any thing of our men (Wheeling) So we concluded we 
would go down, where they were posted, the Moon was shining beautifully, and 
reflected upon our bayenets &amp;c. We sliped along cautiously We at last got to the 
post. "Merabile dictu." They were all there on their posts, and knew 
nothing of us leaving the Hill &amp;c. We got them and came on back. much rejoiced. 
It seems our Sergt Major, was afraid to go to their posts and releive them 
after the Regts left the Hill. The forces in this part of the Country are all 
falling back. towards the C.H. We, all. came on apiece towards the C.H. and 
halted about 2 miles from Anandale There we went into a field and got breakfast 
&amp;c. we will remain here all day I guess. We hear the Yankees are at Munson's 
and Mason's Hills.</p></p>
