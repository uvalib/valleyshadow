<p class="p10">Harpers Ferry </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 23<sup>d</sup> came to hand. I am very sorry that I
                    bought a pistole but I was forsed to buy one because I had to go on picket gard and the men on picket. When two were resting one was going and they
                    have at night riding by bushes have been fired uppon by
                    an unseen foe last night the officer of the night whilst going the rounds was
                    fired at but not hurt.</p>
<p class="p10">The things that are not in the pistole case I took <i>[added: out]</i> the provison
                    that you were going to send down. you can send it to the 
                        fery
                     and I wish you would get me some coloured stuff and make me two shirts
                    and pack them in the box with the provison. all so send me one of little cans of powder that Johnie
                    sent sent me from Richmond.</p>
<p class="p10">You ask me if I want more clotes I want none but what
                    I have mentioned above. </p>
<p class="p10">I am now very well and on duty to day camp life is right
                    hard but I do not mind it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have tended to my horse very well and he stands it as well if not better than
                    any other horse in camp. </p>
<p class="p10">There is no knewse here at all you here more knewse than we do. I am very well and
                    hope to finde you the same</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate Son </p>
