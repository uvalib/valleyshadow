<h4>Franklin County: E. to H. G. McPherson, December 29,
                    1858<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>E. writes to her aunt, Edward McPherson's mother, about the death of Charles,
                    possibly a brother of McPherson. She also gives a general report of their circle
                    of friends including Lizzie Law, Nannie and Mr. Page, and the bad health of Dr.
                    Tyler.</p>

<p class="p10">Dec. 29<sup>th</sup>, 1858</p>
<p class="p10">Frederick</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I received a letter from Edwd- last week dated Dec. 13<sup>th</sup> &amp; it did not
                    reach me until the 20<sup>th</sup>-- where it was, all that time I
                    can't tell &amp; besides, it was marked "way". He stated you expected to go
                    to Hagerstown the next week if the weather permitted. Now as we have had many
                    rainy days &amp; a few clear, I have been at a loss to know where you are at
                    present &amp; consequently how to direct a letter, but concluded to send it
                    to Hagerstown. This will account for my not having written before, since
                    receiving Ed.'s letter telling us of the recent
                    sorrow that had fallen upon you, in the death of Charles, so far away from home
                    &amp; friends -- yet from what Edw<u>
                            <sup>d</sup>
                        </u> says, you have much to comfort you <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> in the thought,
                    that he did not suffer for want of shelter &amp; kind attention during his
                    illness. As Edw<u>
                            <sup>d</sup>
                        </u> says, it would have been a great gratification to have seen
                    &amp; talked with him, but He, who ordereth all that concerns us, "doeth all
                    things well". "Be still &amp; know that I am God," is all we can do. We
                    regret very much it did not suit your plans to come to us first.- We hoped for
                    once, in our life time, to have a relative with us
                    at this season of family reunions. I fear you will not want to leave H-- after being there a while - you will become so
                    interested in the children. I do want to see them so much. Mr Tyler has not left
                    us yet-- he has not been able to wind up his business here yet &amp; that
                    prevented his being present at Mittie's wedding, which is a source of much
                    regret on all sides. If it had been any other time, it would have suited him. I
                    am very sorry too that circumstances prevented Edw<sup>d</sup> going, for I know it would have gratified
                    Mittie &amp; all of them so much. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Lizzie mentioned Mittie had
                    recieved a very nice letter from him, with his regrets. We heard it was to be a
                    very grand affair. Bradley &amp; Maria Tyler with Jane
                    <i>[unclear: Bungh]</i> went down on Monday, Lizzie will be delighted to have
                    them with her. She &amp; the baby are well -- it seems to be the <u>town pet</u> especially among the young men &amp;
                        <i>[unclear: receives]</i> a great many presents from them. Dr. Bradley
                    Tyler is in very feeble health this winter - indeed, it is sometimes feared he
                    will not survive the winter, tho' he seems better now
                    &amp; his cough is not so troublesome. Mrs Tyler is very much better but
                    still in her room. Nelly has been sitting up some for two days past &amp; we
                    hope now, will soon be about again. I had a letter from Lizzie Law last week -
                    all were well &amp; full of the approaching event. I suppose all is quiet
                    again at Rose Hill. My love to them. Did Mary Emma go with the bridal party? I
                    was very sorry, to hear of the death of Mrs Harper's mother. She will <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> feel it very much, especially under the circumstances. Nannie &amp; Mr
                    Page are still at the Dr.'s. He is a very gentlmanly clever man, but very
                    inefficient. He is about closing his present business &amp; then will have
                    nothing to do, &amp; at present, no prospect. I fear they will begin to feel
                    that the Dr. was right in his objections. I suppose they will return to the
                        "<i>[unclear: Track]</i>" in a few days. I am truly sorry to learn the
                    state of things in your church &amp; can see no earthly hope of a better so
                    long as Mr. Van W. remains. I should think much more
                    of him, if he were to go, before it be too late to recover from all this tumult.
                    How sad it is! You must have some very quarrelsome spirits among you to keep up
                    such an unpleasant state of things. We have had two clear days &amp; now it
                    is snowing quite fast. Tell Ned I do hope he will get to see us soon. Much love
                    from us all for yourself, Kate &amp; the Dr. with the dear little children.</p>
<p class="p10">Ever yours affet</p>
