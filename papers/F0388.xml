                <p>Your welcome letter of the 10<hi rend="super">th</hi>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> came to hand this afternoon and I was happy to hear that you
                    were all in good health and the letter enclosed from brother William gave me
                    great pleasure. As I have nothing to occupy my time this evening I take the
                    opportunity to respond to your letter. The <orig reg="reference">
                    refference</orig> to the letter you got at New Harper <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> I give
                    you credit for mentioning it to me and I think I can give you some light on the
                    subject. James Curtis, which name you say was <orig reg="signed"
                    >assighned</orig> to the letter, was a member of our <abbr expan="Company"
                    >Co.</abbr> but is now transfered to <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> M, one of
                    the new <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr>'s raised for our regiment. While we
                        <orig reg="lay">layed</orig> at Frederick <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr>
                    I got well <orig reg="acquainted">aquanted</orig> with him, and when I was put
                    in charge of the recruits of <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> M I gave him
                    permission to go in my tent with my partner <orig reg="until">till</orig> I
                    would return again, as he had<pb n="2"/>but poor accomodation where he was. From
                    that time he requested me several times to write directions on some letters for
                    him and I recollect directing one for him to Louisa Geisinger New Harper P. A.
                    which must be the letter you spoke of. <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> L and M
                    of our regiment are at Frederick <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> yet and I
                    have not heard from J. Curtis since we left there on <abbr expan="November"
                    >Nov.</abbr> 29<hi rend="super">th</hi> 1862. </p>
                <p>Our regiment is laying near <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Franklins <abbr
                        expan="HeadQuarters">H.Q.</abbr> about three miles <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    Fredericksburg, where it has been <orig reg="lying">laying</orig> since the
                    battle. In reference to sending me a box, I would advise you not to go to any
                    trouble to send me anything under the present circumstances. In the first place
                    it is my opinion that our army will go into action again in a short time and
                    second, if such should not be the case, our navigation is so far off that it is
                    uncertain <orig reg="whether">wether</orig> they would deliver a box here or
                        not;<pb n="3"/>but I am very much gratified with your kind and generous
                    offer, and I may some other time make use of your generosity, when we are at a
                    more convenient station. Christmas passed away with us very quiet, there was
                    nothing more going on then usual, excepting that we had divine service, our new
                    Chaplain, Mr. Gracey, had joined us a few days before, and he is very much liked
                    throughout the regiment. On the 31<hi rend="super">rst</hi> of <abbr
                        expan="December">Dec.</abbr> our <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> was
                    detailed for provost guard, and we were stationed on houses along the river
                    below Fredericksburg, where we have been since that time. I am stationed with
                    six men on Mr J. <orig reg="Seddan's">Seddans</orig> plantation, called Snowdon.
                    It is about 4 miles below Fredericksburg, close to the Rappahannock River. Mr.
                    Seddan was a major in the rebel army but it is reported that he has <orig
                        reg="resigned">resighned</orig> and is now in Richmond. The family that
                    lives here now consists of Mrs. Seddan, her mother, <pb n="4"/> Sister and five
                    children, three boys and five girls, the oldest of whom is about twelve years of
                    age; they all acknowledge openly to <orig reg="pro-secession">secesh</orig>, but
                    in every other respect, we could not wish to meet with a finer family in this
                    part of the country, and we feel by this time quite at home here. We have here
                    the sunny part of a soldiers life. we have room to ourselves, for our quarters
                    which <orig reg="are">is</orig> furnished with a bed, table, and chairs, they
                    find us our board, and we set down to a table just like at home, and we have got
                    quite used again to <orig reg="eating">eat</orig> with knife fork and plate
                    instead of a spoon and tincup. We were to be relieved this week by another <abbr
                        expan="Company">Co.</abbr> but when the people along the river heard it they
                    made <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> application to the provost marshal to let us stay here, to
                    which he consented and we were not very anxious to get relieved. This residence
                    is one of the finest along the Rappahannock River; it is situated on <pb n="5"/>
                    a hill from which we can see for miles over the country and down the river, the
                    place has been fixed up in grand style, but it has got a good deal deranged
                    during this war. We can see the rebel encampments on the other side of the river
                    just as plain as our own. their pickets are stationed on the other side of the
                    river all along the bank and ours are on this side. they are very friendly, and
                    have been in the habit of crossing the river to each other, to trade of sugar
                    and coffee for tobacco; the rebels have plenty of tobacco but no sugar and
                    coffee. the crossing of the pickets <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> stopped since a few days
                    ago and <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> we will have another fight in the neighbourhood of
                    Fredericksburg before long. Our men have been at work for the last three nights
                    making a <orig reg="corduroy">corderoy</orig> road through the field just below
                    us in a field to the river, preparations of the same <pb n="6"/> kind have been
                    made at several other places, but where they are going to cross is yet a secret.
                    I hope and pray that if our army makes another attack, we may be successful
                        <orig reg="route">rout</orig> the rebels out of their strongholds, drive
                    them to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, and bring this war to a close as soon <orig reg="as"
                    >a</orig> possible. The weather has been so pleasant here since New Year that we
                    hardly know it is winter season. It rained here on thursday the 15<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi> but it was warm; it cleared <orig reg="off">of</orig>
                    again on friday morning, and the wind has been some what colder since; the roads
                    are <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for our army to move. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> now bring my letter
                    to a close hoping that it may find you all in as good health as I enjoy at
                    present. Give my love to all our family and my compliments to all inquiring <pb
                        n="7"/> friends and I hope that I may have the pleasure soon to hear from
                    you again. I remain </p>
