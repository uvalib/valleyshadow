<p class="p10">Dear Friend Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind &amp; welcome letter some three or four weeks since and I take this opportunity to answer it. I was very glad to hear from you and to hear that you were all well, you said all the girls looked well except Snake you named one in perticular you called her my dear Maggie well if you say she is my dear, it must be so I guess you know, give her my love. Tell Snake I can very easily account for her looking badly she has parted with some one and she is grieving herself about him. I cant <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> say who it is unless it is Mr <i>[unclear: Quarles]</i> tell her he is well and I hope it wont be long before she may have the happy privilege of seeing him. I long to see that happy time when we all may be permitted to return to our homes, you cant imagine how I would like to come home. I have tried to get a furlough but there was no earthly chance so I have come to the conclusion to wait patiently until next Aprile if I am spared to see it then I can come home, but I hope this fuss may be settled long before then. Kate I suppose you heard about Tom Supple loosing all the letters that was sent by him &amp; never have been heard from since, we scolded him a greadeal about it but I suppose he did not loose them intentionally <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> therefore we will have to forgive him. I recieved a letter from home yesterday the firse one for more than two weeks and was very sorry to hear of F Campbell's death poor fellow he suffered a greateal but I hope he is now at rest I would like to have come and see him before he died but that privilage was denied me. I think it very hard that no one are allowed to go home under any circumstance except on a sick furlough. I pittied James Trotter he tried several time to get a furlough to go home and see his Father before he died but there was no chance, well Kate as it is now about ten oclock, and the candle is about out I will have to bring these few lines to a close give my love to all the Family &amp; all inquiring friend excuse all mistakes nothing more at this time.</p>
<p class="p10">from your true friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>James W Vines</i></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br></p>Kate I had a talk with your dear friend John Lightner to night I see him nearly every day he looks very well dont you wish you could see him. Write to me again as soon as convenent. JWV
