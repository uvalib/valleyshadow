<p class="p10">January 8<sup>th</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Mercersburg, Franklin County Penn<sup>a</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Hon S. Cameron</p>
<p class="p10">I take the liberty of addressing you on a subject of much importance to myself
                    for the purpose of soliciting your aid.</p>
<p class="p10">I graduated, in medicine at Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia in March 1846,
                    since which time I have diligently practiced my profession.</p>
<p class="p10">But finding my present income not sufficient to maintain my family, and educate
                    my children properly, I have concluded to apply for an office under the incoming
                    administration.</p>
<p class="p10">Believing that your influence will be sufficient to secure me a position, I have
                    thus candidly stated my situation. Presuming that I am not known (politically)
                    outside my native county, I can hardly expect to procure one of the most
                    lucrative offices. Yet I have indulged the hope that it is possible to obtain a
                    deputy collectorship in Philadelphia, And since the report of your acceptance of
                    one of the most important positions in the administration, I presume it probable
                    that places will require occupants, in your own immediate department.</p>
<p class="p10">If you are kind enough to indicate your willingness to assist me in this matter,
                    Any advice you may deem necessary will be gladly received, And as I am not
                    conversant with the "Blue Book" you may be able to suggest a post of which I
                    know nothing.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope to be able to give you ample satisfaction, in regards to my integrity,
                    politics, &amp;c, And would be pleased to ascertain the recommendations
                    usually required.</p>
<p class="p10">At present I deem it unnecessary to give references, yet<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> it may not be
                    amiss to state that the Hon G.W. Brewer of Chambersburg, has known me all my
                    life, And I presume would tell you the <u>truth</u> in regard
                    to me, however much he may oppose my politics.</p>
<p class="p10">Allow me to Subscribe myself, Yours,<br> Very Respectfully &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>Eliab Negly</u>
