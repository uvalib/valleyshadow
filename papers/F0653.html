                                1865

<p class="p10">Dear Father, </p>
<p class="p10">Last Friday at 12 O'Clock, Michael Wert was shot for trying to desert to the
                    enemy. eleven balls went through his body, killing him instantly. he lieves a wife and five children behind. On Tuesday we
                    had a very heavy Thunder Gust here, it was Lightning and Thundering all day.</p>
<p class="p10">To day our Division are out on
                    review. You would be surprised to see the number of deserters that come in our
                    lines every night. they say that they dont like the
                        Presidents call for 300,000 more men. They
                    are on short rations.</p>
<p class="p10">Night before last I made a big mistake. about one O'Clock in the morning I got up
                    and looked at my watch to see what time it was. I seene
                    it was 6 O'Clock, not knowing that the watch had stopped. I picked up the bugle
                    and played with the Reveille. In five minuits the
                    drummers and buglers in our whole Brigade were out playing the Reveille. In a
                    short time an ordely from Div. Head Quarters arrived
                    at our Regimental H.Qrs. with a note to
                    our Colonel enquiring the cause of all this fuss so
                    early in the morning. by this time the whole Division were up, our Col. sent for me and wanted to know what in the Devil I was
                    about in blowing the bugle so early, I seene that it was
                    all he could do to keep from laughing while the orderly was present. I told him
                    that I thought it was the right time. He says look at your watch once. when I
                    looked I saw that it was still 6 O'Clock. I knew then that the watch had
                        stopped.<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> He drew out his watch and says here I will show you what
                    time it is, fifteen minutes past one. As soone as the
                        ordely had left the Col. rolled and laughed.</p>
<p class="p10">The irons that you sent for my boots I never received. Dont forget to send the Hanover Spectator, and tell Mother or Kate to
                    send me them two books that they will find among my
                    music. one is called the Comet Instructor and the other has 6 or 7 hundred pcs of music in it, with drum and fife calls
                    for the army. it is about 12 in. long and 10 in. wide. both have paper covers. I have not Recd a Spectator since I left home.</p>
<p class="p10">Next year by this time, all that do not enlist in the regular Army, will be at
                    Home. If mother sends a box tell her to put some old dollar Magazines in. we
                    have nothing to read. I am well.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Son </p>
