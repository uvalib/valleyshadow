                        <orig reg="feeble">feble</orig> frame would have sunk beneath the rod. yes
                    brother you <orig reg="know">no</orig> nothing when the last earthly friend
                    forsakes you then &amp; not till then will you know (what) what this <abbr

                        <orig reg="Job">Jobe</orig> forsaken by all but thank God he has never
                    forsook me I hope you will never know what it is to be forsaken by all <hi

                    done I know not. brother are you happy I ask the question I hope to get an
                    answer from you <orig reg="personally">personaly</orig> soon if you are not let
                    me as a sister tell you where I fear you are <orig reg="wrong">rong</orig> you

                    that is right for you to let that anger rise what does our bible teach us not to
                    get angry at those that persecute us. let me here cast a verse or two.
                    "Wherefore my beloved bro let <orig reg="every">evry</orig> man be swift to
                    hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man work Ah not the
                    righteousness of God you must lay a side all such things &amp; <abbr
                        expan="received">recd</abbr> with meekness the engrafted word will change

                    >abe</orig> to save your soul". note brother I do not think you have heard any
                    thing compared to what I have heard but thank God it did not make me angry it
                    made me pray for those that talked about me &amp; you &amp; treat them
                    kindly &amp; I feel that God will help me to live right though my
                    temptations are great do pray for me that I may be able to withstand all these
                    trials.</p>

                <p>You said in your letter that you knew that my <orig reg="conscience"
                    >concience</orig> did not reprove me for what I had done to you with out it was
                    for loving you Oh Willie you are cruel to think that my <orig reg="conscience"
                        >concience</orig> (would) would reprove me for that which God has put in my
                    heart did I not love another or have you forgotten; &amp; did I not pray to
                    God to change me if it was his will &amp; how soon did the change come I do
                    not remember of ever <orig reg="having">haveing</orig> one regret let alone <add

                    me so &amp; I wrote to you to know if it was so &amp; you made no reply
                    so I thought I would confess &amp; see if that (would) would clear me just
                    so you <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> blame me I care not for others. You say let
                    the past be forgotten can you forget it I will join with you in improve the

                    cry for bread move your heart when you put that grain in the hopper to crush Ah
                    perhaps that father has spent his wages this day for the liquor that you have
                        <orig reg="sold">sole</orig> &amp; that dear little one is crying for
                    bread Oh dear brother <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> I persuade you to to reflect
                    for one moment if you can &amp; think then go on if you are going to improve
                    the future commerce now not for my sake do I ask you to do it but for you own;
                    now brother <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> let this make your cheek flush with
                    anger but forgive me if I do any do it with the best of motives for your future
                    happiness. dear brother it <orig reg="grieves">greaves</orig> me very much to
                    think that you came home &amp; did not come to see me but perhaps Walker did

                    hope you will come at the reception of this letter I was told last <orig
                        reg="Sabbath">Sabbeth</orig> by a friend that they thought you was afraid to
                    meet me Oh Willie what have I done have I committed murder that any one should
                    shun me or fear me &amp; especially the one that was once my best friend
                    brother I think it would be best for us to meet the sooner the better cant you
