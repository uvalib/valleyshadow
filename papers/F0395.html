<p class="p10">I will write you a few lines to let you know that I am well and alive yet, and I
                    hope that this may find you all in good health. Our Brigade was relieved from
                    active service, we left the front at the Rappahannock on thursday and came by
                    railroad to Washington where we arrived on friday morning about 10 clock. We layed at the soldiers rest in Washington
                        till 12 O'clock yesterday when we were marched
                    about 5 miles below Washington on the Maryland side. The weather was so hot that
                    the most of our men gave out along the road and they have not all came up yet.
                    We will encamp somewhere around Washington to get recruited<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>up again.
                    Our whole Brigade only numbered 763 men for duty when we were relieved our Regt.
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> We lost 5 men of our Co. in the fight on the 1<sup>rst</sup>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> near Culpepper 2 killed and 3 wounded. I seen our wounded yesterday. they are doing well. I seen John Markley about the 23 of July at Manassas gap. he looked well, but I had no opportunity to talk to
                    him as both our Regt. were marching passed each other. I
                    can write no more at present, but you will soon hear from me again. Remember me
                    to all inquiring friends, and write soon. </p>
