<p class="p10">Friday May 9<sup>th</sup>, 7 1/2 A.M. 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Top of Bull Pasture Mt -- 3 Miles from McDowell</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr. Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you will all have heard before this of the action of yesterday, on one of the
     highest points of the Bull Pasture Mt, on a cleared ridge we repulsed the enemy's attack, made
     about 6 P.M. and kept the battle field &amp; they have precipitately retreated from
     McDowell, burning up their stores there. We had some 25 men killed and I suppose over a hundred
     wounded -- we have no means of knowing the loss of the enemy but it must have been considerable
     -- they carried off their dead &amp; wounded in the darkness that followed the fight Col.
     Gibbons of the 10<sup>th</sup> was killed Gen. Johnson was wounded in the ankle I
     have not been able to find out the others -- for we were up, going about, until 2 this morning
     &amp; then slept 2 hours &amp; were stirring again I have no idea whether we shall
     follow them or not They were reinforced yesterday before the battle &amp; expect Fremont
     tomorrow I am well but very tired -- just rode of the battle field -- a
     sickening sight. God be praised that we won the day. I will write more soon Love to all -- God
     bless you --</p>
