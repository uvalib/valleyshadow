<h4>Augusta County: Samuel Franklin Carson to Annie
                    Harris, July 6, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Samuel Carson describes his inability to return to the army after his furlough
                    because the Yankees are in his way. He then recounts what he has heard about the
                    Battle of Gettysburg, which took place just a few days before.</p>

<p class="p10">Monday evening July 6th, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Martinsburg</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10">As I am here doing nothing, &amp; can't get to the army, I will employ a few
                    moments this evening in writing to you. I will give you a brief history of my
                    trip to this place. I left Staunton on Tuesday morning after I left home in
                    Company with Lieut. Wilson &amp; several
                    other soldiers for Winchester. We had quite an interesting trip, had the company
                    of two very nice ladies, one of them however I am sorry to say was a married
                    lady. We arrived at Winchester on the next evening hired a four horse coach for
                    Martinsburg where we arrived Thursday evening, from this point we had to take it
                        a foot. On Firday morning Lt. Wilson &amp; myself in company with Capt Wharton of the 55<sup>th</sup>
                    Va set sail for the Army, crossing the Potomack at
                    Williams Port, we went two miles into Maryland &amp; stayed all night with a
                    nice old fellow, good <u>
                        cecist
                    </u> too by the way.- Saturday morning we started on expecting to get as far as
                        <i>[unclear: Green]</i> Castle Pensylvania,
                    but we had not proceeded very far on our way before we heard that the Yankies had made a raid into the town, however we
                    proceed on our way thinking we might be able to get through without much
                    difficulty. We stopped on the road side to rest &amp; were laying down
                    napping, when all at once we were startles by the noise of some cavalry riding
                    down the road at full speed hollorring the Yankies are coming! I tell you <i>[added: we]</i> got up &amp; left there in double quick time. We
                    fell back a short distance and made a stand but the Yankies did not come on. Thinking that "prudence was the better part of
                    valor" we came back to this place, there being no chance of get through. We will
                    remain here untill the way is open to the army before
                    we try it again. We have had another big fight at Getty'sburg
                    Penn. Our loss is very heavy indeed, lost a
                    great many <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>officers.- none of our commanding Genls were wounded that we have heard of. Genl
                    Ewel was shot throu his
                    wooden leg, also had his horse shot from under him. Our Brigade suffered
                    severely. Our Company I am told lost a great many wounded &amp; one killed,
                    but cant find out any of the particulars - but one or two of the wounded from
                    our Regt. has gotten up yet. The enemy's
                        <i>[unclear: loss]</i> is said to be very heavy indeed. They lost two Major
                        Genls, several Brigadiers, &amp; a good
                    many Col's. We captured about 13,000 prisoners
                    &amp; there has been a rumor here to day that Genl Lee had whipped the enemy badly on yesterday &amp; that he had
                    taken 40,000 prisoners this however needs confirmation. I must bring this to a
                    close for the present. The news we get is so conflicting that it is hardly to be
                    relied on Consequently I wont give you any more<br> I hope by the next time I
                    write you I can give you all the particulars.</p>
<p class="p10">yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sam F. Carson</i></p>
<p class="p10">Please dont show this to any one but burn it when read
                            <u>if</u>
                        <u>you</u>
                        <u>please</u></p>
