<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, September 22, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes to his wife to report that he has rented a house and inquires
                    about preparation for moving the family to Staunton. He expresses the desire to
                    get out of the service, and laments how much domestic life the war has caused
                    him to miss. He sends messages to his children, especially his son Freddy who
                    has reportedly been "running about" and acquiring "bad habits."</p>

<p class="p10">Sept 22<sup>nd</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I avail myself of a few moments to write you. I am still here and well, and doing
                    as well as can be expected I have rented a house in the country some few miles
                    in case you can get to move out, but think it best not to come without your
                    household effects, as such here would be hard to get, and could not live without
                    them. <i>[deleted: and]</i> the rent will not be much &amp; I had better
                    pay the rent than to miss having a place in case should need it. I wrote you
                    several times to try &amp; see if you could be allowed to move your things
                    out here &amp; if could get teams to move say to Woodstock &amp; I would
                    meet you there with teams to bring you on up &amp;c. have you learned this
                    if so why not send me word what the result is if you Can<sup>t</sup>
                    write get some one else to write me, Henry, Moses John or Jimmy C. or someone I
                    am anxious to know what to count on If you will not be allowed to bring your
                    things, unless Molested or interfered with or uncomfortable or unpleasantly
                    situated there, I rather think best to remain there for the present but if not
                    Comfortable &amp; pleasant there Move to the country or Come on up here
                        with<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> what you will be allowed to bring. I still think I will be
                    able to get out of the service soon and can be with you alltogether but how soon I cant say. this
                    is uncertain. I have made every effort I can now with propriety, and must hold
                    still for at least a short time, before making another effort. I assure you I am
                    quite anxious to be with you continually. it seems that this war has cut me out
                    of 2 <sup>1/2</sup> years of my life. My daily thoughts are about you
                    and the children but I learned that you were getting along well &amp; not

                    little ups &amp; downs &amp; private domestic matters that I feel<i>[deleted: ed]</i> concerned about but I hope you are all getting along in
                    every sense of the word well. I had some intimation that Freddy was running
                    about without any constraint &amp; getting in bad habits. do try and prevent
                    this. try &amp; keep him about home or at school &amp; do keep him from
