<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">After two weeks marching &amp; fighting I find an opportunity of sending you
                    a letter. I am and have been well &amp; hope you are still enjoying good
                    health. Our cavalry has had a fight nearly every day since my last. During this
                    week we left the Army of the Potomac &amp; took the line of march for
                    Richmond getting within two miles of the city where was captured 300 prisoners
                    and 2 cannon. The rebs sent in a large force of infantry &amp; had us
                    surrounded, but the boys whipped the rebs badly and we passed on arriving at the
                    James river where we will get rations &amp; forage &amp; be under the
                    protection of the gunboats. What next I dont know. I
                    have not received your letters for some time but hope in a few days to get them.
                    I ask you to excuse a short letter this time as I am very tired and sleepy. Give
                    my love to the children. I pray that God may bless you my loved ones at home.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband </p>
