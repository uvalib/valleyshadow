<p class="p10">To President</p>
<p class="p10">May I call your immediate attention to the telegram of yesterday from the Committee of safety
     addressed to the Secretary of War arguing a change of Commanders for this military Department
     The Burning of Chambersburg has created great excitement &amp; indignation &amp;
     whether right or wrong so much has centered on Gen<sup>l</sup> Couch as utterly to destroy his usefulness all the business part of the Town
     with its mills manufactories <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and public buildings are in ashes &amp; more than
     two thousand (2000) people made homeless. The people charge him with abandoning them on the
     first approach of the marauders. we need a commander here who has the confidence of all classes
     and who has a stake in our welfare &amp; our people complain that after Sending to the
     field a couple of hundred thousand men we should have a commander belonging to our own State.
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Cadwalader has been <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> put
     here under the orders of Gen Couch though he ranks him and while
     he is willing to serve in any capacity he is entirely useless under an inefficient Commander in
     his present position he is useless because powerless but give him the Command of the Dept &amp; Such is the Confedence the people of the state have
     in him that troops will at once rally to his command. I believe he will be able to get troops
     enough not only for the defense of this <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Valley but to greatly assist in defending
     Washington. Give him the command and you will not only satisfy your friends but do your Country
     an essential Service</p>
