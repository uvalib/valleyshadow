<p class="p10">June 6th 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Home</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear brother</p>
<p class="p10">Your last was received two or three days ago I am happy to inform you that we are
                    all well on Monday night when I got home from town I found Willie complaining
                    seemed to have right smart fever he sleeps in a bed in the dining room and the
                    door into our room stands open about midnight I heard him complaining and went
                    out to see him he was complaining with a pain in his right leg I rubbed it for
                    him he seemed to suffer about half an hour not very severely I laid down on the
                    bed with him and he pretty soon fell asleep I slept there til morning he seemed
                    pretty well in the morning but came down from his school room during the morning
                    complaining of pain in his breast which he said he frequently has had at home it
                    pretty soon wore off and he went back to his school has been quite well ever
                    since. Emma is quite well they both seem to enjoy themselves very well seem to
                    be fond of their studies and are improving Sallie says study a good-deal better
                    than they did at first Emma is very fond of her arithmetick sallie says dont want to stop
                    sometimes when school is out Emma sets very much stooped we are trying to break
                    her of it try to get them all to set straight it is right hard to get Emma broke
                    but I hope we will before long Emma is very much attached to her aunt Mary and
                    me and also to Sallie. We are getting her<i>[deleted: e]</i> broke of her
                    pouty spells she dont have them as often as she had at
                    first I am in hopes she will make a fine singer she is fond of it they sing
                    every evening before<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> school is out, I wish very much we could get a
                    piano and give them all music lessons I cant afford to
                    buy at this time I intend to see if I cant get one to
                    rent Mary has been talking of seeing W<sup>
                            <u>m</u>
                        </sup> Guthrie to see if we cant get <i>[unclear: 
                        Marys
                    ]</i> to practice on by the way I dont believe I
                    told you that Mary was married she went off very slily
                    about the time we left home last winter to the west and married Daniel Guthrie
                    and it is said he was sick in bed at the time, strange things happen in the
                    world dont they she is the last one any person would
                    have thought of getting married, We are having very warm weather now and have
                    had since 1<sup>st</sup> June and a few days before but I have a most
                    miserable prospect for corn the ground was very much baked and came up very
                    badly they are not done replanting, yet most of persons say their corn is 
                        dring
                     very well We have as fine a prospect for wheat yet I think as ever we
                    had will have harvest I expect about the last of the month will cut clover about
                    week after next harvest hands are going to be scarce John A Gilkeson <i>[added: and I]</i> have made arrangements to get ours off
                    he buys a mower and cuts my grass I buy a reaper and cut his wheat will join
                    hands, I have been quite well fed some time but feel
                    one of my spells coming on now am affraid I will
                    suffer for a few days, I got some cloth for Willie the other day to make him a
                    summer suit his aunt Emma is making it on her sewing machine Andrew talks of
                    coming out this week will bring it out with him if he dont Willie will go in Saturday for it Billy Guthries
                    <i>[unclear: Hall]</i> came over this morning and cut out a pair of shoes for
                    him the old fellow make a right nice shoe and he needs a nicer shoe
                    <i>[unclear: for]</i> his new clothes, I will stop now for a while as school is
                    just out and children <i>[illeg.]</i> coming <i>[unclear: for]</i> a play I
                        dont believe they will ever get tired of that part
                    of their education. I weighed and measured Willie his birth
                        day his weight was 68<sup>1/2</sup>
                    lbs without shoes &amp; stockings his height was
                    4 ft 4<sup>3/8</sup>
                    in. nearly over 1/4 hardly 3/8 in his bare feet, You
                    ask for Andrews health it is good now has gotten
                    entirely over his cough, Rob Bickle has a lot and is putting up a neat house on
                    it and expects I think to sell it to A and I expect <i>[illeg.]</i> will buy it
                    he offers to give 10 years to pay it in expect his price will be about $5000
                    which is not high the <i>[added: way]</i> property is
                    selling no <i>[unclear: person]</i> here seems to have any fears of
                    confiscation My paper is full and must stop give my love to Carrie when you see
                    her am sorry that mary is <i>[unclear: so]</i> poorly [onto side of first page]
                    Love to all enquiring friends </p>
<p class="p10">from your attached brother</p>
