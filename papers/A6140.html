<p class="p10">April 3-1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Hamilton Crossing<br> Spotsylvania County Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Companion</p>
<p class="p10">I seat my self this morning to inform you how i am and how i have
      bin since my last letter. I have had a bad coald for the past weak but i have had a good appetite to eat
     all the time. I am well at preasent and hoaping that when you receive this that it will find you injoying good health and in good spirits and hoap all of our
     family friends and neighbours may be injoying the same blessing. I received your letter that you sent by Capt. A Airhart in the first of April. J just came off of picket that
     day and we injoyed
     our selves very well considering such a spell of weather as we
     had. we was gone three days. the first day it rained very hard all day. the second day it was
      coald and the wind blew very hard and coald
     all day. the third day but quite pleasant until eavening after we
     got in camp. it clouded up and the next morning it was a snowing. it fell about 2 or 3 inches
     but it soon melted after it quit snowing and maid a slop. it has been
     quite moderate since. the man that was send to richmond that you spoke of had went home three
     times and he would when <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> camp in times of a fight would run off
      til it was over. it is harder on them that flank a fight than them
     that dont. they have bin hard on some of the
     others too. there is Jacob and David Shull and John and Richard Michael sent to richmond April
     1st for six months hard labor and 6 months pay. that was their sentence. Wm. Shull hasnt had his trial yet-April 5th. I am well and
     hearty but it pained me when i read in your kind letter the death of your brother. it makes of
      <i>[illeg.]</i> in which a man hasa but a few days and full of troubel. god giveth and then taketh away. blessed is the name of the
     Lord. We have lost another one of our company. Absolom Michael yesterday morning at 7 oclock departed this life to a world whare
     their is no more parting. he wasn't sick but about 2 weeks. he had the
      tifoid fever. he was abel to walk about
     some until the eavening before he died. life is uncertain in the
     army as well as at home. i dont know but what he is better off now
     than if he had a lived to heard his trial for his case would be bin
     hard the way they punishe the others. i dont think well stay heare many more
     days until we move it <i>[illeg.]</i> report in camp now that we are to go out back in the
     mountains west of Stanton but i dont
     no
     whare we will go for they take take us whare
     they please. they
     yankeys appear to be quiet and they say they don't want to fite if they can help. they say their is a great
     many of them will go home the first of May or rebell against oald Abe. if they do that the war cant last much
     longer. from what i can heare and see i dont
     think [letter torn away here]...if you think you can manage any more corn <i>[illeg.]</i> the
     bottom feald as you wont have oats enough to
      sew. the field of cornstubels on the
     hill could plant some in their and if you dont plant their sow the best of the ground in oats as far as
     it will go and let the remainder be until <i>[illeg.]</i> put more on your self than you can
     manage. it is not worth while to expose your
      self to put out a crop if you dont get any out of it. you can
     keep the stock off the new ground field and the orchard. it will make as much hay as well. keep
     the stock if the season suits and what luck do you have with your help?</p>
<p class="p10">So no more at preasant but remain yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>from Jesse Rolston</i></p>
<p class="p10">rite and [letter gone] Mary Catherine Rolston
