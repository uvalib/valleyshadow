                    ware the banks of the Potomac &amp; occation the enimy would
                    throw a bombshell as if feeling for our situation but <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    warsted
                    aminition in vain but you may know that your
                    letter being recieved in such a <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    would make a lasting impression on my mind &amp; thare I vowed before Almighty God that I would never play annother card it was very seldom that I every played;
                    when I played it was for mear amusement but well I know
                        thare was a better way to spend my time. This is
                    quite a lonesome day hear, though a beautifull Sabbath morning evry thing looks quiate but dull it is quite a
                    picture to look around on my <i>[unclear: mess]</i> some are Cooking some
                    eating some writing &amp; some sleeping. We had <i>[illeg.]</i>

                    <i>[illeg.]</i> for breakfast you would laughf if
                        <i>[unclear: you]</i> could see us cooking evry
                    one <i>[unclear: must]</i> have something to say how such &amp; such a
                    thing ought to be done. <i>[illeg.]</i> H. Brownlee is hear to day tis the <i>[unclear: first]</i> time I have seen him since

                    looks very well. Tom is Gen. Garnetts orderly.</p>
<p class="p10">What sort of a Christmas did you have mine was very dry it seemed to me like a
                    Sabbath it was <i>[illeg.]</i> beautiful day. I would like

                    could have had some pleasure. I will long remember the plesant
                    hollow days we had a turkey Christmas day for dinner
                    &amp; have had one since. Thare was an inspection
                    this morning a 9 O clock A.M. we had a tolerable hard
                    trip to the Potomac a fiew weeks a go on it is hard to me
                    as I was not very well I had the yellow jaunders. I
                    was very near broke down it was useless to <i>[unclear: write]</i>
                    evry
                    think that happened <i>[illeg.]</i> it has been bublished in the news papers.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope John is getting well so <i>[unclear: he]</i> can enjoy him self. Through
                    the <i>[illeg.]</i> low days I assure you that I shall never think less of him
                    for telling on me for he is a man I grately esteem. I
                    only wish that he would correct me of evry fault that
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> have give my love to him if he is at home when this reaches
