<h4>Augusta County: Unknown (Probably L. R. Smiley) to
                    Smiley's sister (Mary?), May 11, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>The letter gives an update on daily life, discussing for example a concert and
                    the fashion choices of the writers' friends and family. The letter also mentions
                    a recent "mournful" ceremony, without elaborating. Note the date of the letter:
                    perhaps this ceremony was related to the Civil War's end.</p>

<p class="p10">My dear sister</p>
<p class="p10"> Some say it is a mark of disrespect to write with a lead pencil; but I dont mean it as such. It is so much easier to write in
                    this way as I can do it at times when I could not write with pen ink. Mrs Turk
                    &amp; Mrs Anderson got here about half after nine. I got my bundle and a
                    note from you. <i>[illeg.]</i> only a note have you got so delicate that you
                    can write no more than a note? I expected my letter to go up Friday evening. I
                    sent it to office Thursday. I think Lucy &amp; Marys dresses are mighty pretty Lucys in
                    particular. I thought <i>[illeg.]</i> that Mrs Turk said you <i>[added: had]</i> got the <i>[illeg.]</i> for yourself. dont let me <i>[unclear: take]</i> it from you if that
                    was the case I think if I <i>[unclear: would put]</i> a
                    <i>[unclear: faring]</i> on the dress and <i>[unclear: brinch]</i> with a <i>[deleted: ]</i> braid dresses are made very wide so I expect there would not be
                        <i>[unclear: through]</i> for a hem I dont like
                    hems unless they are tolerably deep. I am very much obliged to you for sending
                    my clothes as I dont know that they were clean. I
                    believe my purple callier is not here. <i>[illeg.]</i>I expect I will get a
                    bonnet. Uncle <i>[unclear: Jess]</i> was here yesterday and gave me $5 to get
                    me a bonnet or hat said Aunt Lizzie sent it, wasn't that so good, and kind of
                    him. Mrs Turk wanted me to go down street to-day with
                    her but I was afraid to ask Miss Mary I know she wouldn't be willing for me to
                    go. &amp; now I am certain she would have refused to let me go<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Ella Allen has gone home. we miss her so much she was so lively that she kept the <i>[unclear: 
                        ballance
                    ]</i> of us <i>[illeg.]</i>. It is only five weeks until school closes and
                    we <i>[added: will]</i> have some four or five examinations
                    in that time</p>
<p class="p10">Why didn't brother come down yesterday I think he ought to have been here He
                    could have appreciated the speeches &amp; ceremonies. I could not go was
                    very sorry of it. I heard the bells tolling &amp; the band playing. The
                    sound was mournful indeed. I was at the D, D &amp; B Institution a few
                    Saturdays ago to a rehearsal <i>[deleted: concert]</i> that the blind had. I
                    enjoyed it immensely. Some of the blind were examined. I thought they
                        <i>[unclear: shamed]</i> us, they stood theirs as well. We had quite an
                    excitement here a few nights ago. Some one got into
                    one of the rooms (my old room by the way) and was feeling under the pillow and
                    passing the hand down over the face of one of the girls they raised the alarm
                    and who ever it was hustled out in a hurry. Some
                    think it was a servant who was here last winter I have no idea who it was or the
                        <i>[unclear: affect]</i> of the visit. The effects of it were that locks
                    were put in the doors next day. It amuses me to think that in our room we have
                    been keeping open house all winter &amp; now are <i>[unclear: locking]</i>
                    down. <i>[illeg.]</i> Miss Agness would be glad to have some dried apples or
                        any thing
                    eatible if you have more than you want to use. I told
                    her we had no apples last year &amp; today she asked one of the girls if
                    they had any beets <i>[unclear: parsonips]</i> at their house I dont know what she would give for them but if she had
                    them soon she would be glad to get any thing of the
                    kind as we dont have any extra variety now Nothing more
                    at present</p>
