                    Mr. Jones never would come Tuesday night but when he did arrive tho' late he brought your dear valued letter. I
                    thanked God to hear of your good health Indeed you can't tell how glad I was to
                    have you write that you would come down Saturday. if you come I will go up with
                    you Sunday if God is willing. Ma is well again, &amp; says I may go back
                    with you. <i>[illeg.]</i> anxious to spend my Christmas with you. <i>[deleted: ]</i> wish you were <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    to night. one week since I saw you last but to me the
                    time seems like months. Ma rec'd
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> long letter from Rennie &amp; her husband to day. he writes that he is the happiest man in the world, that he
                    has the dearest &amp; best wife on Earth &amp; he advises all gentlemen
                    to marry if they can find such a good &amp; loving wife as he has &amp;
                    just so Rennie writes of her husband. she says she never was <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    happy in all her life &amp; that she has the dearest &amp; best husband
                    in the world. I will read their letter to you when you come. I <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    they are very happy are boarding with <i>[illeg.]</i>. Mr. Estell was<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>in Monday asked Ada when I was to be married. she told him she did not know
                    when. Both gentlemen &amp; ladies who were here the night of Rennie's
                    marriage said you were so handsome &amp; fine looking. I have so much to
                    tell you. I can't write all but will tell you when we meet again, Which I hope
                    will be day after tomorrow. (Saturday) I have heard so many said I looked
                    beautiful on the 10th but I only wanted to be so to your dear observing eyes. I

                    personal appearance I can not
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> I know how much you admire beauty in woman. Mr. John Ferror was
                    here yesterday. I had promised to spend a week with them soon during the
                    holidays, &amp; if I go with you I shall disappoint them all well they must
                    wait until after the holidays. I can Excuse myself any time I would rather be
                    with you because I love you best, &amp; when with you I don't want to be
                    with any one els. I have so much to tell &amp; to
                    ask you that I can scarcely wait until you come. Ma is rather looking for cousin
