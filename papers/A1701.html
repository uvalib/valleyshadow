<p class="p10">Only last night did I learn that the enemy had reached Staunton. Gnl. W.E. Jones being unfortunately been killed, and
                    our forces thereabout, not deeming themselves strong enough, having fallen back
                    toward the mountains. Of course the enemy unobstructed will proceed to
                        <i>[unclear: loot]</i> and what outrages they may perpetuate there none can
                    say. I am anxious about our Dear <i>[illeg.]</i> and yet not
                    <i>[unclear: corroding]</i> - a, my trust's in that Almighty goodness - which
                    can protect Christ's servants under all circumstances. Yr Ma will be sustained, I believe, for the time. And I cannot suppose
                    that even Yankee villany will be allowed to indulge itself in <i>[unclear: any]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> disgraces to my family. They may destroy property, and so
                    inflict a good deal of suffering. But all that can be
                    <i>[unclear: re------]</i>. Meantime, however, while they cannot hear from us,
                    nor <i>[unclear: we from]</i> them. J <i>[illeg.]</i> be deeply
                        <i>[unclear: concerned]</i>, and they will suffer, I know, extreme anxiety.
                    The Lord, however, is with us. And will be a very fervent help now and in all
                    times of trouble. <u>Col Lee</u>
                    is much in <i>[unclear: your]</i> thoughts. He too will be taken care of, I
                    feel assured. <i>[illeg.]</i> and going off immediately, and I do trust the
                    despicable <u>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </u>
                    <u>&amp; traitor, Hunter,</u> may be <u>punished</u> as he deserves, before he can do much <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    mischief. Of course Kate &amp; yourself must now remain in Richmond until
                    this state of things is remedied. My best love to you both. </p>
