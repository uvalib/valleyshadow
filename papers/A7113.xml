<p>Scott laments the removal of William L. Coan from his position with the AMA in Virginia, arguing that Coan was a necessary and exceedingly helpful agent of the Association in the area.  Commenting on financial troubles, Scott argues that it might be possible for teachers to board with "colored families" as a means to cut down on costs.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute> 
</opener> 

<p>Yours of the 8<hi rend="super">th</hi> was received on Sat the 10<hi rend="super">th</hi></p>
	<p>I am sorry that you put so sharp a construction as your reply seems to indicate, upon my letter.</p>
	<p>I did not intend to "criticize" you in the matter of Mr C'n's removal, and certainly now, with your explanation, if not before, if I were to say any thing about it, I would see <hi rend="underline">the propriety of it</hi> for I most certainly have the highest respect for the judgment<pb n="2"/> of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of the A. M. A. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> word had been said about the <hi rend="underline">expense</hi> of our schools here until a very few days before Mr C's removal, when I received a letter from you containing a threat to discontinue them if not carried on cheaper, and then Mr C removal coming at the same time and all together without the slightest premonition, or expectation you will readily see that it startled me a little; and that letter was the result of that fright and written at that time, but was not sent, finally until the end of the month,  And I was sensible when I came to read it over that It was objectionable in some parts as it seemed ambiguous and liable<pb n="3"/> to an unhappy interpretation.</p>
	<p>Mr Coan was so <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>  and so useful in counsel that I felt very sad at losing him; and the facts that I named as reasons for retaining him were by no means intended as "criticisms" but only statements of things as they are seen by one <hi rend="underline">on the ground</hi>" (I mean in regard to the probable increase of attendance at the various schools) calling for more teachers and making work for a Supt in organizing new schools</p>
	<p>Now I can not tel what facts you are in possession of and what you are not, but the <hi rend="underline">missionaries on the ground, must be the eyes</hi> of the "<hi rend="underline">Association</hi>," I suppose, not to decide grave questions in regard to the business of the society but to furnish facts<pb n="4"/> which form in a great measure the basis of your action, and <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I attempt to do that I do not intend it for criticism of the doings of the Secretaries.</p>
	<p>In regard to the remarks of the Sec concerning the schools of the Valley  I think as you say that I misapprehended somewhat his remark  But was it not natural for me to feel a little jealous of that school for which I am working day and night  I don't mean to be proud of it but considering <hi rend="underline">the</hi> Sec remark to include it and attributing a part of his criticism to my School  I felt that it was certainly a mistake of which justice to <hi rend="underline">these</hi> teachers, and credit to your work here demand the correcting.</p>
	<p>And the fact that in<pb n="5"/> some of your past letters you ask us to write cheerful ones led me also in connection with the remark of the Sec. to feel that you seem to be partly incredulous in regard to success</p>
	<p>We do hope that you will not look on the dark side so much</p>
	<p>And when we attempt to make you believe that by the blessing of God we do succeed we do not mean by that to be "Lecturing any Sec on the manner in which he performs his duty"  And now in regard to the Expense" of <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> Staunton <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></p><pb n="6"/>
	<p>And if there is any thing in the world that we ought to do that we are not doing we should be more than glad to do it.  Did you notice my statement in the other letter</p>
	<p>That the little expense for wood, lights etc. were paid by the pupils now--and also that there would probably be but few more books wanted at present, also the 225 per year--heretofore paid for rent for school house is now discontinued--and I will add that the rent on the Mission House is $60 less per year from Feb 1 than formerly--that is 60 is allowed by government for use of a little <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> office <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del><pb n="7"/> house, since the first of March when the time ran out but the price will not be different under the old bargain it is presumed.</p>
	<p>There is one more way of reducing expense perhaps which involves questions which I have nothing to do with but would obey any orders or follow any suggestions.</p> 
	<p>We might perhaps go into colored families to board.</p>
	<p>The ladies I think are willing Tho it would be hard for them as these low cotages are warm tho' some are quite neat</p>
	<p>Mrs D perhaps might <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del><pb n="8"/>
And if we went into colored families whether you could in justice discharge Miss T who now acts as Matron - and wheather, as the rent ran but the first of March we should be any way obligated for rent after that time, or at least after the time of going into colored families--and wheather it would be well for the cause--are questions which you can if you see fit consider  Mr T has been very kind to us and I do not want to do any thing on my own responsibility that would cause hard feelings either for your sake of his <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></p>
