<p class="p10">Feb 17<sup>th</sup> 54</p>
<p class="p10">Mt. Solon</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Howard--</p>
<p class="p10">By M<sup>r</sup>. Hotchkiss &amp; wife who expect to be in
                    Staunton, tomorrow, I drop a note to trouble you as <u>usual</u> with enquiries &amp;c--and it may be some matter of business in
                    a small way--Has J. D. I. got back--if so what was the fate of the Dora
                    rail-roading privilege bill in the House (the charter &amp;c I see passed)?
                    If the former passed--was it, <u>as from the Senate</u>? How
                    are the prospects of the Cent. &amp; Cov. &amp; Ohio--&amp;
                    especially what of the chances for <u>ejecting Crozet</u>?
                    Pray do not become frightened at the extent of my queries-- </p>
<p class="p10">I return you the letters sent by me--I have rec<sup>d</sup> now <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>a letter of apology from D<u>
                        <sup>r</sup>
                    </u>. Converse of Phild<u>
                            <sup>a</sup>
                        </u> in regard to a mistake in insertion--the <i>[illeg.]</i> of
                        <i>[unclear: Lima]</i>, in the Observer--I do not exactly know hwat it is,
                    until I see the paper</p>
<p class="p10">My neighbor D. M Fall cannot last much longer--consumption doing its work
                    rapidly. Have had a house full of <u>young</u>
                    <u>friends</u> for a day or two, Coz. Nannie Reid, Sallie &amp; Bettie Crawford, Mollie Eubanks, Robt
                    Poagers, D. N. &amp; B. Van Lear, B. Estill &amp;c--</p>
<p class="p10">M<sup>r</sup>. Hotchkiss has a small package that I have directed to
                        D<sup>r</sup> Harris, which <u>I wish you will
                        embrace an early &amp; safe transmission for to him, by some one going
                        to Richmond</u>--Can you not? It may be, I will send <u>two</u> packages--one quite small &amp; containing some "jewelry"--of
                    this am not entirely sure <u>now</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Write me, <u>if you can</u>. <u>I am quite
                        anxious</u> to hear the news from Richmond.</p>
<p class="p10">Call &amp; see M<sup>rs</sup>. H. <u>if you have
                        time</u>. Pease send me word for Eliza--if you have heard anything since I
                    left.</p>
<p class="p10">My love to Coz.
                    <i>[unclear: Sig.]</i> &amp; family--</p>
<p class="p10">Sincerely your relative</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. Marshall McCue</i></p>
<p class="p10">I enclose to you a note in the Cent.
                        Bank for $32. of a Orebough--to pay one in the Valley
                        Bank of $37. and my check on same to pay the bal. of $5. and the disc. for
                        116 days on the $32. Will you oblige the old man, thro' me, to attend to i--I have omitted
                        to fill the blank in the note of the payee--forgetting whether it ought to
                        be myself or E.W. Obaugh--will you insert the proper one--&amp; or the
                        drawer, with the right <u>initials</u>.</p>
