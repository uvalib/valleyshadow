<p class="p10">Wednesday August 31<sup>st</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">To have the honor of being a correspondent of yours, would be a privilege, which, I feel
     assured, would afford me a vast amount of enjoyment. But since our last meeting, (on the 25<sup>th</sup> last,) I have been led to believe that you then anticipated but little
     real enjoyment, or satisfaction, from a correspondence with us <u>being</u>
     so unworthy of being so highly honored For this reason I feel a considerable delicacy in
     writing, and indeed the thought of not writing at all, forced its
     self upon me, so powerfully, that for a time, that it had well nigh gained the day. If
     it be true that you cherish such thoughts [and it may be, that they are only too true] <i>[deleted: But]</i> I think it <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> nothing more, or less, than your duty, (and
     certainly no harm) to inform me of the fact. I censure no <i>[illeg.]</i> for speaking the
     truth, thought it be at my expense. It is only that we may fairly understand each other that I
     write to you now. I know that you are uncertain, as to whether I will write or not; but I think
     I hear you say you give yourself but little concern about it. Very well: that is all right speak it out boldly; and I assure you, we shall soon understand
     each other. It is far from being my desire to prolong a correspondence, which would be far from
     satisfying to you. And I hope you will pardon me, if <i>[added: I]</i> say
     it was to obtain definate information, in regard to this correspondence that caused me to make
     that very unappropriate demonstration, on the (ever-memorable)
     morning (to me) of the 25<sup>th</sup> of August. But let me ask you to pity me,
     when I confess that I was <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> met by a force, so irresistible that I was Gallently
     repulsed, and obliged to retreat somewhat in disorder, and doubtless, leaving behind the
     wounded; and without gaining the desired information period. But I sincerely hope that there
     were no wounded, at least, none that were more severely wounded than I was:
     <i>[unclear: just]</i> remember if I was wounded, it matters not: I censure no one but my-self for it. But please pardon me talking this nonsense. I know <i>[deleted: the]</i>if you are looking for a letter from me, you are not expecting it to be
     made up, of this sort of material. - Probably I am <i>[added: doing]</i>
     wrong by expressing my thoughts in this way - I am naturaly of a
     rebellious nature; and these may only be rebelious thoughts that
     have been forced upon me; and have no foundation: I hope that this is all. I cannot blame <i>[deleted: a]</i> persons for ceaseing to bestoow his affections upon any one whom <i>[deleted: they]</i>
     <i>[added: 
      <i>[deleted: he]</i>
     ]</i>
     <i>[added: they]</i> cannot like. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I <i>[illeg.]</i> no hard
     feelings towards you. <i>[unclear: But]</i> on the <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> they are <i>[unclear: warm]</i>, and <i>[unclear: gregarious]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">But, allow me, (in conclusion, on this subject,) to say that though this correspondence may
     cease to exist; yet our relations towards each other, as <u>true friends</u>
     shall never cease. It is not my intention to wound your feelings by and of these abesurd expressions; - to touch the tender cords of
     your generous heart, would be an experiment, which I have no particular fancy and which I dare
     not attempt. I am declared here as a patient only, in the hospital, and do not dislike it as
     much as I had expected though it is rather lonesome to me, as I am not acquainted about here. I
     spend my time in walking and sitting about the streets, when I have no reading, writing, or
     other duties to claim my attention. I <i>[unclear: intent]</i> to appear again before the
     board as soon as it meets in our <u>ward</u>, if I can get a recommendation
     from the <u>ward</u> surgeon.</p>
<p class="p10">I guess we have no news except what you will have heard before this reaches you. Rumor says
     that Early has had a fight, and whiped the yankeys badly, and captured - - - prisoner<i>[unclear: s]</i> four or five hundred,
     and they say he is now at Bushers hill twelve miles below Winchester Lee, (I am glad to hear)
     has captured two thousand prisoners, and nine pieces of artillery, but the yanks still hold the
     Weldon railroad.</p>
<p class="p10">I had the wholesome pleasure of listening to two sermons last sunday; - and of drinking in
     the ward, or of "feeding upon the sincere <i>[unclear: milds]</i> of the word", as preached
     from the pulpit, of the Episcopal Church. - Excellent sermons; but not to be compared with that
     delivered by Mr. Preston, at <u>Rocky Spring</u> If possible, I <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br>
     would be glad to hear from you soon. A letter from a friend is always welcome by me, and never
     rejected - - direct to the care of <u>Woods &amp; Gilkeson</u></p>
<p class="p10">yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Yates Ramsey</i></p>
<p class="p10">Sept. 1<sup>st</sup><br>P.S.
      As I did not get this sent off yesterday, I will add a line, to say that I did not succeed in
      getting another leave of absence, but have improved so fast, that they consider me fit for
      duty, and I will start for the command tomorrow morning. There are some wounded coming in from
      down the Valley; and among those who came in this morning, was Col.
      Wm. L. Jackson. He has a right bad wound - look pretty <i>[deleted: ]</i> It is reported that what few men are left of the 25<sup>th</sup>
      
       Rg
       have got permission to go to other commands, untill the
      prisoners shall be exchanged. But I think it herdly
      <p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p> probable that he would give them that privilege. In case it be true, I guess I
      will have to flank a horse and try and share some of the glorious reputation, attached to the
       47<sup>th</sup> battalion <br>
      <br> Should you think to confer upon me the honor, of receiving a letter from your hand
      please direct to Co. "D." 25 Va
      Inft.: Jones brigade Gordons Division; and to the care of Captn
      G. C. Merrill. <br>
      <br> And now, as I am again banished from the gayeties, and pleasures of home scenery, and
      the associations attached thereto; and called upon to behold more lively scenes, in the field
      of activity, and strife, there to receive my dues in the way of suffering; you will allow me
      to close this very <u>unwholesome</u> epistle, by sayin to you,<br>Farewell.<br>Yours R. R. Yates</p>
