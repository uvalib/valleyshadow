<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to Mary S.
                    Rowell, October 9, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Manly writes to Mary Rowell, informing her that she will be stationed as a
                    teacher in Staunton, a place she will find to her liking.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
                    Miss M. S. Rowell
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct. 9--</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Mr. <i>[unclear: Hovey]</i> returned last evening and handed me yours of the
                    7th. Staunton is entirely without any provision for schools, although they have
                    had flourishing schools there heretofore. They have a good school room and are
                    exceedingly anxious for a teacher. In accordance with instructions from Mr.
                    Kennedy to send you to some one of the many places that are without schools, I
                    have <i>[unclear: debated]</i> that as the very best of them all. It is a
                    delightful town, with society and religious privileges, and has a most excellent
                    Bureau officer - Mr. Thos P. Jackson who will be to
                    you all that you will desire in the way of sympathy and aid. The Association
                    will expect you to collect, in some form, from the people enough to pay your
                    board. Mr. Jackson will advise with you in that matter. You will report in
                    person to him and he will provide you a boarding place. You had better go there
                    on Saturday of this week if you can and send me an account of your expense for
                    travel, which will be but slight.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>R.M. Manly</i></p>
