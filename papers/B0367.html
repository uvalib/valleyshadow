<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">The within papers having been refered to me as President of the Board Overseers
                    of the Poor of Augusta County, by the County Court of Augusta at the August
                    Term, would report that the Overseer of the Poor of Augusta County have put up
                    additional buildings at the poor House of the County with a view of receiving
                    colored Paupers of the County and we are prepared to support all colored Paupers
                    belonging to the County, but would beg leave to call the attention of the Bureau
                    to the fact that there is a large number of Freedmen in our county who have come
                    in amongst us since the surrender who do not belong to the County and who we
                    could <i>[added: not]</i> be expected to support.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H. H. Peck, President of the Board of O.
                        Poor of A.Co.</i></p>
