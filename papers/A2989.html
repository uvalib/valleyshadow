<p class="p10">Sept 22nd /64</p>
<p class="p10">In line of Battle at Fishers Hill</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your highly appreciated letter of the
                    13th; by Abe the 20th. You can not imagine with what angsity I berused
                    ove its contents to find out how that absent one was
                    getting along. I hope this may still find your health improving &amp;
                    enjoying many blessings My health is very good &amp; hope it may contin so. On the 19th we had one of the hardest
                    Battles that was ever fought around Winchester or in the Valley of Va. And the
                    worst of all I hov to acknowlege we ware badly whiped. Many brave Southerners <i>[added: bit the
                        dust]</i>
                    thare in our noble cause. By the mercies of a great
                    &amp; good God I am still spared I cannot be to
                    thankfull for the many speccial providences that has protected me thus far. His loving kindness
                    has been very grate towards me &amp; my prayer is
                    that I may so walk as becometh one of his true followers. Our Comp came out <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>very well I think, only one
                    wounded, Wm Plunkett recieved a flesh wound in the thigh, &amp; was lost in Winchester He
                    was wounded just as we ware falling back into Winchester. Our defeat was I think
                    caused by our Army being scattered. Our Devision the
                    day before went to Martingsburg, drving the Yankee cavelry
                    from that plase. We fell back the same day to Bunkers
                    Hill, twelve miles below Winchester &amp; Roads
                    Division was camped some ten miles below Winchest
                    &amp; before we could get to Winchester the other portion of the Army was
                    nearly whipt &amp; at the same time thay
                    ware trying to cut us of from Winchester. But we arrived
                        thare in time to meet the heaveist onset of the Battle, &amp; succeeded in driving the
                    enemy near a mile when evry thing lay quiet except
                    skirmishing untill the middle of the eavning. When the enimies
                    cavelry drove our Cav. back <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>then making
                    three or four desperate charges on the left flank of our lines driving them back
                    in confusion which soon demorolised the hole army. We have to morn the
                    loss of many brave men and officers. Maj. Gen. Roads
                    was killed early in the engagment one among the
                    best officers in our army Colonel Funk was mortally wounded through the bowels
                    &amp; left at his home in Winchester I hope he may recover but it is doubtfull. Maj. Newton was wounded in the ankle bone
                    broken is on his way home. He acted very bravely in trying to rally the men. All
                    say he convered him self with glory. Capt J Bumgarner
                    was killed also Lieut J. B. McGuffin My Cous, R. Brand was badly wounded one
                    thigh broken the other a flesh wound had to leave him on the field his comp told
                    me he beged them to take him of
                    the field, but the enimy was so close that they could
                    not. All that tried to get off ware wounded &amp;
                    killed but one <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>poor fellow I pittie him
                    &amp; hope he may be kindly cared for, Cous &amp; Koiner came out safe.
                    We are now lying in line of Battle at Fishers Hill. Both canon and musketry are loudly booming on our front. The enimy are trying to drive in our skirmishers. We may be
                    closely engaged before two hours. We are strongly fortified &amp; have a
                    commanding position I think by the blessing of God, we may be able to give them
                    a sound thrashing I am fearful they may advance up the Page Valley &amp;
                    cause us to fall back as we have only a small cavelry
                    force commanding it I hope you will not take the capture of Jake to much to heart I cant help but think he
                    is not in as much danger as if he was hear. I hear the
                    roar of canon now in the Page Valley. I was sorry that
                    your cous, had a relaps of the fever hope she may
                    soon recover her former health uxcuse me if I failed
                    to answer anything in your letter I have not taken time to look over it May the
                    blessing of a great &amp; good God be with you the news from yours as ever</p>
<p class="p10">Good bye</p>
