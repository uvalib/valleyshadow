<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, October 3, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson asks for information about Estaline Doke, the daughter of a man living in
                    Augusta County, from whence she was sold in 1862. Jackson believes she may be in
                    Richmond, but the results of an inquiry there did not turn up anything.</p>

<p class="p10">I have the honor to request that enquiry be made at Richmond for Estaline Doke
                        (col'd) aged about 14 years daughter of Abraham
                    Doke who lives at Naked Creek, Augusta Co. Estaline
                    was sold to Richmond in 1862 by James E. Carson, a slave trader. Her father
                    (Abraham) has heard indirectly she is still in Richmond and he is anxious to
                    find her and have her come to his home where he can take good care of her.
                    Perhaps enquiry through the schools may lead to her discovery.</p>
