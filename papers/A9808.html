<p class="p10">June 21/67</p>
<p class="p10">Philad<sup>a</sup>.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I regret to say that on my return home I find that the Ledger of P Brady
                    &amp; Co. Bankers has been taken from my Office, by some interested person,
                    I can only suspect DCEB, As he is the
                    only party who could wish to have it out of the way.</p>
<p class="p10">I left it in a large trunk with at least thirty other books, and that is the only
                    one that has been taken. The Cash Book was left with the others <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>My
                    office is in a large building with many others under the care of a Janitor whose
                    business it is to open the same in the morning, to dust &amp; clean it. I
                    suspect him and have placed the Matter in the hands of the detective of Police.
                    I hope to find some Clue to taking of the Book.</p>
<p class="p10">I beg you will take great care of the papers in Your hands particularly the deed
                    &amp; the <i>[unclear: ajc]</i> in pencil taken from the Ledger, which I
                    can prove by the Gent<sup>n</sup>. who
                    took the Same, any thing from Mr. Davidson since I left <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>What is your
                    opinion of the abduction of the Ledger and what this would to Me with the Court
                    in case I Cannot produce it. Waiting your favor.</p>
<p class="p10">I Sir am<br>Respectfully Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>P Brady</i></p>
