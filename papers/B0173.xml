                    <salute>Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>In response to your note of July 2<hi rend="super">d</hi> I beg leave
                    respectfully to say, I am the preacher in charge of the Methodist congregation
                    now in the use and occupancy of the church edifice to which you refer. The same
                    congregation who built the church and who for more than fifty years have
                    worshipped in it and other churches which in that time have stood upon the same
                    spot.</p>

                <p>The title of church property is by the law of Virginia held by trustees for the
                    benefit and use of the local Religious congregation. The building has for many
                    years been held by such trustees approved by the current court of Augusta <pb
                        n="2"/>County under the law of the state. It is with the consent and by the
                    authority of these trustees that our congregation hold and uses the property.</p>

                <p>There are three congregations of Methodists in Staunton, one composed entirely of
                    White persons, the other two exclusively of <orig reg="colored">collored</orig>
                    persons. As each of these congregations has its own separate place of worship, I
                    am unable to understand how the use and occupancy of our church edifice has
                    become the subject of discussion &amp; inquiry by those you represent.</p>

                <p>As I have stated we are and always have been in the peaceful possession of this
                    property, and if any complaints or <unclear>---cutations</unclear> has been made
                    in denegration of our right to such <pb n="3"/>possession, I submit very
                    respectfully that it is proper that we shall be informed of its source and its
                    character. So that we may be enabled to meet it promptly and distinctly. As soon
                    as I have the points to which I am expected to respond I will take pleasure in
                    laying before you such information as will enable you to make a just and and proper disposition of the whole subject of your inquiry.</p>
