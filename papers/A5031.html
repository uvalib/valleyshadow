                    Mr. John B. McGuffin, Harper's Ferry, Va.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Apr 22 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Massies hill</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter was received about a week ago &amp; had I not feared you really
                    had gone to "Harpers Ferry" a place I never intended you to go until I went with
                    you. John be careful of your moustache, <u>goatee</u>
                    imperial &amp; whiskers if you do go. I could not bear for you to write me
                    that one of old Abe's men had deprived you <u>of a part</u>
                    of them.</p>
<p class="p10">Putting all jesting aside John, I fear you will have to go. How much I dread it.
                    I entertain the hope that we will only have a <u>brush</u>
                    &amp; all will be restored to peace &amp; harmony again. What a state of
                    affairs! Our quiet Union the envy of the old countries roken in pieces - First
                        <u>one</u> corner &amp; then another, scale by scale.
                    Not by one unanimous &amp; universal crack, as if done by <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> men
                    blindfolded, but inch by inch here a little &amp; there a little with their
                    eyes open to its awful effect. I am not a great hand on "politics" but <i>[deleted: ]</i> my "war" calls forth my every sentiment &amp;
                        <i>[unclear: exerts]</i> my every nerve. My <u>beau</u>
                    (Mr. Hill) was to see me on yesterday &amp; asked me what I thought of <u>him</u> going. I told him I would be sorry to see <u>any</u> of them going &amp; particularly him, yet if
                    he was needed in defense of his country, to go certainly, that if I was a "wife"
                    I should say so, &amp; would upon no account <u>of
                    mine</u> have him stay. He gently laid his arm around me &amp; did what a
                    certain cousin of mine did, by the name of Berrie, when on his buggy the Sunday
                    before I left home for Nelson, &amp; said <u>that</u> you
                    have the right spirit, &amp; I love you. Right broad assertion I think,
                    don't you. He told me to tell you that if you ventured a challenge <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    you had better be cautious or you might get "suck in." Never mind, John I'll be
                    your "second" &amp; then he will be afraid to hurt you. I thank you much
                    kindly for your papers, I feel like I am again in old Augusta when reading them.</p>
<p class="p10">Do not disappoint me in coming over this summer for many of the girls are anxious
                    to see you &amp; I am as anxious to exhibit you.</p>
<p class="p10">I'll kiss you for the "bouquet" of flowers when we meet. You are a good boy. How
                    I envy <u>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </u> her chance in receiving an offer from you. I think your conversation with
                    her on cousins marrying was right severe. I'll pay you when I see you for what
                    you said about <u>me</u> "crushing" your prospects. You scamp
                    you.</p>
<p class="p10">I was a anxious to hear whose houses were burnt on Mt. Solon &amp; could not
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> you told me.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">My school is very good. I have made $40 clear since I saw you. I do not know how
                    much longer I will teach after July, perhaps until Oct. Can't tell until after
                    the "war." John I am so much obliged to you for attending to my "note" for me.
                    Hope to be able to remunerate some day. We expect to have a pic-nic some time
                    this summer. Will you come over - John write soon if your letter is necessarily
                    brief so I can hear where you are. The rains have played havoc with us on this
                    side of the mountain too. The river is <u>very</u> full I
                    came near being drowned once. The horse got swamped &amp; I had to wade out.
                    Came near "going with the tide." Lignora the lady with whom I board sends her
                    love to you &amp; says she believes that you &amp; I are courting, if
                    not engaged. Write soon to your cousin.</p>

<p class="p10">Julia is always fretting &amp; talking about John
                        says if only she could see him sends her love to you.<br><br>dont forget
                        to write.</p>
