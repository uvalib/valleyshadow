                    at Staunton I dont know but One Cigar Maker that is now Out of work in town
                    Except the Ones you named you did not <i>[unclear: name]</i> and that is Charly
                    March who is a good workman and I suppose will come up if you
                    <i>[unclear: want]</i> him.</p>
<p class="p10">I Could not come to Staunton unless you could give me the assurance I could do
                    well. If John would give us the store and rent us the Room and Sell us the Stock
                    on time I would then be willing to come and devote my whole time to the interest
                    of the business, but it would not do for me to leave a Situation for an
                    uncertain one. I Want to try and go to Martinsburg if I can raise the means<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>as I am certain a man could do well there by strick attention to business, but if John will let us have the Store
                    in Staunton I would come <i>[illeg.]</i> You talk to him and get his views on
                    the Subject. Suppose we give him Half the profits of the concern-- we to attend
                    to all the business. You do that and write to me as Soon as You do it and let me
                    know what he Says.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Elva &amp; Mary Lizzie I would be glad to hear from them and will Prize
                    the Photographs Highly I will look for them next week. Write Soon Love to all
                    all are well. business is good Our town is lively</p>
