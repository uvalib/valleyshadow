<p class="p10">July 16<sup>th</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester<a href="#n1">[1]</a></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Ma</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday I wrote <br>
to Charles<a href="#n2">[2]</a>
telling him of 
Williams<a href="#n3">[3]</a><br>
sickness and promised to write again
to day or to
morrow. I dont think<br>
 he is yet any better. He didnt rest well,
<i>[added: Last night]</i><br>
not sleeping much, though not so<br>
restless as he has been.<br>
His mind still wanders some but<br>
not so much <i>[added: as]</i> it <i>[deleted: has been done]</i> did<br>
yesterday and <i>[added: the]</i> day
before<br>
The Dr. says he has an
affection<br>
of the spine and through that<br>
affects his brain. He just now<br>
advised me to try and get a private<br>
house to move him to, and promised to go<br>
with me to find one. I think it<br>
will be a great deal better to move <i>[added: him]</i><br>
if I can.  He is here in a room with 5 or<br>

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Bro1g16w.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro1g16w.gif"></center></a><br><br>

six others Making it too much<br>
crowded and too much noise <i>[added: and]</i> with<br>
their bad breath.  He was at first<br>
so restless tossing from side to side<br>
and getting up, that I could scarcely<br>
keep him in bed at all. He now lies quietly<br>
but doesnt sleep very much, has<br>
considerable fever, but does not com<br>
plain of any pain. The Dr. has put
a<br>
blister between his shoulders this morning.<br>
All the medicine, he has given,<br>
is spirits of turpentine and dovers<br>
powders mixed with quinine and<br>
calomel.<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
I stay with him all the<br>
time, and will, until he can be out<br>
The boys, of our company, are very kind<br>
in assisting me.
</p>
<p class="p10">
Wm Wilson
<a href="#n5">[5]</a> is this
morning<br>
a good deal better. His eyes were so<br>
swollen for a day or two, that he could<br> not see at all.
</p>
<p class="p10">
Ther are a great many sick here.<br>

<p class="p10">
A few regiments of the enemy were<br>
advancing this way yesterday, causing<br>
us to anticipate a battle here last night<br>
or to day, but this morning it is suppos <br>
osed there will be no fight for some days.
<a href="#n6">[6]</a><br>
I havent time to write any more this<br>
morning.  I will write in a day or<br>
two again.

As ever your son,</p>

After I had mailed this letter 
Dr.<br> Houston came in and told me,
he<br>
thought Wm would
likely not<br> get well.  He is extremely ill.

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> It was at Winchester in June of 1861 that the Liberty
Hall Volunteers were incorporated into the Army of the Shenandoah as
Company I of the 4th Virginia Infantry regiment, commanded by Colonel Thomas J.
Jackson. The army drilled for several weeks at Camp Stephens near
Martinsburg until General Patterson's Federal army crossed the Potomac.
When Patterson occupied Martinsburg, the Army of the Shenandoah fell
back to Winchester on July 7th. They remained in Winchester until the
18th, when they were instructed to move towards Manassas Junction to aid
General Beauregard in his engagement with the Federals (Bean, 31-37).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> Charles Brooks (1839-1920) enlisted in the 4th
Virginia Infantry, Co.  I on July 7, 1861. He was perhaps en route to
join the company in Winchester (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia
Infantry</i>, 41).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> William Brooks (1838-1861) enlisted in the 4th
Virginia Infantry, Co.
I with Andrew in June of 1861 (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia
Infantry</i>, 41). He became quite ill sometime in early
July of that same year. In a letter to James Brooks also dated July 16,
1861, Captain White reports that William passed away due to "congestion
of the brain." See White's letter to James Brooks, July 16, 1861. </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> Quinine, an antiperiodic drug, was often dissolved in
whiskey and used against malaria. Calomel is a mercury compound.
(Freemon, 8-9).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> William Wilson (1843-?) enlisted in Co. I on June 2,
1861. He was also a student at Washington College.  Captured at
Kernstown on March 23, 1862 (as was Andrew Brooks), he was exchanged on
Aug 5, 1862. Wilson was reported as a deserter on Nov. 27, 1862
(Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 41).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">[6]</a> The troops stationed at Winchester were impatiently
waiting for Patterson to advance (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia
Infantry</i>, 33); however, on July 18,
they received orders to evacuate Winchester and travel eastward through
the Blue Ridge Mountains towards Manassas to serve as reinforcements in
the defense of the Railroad Junction. On July 21, the First Battle of
Manassas was fought. The 4th VA was pivotal in the counterattack which
carried the battle, yet sustained the highest losses of any of the
regiments in the brigade: 31 dead and 100 wounded. Besides its role as
an important victory for the Confederates, the First Manassas gave birth
to two Confederate legends: the "Rebel Yell," and Jackson's
nickname&#8212;credited to South Carolina General Barnard Bee who, upon
perceiving Jackson's brigade behind him, shouted to his troops, "Look,
men! There stands Jackson like a stone wall! Rally behind the
Virginians!" (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 5-7).</p>
