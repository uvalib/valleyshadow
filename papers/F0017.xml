                </opener>

                <p>The mail has yet again cheated me of a fondly looked for pleasure. No letter from
                    home this week so I have no letter to answer and if yours will not come to
                    gladden me the mail <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> cheat me of pleasure in
                    writing home to you. I indulge myself in the hope that you are all well still.
                    &amp; I can assure you that my health is as good as common. We have no
                    particular news here. We are all <orig reg="quiet">quite</orig>. Some of the
                    companies are out every day on picket but our headquarters is still in the
                    pinewoods. We have twenty two in the hospital now none of them very bad those
                    who were sick are getting better and on a <orig reg="sun shining"
                    >sunshing</orig> day they all get out &amp; enjoy themselves stretching
                    around with their canes. Today is wet &amp; they are all housed in.
                    Yesterday our regiment made about 2 miles to be inspected by General Stoneman
                    who is our commander now. I do not think there will be much fighting here, they
                    are moving some of the troops away to North Carolina., to come at the rebels
                    some other way as they are too well fortified to be attacked here successfully.
                    The paymaster has not come yet but if we are patient he will come along after a
                    while to gladden our eyes with the greenbacks. You spoke in one of your letters
                    about leaving Good Intent. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> wish you to go for
                    some time yet as you have good friends there better than new ones would be who
                    you knew nothing of &amp; then there must be something standing on the books
                    yet that will keep you awhile which if you move away will be lost I would like
                    it for you to stay there a while longer. I will only be paid up to the first of
                    January &amp; will have about 50 dollars which I will send to you as soon as
                    the paymaster comes. Alex Gunn is here yet &amp; will not go home till the
                    boys get their money so I will send mine home by him. I intend also to send you
                    a pencil sketch of the hospital. I have just got a loaf of bread baked for the
                    hospital I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> tell you what it will taste like but
                    expect it is good. Does Lucy go to yet or try to learn any. I hope my little
                    daughter will try to learn. It would please me so much. Josey is a very good boy
                    to his ma I know &amp; if his life is spared I hope to see him in some
                    honorable of life performing his duties like a good man as he is now a good boy.
                    &amp; yet Lucy is a good kind loving daughter &amp; sister. but I would
                    like to see her something more I would like it if she was like Josey in wanting
                    to learn. so that she too would be able to fill an honorable station in life a
                    servant of the Most High &amp; a comfort to her parents my little talking
                    Bell what does she say Pa would be so glad to her talking to him &amp; her
                    would tell her some stories about the war if she was on his knee &amp; Josey
                    &amp; Lucy could hear them too. Bell kiss Jimmy Sloan for Pa. Mr. &amp;
                    Miller have built a chimney in our tent &amp; have a fine place to look into
                    the dark nights. When Pa looks into it he thinks of Ma sitting beside him
                    &amp; the children must be in bed it is so quiet. looks around to see
                    &amp; medicine boxes meet his eye instead of little children in their happy
                    sleep in trundle bed. If his &amp; their life is spared he will see that
                    little group yet. &amp; have the warm breathing loved Ma at his side instead
                    of the cold ideal. We have had our supper &amp; a <orig reg="piece"
                    >peice</orig> of the loaf it is very good. Old fashioned salt raised bread. The
                    boys in the hospital were very much pleased with it.</p>

                <p>Janey<lb/>Are you enjoying yourself in your stay. Well I expect you are as there
                    are some company in the neighborhood. I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know what
                    amusement they have there now, but amusements are not all, fit yourself for
                    unselfishness &amp; you will enjoy pleasure in the proper performance of
                    duty in what ever station you may be placed whether you will have a family of
                    your own or stay with our parents. Well as I wrote to Cynthia so will I stay
                    with you. We have no news worth relating We are in the Pines no other soldiers
                    in sight as the woods are on all sides of our camp. One day is like another to
                    us so that some times the Sabbath is almost unnoticed as a day of Sacred rest</p>

                <p>Dear Wife<lb/>In sending your letter put no little thing to make some thievish
                    postoffice clerk think there is money in it for it will not come to hand
                    &amp; I will not have the pleasure I prize the most that is the reading of
                    the letter from home.</p>
