 </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I take this oppertunity to write you   
 <br>  
   
 a few to let you no that I  
 am well and get <br>  
 along well their is not   
 sine of a move at <br>  
 this time the  
 weather here has been fine.  <br>  
 yesterday   
 their was some rain but   
 did  
   
   
 last long.    
 <br>  
 I received John letter a few Days ago   
 I though  
 <br>  
  I was  
 not  
 going to get any word from home   
 <br>  
 and was much peased to   
 here and  
 was<br>  
 much obliged to John for <i>[deleted: for]</i> the stamp and   
 <br>  
 sheat of paper I  
  cant neathe

 <br>

 stand them prices well   
 <br>  
 their was some talk a few days ago of our  
 <br>  
 being  
 sent back to Washington   
   
 but I think   
   
 <br>  
 their is nothing of   
 it if whe are  
 moved  it will <br>  
 be towards the river   
 it takes a good Deal   
 <br>  
 of figering to live here as the  
 feed is hard   
 <br>  
 to eat but by taking cair  
  in the cooking   
 <br>  
 whe still make it go down.  
 <br>  
 If I had som

 of the apples that are at home I would have   
 <br>  
 some fine  
 dishes of saws and apple   
 fliters I   
 <br>  
 have been very hungry since I have been here  
 <br>  
 by time but I think I will be able to   
 see it  
 <br>  
  through   
 as their is but about 3 &amp; 1/2 months   
 <br>  
 <i>[unclear:  illeg.]</i> has just been here and say I   
 <br>  
 shall tell you he is will but <i>[unclear:  times are   
 tuff]</i>  
   
 <br>  
 and sends his respects to all is  
   
  a good thing   
 <br>  
 the health of the  
 company is    
 good thare have   
 <br>  
 been <i>[unclear: some]</i> of thoes  
 sent to the hospital  
 <br>  
 that have been sent on <i>[unclear: here are going at]</i>  
   
 <br>  
 convalesant camp at   
 Alaxandria. I hope  
   
 <br>  
 they will stay their  
 as the hardships is hard   
 <br>  
   
   
 to get through and their is   
 more in the company   
 <br> <i>[unclear: that wants to go home]</i>.  
 <br>  
   
  I suppose you have been  
 enjoying yoursalf fine  
 <br>

 tents which are some protection but the<br> weather has been   
 fine I think I  
 never <br>  
 saw such good weather this time a  
  year<br> Their was some talk  
 that  
 in camp that this Brigade   
 <br>  
 would be sent back but their has   
 <br>  
 been nothing said the last few days so I dont think

 their is much in   
 it I <i>[unclear: wish]</i>  
 whe would go back  
 <br>  
 a piece for their would be some chance  
 <br>  
 to By something to   
 eat their is no chance  
 to get  
 <br>  
 any thing here neathe   
 paper nor postage stamps  
 <br>  
 as you will see this is ritten on an old piece  
 <br>  
 of copy book that was picked up <i>[unclear: [illeg.] main]</i>  
 <br>  
 and if I have to maile this and leave you the   
 <br>  
 postage to pay you must excuse me   
 or else   
 <br>  
 I <i>[unclear: [illeg.]]</i>  
 <i>[unclear: change our position]</i>   
 Their  
 <br>  
 is several that I would like to write to if I had  
 <br>  
 the paper their   
 is no sutlers supplies alowed  
 <br>  
 to be shiped   
 as the armies is so large that it require  
 <br>  
 all the transportation the government can raise to  
 <br>  
 bring up supplys their  
  is no much chance for  
 <br>  
 a forward move from here as the Rebels seam to  
 <br>  
 bee very well   
 Situated on the other side of the
