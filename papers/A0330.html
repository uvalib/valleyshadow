<p class="p10">April 10, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Shenendoah, Augusta County, VA </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">I received you letter on the 10th and was glad to hear from you. We have fallen
                    back to Shenandoah Mountain where we expect to stay a while. We left Camp
                    Allegheny on the 2nd April. Marched to Monterey 17 mi. where we had good
                    quarters in houses. Took up our line of March next morning. Marched to MC Dowels
                    the distance of ten miles. arrived about 12 o clock took dinner and struck our
                    tents. stayed there one day and a half. Saturday the 5th left MC Dowel. Marched
                    to Shenandoah Mountain on this side th mountain in old Augusta where we expect
                    to stay a while. our whole Brigade is camped here. Colonel Goods regiment from
                    Huntersville and Colonel Scotts regiment from Fork watters are here. we have 12
                    pieces of canon on top of the Mountain. Just waiting for the Yankees. Captain
                    Millers Andersons and Rices. I expect we will fortify here. it was a good many
                    men detailed out of our regiment to day to go on top the Mountain to work at
                    what I do not know yet as they have not returned yet. It has been very
                    disagreeable here for a few days. on Monday last it commenced snowing and it has
                    been snowing and sleeting ever since till to day. the sun shines occasionally.
                    the snow was about four inches deep here. it dont go quite so well after coming
                    out of good cabins. I was on picket last Monday the first time in Augusta. it
                    was very disagreeable standing in the snow. we mist our shanties very much. two
                    of our men was sent to the hospital at Augusta springs to day Christian Switzer
                    and Patrick Loyd. Switzer took sick since we come here. it is thought that he
                    has the Pneumonia. Loyd has been complaining for some time head ache and sore
                    throat cold. We had favorable weather during our march and the roads were much
                    better then I expected. we also had our knapsacks hauled which enabled us to get
                    along pretty well. I suppose that if the Yankees should get too hard for you
                    fellows down the valley that we will fall back to Staunton or some place else. I
                    expect to get a furlough after while. they have given one man out of each
                    company a furlough except one and two goes out of that one. the married men are
                    to go first. Corporal Wm H Fry got a furlough and started this morning for home.
                    as soon as he comes back some one else will go. six days is Fry's limited time.
                    I suppose after he comes back one will go out of each Company every day or two.
                    it is said that the Yankees have taken possession of camp Allegheny since we
                    left and that it was about 400 at Monterey. the Churchville Cavalry Rockbridge
                    Cavalry and Pennsylvanian Cavalry Scout between here and Monterey. We heard a
                    great many news about the fight down the valley and that the 5 Va regiment was
                    cut all to pieces. I suppose it fared the worst as it covered the retreat. the
                    last news we got here of the fight is supposed to be correct that there were
                    about five hundred of our men killed wounded and missing and about fifteen
                    hundred yanks killed wounded and missing. if that be so it was still a dear
                    bought battle to them. it is said not to be many Yankees on cheat Mountain now
                    that they are working around to other points. our boys are in good spirits and
                    are ready to meet the foe any where and believe we can whip them out. I comply
                    with your request in the last written side of your letter. I will do all I can.
                    it will suit me better that way then any other. I am well and hope these few
                    lines may find you and all the balance enjoying good health. I want you to write
                    as often as you can especially when you return to the army and let me know how
                    you are getting along and I will do the same. dont forget to give me your
                    address. excuse this badly written letter. so I will close. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours Respectfully </p>
