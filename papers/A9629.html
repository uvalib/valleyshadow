                    long we will remain in harpers
                    ferry. Now I dont care for it
                    is a very dull plase. The ladies look so sour that I
                    never speak to any of them. Thare are no beauties in
                    the burg. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> On our way to the burg the Ladies of evry
                    villige cheered us onward by thare smiles &amp; waves. Miss Fannie Lincoln presented our company
                    with a secession Flag. I seen her put did not no her as we pushed on so past in our press waggons we had to travel all day last Sunday which
                    seemed very hard in old Jackson. I almost fell in love with a girl the way I
                    happened to get acquainted with her was I had proke
                    one of my straps that held my scabbard &amp; I just went &amp; asked her
                    to sow it for me if she pleased. She very kindly said she
                    would &amp; before the lady had finished it <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>a dozen of my fellow
                        solders had joined around me, the Ladies all
                    along the road seemed so pleasant that it it cheered us onward thare
                    hankerchiefs
                    ware continually waveing
                    &amp; we generally gave them three loud cheers. Thare are so many rumers afloat that I can not
                    say what we may hafter do. John is very well and
                        seemd to enjoy him self very well. I hope that if
                    it is Gods will that we may all arrive safely at home ere long.</p>
